","In all fairness, director Fede Alvarez has come through successfully on remaking this 81 cult horror, that sees a group of young campers, possessed by evil spirits from that notorious book that should never been opened. With another attractive cast, who deliver realistic performances, especially the heroin addict sister, the film too is beautifully shot in the cold misty woods of New Zealand, and this works wonderfully, cinematically, I might add. This was the biggest thing, I must say, that really impressed me. I must admit I was disappointed at one aspect, as I thought it would be full on throughout, much like Evil Dead 2, (my oldie favourite) where everything just goes crazy and you can't think straight, but there's enough blood shed in this to satisfy you gore lovers. The highlight is the girlfriend cutting off her own arm with a chainsaw scene, with the boyfriend (Fernandez) asking ""Are you okay?"" There are some nice touches of humour here I liked that worked better here, than the original, and the slipping on the tongue scene was inventive. What was good was the catalyst of the story, the reason for them all being there in the woods, as to comfort the young heroin addict girl, one, her brother who's managed to show up here, hot girlfriend and all. Shiloh Fernandez's character irked me some, while not even managing to make his mother's funeral, months prior. How he become the hero near the end, and braved up, I liked. Though of course with not the greatest script that I've actually read part of, here's a well shot remaking of a notorious horror, that of course, can't surpass the original, but comes pretty close. But in this present, it's a guilty pleasure on another chain, it's chilling opening, brilliant, not letting us forget how frightening and evil the original is. And like this remake, among others, these are what mostly opt for. Great end credit sequence, with an afterword from Bruce Campbell."
"Sleepin_Dragon","7","46","57","2 August 2018"," I wasn't expecting much, rather surprised.
","We seem to be in a time where the remakes of remakes will be remade, even films like Cabin Fever aren't remaining sacred, the obligatory remake follows.<br/><br/>Evil Dead now is a remake with a bit of bite, of course it has every possible cliche under the sun ticked off. We have the obligatory character coming out of the ground with long stringy hair, we have the trapdoor, the book of death, and of course the vomiting. Despite all the blatant lack of any sort of imagination Evil Dead somehow manages to capture the imagination, and provide ninety minutes of quite thrilling entertainment.<br/><br/>The scares are plentiful, and the acting is such that you believe in the pain, physical and mental, it really is quite well made. Effective use of special effects and music.<br/><br/>Not a film I'd look to watch on a regular basis, but it's somehow rather refreshing. 7/10<br/><br/>Please enough with the remakes though."

","Evil Dead is a remake of the 1981 original ""the Evil Dead"". I didn't have the chance to watch the original yet, so I'm going to review this without comparing it with the original.<br/><br/>The movie actually starts out pretty slow, for the first 40 minutes there isn't any creepy parts and it actually bores me. Usually, movies start off slow to develop they're characters or stories, however, I find the first 30 minutes unnecessary. However, Evil Dead deserves its wait. Evil Dead has some of the goriest and most disturbing scenes I've seen in movies. There's blood EVERYWHERE and the movie make them look real good! The movie mostly uses makeups and proves that a bloody movie can stand by its own without CGI. <br/><br/>Another thing I like about Evil Dead is the directing. There are many beautifully-shot scenes which makes the movie very enjoyable. For example, the director sets the cameras in different angles, such as the floor or close to the wall, which makes it extraordinary from other films.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Evil Dead lacks character developments, but for its own sake, bloody horror doesn't really need character developments. Characters make stupid decisions and eventually will die out one by one, so it's not really a big deal. <br/><br/>There isn't really a plot or twists in Evil Dead. Everything is presented directly. If you haven't watch this without watching the trailers, the movie is what you thought it will be. <br/><br/>Evil Dead is enjoyable for a movie night if you do not care too much on the details. Just sit back and enjoy the gore, it's real fun."

","So I've read here and there that this remake lacks the camp of the original. And I look back over 20 years ago, watching The Evil Dead on a crummy rental VHS, in the dark of my teenage bedroom one night. The camp? The original Evil Dead was a terrifying experience, even with Bruce Campbell's over the top performance, the film was a scare-fest, a terrifying trip even nearly ten years after its release. The camp was in Evil Dead 2, an horror comedy remaking the original already, technically. <br/><br/>This remake finds many way to bow to the original, aside the obligatory visual quotes. The use of practical effects, notably, in an era of CGI- filled movies, is extremely refreshing. The gore feels painful, makes you cringe, churned my stomach. It successfully palliates a somewhat shallow characterization that makes it difficult to root for the characters (with the exception of Mia, who owes a lot to a really visceral performance by Jane Levy.)<br/><br/>And this is where Evil Dead 2013 took me by surprise. After roughly a first half of the movie taking Evil Dead fans by the hand towards hashed and rehashed territories, making them doubt that this was a good idea at all, the movie lets go of your hand and you're alone, in the middle of the woods, and it's dark and there's strange noises all about... and then limbs start flying. <br/><br/>I won't get into conjectures that the highly conventional and overly familiar first half was made that way with the sole purpose of placing the audience in their comfort zone, only to give more impact to the second half... but I would surely ask Fede Alvarez if I was to interview him. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2013 is a treat for the fans of gore and horror, in any case. Another reminder that out of ten awful remakes, sometimes one rises to the top and delivers. Not for the faint of heart, for sure, but if you're a true horror fan, and even more, if you miss your old school, gruesome gore rides, this one is for you."
"N-Weiss90","10","205","335","9 April 2013"," Excellent re-imagining of a classic
","I have to say I'm very surprised at all the negative reviews I've been reading. I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).<br/><br/>I think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet that if the original was released for the first time right now, it would have been shot down even more than this ""remake."" Although I love the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.<br/><br/>People are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.<br/><br/>This movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the way through."

","'EVIL DEAD': Five Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The first five star movie of 2013 is this long awaited reboot to writer/director Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic original 'THE EVIL DEAD'. It's a loose sequel that finds a new group of young adults stumbling across the 'book of the dead', from the original trilogy, in the same cabin that iconic hero Ash and his friends did in the original two films. Raimi and actor Bruce Campbell (who played Ash) have returned as producers of the film (along with their buddy Robert G. Tapert, who produced the original three films). Raimi picked Fede Alvarez to make his feature film debut directing and co-writing the film (along with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody). It stars Jane Levy (from TV's 'SUBURGATORY'), Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. Levy plays Mia and she's supposed to reprise the role for two more films, the last of which is supposed to link this new film series to the adventures of Ash and the original films (following a 'ARMY OF DARKNESS 2' movie). I grew up on these films and am extremely excited to see Raimi and Campbell picking the series up again and think they're off to a great start.<br/><br/>The story picks up 30 years after the original 'THE EVIL DEAD' film ended with a new group of kids going to the same cabin so Mia (Levy) can try to detox and get over her opiate addiction. Her friends Eric (Pucci), Olivia (Lucas), Natalie (Blackmore) and brother David (Fernandez) are there as well to help her get through it. They come across the 'book of the dead' (the Naturom Demonto) from the original films, in the cellar and Eric foolishly reads from it (despite several warnings not to). He of course awakens the dead and Mia is possessed. The others originally think she's just going through withdrawals but they soon find themselves being taken over and killed off one by one as they fight the deadites for their survival.<br/><br/>The film was made on a budget of just $17 million (which is a lot higher than the original film obviously but a pretty small budget by Hollywood standards). The filmmakers decided not to use CGI (except for touch ups) and filmed for 70 days. The results are definitely rewarding. The film really has that 'old school' classic slasher film feel to it and it's surprisingly loyal to the original films (in style). It's lacking the power of a performance like Bruce Campbell's but it is really funny and satirical (more so than the first film I think but not it's sequels). The violence and gore is out of control (It was first rated NC-17, like the original) and it really is a true hardcore horror film; it's truly exhilarating and relentless. I think the filmmakers did about as good a job as they possibly could rebooting this classic series and being a huge fan it's an enormous pleasure to watch. I have no real complaints; it's a masterpiece just like the original film and it's sequels!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn0mEP_zzoQ"

","I created an account just to review this movie. As a hardcore movie fan I felt as if the reviews of this movie where extremely underrated. This movie is intended for hardcore horror fans and is probably the most gruesome movie I've ever seen. Tops rob zombies movies even. If you watch a ton of horror and want to take it to the next level yet still have all the classic elements, watch this movie. It had all the elements to make it a great yet modern movie while having enough modern day elements to blow you away. I am a self-proclaimed horror fanatic and this movie is was able to keep me on the edge of my seat covering my face, I've never had that experience my entire life until this movie. See. This.

","Let be The Evil Dead (1981) be in my top 5 list of best horrors ever. So I was waiting until the evil came out to finally see another failing remake I thought. But have heard only positive things about the remake I had my doubts. At last, after a lot of stupid remakes this one kicks you straight in the face. In fact, it's based on the original one. Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi were involved in making this flick and Fede Alvarez (the director) did a great job for his first full feature.<br/><br/>Let me first of all say this. If you can't stand extreme gory horrors than stay away from this flick. It contains shock gore just for the gore. If you thought this was going to be a supernatural ride then forget it. This is really one for the gorehounds. <br/><br/>Does it look like the original Evil Dead. Of course not. Back then a few effects were done with stop motion. Here we luckily have the real effects and okay, here and there some CGI which I didn't mind at all. But to go back on the original. Yes, it do has the chainsaw, yes it do has the slapping door, yes it do has the evil faces from back then and yes we do have the woods attacking a girl, but not raping her like in the original. <br/><br/>Was it scary? It never was scary at one moment but still, you will watch it with your mouth open. From the opening sequence you are immediately into the Evil Dead ride. Why I do give kudos to the director is that he made the movie he wanted to make but to please the old school fans he added references to the original.<br/><br/>The acting of course had to be good too and luckily it was. But did they do jokes like in the original. Not really, that was left out here, admit it, we are 30 years later!<br/><br/>Finally, I'm happy to see that they didn't give a sh*t towards the ratings. They made Evil Dead as they wanted to make it, it's full of red stuff. Not done like the new horrors with digital animation. This is old school, this is great, for me a must see for the buffs walking this earth. Finally horror is back with some evil dead to show you....<br/><br/>Gore 4/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 4/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"
"gregoryginal","10","118","225","10 April 2013"," Im honestly baffled by all of the bad reviews
","(IDK if there are actually spoilers, but I want to be safe, lol) I am constantly seeing oh its not original, it's not scary, it's not this, it's not that. I saw evil dead when I was about 11, and have loved the trilogy in whole for as long as I can remember. These movies hold a special place in my heart. Hearing of the remake, I was terribly skeptical like everyone else was, but the movie pretty much lived up to everything I wanted to see in this movie, a REMAKE. I feel somehow just because Bruce wasn't in it, people already start to lose interest, I don't know why. I realize this is my opinion, but as someone who's a fanboy, or whatever its called, of this movie, I really want to know what people were wanting out of this movie, sure some stuff that I wanted to see weren't in it, A newer, incredibly grotesque Henrietta, with the original ""someones in my fruit cellar"", or a dancing headless corpse would have topped it off for me!! The acting I thought was pretty good, The story I felt went along with the originals, with a few tweaks here and there, but nothing to really change the flow of the movie, But why I gave this movie a perfect rating is the constant nods to the originals, even including original sound bytes from evil dead 2, and probably one or two others that I cannot think of. What also made this movie great for me is that while it was missing Gimme Some Sugar Baby Ash (You have to respect the mans reason for not being in this movie, even though I like to think he could've done it, keeping my fingers crossed for Army of Darkness 2) I found myself seeing Ash in all of the characters, besides Olivia, but maybe I didn't pick up on the nods she had to Ash if there were any. However, If I could complain about anything with the movie, it ended up making sense to me in the end (*Hint* Cleansing, Electric Shock) However I think of Evil Dead 2, Where Ash is a Deadite, then he is fine. It may not run along the same lines exactly, but I like to think that's what they thought when writing the movie. All in all, we must realize that the stage set for the production was on a whole other level, the original first evil dead was quite a low budget movie made in the early 80's, Evil Dead 2 seemed like it had a better budget to work with, I am guessing they had an even better budget for this movie than any of the others. It seems they at least tried to capture the feeling of the originals by sticking with on screen effects, rather than CGI. <br/><br/>If you want to go see a movie that is a creepy, gory, absolute blast of a time to see. I am going to go see it again because I did not stick around for after the credits. They knew us screwheads wanted this, and they delivered, with what I believe is a movie that has used the most fake blood to date, and to that, I say Groovy!"
"edduardoa","9","118","229","21 April 2013"," Amazing movie, a step ahead from modern movies of the genre
","I watched The Evil Dead many years ago, and I loved it and when it comes to remakes, I always try to watch them with an open mind, not ignoring its positive points just because I like the original better, after all, they are not going to cease to exist, but some people just can't do just that, and that seems to me as the biggest problem that people showed with Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead!!<br/><br/>Starting with an interesting, but not much relevant opening, Evil Dead show to the audience what to expect from the movie, right from the beginning. After the title, we are introduced to the five central characters. We see Mia suffering with the abstinence, David trying to do something to bound with his sister after leaving her with the dying mother, Eric being angry with David for the same reason as Mia, Olivia trying to do her best to make her friend go through hell and Natalie doesn't do sh*t.<br/><br/>All hell breaks loose when Eric reads the words wrote in the book that they found in the basement (a normal act drove by curiosity, not an dumb thing like many people point at) and the demon awakes in an amazing sequence, the camera rising from the woods and rapidly moving, changing from Mia walking in circles in the rain and Eric reading the words one by one, until the demon finale reaches the cabin.<br/><br/>When I first walked in the theater to watch Evil Dead, I expected a gore fest, limbs flying everywhere and some interesting death scenes, that's all. The film has all that but not just it, the tension is hold from beginning to end, and you really get nervous during the entire show, like in the famous Tree rape scene that this time isn't explicit like in the original and yet is much more shocking.<br/><br/>The acting is also great, Jane Levy as Mia (and here I should say how much I loved her) and Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric are amazing, Jessica Lucas is also very good, but she doesn't gets much screen time. Elizabeth Blackmore could be pointed as a bad actress but in reality, the script doesn't allow her to do much, that being said, she is the most useless character in the movie. Shiloh Fernandez is bland and didn't quite deliver the David that I hoped from the script.<br/><br/>In the technical department, Evil Dead shows the combination of all the good things in a movie, the score from Roque Baños is nothing less than brilliant, the make-up is astonishing and even if the Deadites may resemblance a little too much with Regan from ""The Exorcist"" they feel very organic. But the thing that surprised most about the film is the photography, the landscape in the beginning, the shots from outside the cabin, the blood rain, the contrast between the dark from the scenario and Jane Levy scarlet red dress looks absolutely beautiful.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is an amazing movie, it isn't the perfect one, but it doesn't want to be it. Pointed by many to have ""dumb script"" (like the horror movies in its most, or even the original The Evil Dead had a great one ¬¬) that actually diverges a lot from the genre. We see the family issue, the subtle correlation between the drugs and the demon possession for Mia, and the distance from clichés. A friendly advice, fans of the genre should stop smashing the movie just because of their love for the original, if you can do this, you may actually enjoy one of the most amazing horror movies released in quite some time.<br/><br/>And for the ones that say ""this is just a gore fest with no history whatsoever"" or like someone wrote in a review I read here ""this is Evil Dead for the Xbox generation"", just for the fact you don't like a movie, it doesn't mean this is the ""Worst movie of our Generation"", grow up!<br/><br/>Evil Dead is one of the most terrifying movie you will ever experience"
"robinson-w-walsh","3","210","426","5 April 2013"," Another throw-it-in-the-pile generic modern horror remake with no identity of its own
","There was a time that I gave horror remakes the benefit of the doubt. The Dawn of the Dead remake wasn't so bad for what it was. The Fright Night remake actually did a decent amount of justice for its source material. But then, you stop and realize how short Hollywood has come up in terms of original ideas and cool scares. Nowadays it seems to be a) remakes b) torture porn c) possession movies(these have got to go) d) more remakes. Heck, the last original and clever horror movie I saw was Cabin in the Woods, which was actually a horror themed comedy rather than a true horror film.<br/><br/>Sadly, the Evil Dead remake turned out to be just as disappointing and toothless as I expected it to be. No, this film does not improve on the original. No, it does not become a good horror film in its own right. Yes, you have seen pretty much everything in this film before. Yes, you're better off watching anything from the original trilogy.<br/><br/>I read an interview with director Fede Alvarez which had him say something along the lines of ""When I saw the 80's Fly, I didn't care about the original 50's version. That was the Fly to me"" OK Fede.....point taken. But the 80's Fly was directed by David Cronenberg, who at that point was already a seasoned director who had over 10 years of experience under his belt and who is known for innovative styles and concepts. Alvarez has none of that. As I understand it his background is mainly short films. Perhaps I should familiarize myself with his previous work, but let me just say he does nothing to make Evil Dead his own movie. All I saw were some nifty lighting choices and camera angles.<br/><br/>But then again, there's nothing about this Evil Dead that makes it it's own movie. You have impossibly hot actresses who still look hot even when they're shivering and drenched in gore. You have the same hyperactive MTV-style editing that any supernatural or slasher film these days has. You have poor attempts at making this a ""serious"" film. Seriously, the original was about rapist trees and crazed demons! How ""serious"" does it have to be? You have any number of tropes and clichés which make this an ultimately forgettable affair. And on top of that you have no actors or characters who grab the eye. Imagine that Ash's sister Linda was an irritating coke addict instead of a weird psychic girl. Then subtract Ash. There's your Evil Dead.<br/><br/>One thing that made the original have such charm is that it wasn't just a low budget film, it was practically a student film! I know....it's a big fanboy gripe, but I found myself longing for the original whilst sitting through this Bruce Campbell-less bore fest.<br/><br/>The hype machine and rent-a-critic tactics will likely make this a relative box office success. I hope it is a last gasp."

","Why why why why why did I get excited for this film? Why do I keep doing this to myself? A horror remake with modern gore effects and a fresh take on the best the eighties have to offer. It has to be a winner right? WRONG! This is the latest in a long line of horror remakes that just fails in almost every dept. Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Halloween. Elm street. Omen. Hills Have Eyes. I Spit On Your Grave. The Fog. Fight Night. Friday 13th. Amityville. I kid you not, i paid to see them all. Lined up for pre screenings or opening midnight showings. Always excited. Always disappointed afterwards. In many cases, I was more gutted than the slasher victims on screen. The only two remakes that were decent was The Thing prequel and The Crazies.<br/><br/>At least Evil Dead didn't skimp on the blood and guts. There was plenty. But it did not have an effect. Too much of something may as well be none at all for the impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe is it just wasn't scary. I was pumped when I saw the promo posters saying it was the scariest film ever. But it wasn't even the scariest film I have seen this week. The cast tried, but they were either too drab and lifeless when alive or overacting and too animated when dead. Happy medium reached NOT! All in all, they would have been better off leaving the original film as is, to show what a great low budget horror film should look like. now when teenagers hear of the horror film 'Evil Dead', they will think of this pile of trash instead of a verified classic."
"HudsonsSkull","2","276","573","12 April 2013"," At least 10 stupid things about this movie...
","There are definitely more but here is at least 10...<br/><br/>1- After the nurse says that they've done this before with Mia and they know she will do anything to get away, no one thinks to hide the vehicles keys in a safe place? Probably even left them in the ignition too because it looked as though she just jumped into the car and hightailed it out of there.<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>2- They have a crack addict with withdrawal symptoms and who's mother was mentally unstable roaming about in the cabin, but they leave a shotgun and shells they found in the cellar lying around?<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>3- They find a cellar with dead cats, an ominous book, blood all around and a shotgun with shells and they don't think to head back and notify the authorities that there might have been a possible crime that took place there? Thinking to themselves, ""That's o.k., we're here to help Mia so who cares if there might have been a murder in this cabin.""<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>4- The Evil needed 5 souls to manifest itself, but I only count three or four at the most. The girl at the beginning doesn't count because the Evil was put back in hell, if it wasn't, Eric wouldn't have needed to read a passage in the book to release it once more now would he? The dog was killed by Mia with the hammer, it was never possessed. And if it were possible to possess animals, then why not just possess a bunch of forest animals instead to get his 5 souls?<br/><br/>So that's three souls from the moment the evil was released by the incantation, Olivia, Natalie and Eric. Mia? No, her soul was returned to her body or she wouldn't have been alive at the end to fight the abomination. I'll be generous and give you David as well since he died in the cabin fire with the others, but this nonsense I'm reading about the Evil getting Mia's soul and then loosing it counting as a soul claimed, that's bull. In order to claim something you have to keep it. Finders keepers, losers weepers.<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>5- After the cabin door opens with wind gushing through the cabin, and Mia telling everyone (in a demonic type voice) that they are all going to die, the nurse and girlfriend going bat-sh!t crazy, his sister ending up in the cellar with demonic eyes and all the sh!t going on around him, David still comes up with ""Maybe she got infected by the dead cats and passed it on to the others, or better yet, maybe she's just crazy like our mom was in the asylum. I mean, come on, there's denial and then there's just plain stupidity.<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>6- David buries Mia, then pulls her out of the ground and she's miraculously healed? In the original, the deadites were never healed, they just gave the illusion of being ""OK"" to further torment Ash. And before any of you say ""We'll Ash was healed after he was turned into Evil Ash"" let me point out that this was in ED2 which was a fantasy mixed with humour type horror movie. Fans of this keep insisting this one is a more realistic approach like Raimi envisioned in the first place. Now you have a choice to make guys, you can't have it both ways. It's either a more realistic approach in which case Mia should still have cuts and burns on her body or it's a fantasy based horror where anything goes. Which is it?<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>7- Every time something bad was going to happen, wind would blow the pages of the book to an illustration depicting what was going to happen giving the audience a heads up. Great way to build suspense there Fede. Wow!<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>8- After Mia boils her skin in the shower, the ""nurse"", finally gives in and says ""Her burns are too severe we have to get her to a hospital."" So, David takes Mia with him, in the only vehicle left I might add, just the two of them leaving the three others (girlfriend included) alone in a creepy cabin in the woods in the middle of the night where strange satanic rituals might have happened in the cellar. Last time I checked, there's room enough for five in a jeep. He could have at least taken the nurse with him in case Mia's condition worsened on their way to the hospital.<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>9- The abomination, with enough power in it's scrawny little arms to topple a jeep, had difficulty dragging itself on the ground after Mia amputated it's feet with the chainsaw. If it had as much power in it's arms as was shown, it should have easily been capable of doing a hand stand using it's arms to walk to get at her. Imagine for a second, how freaking' creepy it would have been to see that coming at her from around the jeep upside down. It would have been something like the creatures in the Dead Space video game. Missed opportunity there Fede.<br/><br/>Stupid.<br/><br/>10- Mia starts walking off into the morning sun with her arm cut off and shoved into her shirt, without even cauterizing the wound. I give her 15 minutes before she bleeds out and dies on the side of the road. Even if she makes it that far, she still has to swim across the river that washed out the road earlier in the movie. She'd never make it with all the blood loss, she would pass out and drown in the river.<br/><br/>Stupid ending."

","Save your money. This film is a cash grab of the highest order.

Original story. Groundbreaking gore effects. Stunning visuals. Mesmeric tension.<br/><br/>A masterpiece.<br/><br/>He did so without the desire for box office statistics, nor did he pay shills to promote the film.

That is OK because that is normal. But it not Evil Dead. Why they try and lie to the people by saying it is remake? It not the remake. It only have one or two thing in first movie like necromonicon the chainsaw and girl in the basement. Everything else is different and not the Evil Dead. No laughing in the movie like other the Evil Dead. No the scares and the fright. Just gore to cover story not in.<br/><br/>I not like fake Evil Dead.

","This is not the most terrifying film you will ever experience.<br/><br/>Now the original Evil Dead was an experience. You were scared, disgusted, and exhausted by the time the film ended. It was a low budget gore-fest. The remake is packed with gore, but almost to the point of exaggeration, and that's about the only positive I can give the film. It wasn't scary, it wasn't brutal, it wasn't ""Evil"".<br/><br/>The remake features pretty looking hipsters going to the cabin as part of a drug intervention. Of course, possessions and killings ensue. Good acting isn't expected in this kinds of films, but the fact that the ""heroine"" is one of the worst actresses I've seen in a while (her delivery of a one-liner towards the end of the film had me almost throwing up in my mouth in disgust), doesn't help matters. The remake is very predictable. One character pops up out of frame to save another character at least 3 times. It becomes expected and comedic. For some reason the ""demon voices"" all sound really stupid. Hakf the audience was laughing when someone possessed would start talking in demon voice.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead '13"" is like the countless other remakes that have come before it, it has no soul. But this remake does, however, have the blood and guts. The film tries to redeem itself in the last 15 minutes but it just feels like you're watching a completely different movie at that point.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a bloody deja vu. If feels like you've seen it all before...and not in a good way. Evil Dead '13 is not going to be a classic and if a sequel comes out, count me out.

","Horror Genre perfection. <br/><br/>Much like Evil Dead 2 - this takes the original idea and reworks it in an original way. A completely solid and well written horror movie that gets under your skin like horror should. Real horror fans will not be disappointed. Fans of the original have no reason to dislike this film if they truly enjoy good solid horror.<br/><br/>Critics should be educated on the difference between the Horror Genre and the Thriller Genre. A horror movie not scaring you isn't a valid criticism. Neither are complaints about gore. Horror movies aren't supposed to scare you. They are supposed to horrify you. They play on your primal fears and cause negative emotions to arise as a result. Being scared has nothing to do with how good a horror movie is.<br/><br/>Incidentally I think that is why horror movies get such terrible reviews from critics. A fundamental misunderstanding of the genre. The belief that they are supposed to feel frightened - so when instead they feel revolted by the gore or implications of a scene they react negatively to it.<br/><br/>This was genuinely the best pure horror movie to be released in mainstream cinemas in the last decade."

"robbotaylor","1","101","202","1 May 2013"," Speaking of souls, this film has none
","Remake or not, this film is an absolute bore. It seems the director spent more time getting nice looking shots rather than focusing on performances that should propel the narrative, which they don't. Far from it. The problem starts with the screenplay, which is just dumb, since the focus is on character development, a useless tool if the performances aren't directed well enough. The cabin and the woods is simply not a character as it is in the original, there are minutes of boring dialogue at the cabin before they even open the door. It is gory, but it has little affect since the performances are so terrible that the audience couldn't give a damn if they die or not. Decent work with CGI gore but still not convincing enough. No special makeup effects (appliances). Unlike other remakes (dawn of the dead, the Texas chainsaw massacre) that actually REMAKE the majority of the film, the Evil Dead seems to slightly deviate from the original screenplay, making it difficult to watch without comparing it to the original masterpiece. Mise-en-scene is bland, the props are lame, especially the necronomicon, and the cinematography is lacking if you consider Raimi's experimentation in the original. Overall, this film has no character, no soul, and no dark humor."

","I can't understand the Fanboys and the Fanboy wannabe's giving this excellent Horror any sort of a chance, because they have this infantile manner where they simply give a film 1/10 which is a pathetic attempt at proving themselves right. I know for a fact they have been hanging about the reviews to give a bad score for every review that says anything positive about this film. I watched the reviews myself one afternoon and there is a review which is one of the last reviews thanks to the Fanboys and when the header was changed to show admiration for the film it went from 98/277 to 91/277 over the course of a few hours. That is ""proof positive"" that this is going on. Pretty pathetic if you ask me.<br/><br/>This film should not be compared with 'The Evil Dead' because they may have the same/similar characters 'and' has been approved by Bruce and Raime but one is a comedy and this is clearly not. It's a hard core gross out Horror and has perhaps the most graphic scenes ever to grace the silver screen. This follows the story faithfully but lacks any humour at all. I have mixed feelings about Comedy/Horror because most of the time the Comedy is used to allow the filmmaker (I mean the ""not very good"" film makers) to use it like when they know they can't pull off any real scares so they dumb it down and have the actors doing the same take, more or less but get them to do it in a silly way. This movie is all scares and hacking bits off etc. If you're looking for atrocious acting and loads of blood then this film is definitely you.<br/><br/>Brilliant scary movie. I strongly advise you to go see this but make sure you have company with you for both moral and physical support.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended<br/><br/>You have been reading Buster Gonad and his unfeasibly large testicles."

No plot, no logic, no acting, no scares, no music- nothing but blood and gore.<br/><br/>Yes, it was competently made. If that, and tons of gore is enough for you, then you will definitely enjoy it!<br/><br/>After about an hour, the woman next to me said ""so this is essentially about 5 really stupid people killing each other. With lots of blood. That's it?"" I said ""yup. that's it""<br/><br/>Did anybody cover their face in the movie? Sure!! When you someone pulling a needle out of the eye you will wince.

","Compared to films from the SAW franchise this wasn't really gory; many reviewers feel the need to state that they don't understand how this didn't get an NC-17 rating but I don't understand why it should have.<br/><br/>As far as it being boring well, it really was. I cannot recall the last time I watched a movie and found myself looking at the time and wondering when something was actually going to happen. A good third of the run time was dedicated to plotting and character development yet there really wasn't either of the two things going on. OK, fine, all the characters hate David and Mia is a heroin junkie and the other people are just there. Sure we get a mention that Eric teaches high school, Olivia is a RN, and Natalie's sole existence in life is to be David's woman but that is it. There's nothing else for over thirty minutes and I summed it up in two sentences yet this piece of rubbish takes like 32 minutes to do the same thing? Horror when done in any medium is about ratcheting up the tension until the audience cannot take anything more and then going past it. Yet there was no tension or suspense to be seen in this movie. Some of that was due to the screenwriter's poorly placed idea to say everything that's going to happen with the bloody book five minutes before it happens but most was from the poor script and sub-par direction.<br/><br/>As far as the technical aspect of Evil Dead (2013) the gore was not on par with the original film from 32 years ago. What did you have that was so wonderful? An air nailer that didn't have an air line hooked up to it? I won't mention the fact that it couldn't actually fire a 6"" nail with deadly accuracy even if it was hooked up... oh wait, I just did... I digress. You had a scene where someone puked blood which was done before, a limb amputated below the knee on camera which has been done before, an arm getting severed off-screen, and a woman--physically impossibly--ripping her hand off... oh yes, the tongue scene.<br/><br/>So you have 35 minutes of ""plot development"" followed by about ten minutes of stale gore and 40 minutes of filler. This whole thing was a waste of time for the viewers but if it leads to an actual Sam Raimi written and directed Army of Darkness Part 2 then it'll be worth it.

"aberger79","3","118","241","5 April 2013"," Most Overconfident Movie Tagline of All Time
","When the remake of the 1981 horror classic ""The Evil Dead"" was announced in late 2011, fans of the series reacted, unsurprisingly, with revulsion. At the heart of their outrage lay a simple question: Why? How could a remake possibly improve upon the original? The first film's charm had much to do with its shoestring budget and utter lack of prestige. The cast and crew were a ragtag group of amateurs who essentially had no clue what they were doing. The filming process was notoriously unpleasant, requiring the team to live in a primitive log-cabin in the backwoods of Eastern Tennessee. It shouldn't have worked. And yet, when The Evil Dead hit theaters, it won over audiences across the world with its simplistic, clumsy charm and unique sense of humor--not to mention its pioneering camera work and brilliant practical effects. It paved the way for a decade of ultra-violent, low budget horror movies (either the best thing to happen to the genre or the worst, depending on who you're talking to.) Few products of the medium have ever enjoyed such influence.<br/><br/>Though a more technically advanced film, Fede Alvarez' 2013 remake--backed, disappointingly, by Raimi and Campbell themselves-- is as shoddy a production as the original, but without the charm and humor to redeem it. The fundamental problem with Alvarez' version (and Diablo Cody's reworking of the script) is that it approaches the material with ludicrous self seriousness, thus making itself vulnerable to more intense scrutiny, against which it has little hope of defense. The film begins promisingly enough, opening with a disturbing scene of father-daughter filicide, but immediately tumbles downhill when the meat of the plot (what little there is) is revealed. The premise is this: A group of five twenty-somethings treks out into the woods for a high school reunion/intervention, hoping to permanently cure Mia (Jane Levy) of her heroin addiction. They hole up in Mia and her brother David's (Shiloh Fernandez) decrepit family cottage and steel themselves for the worst of the withdrawal symptoms to set in. However, their priorities soon shift when Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) discovers a copy of the Necronomicon (wrapped in barbed wire, bound in human skin, and with explicit admonishments written in bold red letters upon its pages) and recites the exact words the book warns him not to recite under any circumstance. What follows thereafter should, by all rights, be an entertaining, gory romp through the swamps. Instead, we are treated to seventy minutes of unrelenting stupidity and bad acting. The worst offender is the brainless David, our lackluster stand in for Bruce Campbell's Ash, who, for three quarters of the movie, simply can't get it through his thick skull that his sister has been possessed by a demon, despite all evidence leading to that conclusion. His dimwitted attempts to contain the situation are extraordinarily frustrating to watch, as is the extreme gullibility of the other characters. How many times will these fools fall for the old ""I'm not a demon!"" trick? Make it a drinking game. You'll be wasted by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Again, all of these transgressions would be more easily forgiven if the movie didn't take itself so seriously. But there's nary an amusing one-liner or even a hint of self-awareness to get us through this study in tedium. Even the gore is disappointing--or, at least, it failed to impress this seasoned genre enthusiast. Recent films that top Evil Dead in that department include Slither, Feast, and Cabin Fever, among others.<br/><br/>Here's hoping the ""Carrie"" remake fares a little better."

There is not a single thing about it that is actually scary, and is in fact, so stupid in its presentation that any notion of fear is quickly pushed aside to the overwhelming ""Seriously??!!"" that you scream for the entire 90 minutes. The characters themselves are so one-dimensional and stupid, that it is impossible to feel anything for their violent ends other then elation. This is one of the few movies where I was rooting for the demon. The whole movie is sloppy in its presentation, with more detail being given to fancy murder scenes that hope to distract the viewer with hyper gore so they'll ignore how bad and stupid the entire story is.<br/><br/>Don't bother with this film. Don't even rent it. Just forget it exists. Hopefully the rest of the world will too."

","""The Evil Dead"" suffers from the same malaise as many of the modern remakes of grindhouse/B Horror classics(""I Spit On Your Grave"", ""Black Christmas"" etc.). Rather than use the extra budget to fully realize the ideas and quirks that made the originals awesome......those buckets of cash are dumped into bloated, overlong run times and buckets of CGI blood sloshed about with a few surround sound sheer volume ""jump"" moments.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a lot of makes B horror classics special is the inventiveness forced by their sheer lack of budget.Concise runtimes born of necessity often kept things moving at a brisk pace, with out fluff or an excess of pointless padding.<br/><br/>Think about ""The Beyond"" and its glorious dime store surrealism, ""Dead & Buried""'s layers of moody atmosphere, the weird quirk that managed to make people root for ""The Human Centipede"" to escape its scenery chewing creator....or in the case of ""The Evil Dead"" the fact that it was a horror film, but had a very good balance of black comedy, and Bruce Campbell had an excellent knack for knowing when to toss in a bit of a wink and a nudge. <br/><br/>Granted, the original ""Evil Dead"" isn't nearly as camp/slapstick as its sequels...but it did have a sense of spiteful fun amongst all of the gore. <br/><br/>The remake plays dead straight for so long, when it finally attempts a few brief moments of the original's laughs, they fall as flat as the actors' bland performances. <br/><br/>It plods through the original plot pretty faithfully, and completely ignores the fact that the plot wasn't what made the original great. Demonic possession, the haunted cabin in the woods.....those were genre clichés in 1981, and they are more so 30 years later. <br/><br/>Without the spirited ability to make fun of itself.......""The Evil Dead"" becomes a shadow of its former self, and the few spots where the remake changes essential plot elements only serve to make this ever more of a wad of ABC gum, with about as much flavor.<br/><br/>The protagonists die in the exact order you'd expect them to, and it all comes across as oddly perfunctory, with buckets of bile and a demon with a voice stolen straight from ""The Exorcist"" part of just another day at the office.<br/><br/>Additionally, for a $14,000,000 film, it's appallingly sloppy in a way that could easily been avoided with that much production budget. I can forgive a $1.50 and a shoestring film for plot holes, continuity errors and characters that are lifeless long before their on screen deaths. When it's a glossy Hollywood production the fact that all of the above happen often isn't homage.....it's just careless and lazy.<br/><br/>The few traditional special effects are ridiculously cheap and poorly done, and were clearly afterthoughts tossed in after the CGI budget line item ran out. Objects are broken, tossed aside or set on fire....only to necromance back to their original state a few frames later.<br/><br/>The modern ""Evil Dead"" committed the cardinal sin of a horror film. It was utterly boring. <br/><br/>No one at my screening squealed, laughed or got grossed out by the added ultra violence.....we all just munched on our popcorn and let out a collective ""meh"" as the end credits rolled."

","The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? Uh, no, that would be ""The Shining!""

This unnecessary-as-usual remake has almost none of the fun and camp of the original series. There are a few brief moments of inspired humor, but that's it.

"soulfire42","2","104","211","10 April 2013"," Fan of originals, can't stand this one.
","I am a fan of Evil Dead, Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. I get them. Ash is a riot and a character with a lot of charm and theatrical winks to the camera. I'm writing this review because I can't stand thinking about other fans of the series of the movies that will be duped just like I was by the overall high score of the new Evil Dead movie and some of the glowing reviews.<br/><br/>I feel like I should rate the movie a 1 instead of the 2 I gave it just to help balance out the people who are giving it a 10/10, etc. However, I didn't do that and instead gave it my honest ranking which is a 2 out of 10.<br/><br/>This movie misses the point on several levels. Let me begin by stating that my impression is that the choice made in creating this movie was to try and ramp up the horror/gore while leaving out almost all of the dark comedy. However, the director has no idea how to make a horror movie or how to add tension. We sat in theater about to fall asleep because nothing was remotely believable, engaging or tense. Honestly, I'm not sure how you can have a film about a cabin in the woods and possession and stuff and not have some degree of tension innately present, but somehow this director pulled it off. There is gore and it caused some squeamish reactions in the audience, but the ONLY time I saw anyone actually jump was during a moment that was not actually scary, but rather a character moved quickly unexpectedly. I don't want to state more than that because I'm not out to ruin the movie for anyone who may be able to get a cheap thrill from it.<br/><br/>You will not come away from having watched this movie with any favorable impressions about the actors. Mia strangely conjures the hollow actress of the Twilight movies to mind both in looks and acting capability many times during the movie. The other characters are extremely unmemorable. You'll not care when nasty things happen or as they do nasty things to others.<br/><br/>I'm fine with Evil Dead being its own new thing, if it was a good movie in the process. This isn't. It feels like the director thought that buckets of gore and ripping things could make up for developing any tension, scrapping the comedy, having hollow characters with wooden actors and trying to spell everything out painfully to the audience. Even the good old evil book now has nice red scribblings in giant letters because it appears the director assumed the audience would be too stupid to figure out the book was bad news without it being written on it that it was in big red letters.<br/><br/>This film might have worked going with the more horror and gore and stripping away the comedy of the originals. I can see that as a potentially successful path for a director to take, but you have to deliver on the horror, tension and dread for that path to succeed. That didn't happen in this movie.<br/><br/>This film is stupid, it treats its audience like they are stupid too. This movie fails to scare, it fails to entertain, it fails to surprise, it fails to move anything forward, and I regret paying money to have seen it. It does a lot of the special effects better (which certainly wasn't hard to do) and has some more gross-out moments, but I don't think anyone going to see this film would have agreed to trade out the comedy of the originals for more minutes of mindless gore.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who realizes gore does not equal horror, skip this one. If you know who Ash is and know what a ""boomstick"" is, skip this one. If you're young and easily scared, maybe watch it. If you're a fan of mindless gore, maybe watch it.<br/><br/>Fans of the original, be sure to watch after the credits. However, don't expect this small treat to do anything to make up for the movie you just sat through."
"chicagopoetry","4","86","172","7 April 2013"," The Boring Dead
","I can't believe how awful the remake of The Evil Dead is. I've been waiting for it for so long and was so surprised when I found myself yawning while watching it and I almost fell asleep once. It's so incredibly NOT scary I even started heckling it toward the end. Here are its main flaws:<br/><br/>1. The characters are not likable, especially the shaggy unpleasant dude who is completely annoying and is played by probably the worst actor on the face of the earth. The main female character is a junkie. The rest of them are just cardboard cutouts with no motivation.<br/><br/>2. There is no build up to suspense. In the original Evil Dead all the characters were just carefree people going to a cabin to have a good time and that set up is what made what eventually happens to them so horrible in juxtaposition. But this time around they're at the cabin to help their junkie friend go cold turkey off heroin. Huh? So in other words they're already there, prepared for a bad time so when things get worse well, so what?<br/><br/>3. The sound. The music is just horrible and relentless. Sometimes it sounds like the score from an Indiana Jones film. Other times there is this noise that sounds like a tornado siren blaring as if it's a big neon sign pointing at the screen telling us ""This part is suppose to be scary so be scared."" Also the demon voices are just a joke. Instead of being deep and menacing they sound like some little kid going ""Whooooo"" in the dark pretending she's a ghost.<br/><br/>4. This movie is just not scary and it's also not funny. For some reason they give us an opening scene involving a woman who is possessed by a demon so they sort of give it away right from the start. When other people start getting possessed we're like, right, we already saw that in the first scene. I really can't put my finger on why it's not scary. There are a few really well shot scenes where I sat there thinking, this should be really, really scary but for some reason it's not. It's boring.<br/><br/>5. There is too much attention given to the Book of the Dead. This time around the possessed people aren't just randomly acting nuts but following instructions from the book (scald yourself in the shower, cut your face off). The film keeps showing us pages from the book once again as if we need a big arrow pointing to the screen explaining for us what's happening and why. <br/><br/>6. The ending is nothing like the original. In the original we are taken down the rabbit hole into shear madness and ultimately there's no escape from the evil. In this one, get this (warning spoilers ahead), the main female lead who is the first to get possessed gets buried alive then her brother digs her back up and brings her back to life through a makeshift defibrillator (um, okay) and now she's normal again then for some reason her brother goes and kills himself so that SHE becomes the last one standing against some OTHER demon woman who comes out of the ground no less and chases her around and blah blah blah and in the end she survives. The ending is total nonsense and is a formulaic climax instead of keeping to the insane, no hope spirit of The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>7. The acting is so bad I have to wonder why they wrote in so much unnecessary dialogue since the actors could barely show a single emotion, and even the dialogue is like a big arrow pointing at the screen telling us ""This is what's happening"" as if we're so stupid we can't figure it out for ourselves. At one point one character literally says something like ""I think I caused this by reading from that book"" well DUH!!!<br/><br/>8. The script is the worst script for a remake I've seen since I Spit On Your Grave. Why do they have a nail gun at the cabin in the first place? Why do they have not only an electric knife (or electricity for that matter) but also a perfectly cooked, rare beef roast of some sort that one character cuts up with the electric knife but apparently they never eat it. Shouldn't they be toasting marshmallows or something? Who is with whom anyway? Who's cabin is it? If they were going to change the script so much then why even stage it in a cabin? Why not stage it in a tiny little apartment or something?<br/><br/>9. The film is so dark. I mean the lighting, not the atmosphere. You really have to strain to even see what's going on.<br/><br/>10. Finally, for the life of me, I can't figure out where two of the characters even disappeared to. They were possessed then suddenly they weren't even part of the film anymore. Did I see some type of edited version or something? What happened to the dark skinned girl for example? Maybe that was the part I fell asleep in. <br/><br/>The only things this film has going for it.<br/><br/>1. There are a handful of really original gory scenes but you can get that with just about any straight to video horror film.<br/><br/>2. Jane Levy proves she can do more than Suburgatory. She's by far the only real actor in the film and she does a decent job given the mixed up script plopped onto her lap.<br/><br/>3. If you're lucky like me you can sneak into the theater next door and watch The Croods and you won't feel so ripped off.<br/><br/>Well, that's it. That's my two cents about this stinker called Evil Dead.<br/><br/>PS, let's hope the remake of Suspiria is better than this."
"anthonyly5","3","92","185","7 April 2013"," Evil Deadly disappointing...
","When I first saw the first trailers for this movie, I quickly went to go watch the original and I loved it! It was spooky, creepy and scary! Even the possessed looks of the humans freaked me out a bit after all of these years of its first debut. So I got myself pumped and ready for this remake and everything! I just saw it today and I have to say, I was deeply disappointed...I realize that the creators and director tried to fit it into our present time now, which worked Out perfectly. But, the thing that just didn't work out for me is that they just went a bit overboard with the gore and blood. I feel like they planned everything out perfectly in this movie just for the purpose of the gore and blood. The personality of the ""demon"" in this was pretty frightening but, at times I felt like things were just too cheesy with the ""demon"". Also, some of the lines that were said by the ""demon"" just made giggle. I have to say, this movie isn't ""the most terrifying movie you'll ever experience."" There were probably two or three scenes that made me jump just a little bit. It was just filled with disgusting, overwhelming gore and blood sequences. The only things that I really liked was the acting done by Jane Levy and what happened at the end when it started to ""rain"". I just couldn't sit through the movie anymore when it got halfway into it (I was with some friends so I couldn't really leave, so I had to bare through it). There were times when I thought that it should've ended and also times when I WISHED the movie ended because it was so ridiculous. Anywho, this just isn't my type of movie. I recommend it to those who like gore and blood."
"SelinaKyle3636","1","48","91","13 November 2013"," This movie is. so. bad.
","I just finished watching this movie and I'm just sitting here wondering how and why this movie even got made... It is probably one of the worst horror movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch. It honestly has no coherent plot except what it ripped from the original (which I don't understand who decided that movie needed a remake because it's an amazing classic). The characters in this movie are some of the stupidest I've ever seen. Honestly, all of them deserved to die. So when you find a book that's bound in human flesh your FIRST instinct is to read from said book? Oh your sister is possessed by a demon and is basically infecting everyone with it but let's not kill her because she starts singing a song from your childhood? You want to go down in the basement with her even though she's killed practically everyone? I didn't root for any of these characters. Whenever the possessed people would talk I found myself just laughing because it was so forced. It's like they were trying to be scary and intimidating but it just came off like characters from Scary Movie. The actors in this movie have the intelligence of a bag of rocks and the acting range of Kristen Stewart. <br/><br/>This movie is also torture porn at it's finest. Why do directors think this gruesome violence makes for good film making? I mean this bitch gets raped by a tree. What..? Then she starts infecting everyone like an STD or something, even forcing one girl to make out with her after she's split her tongue in half with a box cutter. It's basically blood on top of blood mixed in with other bodily fluids. At one point a girl gets her arm pinned under a car while some demon is crawling towards her. So she rips her arm out from under the car and is able to get up and pick up a chainsaw to kill the demon. No shock? She didn't pass out from unimaginable pain that would have caused? I'm also glad that a human arm can be ripped off like it's made of jelly and it has no ligaments, tendons, or bone. Hooray for realism! I understand horror movies are not about realism but come on, you can do better than that. I DVRed this movie and actually found myself checking to see if it was almost over. It's so bad, don't waste your time. Glad I didn't see this movie in the theater. Hollywood, please, for the love of all that is holy, STOP DOING REMAKES."
"hannahhdavis","1","130","268","8 April 2013"," should be ""the goriest film you'll ever experience""
","let me start by saying that i am easily scared by horror movies, i am the girl who sits there with her hands over her face, peeking out through the spaces in-between her fingers to watch a horror movie...and the only, and i mean ONLY, reason i covered my face in this movie was because it was so sickeningly gory and violent. i went into the theater not having seen the original, so i wasn't sure what to expect, but it was far from the most terrifying movie i'll ever see, that's for sure.<br/><br/>the back story, as boring and short-lived as it was, helped the movie transition into the bloodbath that it became, with the characters playing off Mia's weird behavior, in it's early stages, as withdraws (although vomiting blood on someone is NOT a symptom of drug withdraw)<br/><br/>the acting was awful...the characters were boring at best, and could have put anyone to sleep had they not been so grossed out. the only actor worth a damn in this whole flick was Lou Taylor Pucci, who took an ass beating and kept on kicking until the very end. Jane Levy's portrayal of Mia was decent, and decently creepy in some parts, but the rest of the cast was just....horrible. by the time everyone starting dying, i was actually glad - it was more torturous to watch them try to act than it was to watch them kill each other...which, come to think of it, could have been caused by the awful, and horribly corny, script, in which the characters have to act serious (and seriously scared) while trying to tend to wounds with duct tape, and convince the audience that someone with ZERO medical knowledge can fashion a working defibrillator out of a car battery, MORE duct tape, two needles and various other ridiculous items. my acting probably would have sucked too if i had to act like taping someone's severed arm with duct tape would do anything at all to prevent the inevitable bleed out.<br/><br/>which leads me to the overwhelming amount of violence and gore. it was over the top...laughable even (as a matter of fact, the man sitting in the row in front of us in the theater WAS laughing) because it just got to the point where there wasn't even a shred of shock factor anymore, it was just violence for violence's sake. there was no depth to it, no build up, nothing to really psychologically mess with the audience before grossing them out, it was just..there. it actually got boring, because everything literally just turned into a bloodbath (pun intended)..it was brutal and hard to watch, and the audience definitely grossed out, but it wasn't shocking, it became expected. the demon reminded me too much of the exorcist to actually be scary, it just seemed like they ripped off the look, the actions, and even some of the phrases from the exorcist and hoped it'd scare people.<br/><br/>overall...i wasn't impressed. over-the-top gore and violence does not qualify a movie as being ""the most terrifying movie you'll ever experience""....it was far from it. had it really amped up the psychological scares and the build-up to the gore, then maybe we could talk, but a movie that relies solely on blood and guts is not terrifying, it just makes the audience want a barf bag.<br/><br/>i'll wait to see the directors cut (as some of the scenes in previews were not in the movie) to make another decision as i'm sure some of the truly unnerving scenes were left on the cutting room floor to allow for an R rating, but for now, it has nothing that you couldn't have seen if you mashed together Saw and The Exorcist.<br/><br/>in general, the scariest part of my movie-going experience was that someone brought their children, all 10 and under, to this gore-fest, and i had to sit in front of them for an hour and a half."

The remake lacks the sense of dread and hopelessness of the original. The characters are thin and forgettable. This version was actually boring...<br/><br/>This film is nothing like the original.

Everything that transpires amongst the characters and the story as a whole is haphazardly thrown together if not just for the sake of adhering to the original Evil Dead movie and reminding you that you're watching the same movie.<br/><br/>There is some macabre humor put in here and there but the execution of the story is so serious it would go over your head or get a delayed reaction.<br/><br/>The violence in this movie is also radically over the top, and seems to be as jolted in as the rest of the plot points in the movie are.

The gore in it was good and there were a few cool things in it but the movie as a whole was really bad. SFX doesn't make a good movie.

To me this movie was a tribute for all the fans of horror and to the Evil Dead series and what it could have been or what it couldn't of been without the first three films and the fans. <br/><br/>From the start of the film, my friends and I were already trying to figure who was the main hero and who was going to be the first to die and how. Jokes from other horror films like ""Cabin in the woods"" and the other ""Evil Dead"" movies filled the movie theater as we all knew or most knew what to expect. And this is what this film feeds on. New and Old horror buffs just sitting down to watch a nice gory movie to a old story. This film is not made to scare you. Its made to make you twitch and cringe with both horror and excitement as each scene passes. Just like the original ""Evil Dead"" its a horror film that is made to be taken serious and still not all all. <br/><br/>But Evil Dead does more than any new horror film in the past few years have done. It gives us everything we wanted. It feeds us this horror film of not scares but of blood and gore with gravy of jokes on top to fatten us up for the last scene which is just a final tribute to all the fans of Evil Dead. You didn't need the last 10 minutes, but it was done to make us all scream in joy as we watch it. <br/><br/>(Spoilers!)It truly says something when a film make a crowd of people in the movie theater stand and cheer for when a girl has to cut off her own arm. And I think that is what the Evil Dead series is about. Not scares or frights, but a salute to what all us horror fans. Don't take this film seriously, go in expecting a great time."

This movie was turned into another copycat Hollywood ""horror"".<br/><br/>Lets start with the characters. The only characters name I remember is the junky girls, Mia, but only because she was pretty much the focus of the whole movie. She was the only credible actor in this whole clusterpuck of a film.

Ash = badass with a chainsaw, whatshisface = complete wussy through the entire movie.

Just more meat for the Hollywood grinder.<br/><br/>The plot was incredibly hollow, the Necronomicon looked like a history textbook on the inside, the infamous ""chainsawing the hand off"" in this version was boring, and a lot of the effects clearly had continuity errors, not small errors mind you, in-your-face cant-miss-it errors, which shows in the last 10mins of the movie mostly.<br/><br/>You're better off going and buying the original trilogy and have a night in with friends, beer and pizza.

I love the original Evil Dead and the Evil Dead trilogy as a whole and when I heard it was being remade I thought no one can replace Bruce Campbell as Ash or Sam Raimi as the director. But when I finally saw the remake I thought while it doesn't replace the original Evil Dead is one of the best remakes I have seen in years. Right from the opening credits ED grabs you by the throat and does not let go until the very end and gives viewers a frightening and scary experience. What is scary and creepy about this new ED is that you never know what to expect and that you are on the edge of your seat the entire time and that you do not know who's going to live or die. We as the audience go through the same dread and torture the characters go through in and it can be very painful and hard to sit through but I think that's what adds to the suspense. What I also like about this film is that while it is a remake of the original film,it decides to go it's own way by giving viewers the same story,but with new characters and a couple of twists and additions to the film. It's a remake of the original while it is it's own film. The only thing I don't like about the film is the lack of Humor the original film and the other ED films had although at times I did laugh at the film. I appreciate the serious this movie had,but I would have liked to see some more humor in the movie. The Demons in this film are scary and creepy but are different from the Demons in the original ED trilogy because in the original trilogy the evil Demons possessed humans and made the possessed humans do horrible things the Demons in the new ED still make humans do horrible things but curse like sailors and say vulgar things almost to the point whether you don't know whether to laugh or be horrified. The Demons in this film have more in common with The Devil in The Exorcist than the Demons in the original ED Trilogy. ED is probably one of the bloodiest,goriest Horror films that I have seen in recent years and it's no surprise that the film originally got an NC-17 by the MPAA(changed to an R-Rating). When the blood and gore starts to come out it keeps coming and never stops and even the most seasoned Horror fan who has probably seen it all will get grossed out by the gore and violence. The film is so bloody and gory you will feel like the blood come off the screen and into your face. The ending of the film is great and the bloodiest 15 minutes you will see in a recent Horror film. Also,look after the end credits and you will see one of the great surprises in movie history.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job in their roles. Jane Levy is excellent as Mia,with Levy bringing emotion and lots of depth to the role. Shiloh Fernandez is wonderful as David,Mia's brother with Fernandez having great chemistry with Levy. Lou Taylor Pucci gives a great performance as Eric,the one who knows what's going on. Jessica Lucas(Olivia)and Elizabeth Blackmore(Natalie)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>Fede Alverez(in his directorial debut)does an amazing job with the direction of the film,with Alverez bring a great visual style and atmosphere to the film while also doing well with the scary scenes. Although Alverez's direction is not as kinetic or as strong as Raimi's,it's still great direction from Alverez.<br/><br/>The score by Roque Banos is effective and memorable and fits with the tone of the film. Great score.<br/><br/>The special make-up effects in the film excellent,gory,realistic,messy and bloody and definitely work for the film. Excellent effects.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love the original Evil Dead or the whole Evil Dead Trilogy,you will love the new Evil Dead,a scary,gory and effective Horror film that stands alongside the original,one of the best Horror remakes in recent years and is worth the price of admission. Highly Recommended. 9.5/10."

","This movie is just buckets of blood and gore. Nothing scary or remotely interesting, no story or plot to speak of. All the characters are cardboard throwaways, with dumb dialog. It is hard to blame any of the actors, because they were given such terrible lines and literally nothing to work with character wise. <br/><br/>This is the worst horror movie I have seen in a long time. It is made as a ""gross out"" movie only. And that gets real boring, real quickly. I was misled by some of the reviews to go and see this, which I now think must have just been pure advertising hype malarkey. It feels like a long and drawn out two hours plus movie, even though it was only 90 minutes. Any horror movie fan can safely skip this, you won't miss a thing."
"bowmanblue","5","27","48","11 August 2014"," The most remaky remake ever remade
","There are two ways to watch the 2013 version of Evil Dead. If you weren't watching horror in the eighties then you'll probably view this as a competent little horror flick. The acting is decent, as are the special effects. There are a few bits that make you jump and other scenes are reasonably creepy. Therefore, you may conclude that, if you were looking for a decent horror film, then you have found one.<br/><br/>Then there's the other way of looking at it. If, like me, you were a fan of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans in the eighties, as he depicted the wise-cracking 'Ash' who was in the original trilogy, then you may be thinking why did you bother watching this? I knew the remake had no humour. I was prepared for that. I can enjoy an outright horror film without the 'tongue-in-cheekness' of the original. However, the central characters are pretty damn unlikeable. Without the humour, they're a miserable bunch who you won't really care much about - they're just a collection of stereotypes, i.e. the blonde, the brunette, the jock, the geek and the other one - 'Mia' - who is a teenager trying to get herself off drugs (and failing) and therefore hardly someone we can identify with (hopefully). The opening drags as we're supposed to 'get to know' the characters. It felt like this part occupied the first half of the film. I checked the timer and it had only been on for 23 minutes (it felt like 45). Never a good sign.<br/><br/>So, the film plays out pretty much the same as the original. All the aspects are there - the bucketloads of blood, the tree, the thing we never see that runs through the wood and the trapdoor under the cabin. Therefore, if we've seen it before in the original, there's little point in us watching it again. Yes, the film has a more 'polished' feel, but there's nothing new here. They tried to stick to the original by keeping to the plot, which just leaves those who've already watched the original finding little new with what's been done to the new version.<br/><br/>If you've never seen the original and you like horror, you'll probably like this. However, I just felt that 'no Ask = no point.' Another great classic plundered and failed. If you want to watch a half decent remake of a horror classic, only the 2004 version of Dawn of the Dead comes close."
"MovieProductions","5","100","204","6 April 2013"," When gore becomes boring- Exhibit A
","""One of the goriest experiences of all time""! ""The whole audience fainted!"" ""I threw up"". I'm not sure which movie people were talking about, but sign me up because that sure as hell wasn't ""Evil Dead"". Before I get written off or torn by my limbs, the Evil Dead trilogy was and still is my favorite trilogy of any film. I have watched each movie at least three times and own a copy of the Book of the Dead edition of the first ""Evil Dead"" and have forced each and one of my friends to watch the first ""Evil Dead"", and even they loved it.<br/><br/>Where does it all go wrong? The first ""Evil Dead""'s notoriety was garnered for pushing the envelope with its grotesque portrayal of violence, yes, but it also had a charismatic lead. I don't care about gender, I don't care that we don't have ""Ash"" anymore, Mia just isn't a great lead. Yes she's gone through a lot, yes her backstory pretty much spells her character, but a sob story shouldn't be the main reason why we should put our fists in the air.<br/><br/>Now what every person came to watch ""Evil Dead"" for. GORE. GORE. GORE. GORE. GORE. Maybe the fact I spotted cuts every so often, or maybe I'm just desensitized, but aside from the blood- bath, this is pretty much your average horror flick. If any thing, it might be one of the bloodiest films of the year, but not the GORIEST. While TED was essentially ""Unrated"" (baring it all), I'm still sure the NC-17 version of this re-boot can't touch the continuous break-neck pacing and violence of that movie.<br/><br/>I'll give the movie points for TRYING to establish character development and bringing some new insight, but it's so underdeveloped that if anything, it takes the movie out of place. We're supposed to ""care"" about these characters when in fact we don't. They're not bad actors, actually, some surprised me, but at the end of the day, we just want to see some flying limbs. And with that being said, it cuts into 1/3 of the movie.<br/><br/>The most-raved about opening sequence is nothing more than a disappointment. Cue the foul language. Cue every cliché in filmmaking history. And of course cue the blood card. It's laid out all on here. Well at least the tree rape was a solid homage, but I still prefer the original's.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Evil Dead"" can't be described as ""awful"", ""insulting"", or a bad remake. It can be described as ""not scary"", ""average"", or really both of those things. With so much hype, and Raimi/Campbell behind this, AND with all the rave reviews from screenings, this is not the movie the fans got. Maybe an unrated version down the road will bump up a few points but for now, a 5 is satisfactory."

","In 1983 I had one of the best movie going experiences of my life, when I saw The Evil Dead in a packed house. The audience ""participated"" in the screening: people talking to the screen, imitating the demons (perfectly), and turning the movie into a party. The original had humor and was actually scary in parts. This remake commits the unpardonable sin of removing all of the humor. This is an Evil Dead movie: the friggin' humor MUST be there. Someone made the idea to make this film straight and actually inject dramatic elements to the story, like one of the characters kicking heroin. So no humor and depressing drama plus nauseating gore (that I did expect) equals crappy movie experience. I can imagine only a perverted sicko would enjoy this horrible movie. The gore just keeps coming and coming...and they keep throwing the depressing stuff at you at the same time. Then the ending...ah the wonderful surprise ending. I was told to stay with it until the end of the credits for a surprise. The surprise is Bruce Campbell...saying,""Groovy!"" Talk about adding insult to injury. What an out of place thing to do. So a big F U to him and his buddies for co-producing this crap. They've made millions already. I hope they're happy with it: I'll never watch anything by them again."

","Oh dear, I can't remember the last time I watched a movie and was unable to find even 1 redeeming feature.<br/><br/>This is a 'horror' movie for people who don't want to be scared, every part of the film is a tired rehash of many other horror movies (think exorcist, numerous teenagers lost in the woods flicks etc) but done much, much worse and, save for a few scenes, not much of a nod to the evil dead original. All the characters are unlikeable to the point where you hope they are going to be killed, the story (what there is of it) is dull and the horror/gore is boring, predictable and unoriginal. Although it carries an 18 rating it is without doubt the least scary horror film I have ever seen - it is so predictable it's embarrassing and it makes for a long 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I went into this movie genuinely excited to see how they were going to take it but but left incredibly frustrated as a reprise of the evil dead should have been a surefire hit - sadly it feels like it was made solely to put cash in the bank.<br/><br/>To summarise this film is a waste of time - save your money and spend it on something better like a tooth extraction or your 1st instalment on that lobotomy you never wanted."
"AlukardsCastle","10","57","111","18 July 2013"," Relentless Horror!
","Let me start off by saying that I LOVE the original 'Evil Dead' Trilogy by Sam Raimi. I'm not like the angry biased people who immediately dismiss remakes of classic horror movies because they aren't the same as the original. Most of these hipster trash talkers didn't even really watch the movie. I loved the spirit of this terrifying gore filled remake/re-imagining of 'Evil Dead'. I gave it a chance. A good horror movie is a good horror movie.<br/><br/>Synopsis: The two leads are Mia played by newcomer Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez as her brother. Many are enraged by this change, but I accepted it. I mean honestly, it would be even worse if they decided to remake the Ash character with a new actor. Seriously, no one can fill Bruce Campbells shoes. That being said, I was actually impressed with the approach the film takes this go-round. 5 friends gather at a Cabin to help one of the group, Mia, overcome her drug addiction. As the hours go by she gets edgy and they discover a basement full of witchcraft type items. One of the group brings out a book and starts to read from it. This is when the demons start to take over. As the movie progresses I honestly felt the movie didn't really have a lead character because 3 of the 5 characters seem to become equally important. <br/><br/>The imagery is beautifully gruesome. The tension builds up in creeping terror fashion until the scares start to get louder and more prominent toward the end. There are even certain aspects of the remake that pay great homage to the original Evil Dead. The quick shot of the Chainsaw. The implication that the girls hand will become possessed like Ashes hand. The terrifyingly creepy cellar scenes. When the guy reads from the demonic book you know right away that horror is about to follow. The movie has a constant feeling of dread. There are some scenes that will make people laugh, but for the most part, this movie was relentless horror! The movie also had a little heart. There were certain scenes that will bring out emotions in the audience. I admit there was a part where I almost felt a tear forming in my eye. The make up effects are disgustingly real. Don't see this movie if you have a weak stomach. I read that they refrained from using CGI effects in this movie to stay true to the spirit of the old school approach of the original. I loved that they chose to do that. The demons in this had the true 'Evil Dead' feel to them. I was so creeped out the entire movie. The faces of the demons are some of the scariest images since ""The Exorcist"". I felt like a kid again watching ""The Exorcist"" for the first time. The voices of the demons will surely haunt most viewers for nights. I definitely closed my closet door after seeing this movie. The directing is clever and creepy. This movie has a lot of good examples of how a horror movie should be made. The actors and actresses give believable performances. The actress who plays 'Mia' was so good in her terrorized and demonic performance. Sure sometimes the characters made stupid decisions, but come on, we all remember the part when the girl walked into the woods alone just because she 'heard something' in the original Evil Dead right? If the characters don't make at least one stupid decision in a movie, then there wouldn't be a horror movie right? I can tell the filmmakers put a lot of effort into this movie. The filmmakers knew how the fan base of the original trilogy would react to certain things. I'm glad that the original director Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell helped a lot with production for this movie. They also had help from Robert Tapert, the producer of the original. If they weren't there to supervise, I can tell this movie wouldn't have been half as good as it is. This is definitely the best horror remake. Also one of the best and goriest horror movies released nationwide in theaters. This made the Saw movies seem ""PG"". The movie has that 'independent' feel of the original while also having a mainstream feel at the same time. I really appreciated this movie. I even cared for the characters. Not like most horror movies where you can't wait to see the characters die. I wanted these characters to live. It was a great tragic movie, just like the original. It terrified me and made me and the audience at the theater cringe and wanna cover our eyes. Watching this movie with a crowd of people is the best way to experience it. I haven't had that much fun at a theater in a LONG time. I encourage you to see it with at least 3 other people. Turn up the volume, and have fun. The quality of the Blu Ray really brought the horror to life at home too! <br/><br/>I do have slight criticisms. I like to believe the movie is set in modern times. But I didn't see a single Cell Phone. Also regarding that, it would've been nice and more modern if at least one character said ""There's no service out here"", because a lot of people in the theater kept saying ""Why don't they just call 911?"". Another thing is, after their hot lady friend is killed first, they just forget about it right away. As if it was nothing tragic! Other than that, this movie is legit horror though!<br/><br/>All in all, don't dismiss it as just another pointless horrible remake. Give it a chance. But most of all, DON'T keep comparing it to the original."
"rejaul","10","49","94","9 April 2013"," Not the evil dead I expected but it did okay
","WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD!<br/><br/>OK iv watched an early screening of evil dead in the UK, thanks to Total Film. OK now Iv been an evil dead fan for 20 years And this one wasn't good as the original evil dead but was okay but it will not fall in to a classic movie of all time, I understand this ain't a remake and it's more of a rebirth/sequel then a remake, only because they are planning to get Bruce Campbell/Ash back in to the mix for an epic showdown between 2 worlds of evil dead but I'm sure this new generation will hopefully love the movie... Here's why I was disappointed and am sure those who seen the original evil dead, will feel the same. I'll just list out the good points and bad points...<br/><br/>GOOD POINTS:  Acting was far better then the original evil dead. Each character played well.  Story plot was better 1st half of the movie had a real feel of the original evil dead.  Practical Effects were better  Higher budget then the original  Had few elements of the original evil dead  Loved Mia (Jane levy) she played well as a Deadite but wasn't too impressed.  Pure Gore and Bloody Thumbs up to that  Entertaining and packed full of non stop action, the original evil dead dragged on most of the times was boring at times.<br/><br/>BAD POINTS:  The Deadites were more of a soul less zombie then a menacing scary looking demons as the old evil dead, I mean they didn't say a word or have a menacing voice, Mia had a voice of a child being strangled.  There were few missing scenes where the trailer showed David with a chainsaw that scene was missing and Mia singing ""where going to get you"" wasn't in there? Hmmm...  What was with the siren effect? Whenever someone's hand/arm falls off or a bloody gory scene You can hear a siren go off? Seriously?... They should have stuck with the creepy old school music and sound effects. <br/><br/>Final conclusion. I really wanted this to be more creepier and more scary and menacing and they should have focused more on the demons/Deadites And better dialogues, that's all I asked for but they were mostly concentrating on the blood and gore... I have to admit story and characters played out well but it wasn't scary or the most terrifying movie of all time but sure was entertaining and packed with action... Sorry but I'm sure most horror fans will admit and stay true to the original but hopefully the new generation will cherish this movie. I'm hoping in the near future they will release a real horror remake of the original."

","I was skeptical when I heard they were going to remake one of my favorite horror movies of all time. When I saw it, I came into it with a very optimistic hope that all by skepticism would die once I saw the final product. What I got was nothing like the original film. Which can be good sometimes, but not this time. The direction made me feel that the director had just been handed the script with no understanding of what the original Evil Dead was about. The remake of Dawn of the Dead was good, and in fact you could tell the writer and director truly loved the original material. Like he'd taken cliff notes after a quick viewing. They treated it with respect and made something different, but that could also stand on its own two feet. The actors were just awful. They were boring and generic. The lead woman was probably my favorite, and in my opinion she carried the movie. The direction was horrendous. It was shot way too dark, and suffered from many of the stereotypical film techniques of today's horror. This was a completely different movie with references to evil dead crammed into the movie. It was all too bland and BORING! My thought on it was why even call this an evil dead move? Without the cabin and chainsaw it's just another generic horror film. The props on the set were probably the only connection to the original."

","I saw the first two original Evil Dead installments on VHS as a teenager, and Army Of Darkness later, while serving in the Military. I went to the see the latter in the neighborhood of fifteen times - yes I am huge fan of the trilogy and Bruce Campbell. <br/><br/>To begin with, what was most lacking in this remake? Why, Bruce Campbell of course. He alone carried all three original films with his uncanny but indescribable cartoon like manner. Frankly, in my opinion he was the core of each campy moment and scene of those low budget cult masterpieces. <br/><br/>Budget. I was initially pleased with the grainy, gritty look of the film until I realized that while well funded, the producers would go out of their way to force the feeling and appearance that their remake was done on a budget similar to the original - which I believe was very low even for the time. So what we have here is well funded, over advertised art imitating low budget B movie awesomeness. Well, in this case as in most, the pretender lost out.<br/><br/>Character development? There was none. First rule of fiction: make your readers, your viewers, your audience care about at least one of your characters. Why? So we the consumer of the fiction have some kind of stake invested in the outcome. How do you get your audience on the edge of their seats if all of your characters are as lifeless as plywood?<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell? No he is not in this film nor did the casting people attempt to procure a B.C. look or act alike. A grave mistake. So that is strike two - the absence of noticeable or memorable acting in any form. Who were those people up on the screen, and why would any of us care what horrible gory fate befall them?<br/><br/>The original Evil Dead was intended to be campy, comedic, light yet gory in a stop motion animation sort of way. I came away from viewing the original all those years back with the realization that Sam Raimi had not intended to scar my young mind at the time with ultra realistic reproduction of traumatic gory injuries. No, the gore in the original was intended to be creepy but tragicomic and funereal. In this remake, the writer/director whomever just wanted to assault your senses and no child of mine would be let close to a viewing of this slag fest that takes itself far too seriously and elides humor in any form. Strike three.<br/><br/>To sum up, events in the film go from normal to just plain ""how did that happen?"" weird without any kind of explanation or entertaining transition. Did they innocently, unwittingly play a recording of a recital of the demonic passages? Nope. Some dude in the movie actually reads them aloud for no apparent reason. He just does and then only much later makes some kind of connection. <br/><br/>In essence, this horrid and stinking remake banks on the fact that you're a fan and that you've seen the original because that is the only way you would fully understand what is happening from scene to scene once the evil is unleashed. <br/><br/>Boo! Did I scare you? No? Well neither will Evil Dead the gory for no good reason remake. Is it the most terrifying film you will ever see? Only if you drop a hundred bucks on tickets and popcorn and nachos, etc. when you go to see it. Please spare your wallet the horror.<br/><br/>Oh, yeah. Apparently the new Ash is female ... self amputee and all. Hail to the stupidity!"

","This film is not worth seeing. First of all, for being ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience."", it was not scary at all. I was more scared by Disney's Bambi than this movie. Another problem is that there was not one moment where I could not see what was coming. It was incredibly predictable. The effects do look great, and are the only thing that merit a 3/10 review. Some scenes were utterly disgusting and stupid. A lot in this movies was laughable, It's almost as if they were begging to be mocked by Scary Movie 5. The characters are OK, but there isn't much bond built between them and the audience. Most things that happen are ridiculous. At one point a man is stabbed directly in the heart, shot with nails, and then continues to survive for 40 more minutes in the movie. There was no tension, just death, more death, blood vomit, creepy voices, death, blood, death. THAT'S THE WHOLE MOVIE, no buildup at all. The music half the time was a rip-off Hans Zimmer and the other half was a incredibly annoying WWII bomb siren. Did not feel original at all, very generic, possibly the least original movie I've seen in a long time. So in review, if you like not at all scary movies, with annoying music, disgusting violence, stupid demons and characters, and wasting $10 to see it in theaters, by all means see this movie."

I don't accept that and I just love this movie a lot and I admit it for real. I've watched the original and the original was a classic and scary Horror movie this movie is just like the original and it keeps the spirit of the original a lot plus the movie is full of violence that is nasty and super gory at the exact same time. Plus the other good things about Evil Dead is the haunting settings of the film. The soundtrack of the movie and last but not least the special and practical effects are so wonderful and there is no CGI used in the movie at all which I liked a lot and there are gallons of effects that are well used and effective plus the gore is super cool and awesome at the same time and the blood is so nasty and extreme at the same time. Kudos also to the haunting atmosphere and the performances of the casts and Jane Levy did a good job with her role as Mia the main character of the film and she's so gorgeous for one reason.

( In fact, Raimi and his star of that film, Bruce Campbell, are co-producers of this update, so much of this new film's flaws belong to them too.)<br/><br/>The original film had lousy acting, a dumb script, and bad production values, but it also brought with it the innovative director's keen vision and camera-work, plus some wit, to redeem its bloody limitations. This new reincarnation, directed by Fede Alvarez, essentially follows that story with some interesting tweaking, but it sorely lacks the humor and real suspense of its predecessor. However, what is doesn't lack is Alvarez's inventive ways to systematically dispose of his young victims and his obsession with more detailed close-ups of grisly deaths and dismemberment. ( Alvarez does seem to have an unhealthy and morbid obsession with tongues in this version.) Entertainment to some, but for me, not very satisfying. ( But then, I never much liked mincemeat either.)<br/><br/>For those who may not know the basic plot, it goes like this: Five friends go to that cabin in the woods and find a heavy flesh-bound volume entitled The Book of the Dead, where upon these sacrificial lambs unleash those evil spirits that will later maim and torture them. ( Right away, the savvy moviegoer begins to wonder the I.Q. of these people, but we go along with the premise anyway. It's all par for the course. )<br/><br/>The acting is still less than stellar, with the exception of Jane Levy as Mia, who comes to this remote forest via intervention for her drug abuse. ( This is one of the few revamped touches that improves upon the original version. adding some logical sense to the story. When she starts hearing voices and seeing things, the others really don't know if she is hallucinating or possessed. ) Needless to say, they begin to find out, one by one.<br/><br/>This downgraded version trades its cleverness for graphic torture scenes involving all sorts of tools to aid in the increasing body count: pliers, box cutters, nail guns, meat slicers, machetes, the tried-and-true chainsaw, etc. ( ACE Hardware really should have paid for the product endorsement rights. ) Yet the real horror in horror films these days is the latest advances in state-of-the-arts technology in its bloodcurdling realism. The filmmakers had nary an ounce of creativity or humor added to their new revision, rarely straying from the formulaic plot structure or improving upon the earlier film. But they seem to pool all their skills to gleefully share in their bloody pound of flesh. Self-mutilation has never looked so darn good! ( I have to say that I turned away from the screen numerous times to avert the violent onslaught of carnage on the screen. It is an understatement to say that this film is not for the squeamish.)<br/><br/>Evil Dead (2013) slaughters the essence of its original source to satiate today's modern movie-going audience's thirst for blood and gore. Less is more, but that old adage is too often forgotten by filmmakers and producers and far away from the clichéd nowadays.<br/><br/>Perhaps, the next sequel ( and yes, there will be another in this series ) should be titled: Evil Dead 2: Pardon Me Sir, Is That a Chainsaw in Your Hand, or Are You Just Happy to See Me? GRADE: C-<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"

","Okay first things first. All sour fanboys who say that this does not pay homage to the original. What movie did you see? Everything in it was a homage to Evil dead. Didn't you guys see the car or the chainsaw did you not hear the old text when Mia breaks the window. You shouldn't smoke or drink as much before seeing a movie.<br/><br/>It takes a lot for me to cringe while watching a movie and this one did that several times. Really anyone who gives this less than an 8 can not appreciate something made with great commitment. When i was young like 15 years old i saw the original which i loved instantly. This is in my top ten instantly too if only for the great practical FX. Something special was made here and anyone who says different is WRONG.<br/><br/>I must admit there are some stupid things like the self made defibrillator and other but that ending just was a perfect 'abomination'.........<br/><br/>See it<br/><br/>On the big silver screen."
"garofolon","10","57","112","7 May 2013"," For a certain set of fans, this is heaven
","I hate to do this but I guess in the interest of fairness and objectivity I should begin by saying that the IMDb rating is probably more accurate than my own. That's because for most people, you will either love it or hate it. It's pure indulgence, all gore and very little in the way of character development (especially the character Natalie, I kept forgetting she was even there for the first half of the film). But it rises above others in this genre by foregoing the usual fake looking CG effects in favor of classic f/x makeup and camera tricks. This adds greatly to the drama by making the feel of the film more edgy and while there are very few ""scary"" moments the overall effect is 90min of unnerving action. This is a must see film for any horror fan, which almost sounds like blasphemy considering its a remake! But it never tries to copy the original, it simply pays humble homage to it. It even expands upon the mythology. My suggestion is to see this before it leaves theaters. There's nothing quite like seeing a great horror film with a crowd of people. Hearing all the laughs, the screams, and the gasps of disgust as everyone collectively refrains from vomiting is an experience worth the hefty ticket price."
"themissingpatient","1","63","125","4 July 2013"," Evil Dead: Twilight Edition
","A Hollywood remake of the indie low-budget classic horror film that introduced the world to Sam Raimi didn't need to be done. Unfortunately fans of the original, despite their disgust at the idea of a remake, are not going to be able to keep their curiosity from leading them to watch it. We hope that maybe, just maybe, this new Evil Dead will be the same woods and same cabin but new characters to become their victims. We hope that it will enhance the original or that this new director will make it more bloody and brutally extreme, as Alexandre Aja did with The Hills Have Eyes.<br/><br/>The new Evil Dead begins by trying to give the cabin a reason for feeling haunted with an out-of-place back-story in the vein of The Exorcist. Not the original Exorcist but one of the sequels or even the prequel. A little girl is burned alive and shot in the head by her father. Sound horrific? It would have been if the special effects used to create the scene were at least a little better than something out of a Silent Hill video game. The horrible CG after effects make the scene a joke. This also takes away one of the key elements that made the cabin such a mysteriously cold and uncomfortable place. Instead of leaving it's audience to use our own imagination for possible reasons this place is so uninviting, we now have a reason and that reason isn't anything better or scarier than not knowing anything at all.<br/><br/>After the opening title we are introduced to Mia and her friends. Turns out Mia is a drug addict and has come to this cabin with her friends, one of them being a nurse, to over-come her addiction cold turkey. Why has this become a good reason for going to a cabin in the woods in horror films? Anyone who has survived withdrawal from any substance between heroin to crack-cocaine knows that this is the dumbest idea anyone could ever think of. But as in the original Evil Dead films, it's not like anyone with any brains has ever bothered to try to stay in this cabin. This can be forgiven. What can't be forgiven is that this cabin is sitting on a sound stage and the forest surrounding is fake. If there is one thing that truly elevates horror it is reality. In the original, the forest set the mood and the trees were characters. It brought a very real feeling of solitude only found in nature and that feeling came through the screen. It added an eerie presence. Shooting a cabin in the woods horror movie on a sound stage is treating your audience like children going to see a family-friendly fantasy film. The director might as well slap us in the face and call us stupid.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez tries to get serious with over-dramatic scenes that are so poorly written and executed they wouldn't even pass in a network television drama. The acting and dialogue are something more suited for the Disney channel. These scenes that are suppose to give us insight into these characters are something only children under the age of 12 years old would believe. Is this not an R-rated extreme horror film for mature audiences? Alvarez doesn't seem to know the difference. Perhaps he should go work for the Disney Channel and leave the horror genre alone.<br/><br/>When we do get some practical effects with the gore, it is not anything we haven't seen before and seen done better. The few jump scares are forced and it seems as if Alvarez is desperate to use every trick in the book to try to scare us. The thing is, if it's in the book it means it's been done before so no matter how hard you try or how many different techniques you steal from other films, it still doesn't fool anyone who knows the genre. Shiloh Fernandez is one of the worse actors I've seen on-screen in a long time. If the filmmakers wanted to cater to Twilight crowds, why not just throw Taylor Lautner in the film? He would have done a better job acting than Fernandez anyway.<br/><br/>In the end it is not an unseen force or presence lingering in the woods that has been awoken by a foolish character reading from the book of the dead. In Alvarez's vision, it's something that looks like an Asian ghost girl from Ju-On: The Grudge, which we got used to seeing back in 2004 and is far from scary now.<br/><br/>For fans of the original Evil Dead films, this will be as horrible of an experience as it was for Star Wars fans to witness The Phantom Menace or Indiana Jones fans to watch The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. This new Evil Dead is nothing short of a movie abortion. You won't see more horribly written and performed dramatic scenes aimed at a mature audience on-screen. As for the director, Fede Alvarez should not only never be allowed to work in any aspect of the film industry, he should be taken to Guantanamo Bay for 3 years of torture followed by a slow and painful death. Any critic who gave this film a positive review should be fired and publicly shamed because they are the reason this industry is dying."

","Woah!!<br/><br/>I was blown away by this film! The trailer, for once! Didn't give any of the gory bits away! I mean it was just spectacular! I can't remember the last time I seen a viscous, dark scary intense film like this! It was just amazing!!<br/><br/>The opening was ace! The Abomination of the girl getting burned from the start by her father & her threatening him before she dies when he then shoots her with a shotgun! Then the opening title 'Evil Dead' appearing on screen! Epic!!<br/><br/>I also liked how the story starts off with Mia getting increasingly stressed through out the film & things rapidly spiralling out of control! Eric & David go into the basement only find animals hanging from barb wire & a book which Eric, so foolishly reads the chant, to reawaken the demons! Then things really get nasty!! When Mia says they'll all die! I was like! This'll be great!<br/><br/>The blood was just top notch! I mean the bits I really liked were when Mia Cut her tongue in half with the Stanley knife! Man that was ace! When Natalie got possessed & started shooting both David & poor Eric who had been ripped to shreds by her & Olivia who had previously (after cutting her mouth open with a knife which was jaw droppingly wicked!!) stabbed Eric in the chest, then he fell back & hit his back on the toilet seat, then she stabbed him repeatedly with a syringe!! Just epic! Then Eric killing her with a piece of the toilet lid & causing her head to be splattered all over the floor! Natalie then getting dragged into the basement! Then the Stanley knife cutting through the tongue which I just mentioned! Then Mia who is now possessed threatening David & calling him a f**king idiot & Saying his sister is getting raped in hell! Badass line! Natalie cutting off her arm after being bitten from Mia when her wound becomes infected! Extremely gory!!! Then her getting possessed & nail gunning David & Eric! Eric who has already sustained so much excruciating pain & suffering! When Natalie starts whacking him & David with a steel rod!! David saves Eric's ass again after he gets victimised & walloped repeatedly with the steel rod (Poor guy!)then David shoots off her arm with a shotgun & kills her right after she becomes un-possessed! Eric after saving David from getting drowned by Mia dies & gets forgotten about until then end when he comes back alive & stabs David in the neck, when David nearly kills Mia, until he dose the live burial & jump starts her heart back when the spirit 'supposingly' dies! David then shuts out Mia & he & Eric get burned to death inside the cabin which David previously soaked with petrol!<br/><br/>And just when you think it's over it rains blood & Mia & the evil spirit have a final showdown! Mia kills the spirit after it chases her through a shed, nearly stabs her with a machete! Vicious! Then Mia, chainsaws the spirits foot off & cut the spirit in half killing her! Then the rain stopping & her looking toward the sunlight & limping toward the exit in the woods!<br/><br/>Overall, a very, very , very!! Gory, viscous & epic film! Very impressed with this one! Horror fans, you won't be disappointed! Go see this film! Can't wait for Evil Dead 2! Another remake which hopefully will be good! <br/><br/>10/10"

","When I first heard that a remake of the ""Evil Dead"" was being made, I reacted in the way I always react about horror remakes. I hates the idea and cursed the idiots in Hollywood who would die if they had an original thought.<br/><br/>I started to come around to the idea after a while, however. I assumed, wrongly, that with Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert and Bruce Campbell as producers that maybe it would be unlike the other horrid remakes out there. Then came the commercial with the girl in the cellar sing songing that little creepy rhyme. <br/><br/>I liked the rhyme because that is what horror is. Horror is not monsters making you jump or excess blood all over the place. True horror is subtlety. True horror takes something that by all means should not be scary and makes it scary. True horror lies in the rhymes and the stories we tell each other as kids. <br/><br/>So when the credits ran and this scene did not even appear in the movie, I was ready to explode. This movie was not clever. It was not scary. It was not creepy. It was nothing but excessive gore for gore's sake. <br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"" are two of the truly most brilliant and scary movies ever made. To this day I am still will not go into a fruit cellar after seeing Henrietta burst out of the fruit cellar floor. But what these original movies had were low budget film makers who made excellent films out of love and desire of the material.<br/><br/>You cannot take a movie that takes place in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, add huge production values and blood and expect it to come anywhere near the ""Evil Dead."" The existence of this dreadful piece of garbage is sad and they need to bury it for good."
"MrGKB","4","33","61","31 May 2013"," It's official: I have matured...
","...to the point where a gore-fest like this reset of ""The Evil Dead"" series failed to impress me. Sadly, mindless Grand Guignol appears to be still popular, and the profit margin of this one will undoubtedly spawn a sequel. More's the pity. Truthfully, the ensemble acting from a quintet of relative unknowns is passable, the DP work from Kiwi Aaron ""Spartacus: War of the Damned"" Morton is quite nice, and certainly the goo and gristle are up to snuff (been looking for a place to stick that pun for awhile), but unfortunately it's all in the service of tyro auteur Fede ""Yes, my first feature film!"" Alvarez' pedestrian script and workmanlike-at-best direction. Others are apparently also to blame for the script, including Diablo ""Juno"" Cody, and likely should be held equally responsible---small recompense to the viewer, though.<br/><br/>After a pointless prologue that could have easily been dealt with in a one-minute flashback, the story (such as it is) settles into an uninspiring realm of hack work, providing nothing in the way of interesting characters to latch onto and even less in the way of surprises, tension and---most important---scares. The film's tagline is sad example of hyperbole and hubris; the only thing terrifying about this misfire is that so many people fell for the hype, and now we'll have to put up with another one down the line. Gone are virtually any traces of what made Raimi's original film memorable, mostly a sense of humor and the spark of genuine imagination. Alvarez' ""Evil Dead"" is deadly serious and deadly intent on making money from an indiscriminate audience, which renders it deadly dull.<br/><br/>Let's put it this way: when several of the main characters purportedly wait ""all morning"" for the rest of their party to arrive at a remote cabin without any of them bothering to check and see if they can actually get in the place, only to discover upon that arrival that the door has already been breached by forced entry...well, you know as an audience that your intelligence and willful suspension of disbelief are not going to be respected, and that all the homages and references to the original film aren't going to make a bit of difference.<br/><br/>I shudder to think what sort of self-congratulatory extras are going to be in the BluRay/DVD release. They're certainly going to be more entertaining (but not in a good way) than this hapless remake of a classic lo-fi horror movie that should have been left alone.<br/><br/>8.27.13 edit: Against my better judgment, I revisited this one on DVD (okay, fine, it was from the library, shoot me) and stand by everything I said above. Thankfully, the three promo featurettes were not, as I had feared, overly self-congratulatory, and actually left me feeling a little more charitable toward the writer/director and his leading lady, but none of them altered my opinion of the film itself. ""Evil Dead"" is make-work, Sturgeon's Revelation all the way."

","Oh my God !!! What can I really say about this terrible film Just for the record I have seen the original many times and this remake well please read on...... This apart from the obvious Necronomicon link and the fast camera through the 'eerie woods' scenes could have actually being any low budget horror romp for a Friday night. Even the 'undead face appearing from under the basement' scene was less scary than the original. This is a total waste of time even on a weekday night with a few beers you'll find yourself ignoring the film and having a chat with your mam on the phone instead (sometimes far scarier!) There are so many remakes which do not make the grade this is one of them. Read one review said that the original was to cheesy well sorry 14 yo you should be in bed for ten at the latest anyway. Poor film, poor actors (high school jocks and nerd stoner with long hair..beards, some girls boring boring boring) Watch the original have a laugh with some beers and some girls and enjoy the scary bits. Or watch remakes of Hills have Eyes far superior. This is just my opinion...make your own minds up !"

","On a scale of 1 to 10, ""Evil Dead"" would be ranked somewhere in the middle. It wasn't good, but it wasn't horrendous either. It was a mediocre film when considering the standards for its genre. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Fede Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" didn't really have enough depth to make us properly feel anything for its characters. The attempt at a slightly emotional and connected character story is to be applauded; however, it still seemed to fall flat in many areas.<br/><br/>The beginning starts off with a recount of what happened earlier (perhaps a few years, but it's not clear) and a foreshadowing of what's to come. After, we cut to a cabin in the middle of the woods (because that's usually how the monsters, demons, and ghosts keep you away from civilization). Mia (Jane Levy) is trying to detox after a long battle with drug abuse with the help of her brother David and friends Eric, Olivia, and Natalie (Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore).<br/><br/>The friends find an evil book in a basement filled with dead cats. Curiosity getting the better of him, Eric reads an incantation from the book. Of course, once this happens, the rest of the film becomes a tiring wait to see who dies first. <br/><br/>A demon is summoned and possesses Mia and then systematically begins trying to possess and kill everyone else. It isn't really scary as much as it is extremely disgusting. There is plenty of gore, cutoff extremities, and creepy sounds that are pretty on par with several other horror movies. Unfortunately, ""Evil Dead"" doesn't harbor any story surprises and becomes really tedious as the same thing happens to each character and you're left wondering if the movie is over yet. <br/><br/>Elizabeth Blackmore's character is only there to serve as one of the souls that the demon must feast upon in order to rise. She has a few speaking lines and her best performance comes from the scene where she shoots her friends with a nail gun. All the character decisions at some point leave you shaking your head at their illogical actions and occasionally even the dialogue is lackluster.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" only really makes sense in regards to why the demon chooses to possess Mia and not anyone else. Besides the obvious case of being the nearest one, Mia has the weakest will of all her friends and the demon catches her at a particularly vulnerable moment. On the other hand, the reason for the demon's existence or why it needs to possess a certain number of people is never explained nor is the reason why they decided to remake Sam Raimi's ""The Evil Dead"" in the first place. <br/><br/>All in all, if you enjoy horror movies, a lot of blood and some creepy scenes, then ""Evil Dead"" is for you. Just remember not to expect too much out of it. <br/><br/>Grade: 2 out 5 Stars<br/><br/>www.themovieexaminer.com"

","Alright alright, we all know Evil Dead is and will always be one of the greatest horror films ever. As amazing as it is, it certainly has some inadvertently hilarious moments that could be improved on, made more serious, done with modern brutality, whatever. This is what we all hoped was being done with this remake. That is not what was done with this remake.<br/><br/>My gripes (some mild spoilers): <br/><br/>No tension. I just didn't feel it. Everything was OK, then it wasn't, and the characters just sort of rolled with it almost like it was expected.<br/><br/>No insanity. The constant mad cackling of the original is harrowing. These ""Evil Dead"" chumps just kinda come at you, not much talk and no laughs. They didn't seem that scary.<br/><br/>No actual ""Evil Dead"" at all. With the exception of one character, NO ONE in this remake dies and then becomes ""the Evil Dead"", which is sort of um...why they called the movie that. The shmoes in the remake become possessed, and then go ape sh*t. Only one of them actually dies and becomes the Evil Dead. Hmm...<br/><br/>The plot and ""rules system"" of this movie is a hot mess. They mention 3 specific ways to kill those who have become possessed...and then use them only occasionally. One chick goes down after having her head bashed in with the back of a toilet, another after getting shot in the face with a bunch of nails and getting her arm blown off. Also, right at the beginning we see one get knocked out by a shotgun stock to the head. Knock out a Deadite with a blow to the head!? Ridiculous. We know this, don't we?<br/><br/>Who the hell are those dummies in the opening scene? What's up with the freaks? Who is that lady and what language was she speaking and why!? Then after handling business quite nicely, they WRAP THE BOOK IN PLASTIC AND BARBED WIRE AND LEAVE IT THERE!? Good lawd. Someone should have second drafted the script and made some sense of something, somewhere, anywhere.<br/><br/>I'm not even sure what that was that crawled out of the ground at the end. Big villain? Seriously, what was it? It wasn't scary. Some skinny chick with no nipples...I would have preferred the black guy with the candle on his head from the book illustrations. Yikes...<br/><br/>Replacing the Lovecraftian horror of the original with the whole Satan thing was so weak it was sad. The book wasn't scary anymore, or mysterious and strange and ancient. It felt like some crappy Satanist's book printed in the 80s. WTF? And dude wasted no time at all reading the passages aloud, for not even a shred of a decent reason other than he was written to.<br/><br/>No one would be dumb enough to think that you could defrib someone with a car battery, jumper cables, and some hypodermic needles. No one.<br/><br/>I agree with whoever else said that the only thing they felt for any of the characters was a hope that the brother would kill that ho and get out of there so the movie could end.<br/><br/>OK, the few things I liked about it:<br/><br/>The look of it. I dug it. And the presentation of the gore. Dug it. The scene with the burning tree and the gravedigging looked great. The rain at the end was great, and a nice attempt at trying to top the broken pipe in the basement of the original film.<br/><br/>The two male actors were fantastic, I thought, and really carried what little weight the movie had. I thought they were both just excellent.<br/><br/>Well, that's it. I'm done burning this halfassery."

No, seriously, they can take a lot! - if you are bringing someone to life don't bother to pull off the bag on their head. - of course that you can make defibrillator from anything in the shack. - if hot water burn your body don't worry, just bury yourself.

","After seeing The Cabin In the Woods and hearing about The Evil Dead being remade, like most fans of THE Evil Dead, I was pretty excited. Surely, the screenwriters would dig deep into the bowels of their creativity and give us something fresh like what Josh Wheadon and Drew Goddard did for The Cabin in the Woods. Nope. <br/><br/>Evil Dead got bad from the time it was established that Mia's drug problem was the back drop for the trip to the cabin. That's waay too serious of a topic to be the set up for a movie like The Evil Dead which never took itself serious and in not taking itself serious, the audience was able to believe the absurdity and laugh at it. <br/><br/>Yes, THE Evil Dead was hilarious, remember? The humor came out of the situation, watching Ash and Scott trying to kill the demons was hilarious. The demons themselves were hilarious. Evil Dead....not one chuckle. And don't give me this crap about ""dark"" humor. Humor means you laugh, period. Whether it's dark or light, funny means you laughed. But there's blood...a whooole lot of blood. Note to producers/director- blood does not equal scary. Screenwriters-who am I rooting for in this poor excuse for a remake? I wanted Mia to die and her brother to kill her, for real, and survive. Maybe that's just me thinking David was going to take the Ash role and end up fighting off the demons...maybe wind up in a portal to another time a place. Oh wait, that's another movie."

","Before I begin my review, I just want to say that I was one of the few who is a fan of the originals, who looked forward too/had an open mind about this remake/reboot/re-visioning (whatever the hell you perceive it to be). Let me also add that I did not let it affect me to bash this movie simply because there was no Bruce Campbell in the starring role or Sam Raimi to direct it. <br/><br/>With the title of this review being said, This movie was HORRIBLE. When I say it fell flat on all aspects I truly mean it. <br/><br/>1. Story. The good part is its a story of 5 friends that go to a cabin in the woods. Not for the partying and fun like the original. The main character, David, goes to this retreat in the hopes of helping his sister become clean of drugs. it is then you find out it this cabin is a place where a lot of their childhood took place, but when their mother died, the less and less they visited and became a place where locals came to perform an exorcism on a local girl who was possessed by demons that surrounded the forest.That is where David along with friend Eric, discover under the storage cellar, where ritual took place because of constantly smelling an odor. That is where they discover a room where Carcasses of cats were hanging. They come across a book that is wrapped up in a trash bag, and tightly wound Barbed wire. eager to find out what it is Eric discovers it is the book of the dead. He reads a summon out loud (Even though the book clearly states that no one should even acknowledge it.) which wakens the demon. which (of course) possesses Mia (the recovering drug addict.) so when weird things start happening to her of course everyone makes it out to be her withdrawal that are making her neurotic. OK that's enough. I don't really have to go any further for you to guess what happens. that being said that is pretty much the same premise as the original. Although there is similarities, over all it falls short of inspiring. the movie moves at a pace where you watch about 40 minutes of it and you still don't know any of the characters names, or even want to care about them. There was absolutely no substance to the story telling. maybe that's because you focus so much on the original, or because this writer/director just butchered the hell out of this remake to make it his own, you just stop caring and you just want to get to the good stuff<br/><br/>2. Special effects (""the good stuff"") The great thing about the original was the low budget and the on screen effects that Raimi used. Well obviously the bigger the budget, the more fun you can have right? I read other reviews, where people said what makes this movie great is the on screen effects and the minimal use of CGI. Whoever said this is a joke all in its own. The on screen effects were just as bad if not worse the actual good abundance of CGI used. The CGI used looked so fake and cheesy, I cant believe other viewers looked at it as if they couldn't notice. The overuse of fake blood made this movie go from bad to worse. <br/><br/>3. What they did right Believe me when I say this. There was very, and I mean very little that they did right. there was minor homage to the original, like the random appearances of the ""boom stick,"" Ash's chainsaw hand, the cameraman running though forest representing the presence of the demon. But honestly that is all I can think of. <br/><br/>My conclusion? Skip it. I literally asked myself: What the hell did I just watch? You would think if you were pay any homage to the original by making a remake or reboot, you do it the right way. But in a sense, is there really a right way to do a reboot? rarely anyone walks out of the theater satisfied. They just get mad that someone tried to fix something that did not need fixing. I know the reason for remakes, but i laughed at all the teenagers that walked out of the theater saying how horrifying the movie was. Some of which never knew this was a remake of an old movie. like I did through out this movie all I did was laugh and shake my head. Skip it save your money. Pop in the original and appreciate it."
"don_hilyer","1","65","131","11 April 2013"," Why Sam Raimi, WHY???
","I must say that when I first saw that a remake was being done for this movie I was, to say the least, very excited. I am a true fan of the original movie and own the other two follow on movies. When the movie was released I rushed out to the theater to view, what I was hoping would be, a brilliant remake of a cult classic. After a short period of viewing I was becoming disenchanted but decided to stick to my guns and hope for the best, a decision that I would later regret. All I can say is that I have lost 91 minutes of my life that I will never get back. I was very disappointed with the remake of this movie. It did at times have moments that looked as though it was going to turn around and get better but alas it never did, at least for me anyway. All I can say is that Sam Raimi should be slapped for destroying what has become over the years a huge cult film."
"smithyofhersoul","1","69","140","19 April 2013"," Dim-witted dubebro schlock
","You know how some films are so bad, they back unwittingly into genius? Well, this rehash of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' is definitely not one of them. The only thing this film backs unwittingly into is dim-witted, wooden dudebro schlock, so profoundly disengaging and ultimately unsatisfying that at one point I actually started composing haiku to its monumental awfulness on my mobile phone.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm a little bias: I've got to admit I find scenes of violence towards women rather hard to take, and the horror-genre's disproportionate fondness for them, kind of troubling. I must make a distinction here, though, between violence justified by narrative and handled with tension, realism and empathy; and the violence of your typical 'torture porn' which is unmotivated, unrelenting and gleefully gratuitous. 'Evil Dead' falls into this latter category with the hollow splash of a turd landing in a hot-tub.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I love the horror genre; that's why this kind of hackneyed nonsense is so depressing. And I had hopes too. I even dared to dream that this remake might improve upon or address some of things that bothered me about the original. Nope. How wrong can a person be? What distinguished Raimi's 'Evil Dead' was its inventive playfulness; a kind of B-movie shoe-string baroque. Silly, unquestionably, and of its time (with all the sexploiation undertones that this implies) absolutely, but a credible achievement nonetheless for its day. It was eager and engaging and weird as all get out. It didn't take itself too seriously either; it had (odd as this may sound) a quirky, dirty charm to it, and so a person was more willing to go with Raimi (and Campbell) and just ride the wave.<br/><br/>It's successor, though? Honestly, I don't even know where to start. The acting was unforgivably bad. And no, I'm not about to tell you that Bruce Campbell bestrode the known Thespian world like a colossus, but I am saying that when Alvarez decided to raise the emotional register and stakes of the film (Jane Levy's character, 'Mia' going cold turkey, the uneasy relationship between Mia and her estranged brother David, played by Shilho Fernandez) he needed to be sure that he had actors who could pull it off... He didn't. The supporting performances were risibly insipid and undistinguished, but in all fairness to Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore they didn't have much to do but shout and die, horribly. Lou Taylor Pucci fares a little better, in that he actually gets to do a bit of toothless and unconvincing dudebro bonding, and display some actual emotions (fear, annoyance, and what is maybe meant to be confusion) before dying, horribly.<br/><br/>Sigh. To be honest, though, and to give the actors the benefit of the doubt, the dialogue was so silted and lacklustre, the characterisation so minimal and so poor, that there was really very little they could have done with it. Mia was the only protagonist with even so much as a semi-fleshed-out back-story or any distinguishing traits at all, and thus the only one of five (if you don't count the dog) who it was remotely possible to care about in any way. It's probably for this reason alone that Jane Levy's performance wasn't as abysmally bad as her co-stars.<br/><br/>The 'plot' really wasn't much better. What I'd hoped for, and what the trailers, and the way the film was being talked-up, seemed to suggest, was that this version would elaborate and lend substance to the more interesting and off-the-wall aspects of the original story... It doesn't... In any way... Shape... Or form. All it does is rehash the same scenarios, while sloshing round plenty of self-indulgent school-boy gore, with scant regard for things like basic human biology, the tensile strength of metals (hands are not detachable, electric carving knives can't cut through bone, car batteries are not a valid substitute for a defibrillator), or the dignity of women (yes, that scene is still there and still as well-handled as ever, also: nail gun to the face). And yeah, I get that the original had moments of utter idiocy, but what is forgivable in the context of a seventies b-movie, is not so acceptable to the twenty-first century sensibility, not with the bloated budgets of most modern horrors. What directors of such films would do well to realise is that a 'remake' doesn't just mean 'the same but bloodier'. To be truly credible, relevant and engaging to today's more sophisticated- jaded even- pallet, you need to bring a new dimension to the story, at the very least you need to tell it better. Rob Zombie's 'Halloween' franchise does this; Alexandre Aja's take on 'The Hills Have Eyes' wasn't a total loss either. In a cultural climate all ready saturated with better examples of the 'remake' genre Alvarez's film looks like little more than a cynical attempt to cash in on a trend. It evinces little love for the original, or for the poor audience who forked over time and money they won't get back to go and see this execrable bunkum.<br/><br/>I wanted to like this film, I really did, but can only see it appealing to teenage boys, or boy-children of limited intelligence and sensitivity."

","Evil Dead? More like Abysmal Dead! Terrifying? No but the popcorn prices gave me a shock! This movie is shameful with no redeeming features of any kind.

This utter pile of a movie is slow and disjointed, featuring a cast displaying little or no involvement in events going on around them. It lacks any kind of momentum or crescendo.

"marktarnovetsky","4","81","167","6 April 2013"," pointless
","OK time for my summary of this thing. <br/><br/>well, the one thing it had going for it was the near absence of comedy/parody, which has absolutely no place in the horror genre. it also had some decent production value (photography, lighting, and editing) <br/><br/>more importantly though, this is a movie for an immature audience who'se only pay off comes in which way the chainsaw will be used to dismember a body on screen. <br/><br/>this film has no heart, non existent characters and stupid dialogue. <br/><br/>they could had greatly improved this film by dropping the whole failed notion that gore = fun, and focusing itself on the addiction of the lead character. by taking the proper steps to flesh out the paranoia and discomfort of the drug addiction maybe we could actually care about the brother/sister relationship, alas, the characters exist only to fuel childish desires to see them cut limb from torso. this movie needed to be MUCH darker, mature, and impart the seriousness of violence and how disgusting and horrific it really is, however, since the characters do not follow any arc in any sensical manner all that was left in this shell of a movie is its blood and guts, and without a heart or a point, why should we care? <br/><br/>all in all. a pointless endeavour. <br/><br/>4/10"
"KineticSeoul","4","52","103","8 April 2013"," Not a worthy remake
","Usually good or even great remakes go in a different direction but has certain similarities to the point you can call it a remake but better or at least as good or even near good. Or go in a similar direction but has it's own flare for it to be worth a remake. But that really isn't the case for this one. All of the characters in this combined just couldn't replace Bruce Campbell as Ash. And never felt even remotely attached to any of them. It's 2013 and it there is better technology to make things appear real. And although the original ""Evil Dead 1 and 2"" lacked the technology and looks fake in certain areas. It's just a more scary and suspenseful movie, plus it's even creepy and has uncomfortable dark humor to go with it. This remake lacks everyone of these elements. Sure it has more graphic imagery that is cringe worthy and I did cringe during few scenes. Although I have seen even more graphic movies before. But I never felt like I was entertained or scared. And I do think this movie's tagline is false, it's just isn't all that terrifying. The beginning few minutes starts out well and eerie but it quickly becomes dull. I just don't get the constant positive reviews this movie is getting. It's actually somewhat of a hit at box office so there will be a sequel but currently just isn't interested or hyped for it. I think I rather re-watch the whole original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Or just re-watch ""The Cabin in the Woods"" which the makers of this movie was probably inspired by because of it's success. Although ""The Cabin in the Woods"" was inspired by many many different horror movies. The thing is Sam Raimi actually help produce this movie and it is still a let down. Some things don't even make much sense near the end of the movie either.<br/><br/>4.6/10"
"doctorarzt","5","33","62","6 April 2013"," We're Gonna Get You ... NOT!
","I'm a huge fan of the original, but not so much of this remake. I'll disqualify myself as a zealot immediately by saying the original ""Evil Dead"" was far from perfect and the inexperience of the filmmakers—at that time—becomes more and more apparent as the film ages. But ""The"" Evil Dead didn't achieve cult status by being a great technical film. Raimi and companies weird adaptation of the narrative style of The Three Stooges turned evil, an assault of bloody and disgusting gags, is what made the film so great. It's not a terrific story. It doesn't feature terrific acting. And the makeup is pretty awful, really. And I love it. I love it for the relentless gag after gag after gag style, and the moments of photography that portent the genius to come in Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>What I had hoped from the remake was for a new film-maker to seize that raw assault on the senses aspect of Evil Dead and to turn it on a new generation. A generation that has gotten used to the camera cutting away before the really awful thing happens.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" suffers from a front loading of rationality that really kills the atmosphere. One of the best examples I can think of is the sense of isolation that permeates the first film after they discover the bridge has been destroyed in some obviously supernatural act. Also, later, one of the Cabin's captive attempts to escape through the woods only to return mortally wounded to warn of the terrors that await in the forest.<br/><br/>In ""Evil Dead"" 2013, they are trapped at the cabin by a road being washed out by a flood. Other hard edges of the supernatural are ironed out with rationality as well, most notably when Mia, the first to be possessed, is cast as a recovering heroin addict going cold turkey.<br/><br/>The rationality is certainly disarming if you are a character in the film, as a member of the audience though it comes off as a bizarre attempt to temporarily 'elevate' the narrative.<br/><br/>Even though the rationality eventually dissolves, it's too late. ""Evil Dead"" lacks the sense of supernatural captivity that the original, with all of its faults, managed to establish with simple and effective plot devices.<br/><br/>Evil Dead '13 DOES manage to establish some graphic images that will most definitely stick in the mind, so I expect it will have a lasting impact on younger audiences; but die-hard horror buffs hoping this film would help the genre get out of the wussy all-talk and no-balls trend it has been stuck in for so long might be a little disappointed."
"peterparker1219","10","40","77","2 August 2013"," Horror geeks rejoice
","This movie was a balance of a tribute to the classic, and a unique and worthy addition to the family. I think a lot of the ""horror snobs"" are just uneducated if they say this movie was a disappointment. The original evil dead was not campy, like army of darkness, or even the evil dead 2, It was creepy, innovative, and fantastically gory. This movie definitely has its share of gore and buckets of blood. Don't get me wrong I love all three of the Sam Raimi films, and he is a bit of a god in book. But I'm not going to Dis a film just because he was not directing. Fede Alvarez did a remarkable job at keeping the spirit of the original alive. While I did miss the whole Jack of clubs scene from the first, I'm glad it was not a shot by shot remake. And it has it's own share of classic moments, like the grave scene. It's not Sam, and Bruce Campbell is reduced to a end of credit shot, but bravo for having the nuts to tackle a remake of a cult classic."

"zzoaozz","4","59","119","6 April 2013"," A pretty average horror movie
","First of all, I'll address this movie on its own merit without taking into account its cult classic predecessor. <br/><br/>The acting in this one was decent though nothing special. The pacing and effects were just okay. The plot was very straight forward, no twists or surprises. There were a few really large detractors for me. The relationships between the friends seemed forced. The dead dog puppet looked so fake I almost laughed. The contraption David rigs up to defibrillate his sister back to life is completely ludicrous. All those things can be overlooked though if your expectations are not too high to begin with. It's one of those movies I would watch on late night TV if nothing better was on. <br/><br/>To compare it to the original Evil Dead:<br/><br/>There is absolutely no humor in this one at all. There are only two very thin homages to the original at the end. None of these characters have anywhere near the on screen charisma that Bruce Campbell's Ash had. The basic reason for the friends to be at the cabin and their staying when things get weird is much better in the new movie. The tree rape is in the new movie though significantly changed and very brief. <br/><br/>This new version will never be the cult classic the original was because it doesn't stand out in any way from the tons of other horror movies with the same premise. All in all it's just average."
"iamsomeonestupidjustlike","10","145","314","28 March 2013"," Pays Homage to the Original and Then Some
","This reanimated remake of the classic Evil Dead starts out a view askew from the original, but heads off into the general known storyline before things get completely out of hand. The characters get just enough back story washed over them to make the premise make sense without relying on flashbacks or any other tired story telling technique.<br/><br/>Once the action begins there isn't a drawn out waiting period between actions points but it's not all jammed down your throat like a chainsaw right at once either. It maintains a fairly good pace throughout and doesn't deviate from the story for any meaningless asides.<br/><br/>Fans of the original will be well pleased so long as they are aren't too obsessed and afraid of a little change. Newcomers completely oblivious to what they are getting themselves into will either be turned away by the blood and gore or find themselves entertained by a well spun modern retelling of Sam Raimi's cult film from 1981.<br/><br/>There were times I laughed, times I cringed, and at one point I flinched just a little bit. Granted I'm an avid horror fan so I don't jump so easily, but they got me once. If you're looking for a genuine scare, this might be the movie to do it for you. If you love gore and have been waiting on a movie that doesn't rely solely on it for 90 minutes, this might be for you. But if you take yourself too seriously and think there is no way an Evil Dead movie without Bruce Campbell could be good, just stay at home and miss out on one of the few excellent remakes ever made."

","and frightless, as well.<br/><br/>Evil Dead (2013,) the second remake of the 1981 original did have its moments and it sure as hell was creepy and bloody, but did it hold up to the original? No. Did it even come close to the lesser, though still very good Army of Darkness? Nope. But, at least it trumped the first remake, Evil Dead II.<br/><br/>It might be best to start over and not compare it to the source material(s), and let it stand on its own. Of course, even then, it was just the run-of-the-mill horror fare as of late running amok with clichés, the stereotypical young and dumb adults proving their idiocracy with every single turn and contained more gore than frights – a sign of incompetent writing in regards to horror.<br/><br/>Of course, what's scary is subjective, but I found nothing terrifying. Just a handful of bloody and gross shots and completely unrealistic endurances and actions from the living.<br/><br/>If this movie wasn't so bent on being serious – yeah, going back to the source material for a moment – and shedding its established campiness from the first three installments, I would've given it a pass. But, since it does provide us with rules for the evil spirits and ""normal ones"" for the still breathing, I had the hardest time suspending any disbelief from what these buffoons could physically do to themselves and not just survive, but thrive. And those plot holes and inconsistenciesthose were a pain to ignore as well.<br/><br/>Following an actually decent opening scene, where veteran Evil Dead fans knew how it would play out, five young adults venture to the absolute creepiest cabin this side of Jason Voorhees's shack in Friday the 13th Part 2. Naturally, no one questions this, and decide this is the best place to detox one of the fivesome.<br/><br/>Pausing a minute for character depth and who's whoOh, wait, they never did, so I don't have anything to report other than one female is another male's girlfriend and the druggie was that male's sister. Whew, by saving time to never completely introduce the main stars or establishing eventual empathy for them, it gives the writers time to get to the only reason to make this movie: gore.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, one of our ""heroes,"" a blatant (albeit terrible copy) ""Marty Mikalski"" rip off character from The Cabin in the Woods and Eric Stoltz-look alike actually named, ah-hem, Eric in the movie, reads from a book found in the cellar and our strung out female gets the Evil Dead bug. How she did, which was homage to the original The Evil Dead, was far less inventive, although it did cause a couple to get up and leave my movie theater.<br/><br/>Stopping therethe title alone should NOT fool anyone. They weren't trying to be comical, though deceiving, by naming it: A Family Fun Cabin in the Woods. What would someone possibly expect by buying a ticket to: EVIL DEAD and then getting offended by gore?<br/><br/>At any rate, you know the story, even if you hadn't seen any of the four (so far) Evil Dead films: she gets possessed, confusion ensues and death becomes them.<br/><br/>Admittedly, some of the later scenes in the movie, when the heat finally picks up, were effective and gross; even I had to turn away once. But, if you added up every scene that I thought was successful to a film in this genre, you could fit those in the final third of the trailer and save us all some time. And the lack of more original ideas pales in comparison to something (or one) else the film omitted.<br/><br/>Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not in this. Reasons of, to the date and time of this writing, are unknown to me on why not. Perhaps, again, they wanted to shift away from the camp, or he was too busy on another project or, maybe, he read the script co-written from the gal who brought usJennifer's Body. I doubt he would've been able to save this movie, but at least he would've been the highlight.<br/><br/>Final thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, nor really disliked it. Blah, yeah. Despite it being a remake, unoriginal, uh-huh. Would I want to see it again? Nope. Buteven though I would recommend any Evil Dead newbie to watch just Part 1 (1981) and Part 3 (Army of Darkness), you could do worse than this mindless splatterfest."

","When I first heard that a remake to the classic 'The Evil Dead' was in production, I was heart broken. If there's one thing I hate more than remakes, it's remakes of classic horrors I watch as a kid, and after Rob Zombies god awful attempt at 'Halloween' I had almost given up hope with modern remakes. I started to hear many good things about 'Evil Dead' but wouldn't let myself be dragged into the hype, but as a hardcore fan of the Evil Dead trilogy I had to go see it. I kept my expectations low but, wow!<br/><br/>Not only is this film a great remake, it's a great film in its own right full stop. Jane Levy's performance as Mia is fantastic both as human & deadite. It takes a lot to make me jump but this film is full of them & I can't say enough about the effects, and without cgi it's incredibly impressive. Yes there's no Ash, but does there need to be? Did you really want another man filling in the shoes of the almighty Bruce Campbell? Do we really need another 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' remake situation? Mia stand on her own feet as a new horror icon for a new generation. <br/><br/>A horror film can never be truly judged until it's 20 years old and being watched way before you should be watching it. The question is, will 'Evil Dead' still be shocking us in 20 year's? I think it will. Bring on the sequel & bring on 'Army Of Darkness 2' as an Evil Dead or a horror fan, or even just a fan of truly fantastic films, you need to watch this film.

","Personally, I thought seeing the remake to this would be great. I loved the first one and even the sequels were quite good, but this? This was a sad excuse of a movie and a terrible remake. I think the graphics even sucked. The 1981 movie had better graphics and a better story and just wasn't stupid. I felt like the actors weren't too good either. Seemed very low budget as well, which isn't a problem, but they went to far trying to make it look scary and add a lot of affects that just didn't work out. It was too animated and just didn't appeal to me or the other 5 people I watched it with. Do yourself a favor and watch the original and save yourself 2 hours and don't watch it."

","**Spoilers included if you wanted to see this garbage** Evil Dead Review: How was this movie rated so highly? Why would the ""father"" in the beginning wrap the book in a garbage bag and leave it there on a table after he ""cleansed"" his daughter? To maintain it? If he was the one who wrote all the stuff in the book, then wouldn't he of known to hide it? or perhaps bury it so people wouldn't find it? So other people wouldn't have to go through what he did. Apart from all the obvious idiot things people did in that movie; go in the basement even after they all knew Mia was possessed. How did the hatch to the basement open up after it was shut then Mia was saying she was ""locked"" down there when she wasn't. How was the blonde girl able to escape after going to the basement and being locked up from the guy simply opening the hatch? The nail gun the movie wasn't connected to anything and yet it was able to fire off nails into the people, on a note with that. Nail guns can't be used to shoot people as projectiles, even if they (she) had a second arm to hold down the safety. If this was their Grandparents/Parents place (indicated with the family pictures hung up there) then why was those whole ordeal never spoken of? Seriously? Burnt you're aunt/Mother, and nothing was said. Now I could get over that part. But what I don't understand is the ""cleansing"" part where you could bury them and they would be demon free to say the least. Why don't you bury them and then dig them back up quickly? Ta Da! Sister saved. Also Why was the long haired male in the movie not infected? I assure you that the glass used to stab him was definitely covered in blood, which would make him infected. Another huge flaw in this, at the very beginning when the long haired male says the first word (in order to summon the creature) it summons it. I know out of 7 billion people in the world, someone would of said word that in that span. At the very end, when Mia is safe and ""resurrected"" all her skin and wounds are magically healed? I never knew if you had a demon released from you then you magically get healed. I think doctors might want to look into this treatment.<br/><br/>Moral of the story; Don't be a junky or else you'll get demon creatures from hell which will possess you first. Because every demon from hell knows, junkies are the best to go after."

"daha1120","1","57","115","29 April 2013"," So Not Groovy
","Now I'm not one of those people who automatically writes off remakes. There are plenty of remakes, including a handful of horror remakes, that I would say manage to be a marked improvement over the original. The Thing (best horror remake ever), The Hills Have Eyes (not great, but still better than Wes Craven's) even Dawn of the Dead (I realize many horror fans would call that sacrilege, but its just a fact. The original had a terrible color scheme, terrible acting and was just all around Romero's weakest zombie opera until the extremely regrettable Diary of the Dead, while the remake of Dawn was really the pinnacle of the short- lived fast zombie fad.) However, this was one of the worst horror remakes I've bothered to check out. And its not because its not graphic enough (a concept more foreign to me than the director of this movie.) If modern torture porn has taught us anything, its that convincingly painful visuals aren't enough. It takes grit, imagination and a certain hard energy to really get under the skin and into the mind of its viewers. And this had none of those things. It was far too slick to feel real, the demon voices were not nearly weird and disturbing enough no matter how hard they tried to ripoff The Exorcist, and the acting was far too flat to sell either the demonic possessions or the terror that the non demonic characters were supposedly experiencing. Now I used to consider the acting to be the weakest part of the original Evil Dead, but as I was trudging through this drek, I came to find myself missing even the most obnoxious performances from the classic. Beyond that, this movie was just dumb, dumb, dumb. The original, while not being the most tightly constructed or intellectually satisfying piece of horror ever, at least didn't contain any plot holes that were too horribly glaring. This movie just didn't make sense on any level. First of all, the reason that they're in this ridiculously creepy cabin is because the main girl is trying to quit heroin cold turkey. In order to design a more terrible place to go through withdrawal, you'd have to be H.R. Giger. Then, when they find blood under the rug and a basement full of dead cats, they still don't leave. Now in the first movie, there's nothing that amiss about the cabin, and the demons are awoken when they unwittingly play a tape with the incantation. In this, the one guy looks through the book, sees a bunch of warnings covering up the words of the incantation so he pulls the old leave tracing trick to reveal them and then says them out loud even though no one else is around. Really? Who would do that? And the stupidity doesn't stop with the characters being almost cruelly moronic, it extends to other plot points as well. Such as the fact that their in a decrepit cabin in the middle of the woods, yet they're using things such as electric meat cutters and hot water. These things are totally out of place and are painfully contrived to setup the gratuitous carnage that the director was hoping would carry this turd through. Forget the fact that its more humorless than the original, as humor really didn't become as much of an element until the sequels anyway. This just needed to be effective in some way, any way, and it truly wasn't. I realize Sam Raimi wanted to finally make some real money off of the Evil Dead name, but as a producer, he could have demanded better than this. And the reason he didn't wasn't because he's lost his knack for horror (the last movie he directed was Drag Me to Hell, which was only rated PG-13 and was way more effective than this gorefest.) Groovy this is not."

Please get out of the movie business and send some of that money your losing on crap like this to people who could really use it. I think the Producer is the only Evil Dead thing about this Movie! I feel bad for the actors in this movie. No names from nowhere. Gore is not scary...and anyone who has seen The original Holloween can vouch for that!

","Lots of gore but no glory. The film has almost a similar plot to the original but doesn't have the charm. It's another Hollywood scare fest that tries to be scary but ends up being slightly predictable. I felt like some parts of the movie tried too hard to scare us and other parts felt like they didn't try hard enough. The blood and gore was enough to freak some people out but not me. I've seen a lot of scarier, bloodier, and disturbing movies in my life and this movie was as mainstream as you can get, in other words, it's what you would expect for a popcorn movie. That being said the acting was quite well and I thought they did a good job with the cast. If you're a fan of the original I recommend you wait for this and rent it. But if you really want to see this film by all means go ahead. Just don't worry about getting nightmares, you will forget about it as soon as it wears off."

She is a clear woman lead who can deliver such a variety of feelings. This movie is certainly a horror masterpiece. Maybe not in terms of plot, maybe not in acting, maybe not in the script, but the gore and the quickness of it all is really easy-going and revolutionary. I mean the make-up is just art. This movie is not at all stupid and really deserves a watch. If you encounter ANY review lower than 6 it's just because people get angry at remakes.

","Oh wow! I've never in my life been so unimpressed with a film after expectations. To get one thing straight, I was totally against the remake of THE Evil Dead from day one but come February this year a friend sent me a link to a teaser trailer...then a real trailer and I started thinking ""wait a minute...this actually looks like it...might...possibly...be...good?!?!"" Then I saw another trailer and started getting really excited. They looked like they'd genuinely made the film with a real love, understanding and loyalty to the original and suddenly I found myself genuinely looking forward to it. It was my birthday and dragged a few friends along with me to see it.<br/><br/>CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>Right from the off, I knew something was wrong. We seemed to be given some sort of exposition that while quite intriguing in a ""I want to be a Sam Raimi film"" sort of a way, didn't really add anything to the original plot. Then we meet the five teenagers after a most likely expensive helicopter tracking shot through the trees which gets away from the frightening, claustrophobic introduction of the original and instantly distances you from the actors. All five come across as annoying, stereotypical and one dimensional. None of them are drawn in interesting ways or with any degree of depth. One even moans that she ""looks like road kill"" when clearly she's dolled up and looks pretty stunning (especially for a drug addict as she's meant to be). We're also introduced to a sixth member of the party...a dog! His only function is to find the trapdoor to the cellar where the book of the dead and other such artefacts are. One can't help but wish they'd have left the dog at home, not found the trapdoor and the film have just been a drama about the lead girl getting over her drug addiction with her friends crumbling around her and struggling to help her whilst bickering with each other. <br/><br/>One of the characters decides it is a good idea to read aloud from the book despite the warnings IN THE ACTUAL BOOK telling him not to do it. I'm not kidding, they literally do say not to read any of it aloud!!! Then we proceed to the tree rape made so famous by the original, and here marred and ruined by bad CGI effects that wouldn't look out of place in an anime series. From this point onwards we're ""treated"" to various scenes that seem to plod along at an alarmingly boring pace which just keeps you thinking, ""hmmm...why didn't they just do what they did in the original?"" Everything seems to have been...not so much tamed down as simply watered down. It's as if they decided they wanted to make a really gruesome film and then at last minute just thought, actually let's not bother. It is similar to the Nightmare on Elm St remake in terms of the theory of 30 years after the original with so many more resources and a higher budget at the film-makers disposal, why do they just resort to Freddy simply 'stabbing' his victims? Where's the originality? Where's the THOUGHT? It isn't until one of the characters cuts her arm off due to it being infected (obviously a nod to ED2) that I thought to myself, ""at last, something ballsy!"" but then we get back down to the pathetic trickle trickle trickle of the dull and lifeless excuse of a plot. <br/><br/>The film's main issues are that there isn't really a start, middle and end. It just seems to be a bunch of stuff that happens at various intervals without picking up any momentum. Also, as much as it tries to offend or disgust with all of it's tongue slicing, arm tearing and nail gun firing, it just isn't effective. It isn't until the last 15 minutes when we're treated to a good old bit of chainsaw wielding carnage that anything remotely viscerally exciting happens, and even that is overshadowed by the fact that the character using the chainsaw seems to be far from concerned about the injury they've just sustained, by all accounts shouldn't be alive, shouldn't be able to talk and should be covered in blisters from an earlier encounter with a boiling hot shower. Also we never fully understand who or what it is that she is attacking the chainsaw with and by this point...who really cares? <br/><br/>I have honestly NEVER been so disappointed with a film in my life. This is not a harsh exaggeration. This is a genuine feeling of hatred for a film I believe to be worse than the Nightmare on Elm St and The Fog remakes combined!<br/><br/>Oh, and it's THE Evil Dead, not Evil Dead. The film-makers couldn't even get that right...and Ash's cameo after the credits honestly isn't worth sticking round for!"

This is a fiction, yet, seriously, it's just too forced to be 'scary' and too unacceptable in almost everything that happens. The occurrences of the events are fantastically annoying, it's like the characters have no survival instinct at all, it seems to me that they even want to die by doing dumb things. Moreover, the scenes are all so predictable and boring, and unbecoming because (again) the characters make it happen thanks to their stupidity. Furthermore, I don't know if the producer or director or whoever that made this movie knows any biology at all, but, I believe if a person loses too much blood, the body won't work properly, right?

","I guess 'Evil Dead' means 'The Evil Dead Beings', or 'The Evil Dead People'—a completely random name for an ambition-less movie, directed and acted by hacks (with Raimi lurking, it seems), sometimes basely parodying, as if it mattered, with a nonexistent script—a mindless roller—coaster of random events—that starts with a handful of youngsters—five, I believe—getting together to help one of them, a young woman, called Mia, to get over the first steps of the withdrawal, the period of fighting addiction. The movie is very disappointing and—ugly, displeasing, completely unexciting and trite.<br/><br/>The addict woman, Mia, and her brother, come from a familial background of insanity.<br/><br/>From the book found beneath the house in the forest, the youngsters find out about the reign of evil—but also about the way to rescue its victims. All events take place during a day (and a storm). The gruesome is of the spectral, and also of the gory kind—specters and gore.<br/><br/>Towards the end, it rains blood, one actress looks good—or, at least, nice—again (perhaps because her character's once careless brother now sacrificed himself for her, in an intendedly galvanic moment), the sun rises, it's over.<br/><br/>There is no storyline—just bits of events, random events—a book, Italian translations written on its pages ('SONO TUTTI MORTI'), fights with chainsaws and nail guns, this sort of very general rubbish—in the most classic American template: a house in the forest, a few youngsters, and high water. This movie is indeed dire rubbish. It looks, as I have mentioned, really ugly, and clumsily shot, the work of a bunch of larval minds.<br/><br/>A hack, Alvarez, directed this movie, but Raimi still has a hand in it, which is a shame—as a producer, which doesn't make him any honor. (I have read that Raimi picked this idiot hack to direct the movie.) I realized I kept forgetting what just happened in the movie—who cut the third victim's hand—where did they read the prophecy, and who read it—etc., but this was because everything seemed so devoid of interest, and lifeless—truly dead, and because the whole set—up has no meaning whatsoever: and was not meant to have any; indeed, a very bad movie.<br/><br/>The acting is dishearteningly poor—a highlight would be the teacher whispering 'evil'.<br/><br/>In truth, I felt thrilled for a moment, at the sight of one of the book's pages—hoping it will remind me of 'Seven'—which it didn't.<br/><br/>The topics are very general, and vague—witchcraft, a cursed book—the hazy Sabbath at the beginning—the obviously threatening witch and her blurred language.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I have seen Evil Dead'in a movie theater where a handful of morons spoiled the otherwise tasteless enjoyment: a couple were ceaselessly crunching chips, and presumably having some kind of damn lunch there—I had brought a bottle of cola, and drank some of it; others were flashing their phones, from time to time."
"lornloxor","10","36","70","23 July 2013"," Amazing thrill from start to finish
","Damn, I wish I had seen this flick in a movie theater. Fede Alvarez's re-imagining of the Evil Dead is definitely a great ride. The movie starts off with a very creepy prologue which opens up the movie seamlessly. We're then transported to the infamous cabin where we meet the main characters. They also give us a convincing and different reason for why these five twenty-somethings have to be at the cabin. One of them is trying to kick her heroin habit and she's going cold turkey. His brother is also there to help her. It's really smart because it forces them to make her stay at the cabin and also makes it difficult for the others to believe what she's saying. This setup also makes the characters more relatable because of the family dynamic. Soon after arriving at the cabin they find the familiar demonic book and all hell breaks loose. The story isn't of course anything mind-blowing but it fits this kind of a movie perfectly.<br/><br/>The cast does their job capably conveying fear and emotion on the screen. They do nothing too memorable but they serve the movie well. The only exception perhaps being Jane Levy who plays Mia, the drug addict who is trying to go cold turkey. She's terrific in this movie, especially when she's possessed by the demon. Also a huge plus for the writers for not making the characters do anything idiotic, my suspension of disbelief wasn't really challenged at any point. I thought everything made logical sense within the context of the movie. Some might point to the scenes where the teacher is reading the demonic book out loud as dumb but I didn't feel like that at all. The teacher was obviously from a world where none of this stuff happens normally so when you see a book that tells you not to read it out loud, you might just do it out of spite. <br/><br/>The pacing of the movie was fantastic as I was on the edge of my seat the whole movie. There's no useless filler in the movie. The editing was also really good. The slow focuses on some really cringing scenes and then the quick and crisp cuts in the action sequences were really nicely done. Sound design was also fantastic and it really added to the atmosphere. <br/><br/>The movie's stunning and fitting visuals do a great job of creating a gripping atmosphere. I was actually grasping my knuckles during the movie. A special nod to the lighting in this movie, it was fantastic and instrumental in creating the mood of the movie. The production design and look was also great. I really liked the set pieces, the demonic book and its drawings were exceptionally well done. <br/><br/>The gore is done really well here and there's a lot of it. It's brutal and very raw. The decision to not use CGI in the film was one of the best parts of the film. It makes all the difference. The masking and make-up of the demon-possessed characters is done terrifically. It gives it a really timeless quality which couldn't be achieved with CGI. The tone of the movie was very powerful. Every scene was seemingly filled with tension and dread. I wouldn't say the movie was scary per se as much as it was gruesome, brutal and tense. It's definitely not a funny movie but it doesn't take itself too seriously.<br/><br/>I really don't understand the people who are complaining that this movie doesn't have Ash in it (except for the short cameo after the credits) or that it's not like the original. Why would you want that? Like a good cover song, a good remake has to be its own movie. If you want the original, then go watch the original. This is a polished and very smart remake, it's just bloody good and entertaining fun. As Fede Alvarez' first full length movie, it earns high marks from me and I'm eagerly waiting for his next movie."

","Okay I love a good horror movie as much as the next person, and my excitement for the film grew with each trailer being posted online and all the buzz being drummed up on social media. But as soon as the film started rolling I began wondering if they would be actually able to pull off a suitable remake. <br/><br/>**Spoilers** <br/><br/>The only thing I enjoyed about the film was the back story about how the book of the dead ended up inside the cabin but after that it was all down hill from there. I was expecting this intensely scary and somewhat graphic version of the film but what myself and the rest of the audience received was a big let down. There were a few rip offs from The Exorcist ( I.E: the girl peeing down her leg when she becomes possessed and the sexual innuendos from the girl possessed trapped in the cellar) Furthermore the film was ninety five percent gore. Going for all the cheap gross outs instead of a good scare. <br/><br/>Another big disappointment was the trailer was actually scarier than the film was and lets not forget the scene in the trailer when the girl pops her head up from the cellar and starts singing in the creepy voice... but that scene was not even in the film. <br/><br/>Generally I find the good in most films but this one I was really disappointed with. They try to make remakes of classics and this is what the end up, flops. Granted it did extremely well at the box office but just because people paid to see the film does not make the film great. <br/><br/>Overall it is a 2/10 for me."

","Before I decided to go watch I checked IMDb.com.Had to browse through 5 f****** pages to find a positive review. So many down voters, unbelievable. Scary movie, decent acting, unpredictable story. It got me just fine and I hated the original Evil Deal 1980 Bruce Campbell movie. I mean who the heck goes to see a horror comedy? Horror is supposed to be that, scaring one out of ones wits. It convinced me. What was the most interesting aspect was seeing the deviation between the 1/10-4/10 voters and the average grade (6.8, proving the vast majority enjoyed it tremendously). As scary as Insidious 1, and was really gory."

","So there is a new name in town, Fede Alvarez attempting to remake one of the best 1980's horror franchises in history and failing miserably!. As a forty something horror buff I remember the buzz the original had, throughout my teens everyone was talking about the Evil Dead, the gore, the tree rape, the camera trickery in the woods and of course the humour. Actually for it's time the movie was that bad it was very good. Myself, my wife and a friend all went to the cinema to watch with trepidation (as IMDb's users had scored an average of 7.5, I presumed it would be watchable). Oh how wrong I was!!!<br/><br/>1) Poor casting 2) Awful, lazy plot 3) Never jumped once 4) Laughed at a part I wasn't supposed to 5) SO SO predictable!<br/><br/>What annoys me is they will actually make money from this, I believe the £17.5 million dollars this tripe cost has already been surpassed by the box office. It's been a long time since I have seen people leave a cinema half way through a film, but it happened, people booing at the end. I think Hollywood treats its audience like mugs believing they will buy into this tripe. Remember we were brought up on proper horror Jaws, Halloween, The Shining - not much blood and guts but superb acting, scripts and directorship you felt like you'd ran a marathon afterwards you were so drained. I believe the problem we have with American horror is no one cares whether the characters die or not unlike good European or Asian horror where the cast is believable<br/><br/>I think Takashi Miike, Kim Ji-Woon, Pang Ho Cheung and Pascal Laugier can all sleep safely tonight knowing Fede Alvarez is just another fly by night director trying and succeeding to make a quick buck.<br/><br/>Oh and please don't bother making Evil Dead 2, as I for one will not be attending."

","It's challenging to find words to describe this disaster called Evil Dead. It was evil to endure the movie and the storyline was dead within about 10 minutes of the movie. I suppose that's how the name ""Evil Dead"" materialized. It was not remotely close to the original cult classic. The director obviously struggled with connecting the Book of the Dead with the rest of the movie so he pulled out a red Papermate ink pen and provided the audience with English-written inscriptions of what was about to happen. How clever? I would have preferred instructions to leave the theater. So many concepts of horror and mystery were quickly destroyed by the director's use of in-your-face predictable scenes. Plots would begin to take form, but then almost instantly removed leaving the audience asking themselves, ""WTF?"" If poor acting, poorly executed script, overdone corn syrup gore, and predictable climaxes is your thing, this movie is for you."
"winterknights","3","22","40","20 July 2013"," Rubbish
","One of the worst horror films I've seen. Yeah it has bursts of ""seat jumping"" also has some pretty gross stuff. The story is terrible. The way they come across situations is plain dumb. There were parts that were plain obvious that if it was a real situation it would have happened differently. They just make them out to be really dumb people in the movie. There was around double the amount of nails in the nail gun then what there should be. The acting wasn't too bad, they did that right. The other thing that got me in this was the fact that it was basically a copy of the cabin in the woods. I'm sure thats what they based this movie from. Some of the actors get that badly wounded but still don't die. super human or something. All in all I'm going to watch monsters inc. their scarier."

","This is essentially the 1981 original with most of the fun elements pumped out of it. OK, so to be fair ""Evil Dead"" is definitely more of a reboot than a remake. Other than the name, director Fede Alvarez and co-writer Diablo Cody have tweaked ""The Evil Dead"" story just enough (while keeping its original cabin in the woods mold) that this ""Evil Dead"" should be considered a standalone piece from the Sam Raimi series. That said, with a plot line consisting of five friends spending the night together in a cabin in the woods and reading from a Book of the Dead until they are one by one possessed by demons, leaving only one left to fight for survival, it is hard not compare it to the original. It is just such a shame that the original is so much better than this unimpressive attempt at horror. In short, the Alvarez/Cody ""changes"" I alluded to above, only work to overexpose a perfectly simplistic storyline, making the movie seem longer than need be and also nearly destroying the campy nature of what made the original ""The Evil Dead"" such a success.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the second half of the film doesn't contain parts which some would consider ""fun"". There are a few well directed creepy visuals and the grotesque makeup here is simply superb (the best part of the movie). Furthermore, and quite shockingly, this reboot is not just another mindless big budget torture-porn gorefest, like 2003's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""well, let me reword that. In the spirit of ""The Evil Dead"" franchise, which is essentially predicated on violence and campy gore, this reboot isn't as maliciously gory as advertized, but still earns its R rating.<br/><br/>That said, almost all campy moments in the second half are clearly examples of too little too late, as nothing remotely funny (or interesting) happens until almost an hour in. There are also some nice callbacks to the original, including the infamous POV shots where the camera barrels through the woods, chasing after a screaming woman. But in the same breath I should make mention that the tree rape scene from the original is totally ruined here. I know what you're saying. How does someone screw up a tree raping scene?! And yet Critics of this critique may say that I went into this film with many biases, being that I am such a fan of the original. But to those I would say: I strongly believe that even the people who enjoyed ""Evil Dead"" (for what it is) or God forbid, haven't seen the original, will still surely forget about it by the time the next Paranormal Activity comes out. In fact, if not for a rather suspenseful final 10 minutes, which may be the bloodiest in recent years, this movie would have been completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Side Note: The trailers are more memorable than anything in this film. Oh, and by the way, you know the part in the trailer when the ""possessed girl"" utters the infamous line ""we're going to get you, not another peep, time to go to sleep""? Yeah, that's not in this film.<br/><br/>The Acting: I won't mention anything about the acting, only because the acting in a movie like this isn't important AT ALL! Final Thought: Even though ""Evil Dead"" does spark from time to time, it can't seem to ignite or let alone sustain any sort of suspenseful, campy or terrifying atmosphere. From its far too serious for its own good tone, to an exposition that is way too drawn out (especially for fans of the original) to its failed attempts to go the ""Drag Me to Hell"" (make situations and visuals so over-the-top that they are intentionally humorous) route, as a whole, this film should be considered a watchable disappointment. I will go so far as to say that ""Evil Dead"" was so shrug inducing that it is no wonder why Sam Raimi gave it his seal of approval, as he must have seen this reboot as no threat to overshadow his original classic.<br/><br/>Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","28","53","10 April 2013"," The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? Hardly.
","It takes a lot of nerve to advertise a horror movie as ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever See."" In this cynical, movie-drenched culture, when we often complain that there is nothing new under the sun, a line like that makes us walk into the theater thinking: ""I'll be the judge of that.""<br/><br/>That is, in fact, how Fede Alvarez's remake of Sam Raimi's 1981 cult classic ""Evil Dead"" (from Tristar Pictures) comes advertised. The line is especially bold (and foolish) since this movie turns out to be nothing more than your standard, garden-variety, run of the mill, cabin in the woods movie with five strangers holed up in a dilapidated shack while something from the netherworld picks them off one by one. The story is best known from Sam Raimi who created the genre of Gonzo Horror back in the early 80s with ""The Evil Dead"" an over-the-top horror epic that made perfect use of exaggerated camera angles, bizarro ghouls and a soundtrack that seemed made up of weird animal noises and the constant bonging of a rather unnerving wall clock. It wasn't the greatest movie in the world but at least you could say that you hadn't seen anything like it before. Raimi genius was that he presented it with style rather than substance. He knew what he had. How much substance can you bring to a movie in which a woman vomits buckets of blood while another is raped by a tree? He knew what he was working with.<br/><br/>This is not the case with the remake. There's nothing new here. Countless films have come along since Raimi's film featuring a handful of young people traveling to a cabin in the woods to be picked off one by one until the very idea has become a joke all by itself. Where Raimi's film benefited from a low budget, this one doesn't have that excuse. It's slick, good looking; it has lots of special effects, but it is so bland that you find yourself attempting to identify the movie that is booming in the theater next door. You know everything that is about to happen in this film. Raimi's film also benefited from a wicked sense of humor. This remake has no laughs save for a few that are unintentional.<br/><br/>The story is nothing to write home about. Five kids travel to a cabin in the woods so a sad girl called Mia can detox from an addiction to opiates. As the film opens we learn that, years earlier, a possessed girl was burned alive in this cabin and her angry spirit still resides, possessing those who inhabit it. When the kids arrive, the angry spirit is triggered when a brainy hunk called Eric reads from a book bound in human flesh and written in human blood – this despite a desperate scrawls on the pages not to read the text (he even takes notes!). He reads the book anyway until all manner of special effects Hell breaks loose. What happens for the next hour and half is just blood and mayhem without logic or purpose.<br/><br/>In order for a movie like this to work, we have to have some investment in the characters. The best supernatural horror films like ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Carrie"" and ""Poltergeist"", have all benefited from having characters so close to reality that when the supernatural happens, the realism and the unreality balance out. This ""Evil Dead"" remake has none of that. The characters are all stock; the hunk, the brain, the babe, and the damaged girl whose personal and familial history are a horror show all their own. These characters never come off the screen. They are what they are: Fodder for the mill. They do dumb things and then get chewed up until one is left standing. <br/><br/>It might actually be easier to forgive (or forget) this needless remake of ""Evil Dead"" were it not for recent film from last year that all but rendered movies like this obsolete. It was called ""The Cabin in the Woods,"" a movie that takes this same premise and literally breaks open the entire horror genre until all the classic clichés come spilling out into one glorious and entertaining orgy of blood and guts. That film was one of the best of 2012, and someday may take its place in the cult horror wonderland right up there with Sam Raimi's original ""The Evil Dead."" This remake is headed where it belongs, right into the dustbins of history. The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? Not on your life.<br/><br/>*1/2 (for ****)"

","...for this mediocre shopping-mall remake of the original horror movie classic(s). The new (first-time) director sticks to the basic formula of five young people unleashing demonic forces in a cabin the woods – MINUS the clever filmmaking techniques, inventive set pieces, innovative camera movements, creepy atmosphere, hold-your-breath suspense, grotesque wit and manic delirium of the 1981 low-budget masterpiece. Instead, he gives us gore. Lots and lots of gore. Gore that, quite frankly, has no impact for the viewer or the victim (a sliced tongue magically heals and lost limbs are treated like flesh wounds). Oddly, all the over-the- top gruesomeness ends up being monotonous, even tedious – and it's not because today's audiences have become immune to violence so much as the director doesn't have the filmmaking skills to make us flinch. Or squeal. Or react in any way besides a smirk and a shrug. <br/><br/>Other complaints: The new demons don't have distinct personalities like the originals, so the possessed act and look the same. Boring. The remake's new ""rules"" and ""mythology"" don't make any sense, ignoring their own ""5 soul"" requirement as well as the laws of physical reality. The rapid-fire editing is so fast and sloppy, there's no suspense whatsoever, no unbearable moments where the audience shouts, ""no, don't go down there!"" Some re-staging of the original's scenes (the tree rape, for instance) feel like the director is half-heartedly checking off boxes. Also, I hated the addition of ghostly visions and poltergeists. Meh. On the positive side, the film looks good, the actors are fine, and the blaring score is loud but effective. <br/><br/>In the end, this slickly produced reboot is not flat-out terrible, just disappointingly uninspired, unscary, and unlikely to attract a cult of devoted fans (let alone life-long Deadites!)

","Evil Dead is not a masterpiece, that is for sure. It is not perfect, nor is it cinema gold, but it is beautiful in its own right. I have read through many of previous reviews and upon me is a sea of one star votes; solid negativity with no light amidst the darkness. Many people have mistaken this movie for horror. It is not. This movie is grind-house in its purest form. Grind-house, for those who don't know, is the genre of film that embraces massive pools of blood and gruesome special effects. This is what the new Evil Dead is. It plays tribute to Evil Dead and all those in the related genre, but at the same time, modernizes its predecessors with new technological advances. The movie was well done; dialogue was limited, but believable, and effects never distracted the audience from the goal of the film, but rather embellished it. From a personal standpoint, myself being an original Evil Dead fan, I don't think the movie could have done much of a better job. Evil Dead was the heart of what every movie should be: entertaining. I smiled the whole way through. By the time the end came, I was completely satisfied. It's not often that a remake or sequel meets par with an original, but this is definitely an exception. Watch this movie for the gore, watch it for the one-liners, watch it for the tributes, just go ahead and watch it."

","You've already seen this movie. It was the remake of Black Christmas, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It's every horror remake you've seen in the past ten years, only separated from the pack by lots of blood and pulp. Because the only thing this new version of Evil Dead has to offer is copious amounts of the red stuff.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a prologue in which one man says ""Baby"" to his daughter, whom is he about to sacrifice, one too many times. This is just the beginning of the awful dialogue to come in the next twenty minutes as we move to the present day and get introduced to a group of friends through awfully stilted dialogue that only exists in movie world. I'm sure there are better ways to introduce your characters and their relationship to one another than having them openly remind the others of their relationship to them, their profession, and their back story. This is conversation that only exists in movie land, because real people don't need to be told you're their big brother or their best friend or that they're a high school teacher.<br/><br/>After the clunky exposition, the film moves to the ""scares"" once a strange book is found in the basement of a cabin the friends are staying at to help one of them go through a cold turkey drug withdrawal. The quotes around ""scares"" was intentional, as there is not one genuine moment of suspense in this lifeless thing. The movie's sole calling card is the over-the-top gore, which, as an entertainment device, quickly loses steam the moment you realize that none of these effects are going to be preceded by any kind of suspense whatsoever. I saw the film with a theater that was 3/4 full and not a single person jumped, screamed, or showed any outward sign of emotion throughout.<br/><br/>Once the unleashed demon begins taking over human bodies, the dialogue again takes another turn for the worse, with the possessed humans spouting dialogue that's straight out of more disturbing films like The Exorcist and come off like a kid trying too hard to impress his friends by saying the most extreme things he can think of without realizing how ridiculous he sounds.<br/><br/>The last half of the film plays out like an effects workshop class, moving from one gross-out effect to another with slight pauses in between. Once the filmmakers intentions are made clear, the boredom quickly sets in. There is nothing remotely entertaining or suspenseful to fill the time. You can only sit there and wait for the next ""genius"" gross-out effect which is meant to carry the film in the absence of any good characterization or scares. For a horror movie to be slow is one thing, but when something is happening every five minutes and you're STILL bored, something is clearly wrong. And that's precisely what Evil Dead is--a boring film.<br/><br/>The mood of the audience leaving the theater with me was underwhelming. For a movie that touted itself as ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"", something obviously got lost along the way. This is every Platinum Dunes effort you've seen, only touched up with some more gore to make up for the complete lack of anything else. Unfortunately this is 2013 and this trick is played out."

I can't say I'm happy with spending $21 for us to go see it in theaters, I'd suggest waiting until it's on TV or Netflix. The actors aren't great, but the effects are really good (except the voices) and the zombies look cool. Even the vine rape scene was shitty.

I'm used to them; I've seen a lot, good and bad. I enjoy a good scare.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of fun, entertaining, horror movies that scare you, then this is not the movie for you.

What's worse though, is that it's got no purpose. It's not the kind of horror that is so over the top, it's funny. It's not even designed to scare you. It's a horror movie designed, not to tell a story, not to make you jump, but simply to make you want to throw up. <br/><br/>I'm not sure it even qualifies as horror. Because I wasn't scared.

(apart from the fact the other two were so awesome that no remake could ever do them justice?) I assumed that the movie would have a more robust storyline and amazing special effects, the truth is the storyline is practically non-existent, the lack of continuity in the film really ruins any sort of scare-factor, the characters are very shallow and their behaviors vary from completely predictable to completely illogical with no middle ground.

"subrata-gamer","2","40","80","5 July 2013"," An Insult To a Cult Classic!
","First of all I want to Say This is my First Review at IMDb. As a Horror Film Buff for last 20 years (I am Now 29 :) I cannot bear the Insult This movie has done to the Original. <br/><br/>I watched The Original Evil Dead In VHS when I was 8. It scarred my mind & gave me nightmares for at least 2 years. The total Atmosphere, Makeup, Gore, Violence,Special effects are Nihilistic & Disturbing. Even after 30 years in this age of HD & Blu-Rays its STILL give me creeps. <br/><br/>But in this REMAKE I found the following points which made this a TOTAL GARBAGE & Waste of Time...<br/><br/>1) No Build Up of Atmosphere OR Suspense. I know all of us know the Original story but you still have to make the atmosphere with creativity, SFX, Sound Effects etc which made the Original Truly Disturbing.<br/><br/>2) Excessive USE of GORE. The original used gore with creativity but here we see Pool of blood, Shower of Blood etc. Also The Filthiness (like Green goo, Roaches coming out of Body etc) is MISSING in this Remake. <br/><br/>3) Stupid Make-Up. The Original make up of Demons is 10x better than this remake. Considering 1981 with 2013 we expected far better make-up. Particularly The EYES of the Deads in the Original are Scary. <br/><br/>4) Non-Likable Characters. There is No build-up of Characters which didn't help this movie. Also many of their acts are questionable & makes no Sense.<br/><br/>we missed Bruce Campbell here.<br/><br/>5)No ""Jump Out Of Your Seat"" Moments. The Original was full of Jumpy scenes which Torture your nerves & make you feel that you are nauseating. But Here you didn't EVEN find a SINGLE scene worth Mentioning. <br/><br/>6) Horrible ending... In the Original you feel like The Devil want to eat you.. but here you got something which made you feel like you have been cheated! <br/><br/>So as far as my opinion.. I gave this REMAKE 2/10 ONLY for the Effort. This will NEVER EVER will be a cult Classic like the Original."

What happens to Sam Raimi?Why didn't he direct this movie as well? This one is awful. Period. The acting is bad, the story is lame, everything is simply...awful. Special effects are awful too. Bruce fit into the series like a glove, he has that ""thing"" that makes him perfect for such a role. I actually don't get how the big studios accept to invest a lot of money into such crap! Avoid watching it at all costs unless you're a die hard fan!"
"movieman89-2","2","35","69","30 April 2013"," Possibly the worst horror remake I've ever seen. I bow my head down in shame
","When I first read in Empire that The Evil Dead was going to be remade I thought ""Oh for god's sake, why bother remake an absolute classic?"". I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy. If you haven't seen them, I highly recommend you see them. I absolutely love them. I then heard that Raimi and Campbell were involved so I thought that was a bit of a step up.<br/><br/>Saw the trailers and then was set in two minds, both saying yes and no. So my curiosity got the better of me and I saw it. I literally bowed my head down in shame and was outraged of how bad this was.<br/><br/>The story of course is great cause of the original but how it was portrayed just laughable. OK, the beginning scene was OK and it had potential of being an average remake. It also had some character development which was nice to see at first and the acting actually wasn't bad. But then the disaster began.<br/><br/>The script writing went down the drain of when we see how ridiculously stupid the characters were. Through out the situations where one of the characters was possessed and was going to attack, what did the survivors do? Cowered down like utter sissies and put their arms up to protect themselves. Surely you would try and run away or even attack back? Also, when the Mya was back to normal (somehow? who knows it was never explained) she was running away from a car that was about to fall on her, what does she do? she turns round to look, now surely you would keep running. This at the end just got ridiculously annoying. The worst was the fact that as the main character was about to burn the cabin down with his possessed sister in the basement, he stops and says he couldn't do it cause she was singing a lullaby that their mother used to sing to them. He opens up the basement and goes down to see her. Why?!. Also when he buries her alive, he then decides to dig out again and try and bring her back to life, using a heart resuscitator that he somehow created. How do these characters live while they are so stupid? I do not know. I just couldn't wait for them to die to be honest.<br/><br/>There were also some very unnecessary visuals that was just thrown in just to make the film more visual. One was when through out the tree rape scene (which I thought was much more shocking in the original) there was a vision of the girl who was possessed at the beginning, throwing up blood. Also we see her again of when Mya was having a shower we see her again. Also we see of when we see another character washing her self, her reflection is of herself as a horrific demon. Seriously enough visuals, leave some of it to the imagination.<br/><br/>The end, the beginning scene was never explained. Also when the cabin was in flames, the book of the dead somehow got out the cabin and ended up on the floor. What? At the end I just prayed for the movie to be finished as soon as possible.<br/><br/>I cannot believe how bad this movie was. If I was Sam Raimi (who I'm a huge fan of) and looked at the script, I would of felt offended and asked what are you doing to my movie. I think Raimi and Campbell were just so desperate to get back to the times where the made the original cause they felt they had such a good time making it, by remaking it.<br/><br/>Please do not bother with this awful waste of film reel. If you've seen the original, please stick with the original. If you've seen this and loved it, hey everyone's different, like it by all means."

No Ash in this movie leaves a lot to be desired and the premise of getting a junkie clean in an abandoned cabin is insulting. The makeup of the possessed reminds you of the original Exorcist make up which isn't bad. In the end, this movie just goes to remind us of how Hollywood has lost its creativity and continues to remake great movies into horrible new releases. Further, there is too much computer animation in the movie which does not allow the mind to imagine for itself. <br/><br/>Wait till this movie is free on cable before wasting your money."
"keith-kanderski","8","69","147","5 April 2013"," A Remake Done Right?
","Is this film perfect? No. Is this film better than the original? I think the question is unfair. To a younger generation, I can see how they'll prefer this over the original. To my generation, I can see how we'll prefer the original. It's just the way it is.<br/><br/>The film contains lots of gross-out, bloody scenes (much like the original). The film contains some over-the-top scenes and acting (much like the original). Once the carnage begins, the film is basically about the carnage (much like the original). The film contains some wonderful dark humor (much like the original).<br/><br/>The setup of the addict trying to kick her habit (and not for the first time) logically keeps the kids at the cabin when the audience sees things starting to get a bit strange. The new ending was cool and freaky. Overall, they did a great job creating the atmosphere of an Evil Dead film.<br/><br/>However, I'm reading most of the negativity surrounding this film is due to a lack of story, bad acting, under-developed characters, and lack of scares. Again, these same criticisms are what make the original so great. Bruce Campbell had three films as Ash. His personality really started to take shape in Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and was further enhanced in Army of Darkness. It seems as though most people are comparing this latest remake to the trilogy, as opposed to the original.<br/><br/>There are some aspects of the film I could've done without (like some of the random jump scares that were inserted). Overall, I felt as though there was a bit of tension in the crowd, which is what makes a good horror film.<br/><br/>Finally, the musical score was great.<br/><br/>As to the devoted followers of Sam Raimi who are happy that he ""had nothing to do with this film."" He was a producer on the film and kept tabs on things as they went, wanting to give the new filmmakers space to make their own film but not allowing what he thought was a piece of crap to share the Evil Dead name. Yes. Sam Raimi endorses this film, and he was involved.<br/><br/>For me, growing up with the original, I will always cherish that one. When the two DVDs are sitting side-by-side, I will reach for the original more often than the remake, but I think the remake disc will get plenty of wear. Go into this film with an open mind, and I think you will be pleasantly surprised."

I wish people would stop wasting moviegoers time by copying other masterpieces thinking theirs is as good or better because I haven't seen this to be true yet.

"Ric-7","3","22","41","7 May 2013"," Grossly disappointing
","If there was a moment of wit or humor in this film, I missed it. Perhaps it occurred while I took a restroom break for a minute or two.<br/><br/>In 1981, when the theme of a group of youngsters imperiled in a deserted location was by no means new, Sam Raimi created The Evil Dead, and the film obviously did not take itself too seriously. In my estimation, Raimi was not attempting to one-up George Romero's Night of The Living Dead. Do I think The Evil Dead was intended to be taken as basically a horror film? No. Not at all. In 1981, Raimi took what was already a cliché in horror films, and made what is mostly a parody of such films. Yet the genius in the film is that Raimi's film could be enjoyed as a horror film by anyone unaware of what Raimi was doing. (Unlike the ""Scary Movie"" films, obviously intended as parody.)<br/><br/>This film was promoted as being a remake of the 1981 film. If the creators of Evil Dead (2013) think their film is a remake of Raimi's, I can only say that they are probably one of those unaware of what Raimi was doing in 1981.<br/><br/>This film--depressingly unfunny, and incessantly gross and unpleasant. How do we distinguish it from any of the dozens of other similar unfunny and gross ""horror"" films being released? Well, perhaps because this one did not go straight to video, though don't ask me why.<br/><br/>So, if you are expecting a remake of the 1981 film, generally similar to the original, you should plan to be disappointed. If you don't have any idea of the 1981 film, and you are entertained by unfunny, gross and unpleasant horror films, you will love this one."

","Contemporary effort of the now-legendary 1981 Raimi film is refreshing at first, but finds itself being overlong once all the gore and scares have peaked in the middle. The story-differences between the old and new films create an intensity that gives fans from the original series an equal amount of jolts as the newcomers, and the cast is slightly more likable than your typical horror film—though that's still not saying a whole lot, unfortunately. The opening scene is completely unnecessary, even though it was pretty cool. The main issue with this film is the main issue with many remakes modernization. And the main issue with modernization is that itself will one day be outdated, not unlike its inspiration. Thus, pointlessness. The different ending doesn't change anything either; nice try. If the objective was to place the audience in Hell for 90 minutes, mission accomplished; but there is a feeling of emptiness when camp and low-budget are absent from an Evil Dead story.<br/><br/>** (out of four)"

But as for the rest? It wasn't as horrible either. I don't want to compare it as much to the original as this version dissed out the comedy factor..Which granted-- BUT I wish they developed the other aspects in which they introduced alongside the gore; it seemed their main focus was only gore.

Albeit it was still disturbing. <br/><br/>3) The friends? I don't know, I wished they spoke more; interacted more, maybe showed a scene where they were interacting when David went to his sister at the beginning, something, to feel that atmosphere as they ease down Mia's struggle than just being stiff & forced. <br/><br/>4) I liked how Mia was explaining how their mother, & David being there, maybe in here they could have put more horror into it-- I expected the mother being possessed since they lived in this cabin, maybe some flashbacks of how crazy she looked in Mia's dreams, or some echoing angst screams or something as the possessed gets to her.. This will leave more depth to the character, connects the audience more and also; will give somewhat a psychological effect to it. Same goes to David, I wish they somehow showed a brief 0.5 second of his past how he felt-- I don't know, some regret or remorse or whatever.. <br/><br/>5) How'd Mia know boiled water affects? Did she read the book? Also, Eric is a moronic f*ck (excuse me), if the illustrations were as clear as a comic book (not ancient-y puzzling) and it had all that captions of warnings; why DID YOU DELIBERATELY READ IT? LOL? Even reverse psychology would forbid itself to work in this case. Or maybe cause it looked comical he read it out loud. Maybe. & the fake dog's body was too fake, I thought I was hallucinating or something.<br/><br/>6) I don't mind Olivia, but Natalie? She was too dull & bland except the part where she cut off her hand, I still don't get how she died though.. Or did she die before THEN got possessed? <br/><br/>7) Okay so, David was being overprotective; he clung to every hope out there, the burial happened & I was glad he didn't fall for it the next time, but didn't the demon somehow disappear way too fast? I thought Mia's revival was a lie and David would kill her with the chainsaw just like how the trailer was-- HE HAD A CHAINSAW. THE SCENE WAS A LIE. MY LIFE'S A LIE.<br/><br/>8) Eric, please, David doesn't want you; leave him be & let him run with his sister (whom I still thought was possessed & got David fooled..) <br/><br/>9) When the rain happened-- I was waiting for him to appear.. which appeared to be that thin slimy dude with a chick's face.. (explains why he was sexually frustrated and wanted to rape Natalie) alongside him, I expected maybe more possessed deadly bodies to appear and the entire forest abiding his very own commands.. but.. No. <br/><br/>10)The demon cussing just threw off the entire thing for me; it was a complete turn off. I wished he didn't cuss much-- maybe if he used sweet words and had that persuasive personality it would be scarier. Like an alluring hallucination. Didn't Mia notice the eye on the heart? Or brain or whatever it was? Looking at her? She should have killed that too. <br/><br/>All in all, the movie did have loopholes everywhere, but it wasn't as awful as many describe it to be. It's an o-kay one. I still felt a liiiiittle bit of nostalgia and was glad to see Ash in the end after the credits; brought a smile to my face. <br/><br/>If you want to see gore-- sure, watch this, it's not as memorable as I expected it to be, but it's not as forgetful, but it's definitely not ""The Scariest Horror You'll Ever Experience."" unless you're talking about a-creepy-smiling-chick-staring-at-you-for-eternity-from-the- basement type of horror."
"drwatts201","5","29","57","6 April 2013"," Sorry, but simply not scary. See the original first and compare for yourself.
","First off, horror movies are supposed to scare you, whether a remake or a new movie. Evil Dead fails to scare because it fails to create tension or terror, two things the original was able too do throughout. Where the original kept you in the dark as too who the demon or demons are, the remake not only gives that up, but also gives you the graphic novel approach as to what's about to happen via the Necronomicon (book of the dead.) The pluses to this remake are the effects, although mostly CGI, still very gruesome and able to make you cringe, and if you're into gore, this has an abundance, the most I've seen since Saw or Hostel. Also for a major release it pushes the envelope when it comes to language, not the amount, but the content. A sad fact about horror movies today are too many effects, because they take away our own imaginations, because they can vividly show us how scary something is they never set us up so our own imaginations can takeover. Now before you say I'm just ripping this because it's a remake or I'm not the target audience of 16 to 25's this movie is aimed at, not so, I liked Rob Zombies, Halloween and Gore Verbinski's The Ring not too mention others. I remember thinking while watching the original Evil Dead that, if I were Ash I would have killed myself long before the end of the movie. Where the original was non-stop terror and tension, the remake felt robotic and didn't even seem to upset the characters it was happening to. The even sadder point is this, as far as new horror movies go, this movie is probably a 9, but with the classics and cult favorites like the original Evil Dead to compare this movie too, at best it's a 5. One final thing the original Evil Dead didn't feel the need too do.....the happy ending........."

","Before this, the worse horror movie I watched was cabin in the woods. Congrats now to evil dead! Well, there are many negative reviews on this title. I am giving another one. The movie started good in the early minutes, but then the non-logical behaviors and scenes got me bored. One of them is that how much blood is in a normal body? I mean how could those people loose that much blood and still keep going? Maybe this was a first experience for the director... I even started to laugh at some scenes because they were funny instead of being shocking... But to keep my honesty, the best part was the scene that the guy with glasses was on the floor and the one-hand girl was going to hit him with the iron rod... then the guy tried to block with his hand... and after the hit, I was amazed about the way his fingers were looking...this was truly artistic!!! That's why I gave it 2 starts instead of 1!"
"brad_the_metalhead","4","24","46","12 April 2013"," A big let down.
","I went into this movie with high expectations. I was very excited when I seen the trailer, I actually thought that it was going to be scarier than the original. I have to say it is nowhere near as scary as the original, and it is definitely not ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" Another reason why I was so disappointed, the ""Where Gunna Get you"" song is not featured in the film.<br/><br/>The only thing that I actually liked is the acting. The actors in this film are actually very talented and have a lot of potential. They are very convincing in certain sequences in the film.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the movie was awful I also have to say that the make-up effects were awesome I liked how they used practical make-up effects rather than CGI.<br/><br/>The only good elements that the movie has is good acting and good make-up. Other than that it is kind of boring, and not at all scary, so don't waste you time getting excited because it is only going to let you down."
"claymation8","5","32","64","5 April 2013"," I am justified in giving this a 5. Here's Why!
","My friend and I have been waiting for this movie for so long; we haven't seen the original, no, so this review in no way applies to the initial film or the storyline within that. <br/><br/>I was just like, ""eh."" That was the problem. My friend and I went in there ready to be terrified and screaming, but really there was nothing to scream at! It was definitely one of the most disgusting things either of us have ever seen - that goes without saying. But as far as scare tactics, I'm not sure where the critics are getting the feeling that it's ""redesigning the horror genre.""<br/><br/>Jane Levy, for one, was awesome. I believed every aspect of her story - possessed and not - from beginning to end. She really is on the rise. Lou Taylor Pucci comes in a distant second; at least he understands what it means to ""feel"" scared rather than ""appear scared."" Lucas, Blackmore, and Fernandez, however, each failed in some respect to deliver what was needed to be believable. If a girl, who is close to you, is cutting through her tongue in front of your face, don't you think you'd be doing a little more than breathing somewhat heavily and staring? <br/><br/>The last 10 minutes were by far the scariest. No spoilers here, but at least there was some edgy music and intense visuals to make it ""scary"" rather than ""gory."" Realism was also something that was unexpectedly found in this movie; every character had pretty good reason to do certain things or act certain ways, and each actor showed effort. Not all succeeded.<br/><br/>That's why I gave it a 5. Trust me: I have been waiting for this for months and honestly wanted so badly to run into my house when I get home, shaking, giving this film a 10 and rave reviews. I really did. Sometimes, though, too high of expectations lead to too much leeway for disappointment, and this was one of those times.<br/><br/>Go ahead - see it for yourself! It had it's moments. But as far as the critics reviews go, there's too much hype. Definitely worth watching for Levy's stunning performance, but not if you're waiting for pop-ups or heart wrenching scares. You'll be sick from this movie before you're trembling from this movie."

","This film is a pathetic rendition of both Evil Dead I and II and they should be ashamed of the horrible job they did. I understand that they tried to recreate much of what Sam Raimi did in the 80's but they failed miserably, relying on poorly done special effect ""shock"" scenes to attract viewers. For those of us who grew up seeing the original films there is much to be appreciated about the impressive effects that Raimi accomplished without the use of computers. Considering the technology available in Hollywood today this was really poorly done and I was very surprised to see the 7.4 rating on IMDb. This is the first time I am actually questioning their credibility..."
"Chuck_Griswald","1","18","33","21 July 2013"," D I S M A L remake of a horror classic
","Contains a few spoilers, yep. But can you spoil something that's already rotten<br/><br/>This one was certainly made for the teen-agers (and they love it!).<br/><br/>Utterly forgettable. So glad I didn't pay money to see this trash, as my expectations were very low, no surprise this movie has none of the charm, wit or humor of the original Evil Dead movies. Lets run down the check list of failures this movie has going for it. BAD CASTING - impossible to care about anything that happens to these people. BAD WRITING - did the dialog bore the bejesus out of you too? Just wanted them to stop talking and die already. The junkie girl is quite grating, is she not. Hate her. The gore, although there's a lot of it, is not effectively used and makes little impression and was it necessary for it to rain blood. Which leads to the painfully stupid ending, the junkie being raised from the dead and then kicks undead a$$. Terrible. The ""bridge out"" sequence has no visual flare, very mundane - no effort put there. The roving POV camera shots that represent the demon (one of the true hallmarks of the series) weren't done according to spec, nor did they occur often enough and created absolutely no suspense or excitement. I really did think they could have at least got that aspect right, but no, they didn't. The soundtrack, as in the music,(one of the only positive aspects about this miserable movie) is under-mixed, I.E. not loud enough, rendering it to little effect. The obligatory ""rape of the vines"" sequence didn't last long enough to be effective/entertaining and there simply wasn't enough vines grabbing her to make it fun to watch, plus it occurred during the day which is not the way its supposed to be done. How many fatal injuries can the bearded guy with the glasses shrug-off, as if he just stubbed his toe. Lets start with the 4 to 5 inch deep knife wound very near his heart, that oozed blood with every beat, how many nails were fired into his head and neck and probably else where. Plus there's a few other injures I can't remember. Point is: He lingered too long. The book of the dead looks different in every single Evil Dead film, in this one they resorted to childish vulgarities being scrawled in its pages - looks very juvenile. So what's to like about this extremely awful movie, other then the already mentioned good music score (under mixed, of course) there were a few interesting looking exterior shots of the cabin....... man not much comes to mind. The blonde chick was hot, I hated seeing her prettiness destroyed by the efforts of an amateur film director and over-done gore effects that are simply a bore. And who was the dark haired guy, was that supposed to be Ash, ha ha, !!!FAIL!!! A beyond pitiful attempt to resurrect a mighty film franchise......<br/><br/>Well let me end this with a little advice and that is, just watch the Sam Raimi/Bruce Campbell Evil Dead movies, you know THE REAL ONES - they are entirely better in every possible way."
"rbw_88","3","18","33","13 July 2013"," Sam Raimi has left the building
","Okay, fellow Dead-ites, I was willing to give Mr. Raimi the benefit of the doubt; even though he didn't direct this unfortunate happenstance of a movie, he did have a say in who did direct it. Therefore, I was willing to believe it would be something that his fellow Dead-ites would enjoy, but that just was not what happened. It was like watching Cabin in the Woods, with a mish-mash of The Ring and The Exorcist thrown in for good measure. I mean, really? Really? Do NOT watch this film and expect it to be even remotely entertaining as the original is. It does not have the same grit and fun, and the characters are a joke (but not a joke as in ha-ha, but more like, Oh God, no no). It's hard to have empathy for cardboard, so who cares if they get killed? Disappointing doesn't cover it. Mr. Raimi, get out of the backseat and start driving. Obviously it only works when you are at the wheel. When we watched Drag Me to Hell in the theater, we were laughing our asses off while the rest of the audience screamed and gasped...that's the magic we are missing."
"adventdd","3","18","33","13 July 2013"," This movie destroyed the series
","So after watching The Evil Dead, I have to say I was far from Impressed. The Story line started strong but made me loose interest quickly as the movie was filled with Animal Abuse, Intense Gore. The Plot remained the same but toward the end it got really stupid, it branched off into a totally different direction which compared to the first three ( which I loved) made NO sense at all. The High end technology that had gone into the movie was fantastic, but I found my self questioning where the original Cast was namely Ash and as the movie progressed I came to realize that this movie had to have been the beginning or origin of the Evil Dead movies.<br/><br/>There was many different times I had to turn away due to the intense violence the movie offered me, and at many a times it seemed that the director only focused on how much gore he could produce rather than making a compelling story line. Toward the end as things took a rapid turn for the worse I found myself only wanting this movie to end but it continued to not only confuse and destroy my belief in the series but I just couldn't wait for it to end. Honestly I would have given this movie 3/10 stars and that was mostly justified by the amount of gore and special effects.. does anyone else think they should have let the evil dead alone or do you think this was worth waiting for, personally I don't and hope they don't make another one"
"vovin999","3","18","33","25 May 2013"," Humanized evil and lost touch with the original
","I had such high hopes for this movie, having read some of the reviews. It was a pity then to see it, disgusted at how low-end it was.<br/><br/>The original was a work of art, succeeded only by part two. The madness that the Ancient Ones were portrayed having - to utterly inhuman perspective - was interesting and poignant. The absurdity was the alien nature of the Old Ones, and how it was handled by the magnificent Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>This version is cold, to say the least. The Ancient Ones have been given human values of evil, and the human characters are all imbeciles. The director seems to have no feeling for the Lovecraftian evil, that is both bizarre and ridiculous. We are talking about praeter-natural beings that move between the spaces, completely oblivious to the workings of the human mind, but this movie makes them into your common psychopath killer, with human motives.<br/><br/>The fear that entices in the original is not the life of the characters, but their mortal sanity and very soul. Here it is all about staying alive; the risk for your soul scattered about more like an after-thought. Tons of blood and seemingly almost immortal humans are kept alive until the last parts of the movie, where they die in pointless manners, so that you just go , ""So what?!"" or even ""Finally!"" instead of ""WOW that was!"".<br/><br/>The final scenes are the biggest yawn in history, without giving spoilers.<br/><br/>It is a testament to Sam Raimi - who created the first Evil Dead - that with the limited budget he managed to create a classic. This becomes even more apparent seeing how an AAA budget could miss the mark so greatly.<br/><br/>The funniest part is that it isn't even entertaining in a bad way. The production value is great, the effects are stellar, the cast of actors know their job; what is missing is the soul and the mystery.<br/><br/>Something the movie DID accomplish was to make me want to go and see the original trilogy again. Cthulhu Calls!"

"Bonhamkt","4","23","44","18 April 2013"," Horror Trunk Review: Disappointing Dead
","The storyline is unsurprisingly similar, but it fails to convey atmosphere and depth to the characters. The opening is used to 'establish' the evil that will be unleashed, basically acting as a 'Here's what to expect before the film has been begun' slogan. <br/><br/>The film is sombre and depressing as we are introduced to characters that are consumed with their own dramas and problems, leaving no room for subtle humour or pace, that the first had and this film badly needed. The music is filled with classic horror cues, and there are two notable jumps (for me) at least. <br/><br/>The gore is in abundance, and with the majority being practicable effects instead of CG, it's impressive, especially when taking into account the report that over 500,000 gallons of fake blood was used in one day. However, what this film lacks in story and substance is attempted to be replaced by blood and guts; not that I am complaining of course, but it feels like another lazy Saw franchise fob off. You can almost hear the director saying ""Feed them mindless gore and they will love it...""<br/><br/>As a standalone film I enjoyed it, but the inescapable Evil Dead 'original elephant' in the room only serves to create nostalgia for the original. Evil Dead is a modern echo of a cult classic that will disappoint die-hard fans looking for the stylish balance of terror and black humour that resonates so easily from the first. To be honest I enjoyed the last 10 minutes the most, as the momentum of the story picked up and the storyline finally had my attention. A gory film that tries to compensate with blood, but with a tagline that it cannot live up to. <br/><br/>If you go down to the woods today you're in for a nasty surprise...<br/><br/>www.horrortrunk.com"

But the rest just lacked anything real special. I especially missed the campy type of dark humor that was in the 1981 original, there was only 1 or 2 lame attempts at anything like this in the remake, granted there is enough blood and gore to satisfy most horror fans. But as a true EVIL DEAD a fan I was somewhat disappointed. I hope they stop at this one for remakes and leave the classics alone...this generation is getting screwed with remakes."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","5","27","53","6 April 2013"," A remake just for the fans
","I don't blame Sam Raimi for deciding to produce a remake of his original film. I absolutely do not. His original film, The Evil Dead (1981) has such a strong cult following that like several other films have received the Hollywood treatment of either getting a sequel, remake or prequel made in their name. What saddens me though is that I didn't find this movie anymore entertaining than its ancestor. There were a few slight pluses that distinguished it from the 1981 film but overall this remake made me favor the first one a little more.<br/><br/>For the most part, the plot is the same as the 1981 movie - Teenagers decide to stay at a log cabin unknowingly surrounded by evil spirits that inhabit the forest that are currently lying dormant. The only way for them to be unleashed is by one of the curious teens to read the book of evil sayings. When this is done, gradually each teen is possessed and ends up either killing someone else or hurting themselves. However, I do give credit however to the four writers of the screenplay for at least slightly changing the back-story (two of which were Sam Raimi and director Fede Alvarez). As it turns out, these teens are not up in the cabin for a vacation. Out of two siblings in this group, one has an addiction problem with drugs, so the plan was to help her break the habit.<br/><br/>Then again, this also confuses me because in the story, it sounded like these kids have previously visited this cabin before...so why didn't they notice all the dead animals hanging in the basement before? I don't get it. Oh and let's not forget the beginning scene. I honestly don't understand of what the relevance of it was. The characters involved with the scene are not connected in any way to the other characters that revolve around the plot...so why have it? The beginning scene was only connected to an inquiry that one of the main characters had, but besides that nothing else was explained to who these previous individuals were.<br/><br/>And to bill this movie as the most terrifying movie - I highly disagree. The more psychological horror movies become, the more terrifying they are. Just having a ton of gore and creepy looking demonized individuals is not terrifying, especially if you are one who has seen plenty of other gore fests. And that possessed tree rape scene...the only other thing I could not stand. Something like that, no matter how lengthy on screen is not considered entertainment. I acknowledge that it is not real, BUT why would anyone want to see that? That's not horror. I said this about the Raimi's 1981 film as well.<br/><br/>Besides the back-story being expanded on, I will also give credit to the acting, gore and music. The actors portrayed their characters very accurately as if they were really scared and frightened of what was happening around them. The gore was also definitely up there too. Depending on who you are, it'll either be gross out night or a ""eh whatever"" night. But to be honest, I'm only giving credit for having it and for being similar to its parent. I'm not saying that any of the kill scenes were original or innovative. They're more like nods towards the original.<br/><br/>The one thing that I am sure about giving credit to is Roque Baños for his musical score to the film. Not only does Baños create some really dark and creepy tones and even some emotional tunes to the movie, but he also creates a main theme for the actual franchise. Throughout the film, audiences will get a chance to hear the specific tune that will belong to this franchise. If composer Joseph LoDuca had done that in 1981, I also would have enjoyed the original better too. Sadly Baños is the only thing that truly stood out to me as an improvement over this run-of-the- mill remake.<br/><br/>Just like Raimi's first film, the remake to the original is by no means bad at being an efficient horror film, but it hardly makes anything more entertaining. The screenplay has an intriguing back-story and its score has improved but the only audiences it will truly please are its devoted fans."
"ninokay","1","17","31","28 July 2013"," Disappointing remake of a classic
","Well, I waited impatiently for this one, as the original is what made me a fan of the horror genre in the early eighties. Needless to say that this remake ruined a classic for me in so many ways.<br/><br/>What made the original so compelling is that its idea was first of its kind back then (friends gather at a cabin in the woods and the horror ensues). Between 1981 and 2013, countless movies were made around the same general plot until the subject became a tacky horror cliché.<br/><br/>You would think that, 32 years later, a remake would include some new elements or plot twists, or the story would be developed further in one or more directions, but alas, no. It's a just a pointless remake devoid of thrills.<br/><br/>I kept waiting till the end for something intriguingly unique to happen, but unfortunately the film ended seeming as a boring and tired rehash not of the original, but of those countless horror B movies of the past 32 years.<br/><br/>Way to ruin such a great classic..."
"cornflakeboy20","5","93","210","3 April 2013"," All the gore, none of the charm
","Like many horror remakes, this improves on the visual effects and updates the hairstyles but strips all the charm and originality from the story. The Evil Dead remake is competently made, has lots of gore, and is thoroughly suspenseful but it will never rival the original or any of its sequels.<br/><br/>The remake begins with the burning of a witch in our cabin in the woods by a group of Deliverance style hillbillies. We don't know precisely when this action is occurring, but it would seem to be in a previous era. Later evidence suggests that this actually might have been quite recent. The MF profanity, for instance, has only been in use since the late 60s. There are animal corpses still not completely desiccated when the kids arrive. And there is evidence of a break-in at the cabin since the last time it was visited. The cabin, by the way, is still on the electrical grid. No harbinger warns the kids, so we're never exactly told the significance or history of the cabin itself. We're not precisely told when the story is set, but it seems modern day.<br/><br/>The five young characters arrive, and in this scenario, they are there to assist in the intervention/detox of heroin addict Mia. The characters don't seem to like one another, and except for estranged brother David, their relationships are unclear. They would seem to have been childhood friends who previously visited the cabin. But most of the characters seem awfully prim to have maintained a relationship to a self destructive heroin addict. I never quite figured out where the hippie character Eric fit in. He's not even in the movie as stoner or comic relief. His chief duty in the movie is to discover the necronomicon, unleash the evil and try to warn the other characters. The necronomicon, while we're on the subject, is among the movies worst flaws. It looks like a goth teen's notebook full of pencil sketches and ""scary,"" profane jargon in red ink. A second flaw is that none of these characters has any real personality.<br/><br/>The detox angle has possibilities, because – as in Trainspotting – people coming down from drugs often have terrible hallucinations. But the main point in this story seems to be as an excuse to stop Mia from fleeing the cabin. However, they do not disable the cars, so Mia takes off at her first chance where she meets the witch in the woods, who – in a scene straight out of Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday – infects Mia with evil by throwing up a black oozy snake which crawls up Mia's skirt into her body.<br/><br/>Mia's infection and the subsequent killing of other characters is done in gory zombie movie fashion. Mia actually behaves quite a bit like Regan in The Exorcist. I recall the original zombies being full of joyful, laughing evil, which was part of its campy charm. The post possession scenes become a stalk and slash with various weapons around the cabin. It will be a treat for fans of gore; the movie doesn't skimp. But I also don't recall hearing any trouble about it with the MPAA.<br/><br/>There is some originality particularly toward the ending, as the movie takes some twists and switches heroes and villains. The movie lets you know that animals aren't off the table as victims, etc. It is a bit of a flaw to not know whether it is Mia or the witch who is the movie's main villain. During scenes where Mia returns to her own identity, she appears to bear none of the scars that would surely result from all the violent action she's been through. Overall, it's a competent, scary horror movie. But the characters or mythology do not win over the viewer. This is unlikely to itself become any sort of long lived phenomenon and I wouldn't expect anybody to come out of this movie with the cult following attached to those involved in the original. BTW, I write this before the movie has officially premiered and the 7+ point IMDb rating it currently enjoys (virtually unheard of for a horror movie), has been incredibly inflated by fanboys."
"DICK STEEL","3","22","42","13 May 2013"," A Nutshell Review: Evil Dead
","It's hard to live up to one's tagline, especially when it's screaming the words ""most terrifying"", because it's building expectations sky high, only for it to come out a little bit underwhelming, despite having cult classic pedigree backing it. Evil Dead is that continuation of the Sam Raimi Evil Dead films that had Bruce Campbell in the starring role, but this installment is all seriousness without the camp, which made it a little bit dreadful to sit through, and an exercise in excessiveness.<br/><br/>With the slew of horror and slasher films trying to out-gore one another, a plateau has been reached as to how many times something can be dismembered on screen, full on view, without the need to cut away for decency. Then comes the gushing of copious amounts of blood fit for vampires partaking in their own version of Oktoberfest. There's a limit to how much is enough, though that limit has constantly been pushed further and further away, that it's probably not far fetched to start pondering about how much more the envelope can get pushed, before enough is enough. When one's desensitized, the ability of shock-and-awe diminishes, and the obsession to drape everything in blood isn't really healthy.<br/><br/>But I digress. Credit has to go where credit is due, and the entire make up department deserves that pat on the back for making its main cast of five look grotesque when they needed to be, given that the Book of the DeadXX has unleashed a demon amongst the midst of five young adults, who are assembled in an isolated cabin in the woods to assist one of them, Mia (Jane Levy), to kick her drug habit. This in itself is a smart premise, because when Mia experiences spooky occurrences, it could be brushed aside and treated as just another side effect, until of course it's too late. Iconic scenes do not get replaced, so when Mia issues her threats while under possession, you'd know just what to expect.<br/><br/>The body count's pretty low here for obvious reasons there are only a handful of characters, but there were some nifty moments to ensure some of them got recycled as part of the plot. There's possessions and mind control, coupled with characters who can take a lot of punishment given the slew of weaponry being targeted at them, from chain saws to machetes to a nail gun. It has everything including the kitchen sink, and everything and anything can be used as fair game to stop the madness from decaying from within each of the characters.<br/><br/>As an expansion to the Evil Dead franchise, this has set itself up pretty neatly for future installments for this component, and the established mythos, to collide some time in the future. The soul, erm, sole redeeming factor here will be the finale, with Fede Alvarez crafting what would be an excellent scene of Man vs Monster that would be a no brainer as the poster-child of the movie, and one that's most memorable. It's a pity it had to plod along to get to the best part."

Rarely do I turn a movie off before it's finished, but less than an hour into it, and I was very bored with the plot & so grossed out with the excessive unnecessary gore. Thank goodness, I spent under one dollar to rent this! The beginning of the movie showed a HINT of maybe, possibly, a decent demon story, but I was wrong. Blood blood, blood, predictable horror movie clichés...It's just all wrong. Also, I didn't feel that any of the characters were well developed. I don't understand how this has such a high rating.

","That a classic film, one so profoundly iconic in the history of cinema, should be remade is a huge risk. Unfortunately, those involved with this abomination only insult the memory of a truly great film and provide a complete wastage of film stock in the process. Why Sam Raimi allowed this to happen is beyond all imagination. His direction of the original was superb and his visionary masterpiece of a motion picture required no remake. The very concept of such an blasphemy is impossible to grasp. The performances in the real Evil Dead were stunning and Bruce Campbell's Oscar worthy. The intensity and humanity he brought to the character of Ash is unforgettable. At least the character of Ash is omitted from this utter failure of a film. For anyone who cherishes the Evil Dead of long ago, this is unworthy of consideration and deserves unregulated contempt."

","Evil Dead (2013): Dir: Fede Alvarez / Cast: Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, Elizabeth Blackmore: Torturous disgusting graphic mess sighting death as a doorway to further evil. We have a carload of brainless ding bats arriving at a remote cabin. Jane Levy plays a cocaine addict who is brought out here in order to prevent her from relapsing. Shiloh Fernandez plays her resourceful brother there for support. Lou Taylor Pucci plays a complete moron who discovers the Book of the Dead in the basement and recites the words despite written wording advising otherwise. Levy flees into the woods and is raped by tree branches and possessed by some unseen force that allows the victim to speak demonic. Jessica Lucas apparently plays a doctor who is perhaps more dimwitted than anyone. Director Fede Alvarez creates tension and is backed with favourable effects and makeup but the screenplay is littered with so much blood, guts and gore that it is difficult to appreciate any suspense. We see at least two occasions when arms are sawed or torn from bodies in graphic detail and it is despicable. Levy is the one solid presence as a demonic victim locked in the trap door in the basement and her concluding revelation is surprising. Fernandez also fares okay but other characters are as dumb as a bag of hammers and more or less exist for whatever graphic torture they meet. Another issue is the lack of humour that was priceless in the Sam Raimi versions starring Bruce Campbell. The result here is a remake that should be burned and buried and never resurrected again.

And as many reviewers have said the characters in this are very two dimensional as no personality is established with any of them. In reality any Evil Dead movie is worth watching a third time rather than watch this once. The only thing that it really had going was the Plot and location.

","Unlike a lot of the people interested in the Evil Dead remake, I was not really a fan of the original Evil Dead. I was, however, a big fan of Evil Dead 2, which was in many ways a remake of Evil Dead. The second film kept the first film's elements of fear, creepiness and gore and added a bad ass protagonist, humor and creative violence. I was disappointed that this 2013 remake seemed to draw its inspiration only from the first film.<br/><br/>Even though I'm not a fan of the original Evil Dead, I think this film is inferior in many ways. It does away with subtlety almost completely and draws on more clichés than the original, which does not help with creating suspension of disbelief. It goes to greater lengths to try to explain what's going on, but the explanations don't make any sense.

The actors played their parts very well. It had my stomach wrenched in some spots and it takes a lot for me to feel like that.

Secondly, the main girls back story wasn't really something that endeared the viewer to her plight. Half way through I actually rooted for the demons. I guess the one thing I liked about the wasted time I spent with this film was trying to see how many references I could pick up as homage to the original three movies.

","I am not a horror genre fan I admit, but I do enjoy them from time to time, but this film is an example of what is wrong with the Genre now. Remakes of classics, with nothing new to add, why take the step at all if the step is backward? The same old lazy horror clichés, for example, the mirrored bathroom cabinet opened, and when the door is shut, the reflection has changed, and why do Hollywood now think that the scariest image we can cunjure is a girl with long black hair covering her face in a nightie? Any tension built in the film was because I was getting annoyed by the characters doing the same horror film mistakes 'go on, get back down in the cellar, the thing wont get you this time!' I found myself laughing at the parts which were meant to be the most disturbing, probably because the director is treating the viewer in the lowest regard, by simply making the film as gory as possible, throwing as much fake blood around as they could lay their money grabbing hands on, and not really bothering to think of any original ideas.<br/><br/>Avoid this film, or watch it if you want, what do I care?"

","Out of all the remakes of classic 80's horror in recent times, this was the one that I was most looking forward to and was literally shaking in my seat in the cinema when the film started. Being a massive fan of the original Evil Dead trilogy and having seen the '81 version more than 100 times (yeah, really) the trailer for this one sucked me in right away and seemed to be the one remake that they were going to get right. How then did they get it so wrong? As you can see in the trailer and read in the other reviews, the effects are spot on, the productions values are high and all-in-all it is a good looking movie. <br/><br/>Enough good things said about ED2013. The acting was terrible, there was no character development (the characters were woeful anyway), etc, etc. But worst of all, it just wasn't scary! Where's the horror guys? I would imagine that the bulk of people seeing this film are fans of the original and therefore would be, like myself, in their 40's. We expect more than high-tech blood n guts in a horror film these days, where's the fright-factor? And the possessed were all-so-lame! The voices and character animation in the original rocked and set the standard for hardcore demonic possession in modern horror. You would not be stealing if you had copied this trait, it would have been appreciated, even expected! <br/><br/>The negatives far outweigh the positives and make this just another junk teeny horror. It's a crime that such great films like Texas Chainsaw, The Omen, NIghtmare on Elm Street, Halloween and now Evil Dead have been allowed to be slapped together in these pathetic re- hashes. There is so much great horror fiction out there, how about reading some books and getting some fresh ideas if you have none of your own? Yet another sad day for horror..."
"3xHCCH","4","19","36","23 April 2013"," NOT Exactly What Its Hyperbolic Poster Would Have Us Believe
","I have not seen the original 1981 ""Evil Dead"" by Sam Raimi, so I am judging this film on its own merit, not on how loyal it was to the original. Horror film that I am, I must say I do not like blood and gore type horror films. So the fact that this film had gallons of blood and gore splattering, gushing and dripping all over the place certainly did not make me like it more.<br/><br/>The premise was rather shallow. Five people are gathered in one lonely cabin in the woods supposedly to help one of them, Mia, get over heroin addiction. However, when one of them finds a chain-bound book in the basement and started reading the mysterious words it warned him NOT to read, then the demon awakens and the bloody mayhem begins, killing them one by one, until the inevitable last man (or woman) standing.<br/><br/>Nothing was spared to make each member of the cast all bloodied up. There just happened to be an electric knife, a nail gun, a chainsaw, anything and everything to slice, to stab, to dismember, to maim, everything to make a gory film gory. So if you hate blood, you should not watch this at all. Gallons and gallons of blood-like liquid were used in shooting this film.<br/><br/>As I have mentioned, I do not particularly like blood and gore type horror films. I went into this movie not knowing that this would be like ""Halloween,"" ""Texas Chainsaw"" or similar massacre type films. I confess I cringed and averted my eyes alright, as there were truly disgusting scenes. But I have to say that this definitely was NOT the ""astonishing,"" ""astounding,"" ""awesome,"" and ""near perfect experience"" that its hyperbolic poster would have us believe."

"Remy_Azhary","3","13","23","9 May 2013"," The irony lies in its production budget
","Just as I'd expected EVIL DEAD turned out to be just another typical remake of today. Seriously, Hollywood needs to learn its lesson of not cashing in from originals. <br/><br/>I was gingerly anticipating to see this new ""reboot"", if you will, as I knew remakes don't usually make it good on the screen these days. And people these days are far more preoccupied with their mobile devices to be even remotely interested in watching movies anymore.<br/><br/>That said, on with my thoughts about how the new EVIL DEAD was. For a start, I'm not making any comparisons to the original 1981 Sam Raimi's version. Although the effects and makeup in that latter version were filthy cheap, not to mention extremely cheesy by today's standards, somehow 1981 EVIL DEAD gave a far more superior spooky atmosphere than this latest one.<br/><br/>In the original EVIL DEAD, the audience are treated immediately with an aura of evil as soon as the film started. There was no studio logo introduction. We started off with evil's POV running through the woods as if sensing its victims.<br/><br/>The 2013 one, however, wasted the audience's time by attempting to build a story around it and that tremendously slows down the pacing which I could certainly feel.<br/><br/>However, credits still have to be given to the effort of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell (the director and protagonist of the original film) in that I could see remnants of their 1981 film in this one. One of these includes the pendant that the protagonists in both versions gave to their lover (1981) and sister (2013).<br/><br/>I wouldn't go any further in elaborating how much I prefer the original version than this new one. But sufficed to say that this 2013 relied too much on its goriest and gruesome tortures. Even the ""possessions"" looked cheap. The irony is that the so-called ""makeups"" looked far cheaper than the cheap 1981 version, if that makes any sense at all.<br/><br/>To be honest, I was sitting in the theater constantly thinking how many of these (pardon my tone) idiots ever saw the original.<br/><br/>In short, I'd say this 2013 EVIL DEAD looked like the gorefests of the SAW franchise and 1972 THE EXORCIST (times 5) with the makeup effects of Hollywood's THE RING.<br/><br/>To quote Sidney Prescott from SCREAM 4, ""Don't f**k with the original"". Giving a vote of 3 out of 10 is as generous as I could get."
"TomL123","3","18","34","27 May 2013"," This thing...it does not burn...
","I walked into this movie having read the reviews. Some said it was brilliant. Others said it was bad. This intrigued me as there was no one really on the middle ground.<br/><br/>Having now seen the movie I now understand why that was the case.<br/><br/>First of all here is my breakdown of the movie. visuals 7.5/10 script 0/10 Acting 3/10<br/><br/>See the visual effects in this movie are are very good. The gore level is high, though not as high as I expected for an R18+ Australian rating. So these aspects of the film are going to impress the horror fans who are not looking for a story so much as an adrenaline rush. 90 minutes of mindless violence to their minds off things.<br/><br/>But those of us who are looking for a little bit more, those of us that are looking for a storyline where we actually care about the characters and where there aren't any gaping plot-holes are going to be sorely disappointed. <br/><br/>I'm of the opinion that in order to make a good horror movie you need to make the audience care. The more they care, the more they scare. The more they are pulled along with the journey of the main characters and when they feel scared so do we. But to put it simply, I did not give a dam about any of these characters. They were all annoying and whiny and badly acted for the most part. <br/><br/>I guess I shouldn't have expected anything better from a script that Diablo Cody was involved in (My god Jennifer's body was so terribly written). I honestly don't know what people see in her writing.<br/><br/>I also thought the script itself was very limited. The same motifs and the same references to the original Evil Dead were repeated to us so many times it got annoying. <br/><br/>The acting itself whilst at times okay. At other times was very ordinary. Jane Levy was perhaps the only exception to this. You can certainly see why none of them are A-list actors (though to be fair they didn't have a lot to go by).<br/><br/>SO to sum up. the gore and visuals were exactly what most horror fans wanted. It just lacked us caring for the characters and therefore the actual scare factor was very low. I thought that Fede Alvarez overall handled the DIRECTING aspect of the job okay. but I re-iterate again and again the script needed about another dozen re writes.<br/><br/>3/10 If you're looking for a horror film with any sort of depth...Avoid this one."

Normally I despise remakes (excpetion: 2011's The Thing,) but Evil Dead, this 2013 version directed and co-written by Fede Alvarez and with Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell as two of the film's producers, blew my mind. Now it not on a par with the original, and it is definitely not ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience,"" but damn... still, it was, with out a doubt, the scariest movie I have seen in a long time. And I watch a LOT of horror movies. Pop-up after pop-up and twist after twist, it is absolutely relentless. <br/><br/>Despite its brilliance, as with any film there are flaws. The opening scene doesn't do the rest of the movie justice, I don't know to me it didn't seem to fit in too well. And some of the dialogue is slightly cheesy. However, those bits of cheesiness are made up for with surprising performances from all of the cast. But overall, it is fantastic. Once it gets going, it doesn't slow down. On the contrary, it only seems to pick up. As a film buff, one thing that I found awesome was the absence of CGI. In fact, all the effects are man-done, going old school with it. I had never heard of Fede Alvarez until today, but he is an impressive director and I have high expectations for him. Evil Dead does not disappoint, and has plenty of homage to the original trilogy (Evil Dead fans prepare to get ready!. A must-see film; just remember, it's NOT the original.

","I really enjoyed this movie and could not help but feel like it is one of the best horror films I have seen in quite some time. So I was a bit shocked and sad to see it getting a lot of bad reviews and comparisons to the older version that this film is loosely based on. I am 21 years old I was not alive in the 80's when the first Evil Dead came out and yes I have seen it and I can see why it would have been amazing and good at the time but it really had no effect on me. This movie is made for my generation, for those that have seen it all and need new scares and shock tactics. Perhaps in 40 odd years time they will remake this again and I ll be the one to slate it and give it bad reviews and say it really did not compare to the 2013 version! What I loved about this movie was the fact it was just never ending, one thing after another it was tense, gritty and at times very jumpy and cringe worthy. A real roller coaster ride of horror. I could not help but feel like there was lot of references to other great horror films, the bathroom scene (Physco), the car driving to the cabin (The Shining) and there was also quite a few Sam Rami style camera angles which were great. At the same time they also managed to bring some new and fresh things to the table for example at times the music was quite different (sirens/warning alarm) and at some points it was very classical and what you would expect from a horror film. It was very gory but I was so caught up in the terror and thrill of it I did not mind it or even think about it till after wards when I was like that was actually really gross. Unlike other films such as Saw where your just sitting there thinking this is just violence for the sake of violence. To me they struck a really good balance here of being necessary and shocking with out being too over the top or fake. The story plot also was quite strong I am sure if I were to watch it a second time I could pick out some flaws and holes but on first viewing everything seemed justified and reasonable. Compared to other films where your left thinking why would you do that, why would you go back or who would do that in real life? It was also such a great experience to see it in a cinema, every body was screaming, jumping, cringing or hiding behind some one which only made it all the more fun for me. The only bad thing I can say is that the characters/acting were at times a bit flat especially at the start but if they had tried to develop the characters and their own stories any more it would have made it very cliché and fake. I also did enjoy the opening scene and did not feel like it was a good way to start the movie as there was no suspense or tension build up just boom, blood and violence. Perhaps if they had worked it in as flash backs when they find the cellar it would have worked better, but thats just my opinion. Don't hate this movie just because you think its cool too or because it did not compare to the time you saw the original in the theater. You have to take into account, the times and the industry have all changed and moved on. Just go grab your most nervous and jumpiest friend, a big box of popcorn and let the fun begin!"

All of this would not have bothered me, as I enjoy b-movie horror flicks. HOWEVER, they completely neglected what made the original movie - the humor and self-awareness of being a cheesy b-flick. There is literally nothing unexpected, funny, or memorable going on here. They kept the ""story"" of the original, and that's about it.<br/><br/>There is no ""groovy"", no talking deer, and the psycho terror of the possessed felt forced and boring. We do get a chainsaw and a double barreled buckshot, but no cool finale. Up to the end, I sat hoping that the final might make up for the tedious going-through-the-motions jump scare gore horror I watched, but alas, no. The ending was outright terrible and even after this movie, a letdown. The supposed terror that was summoned was no different from any zombie in any zombie movie, its lines taken from any exorcism flick.<br/><br/>For gore and b-horror-movie fans that haven't seen the original, this will serve as mild entertainment.

I waited 8 months for it, and it was totally worth it. This movie has your eyes glued to the screen from start to finish. Jane Levy was stellar, and Fede Alvarez did an incredible job as the director. I read about what a hard time the cast had filming it, and I can't believe that they are willing to do other projects. This is not an average horror movie, and has an actual plot, compared to some other horrors this year. And the Special effects were fantastic, and limiting the usage of CGI definitely works in horror movies. It will remind you of the horrors from the 70's and 80's. Overall, the best horror I have seen this year, and Jane Levy definitely has big things coming her way."

","Fast pace , creepy , dark and well developed remake film by Fede Alvarez . Five friends (Jane Levy , Shiloh Fernandez , Lou Taylor Pucci , Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore) head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods. The evil presence possesses them until only one is left to fight for survival . The young people get drawn into a web of evil and is beset by horrible demons.<br/><br/>This frightening , strikingly designed horror movie achieved a lot of success thanks to its unstopped terror ; and it deals about a group of five friends go into at mountain cabin and they find the book of the dead , then begin a possession demoniac and they undergo an eerie transformation at night and going on a murderous rampage . This enough budget film contains tension , terror , shocks and lots of blood , slime and guts . The movie is blending from ¨Night of the living dead¨ with a creepy creatures submitted a fantastic possession has transformed into flesh eating , being influenced by ¨Suspiria¨ spectres , and of course, the ¨Exorcist¨ , besides the death of possessed bears absolutely resemblance to the original version by Sam Raimi . Highly adequate make up Roger Murray and Jane O'Kane along with excellent special effect with effective monstrous creatures . It must be stated that this is one of the grossest , disgusting and most brutally unnerving movies in the last years . A passable retelling providing chills and grisly horror and isn't apt for squeamish neither feeble stomachs . This independently produced gem features sets and production standards but is skillfully narrated and results to be an exciting horror film . Magnificent visual effects filled of incredible transformations by George Ritchie . The film primarily used practical special effects ; however, CGI was used to remove wires and equipment used for the effects . According to reports in the press, the film used 70,000 gallons of fake blood. In an interview, Fede Alvarez said they used 50,000 gallons for the final scene alone . This is compared to the 200-300 gallons used in the original. <br/><br/>Original Musical score by Roque Baños plenty of eerie and screeching sounds . Adequate and dark Cinematography by Aaron Morton . The motion picture was professionally directed by Fede Alvarez , though with no originality . The first rendition was ¨Evil Dead¨ (1981) by Sam Raimi with Betsy Baker , Theresa Tilly and Bruce Campbell who finds ¨The Necronomicon¨, it has became a cult favorite thanks to its relentless horror . Followed by two inferior sequels : ¨¨Evil dead ¨2 ,¨Army of darkness ¨ with similar actor (Bruce Campbell) , producer (Robert Tapert by Renaissance pictures) , musician (Joseph LoDuca) and well directed by Sam Raimi . Well worth watching for terror and gore lovers."

","Well I've just finished watching this, and I have to say that I am very disappointed. If the intention was to do a remake of the original, then it failed on many levels. If you like excess of blood and gore and a weakened diluted back story you might enjoy this though. <br/><br/>Evil Dead 2 did a better job at attempting to remake the original (with a higher budget) and that was over twenty five years ago!<br/><br/>Character development was rushed and lazy, the character ""Mia"" was about the only likable one, but only towards the end of the film. Makeup wasn't too bad, but I'm left wondering why they needed to ""update"" another classic. At least we've still got the original Evil Dead films to fall back on. I expected more but was left wanting. Hopefully nobody gets any funny ideas about remaking Army of Darkness. 3/10"
"momentofpeace1","3","14","26","17 June 2013"," Hollow and pretentious gore-fest
","I feel like this movie tries to bite more,than it can chew. It fails to provide even two-dimensional characters to such extent,that you'll be hard pressed to name a single character trait , that distinguishes one character from another. With a setup like that the attempt (if one can even call it that) to present the strained relationship between Mia and her brother really falls flat. The part about careless teenagers awakening ancient evil by reciting spells from the magical book could seem far-fetched in the original,but here it's taken to the extremes. A guy goes to a black magic room with ritually slaughtered animals hanging from the ceiling,finds the magical book and immediately proceeds to read the incantations aloud,despite the warnings and the fact,that he's alone in the room. Then the company decides to forcibly keep Mia in the cabin... Unless she'll walk out and use a car,that is. Is the ""plot"" here just an excuse for mutilation and self-mutilation sequences or are we actually supposed to empathize with characters so one-dimensional and stupid? I'll go with the former.<br/><br/>The amount of ""nods"" to the original trilogy is enormous , but it's also done in a totally humorless way. For example,twice characters will sever their hands , but there won't be a single ""Farewell to arms"" moment. In fact,endless ""Nods"" end up dominating the ""plot"".I imagine,that the scripting went somewhat like this: ""Ok,now we need a ""Swallow this!"" nod. Let's use the chainsaw instead of shotgun this time,because we're just so original. Also,make sure,that Mia loses her hand since she's our Ash and he's supposed to lose one. So original."" <br/><br/>Apart from milking the franchise I don't really see any point in this film.If you're feeling nostalgic about the original trilogy you can always re-watch it without needing to resort to this... thing."

"dutchchocolatecake","1","6","9","13 September 2013"," The Evil Dunce
","Let me preface this review by saying, that I am a fan of the Evil Dead series. These movies are the last vestiges of honest creativity in the cult classic world. No seriously, think about it. When was the last time you saw a movie maker just take and run with his ideas; not giving a crap about the status quo? Not caring about if his stuff is macho enough for the 1 in 25 sociopaths out there? Now everything is stylized bullcrappery meant to elicit a reaction, not tell a story, not meant to entertain. It's just created to satisfy the urge to see women scream. Sick, sick, sick.<br/><br/>I am the exact opposite. I expect a horror movie to scare and entertain me, not terrorize me or encourage violence against half the human planet. I don't confuse blatant, violent misogyny as an acceptable expression of ""Horror."" I don't expect to see racist or homophobic crimes in a horror movie, nor should I expect to see crimes against women used as entertainment fodder for the psychos in our society.<br/><br/>All you have to do is look at the advisory warnings to see what's in store for you if you decide to spend money on this movie. Violence, gore, more gore; sick sexuality with some lesbian appropriation thrown in. Ooooh sex. Tee hee. Sex is always a Big Deal to the repressed and immature.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has officially lost my respect because of this movie. He has taken a perfectly good movie franchise and sold it out to the crowd of ""the biggest, most aggressive, violent, cruel, sadistic butthole rulez! (bro)."" This movie didn't add anything to the storyline, and it didn't enrich the viewer's enjoyment or understanding of the movies it was based from. The magic of the original Evil Dead movies is that they were creative, funny, ironic, and did NOT rely on cookie cutter stylized pop culture garbage. That magic is gone now, completely RUINED. Thanks for nothing, Mr Raimi. I wonder if Bruce Campbell regrets ever being a part of this franchise.<br/><br/>I'd like to make one last point about horror - the point of horror is not to create movies for psychopaths to get their jollies off or satisfy a need to see women in pain. For godsakes. Horror is meant to be intriguing to a degree as to the possibilities that exist outside our normal lives. That is where the bona fide reaction of being afraid comes from, geniuses - the realization that things exist outside our normal understanding. Whether they are a dead person rising from the grave or a monster from parallel universe. Read Lovecraft, he knew exactly what horror was even if his writing style is not your favorite you will learn more about what horror is reading one story of his than you will watching 20 modern ""horror"" movies (lolz, if they can be called that).<br/><br/>In my time at IMDb, I find that the real fans of the horror genre are intelligent and cynical. Cynical because they have already confronted the aliens, the demons, the psychos, etc and you won't find them GUSHING about how WONDERFUL it was to see women sliced in half, because they don't watch horror to be entertained or expect the movie to reflect their sexist worldview. No, they want to be taken OUT of their worldview, they WANT to confront something that is new and different, a possibility they have never considered before. And they want to TALK and DISCOVER about those possibilities, not sit around staring at mindless gore.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, the Evil Dead franchise was not meant to be the most intellectual or radical movie series, but it was at least entertaining until this piece of crap remake came along. But you could at least say, ""Yeah, I've seen those movies. What a hoot huh?"" and now I can't even say that anymore."

","There wasn't much like this when Sam Raimi Et. Al. produced this precious little gem. The thing was, the preciousness was time sensitive, and in the late seventies,when all we had was Friday the 13th Part 1 (thank you Kevin Bacon), this was a welcome surprise to the genre. That Bruce Campbell was willing to get his ass kicked as a primer to the sequel is beside the point; the original movie is undeniably prescient, for a thousand more would follow. And as bad ass as the beginning scene is in this remake, it can't make up for the loss of the original horror/comedy aspect. This is the remake's elemental mistake, trying to make a horror/comedy into a horror movie. This should not be a horror movie. It should be a laugh fest when Bruce Campbell says, ""Chainsaw,"" which is utterly missing in this rather pathetic remake. Take a look at Evil Dead 2, especially the scene where Bruce hammers in the cross to his beloved Linda in the grave below. That is the essence of what is not replicated in this remake, which is why I give it 1 stars."

The sheer lack of acting skills, horrible special effects and lack of any common sense in the script has made an old classic into a modern nightmare. I don't know what they were thinking when they made this movie. I honestly felt retarded during the last hour of he movie. It was nothing but blood, bad acting, and annoying screaming from the stereotypical female characters in horror movies.

"torynspirit","1","7","11","11 August 2013"," Complete waste of time.
","I'm going to click the spoilers button because this is my first review on IMDb, that's how strongly I feel about this movie. Horror films, and supernatural horror, are pretty much my bread and butter. I will watch any and all of them. I even thoroughly enjoy B horror movies, and it's very rare that I can't find -something- enjoyable about a movie. This was one of those few. Now I'm not going to say how much it sucked compared to the original Evil Dead, because in my mind you just can't compare a remake to a cult classic. It's a cult classic for a reason, and it will never be topped. So this review is purely about the 2013 movie that happens to be called Evil Dead (and have a strangle similar plot). The story moved way too quickly in the beginning, it felt like the movie wanted to get to the juicy parts as fast a possible. The actual acting wasn't all that bad, for as little as it actually had. The plot was seriously underdeveloped in major areas, for example (I don't know if this counts as a spoiler) the cabin seemed to be owned by the family of the main characters, seeing as how it had pictures on the walls and stuff. Why make that change? Why make it a specific place related to the characters, rather than just a rented cabin or something? The absolute greatest disappointment for me personally came during one of the horror scenes. Tangent a little bit - I typically fall asleep to the Silent Hill film every night. I love the sound of the air siren, and I think it's incredibly iconic. So imagine my surprise when my ears perk up at the sound of an air siren in Evil Dead. It only went once, and I figured I must be mistaken. Until the next horror scene, when it was used again. And again. And again. For a crystal clear example, listen right at the beginning of the credits. That is what killed this movie for me, no pun intended. I can handle bad acting, laughable dialogue, campy special effects. But get your own hooks please (again, no pun intended). Yes, Silent Hill made a common air siren creepy (well, creepier, since I live near a nuclear reactor and if I ever hear that sound in my daily life I am most certainly screwed), but that's a Silent Hill thing. Like Freddy's claws on metal, Chucky's laugh, that suspenseful tune from Jaws, and even going outside the genre, the sound of the Tardis, a TIE Fighter, D'oh!, et cetera. All of the iconic films and shows have their own sound effect or noise that, even if you've never seen the movie or show, you'll instantly recognize. So new Evil Dead movie, if you have a sequel, as the end credits audio and scene seem to imply, please don't use any air sirens. Try the teleporter noise from Star Trek instead."

","If you get off on constant gore without any degree of interesting storyline, if you don't mind knowing what's coming next and you can pretty much guess what's coming after that etc, then congratulations, this film is for you.<br/><br/>I skived off work to watch this, it was so boring that at 20 minutes from the end of the film for which I had a free ticket, I was seriously contemplating whether to just walk out and miss the end. In hindsight, I wouldn't have missed much.<br/><br/>The characters are not likable, I really didn't care whether they lived or died.<br/><br/>Summary: Worst film I've seen for ages and I'm easily pleased.<br/><br/>PS, I have nothing against gory movies per se, but this film has nothing else."

","There is nothing nice to say about this film. It is yet another modern mutilation of a classic cult horror film. What were they thinking? The over-the-top gore was sickening and took away from the underlying plot, which was pretty non-existent. There also doesn't seem to be a clear time line presented. It had nothing from the original Evil Dead, save the nature-rape scene, which Sam Raimi has admitted he was ashamed of. So they decided to take away the campiness, the humor, the original low-budget horror feeling, and they leave in the one scene the original creator is embarrassed by. And then there is the whole drug withdraw storyline which muddles up the film even more. There is no work done in creating a bond with the characters, and what little effort is put into it just makes you like them even less. Great job guys, not. What a waste of time."

"DonFishies","7","113","277","23 March 2013"," A satisfying and brutally bloody mess of a remake
","When I initially heard about a remake to Evil Dead, I was a little disappointed. I was never a huge fan of the original film, but the sequels remain two of the most wildly entertaining films I have ever seen. With my doubts in mind, everything changed the moment I saw the first red-band trailer. And now after catching a screening of the film last week, I wonder why I doubted Fede Alvarez's re-imagining in the first place.<br/><br/>Five friends venture to a cabin to help Mia (Jane Levy) kick her drug habit. Things are not as they seem from the very start, but it only gets worse after Mia's claims she was attacked by a demon in the forest. Her friends just think she is adjusting badly to going cold turkey, but strange occurrences start to take place within the cabin, and it quickly becomes obvious that Mia is not quite herself. <br/><br/>I went in with low expectations, but Alvarez does a great job bringing the film to life. It hints at and replays certain key moments from the original series, but for the most part, Evil Dead is very much its own individual thing: a re-imagining that exists all on its own. The story is not all too important here, but it does more than enough to move the film along from beginning to end; something the horror remake genre has botched all too often. Better yet, Evil Dead never feels like it is struggling to live up to lofty comparisons, and seems very content at having fun mercilessly torturing these five young people. Fans will love seeing how Alvarez reinterprets some of the franchise's most popular scenes, but non-fans will still get a hint of glee seeing just how depraved the film quickly becomes. It may take a while to get there, but it never lets up afterwards.<br/><br/>The trailers and marketing elements suggest that the film is terrifying. Indeed the trailer was absolutely horrifying. But I found myself not so much scared as why I was mortified by some of the kills and ludicrous ideas inflicted on the cast. I say ideas mainly because some things that happen should result in a criminal diagnosis on everyone involved. The film is definitely not for the squeamish, and revels in the amount of blood and gore it spills at every turn. It uses the original franchise as a barometer, and then throws it out the window in favour of being more ""inventive"" and eclectic with its choices. The trailers may have prepared you for some of the brutality, but it only hints at the lingering after-effects. Expect to hear a lot about the vivid and fully realized makeup effects – they are so much better than you could have ever imagined, and are light-years ahead of the minuscule CGI effects employed during the film.<br/><br/>For how enjoyable and loving a tribute this re-imagining is to Raimi's work, there is still plenty wrong with it. Roque Baños' score, although tense throughout, is way too serious and overbearing for the film. It helps create plenty of frightening moments sprinkled generously throughout the film, but I feel like it belonged in a much different film. It never gels quite properly with the tone of the film, and feels off even in the minute sections where it does work. Much the same goes for the prologue that opens the film – a totally new invention of Alvarez and crew. It tries to set the tone for what is coming, and tries its very best to totally set itself apart from the original films (even going so far as to introduce an actual ""identity"" to the demons possessing the precocious young adults), but ends up feeling totally out of place. About halfway through the film, I forgot it even happened because of how little it affects what comes after. Why bother adding it in the first place?<br/><br/>While I take issue with a number of idiosyncrasies involving a bizarre third act twist I should have seen coming, my bigger concern is with the characterization of everyone except Mia. Their driving force is to help her get better and rid her of her drug dependency, but they seem to have no other motivations outside of that. Lou Taylor Pucci's character Eric unleashes the demons in the first place, but he never really gives any hint of why he commits this act of malice or even how he can read it so well. Elizabeth Blackmore's Natalie is a glorified stage prop, frequently disappearing for whole scenes at a time, only to reappear when the film suddenly needed her to be on hand for reaction shots. The only reason I had any idea of who this character is supposed to be was because she shows up with Fernandez at the beginning of the film. Should she have already been hanging out at the cabin, I do not think we would have been afforded that luxury. <br/><br/>But I digress. For what it is, and for what I can only assume most people expected, Evil Dead is a satisfying, albeit bloody mess of a movie. It does enough right, and does an admirable job being its own film – as opposed to coasting along on the tail of the original film. With a little bit more work, this could have been a significantly greater film. But whether you look at it as pieces or in the sum of its parts, it is more than worthwhile to see.<br/><br/>7.5/10."
"simplisticreviewsblogspo","8","102","252","2 April 2013"," Good remake, or clever pseudo-sequel?
","Review by Matt:<br/><br/>I'm not one for April Fool's pranks. I find them annoying, stupid, and most of the time, ridiculous. But there are times when one happens, and its wonderful. It's even better when you are going to see one of the most classic horror films of all time, 1981's ""The Evil Dead"" with Bruce Campbell in the audience introducing the film and conducting a Q&A after it's conclusion. It's even better when the film starts, gets about a minute in, and the film breaks, revealing the trick, which I had a sneaking suspicion was coming. April Fool's, you're not here to watch ""The Evil Dead"" '81, you're here to watch ""Evil Dead"" 2013. Truly, truly awesome, and now I'm lucky enough to bring you kids a review of the as-of-yet- unreleased ""Evil Dead"" remake, which is an ode to everything wonderful and right with horror remakes.<br/><br/>Everything you've heard about ""Evil Dead"" is warranted; it's a brutal, bloody, gory, sick, twisted, squirm-inducing nightmare; in the best way possible. While, as a rule, horror remakes are usually unnecessary, I really thought ""The Evil Dead"" was in need of a tune-up. Coming out three years after ""Halloween"" and merely a year after the genre game- changer ""Friday the 13th,"" ""Dead"" made it's mark as The Ultimate Experience in Grueling Terror. It was low-budget, gritty, and a new take on the slasher genre. It had the demonic spirit of ""The Exorcist"" but the wink-wink-nod-nod of ""Friday the 13th"" and even some old Herschel Gordon Lewis films. However, if you look at ""Dead"" now, it seems dated. You can tell that it only took them about $300,000.00 to make the film. Still, I believe in keeping a classic, a classic, and not messing with a good thing. Come some 30 years and two sequels later, a new vision of ""Evil Dead"" is about to be unleashed nationwide, and with the blessing of Sam Raimi and Mr. Bruce Campbell, I can honestly say we got a winner.<br/><br/>While keeping with the spirit of the original film, we follow five teens who have decided to head out to the middle of nowhere to a cabin in the woods. The added twist this time around is that they are there for an intervention for Mia, played by Jane Levy, who could be America's newest Scream Queen, a heroin-addict who just suffered an overdose. I liked the fact that the teens are in the woods for a reason, because in films like these you always get a lot of red herrings, namely the Necronomicon, which is unnamed in this version, but you should know what the Necronomicon is at this point, where you have to suspend disbelief nearly the entire film, and don't worry, you'll have to do it anyway for most of this movie, in a good way.<br/><br/>While the story is reasonably strong for the genre, the violence and gore is ramped up to 11, and it's wonderful. The gore effects are great, and I was surprised to see that WETA was behind some of the work, and it makes sense, because some of the effects are right out of ""Dead/Alive,"" before Peter Jackson got all Hollywood on us genre fans.<br/><br/>As a horror film, ""Evil Dead"" is fine, a bloody-romp in the vein of what most people are used to out of the horror genre these days. As a remake, one of the best ones made. And while I use the term ""remake,"" ""Dead"" is more like a re-imagining of the original. There are various odes to Raimi's masterwork, including our heroine wearing a Michigan State sweater, to the old car that she is also sitting on. We even get some chainsaw, yes, a chainsaw, what would an ""Evil Dead"" movie be without some chainsaw. With all that being said, if you're a purist, go into ""Evil Dead"" with an open mind, and have fun with it; there are plenty of odes to the original, and if you're new to the world of Ash and the Deadites, do your homework and watch ""The Evil Dead,"" ""Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn"" and ""Army of Darkness"" (the primitive screw-head next to me kept calling it ""Evil Dead 3."" I wanted to tell him to go home because his mom called, and he had chores to do, plus it was a school night). 2013's ""Evil Dead."" In a world full or remakes and bad ideas, its nice to see they got something right. Hail to the King, baby.....<br/><br/>Check out more reviews at simplisticreviews.blogspot.com"
"adamscastlevania2","Null","2","2","20 March 2015"," Perfectly acceptable horror, but it's no future classic
","(53%) A remake of a horror comedy classic, only with almost all the comedy removed, and most of the fun, and the low budget charm, the crazy trippy scenes of madness, Bruce Campbell, the black humour, all with the added fact that this will be largely forgotten about an hour or a so after watching while the original can be played vividly in my mind scene by scene from beginning to end. So as a remake I'd stick with hugely fun Evil Dead 2, but with all that's been said this is still an okay watch. It doesn't add anything to it by saying this is the highest quality of all the Evil Dead movies, mainly because here they had a budget of over $100 to spend, but this is well shot with good production values and some very graphic blood and gore. And by the end that's the only thing you'll be able to slightly remember from this throwaway rehash of low budget horror perfection."

","As modern Horror movies go, there are a few schools of thought: Make an original movie, make another equal to an established franchise or do a complete reboot. This film falls into the latter. The original ""The Evil Dead"" has become something of a cult classic, and rightfully o as it is a tastefully delivered horror flick that did things a bit differently. As such this movie was released to an established fan base and did quite well at the box office. <br/><br/>The reboot, simply titled ""Evil Dead"" borrow only two elements from the original: The name and the gore. Beyond that, there are very few similarities to the original. <br/><br/>Story: Five friends go to a Cabin In The Woods to help one of them overcome her drug addiction. However, while there they discover a ""Book Of The Dead"". After reading from it, demons possess and try to kill them all. <br/><br/>Good Points: This is a well made, well produced movie with a somewhat interesting, if uninspired, score. The filmography and the special effects are carried out in a way that glues together well. The acting is on par for the horror genre, though there are no gold stars being handed out here for them or the script. <br/><br/>Bad Points: The original was funny, gory, great entertainment and made on a tiny budget. This is only gory. I personally found it predictable and boring. Without seeing the original, I'm sure that'd be the case for most. This film appeared to me to be a montage of people falling over, trying to escape only using their arms and deaths that are aimed at the creative ""SAW"" franchise lovers.<br/><br/>The problem here is that nothing sets this movie apart, there is nothing to come here for that you can't get somewhere else. It lacks jump scares, it lacks suspense, the characters are written to do weird illogical things and the film winds up coming over just a bit silly for something trying to be so serious. <br/><br/>It won't be keeping me up at night.<br/><br/>5/10. A reasonable effort, though."

","The best review for this was by Admarple on p.48.<br/><br/>I'll just add that this movie is relentless horror until a complete switch of tone at about 75 mins - the mood music goes all violins and we end up with a different hero. I suspect the producers overruled the director. So the Three Labours of Hercules (MacGyver style) that had been set earlier in the movie went to the sister instead of the brother. Basically turned into a chick flick, with a Caravaggio chainsaw slaughter at the end.<br/><br/>Not sure it was worth remaking, even with a more grim/less camp approach - nothing really original added, although the addiction rehab was a good idea that didn't have time to develop. And the blond was mysteriously pointless - did she die? I forget.<br/><br/>I was thinking 7/10 halfway through, but it ended up as a 5."
"falcolnpunch","2","2","2","23 January 2014"," Give Me Back My (Cash in) Hand!
","Let me start by saying that I am a massive Evil Dead fan, and believe that Evil Dead II is one of the greatest sequels ever. With that said, I went in to the Evil Dead Remake, boomstick in hand ready to shoot myself when I sensed a bad movie.<br/><br/>Evil Dead 2013 continues Hollywood's sluggish attempt to bring back every horror movie you ever loved and squash it, taking as much joy and charm away from its original film that it actually pains you. Surely, they would have learned from My Bloody Valentine 3D, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>The story here is pretty much the same, and actually probably more coherent to begin with than ED 1 & 2 - as five teens go to a Cabin In The Woods to support their drug addicted member through the next few days as she tries to go cold turkey. Unfortunately for her and the rest of Scooby Doo-esque gang of friends, an evil book is discovered... <br/><br/>The main problem with this film is its lack of charisma. All of the fresh faced leads are useless and stereotypical to the genre. Gone is the amazing/terrible acting display of the brilliant/awful Bruce Campbell, replaced instead with ""Shiloh Fernandez"". I'm fine with bad acting (look back at any of your favourite horror films - they will all have someone with the facial expressions of a tree, or ""Lacktors"" if you will), but apart from looking pretty, Fernandez has literally nothing otherwise that stops you from wanting to see him killed by something horrible in these evil woods. <br/><br/>Gone too is literally any kind of humour. hile ED2 had this bizarre twisted funny bone running through it, this movie doesn't even attempt it. No lines, no puppets, no deer head, nothing. This isn't a bad thing, because I'd argue that Army of Darkness (the third in the Evil Dead series) went a little too over the top. But not even a line? A sly reference to the original? Nope. Nothing. Going back to other bad horror remakes, I can remember that even Friday the 13th 2009 had a few stabs (!) at it. <br/><br/>On saying that, I did laugh twice at unintentionally hysterical parts, both involving Jane Levy. Our addicted heroine of sorts, while becoming possessed, she witnesses lots of strange things, and just look out for her reflection... it's stupidly hilarious. <br/><br/>Which leads me on to the deaths. This film was given an 18 certificate in the UK, something so rare these days, which'll be a result of this being actually a mash up of both ED part 1 and 2, pilfering the best bits from both of them. With that comes lots of the makeshift weapons used in both, tweaked ever so slightly. Like the originals, this movie's best moments come from the practical effects: lots of blood, tongues, hands, etc, with one scene involving a razor blade standing out, and giving you your only scene where you stop and go ""Wow, that's not terrible and looks actually quite good"". Unfortunately, that is the only highlight. Otherwise, each death is really rather flat, dull even.<br/><br/>If you want to do a remake involve George Romero (Dawn of the Dead 2004 and The Crazies 2010 were both inferior but great), otherwise please please stay away, as films like this are straight up painful to sit through.<br/><br/>In the Evil Dead movies the characters are possessed by evil spirits and turned in to monsters. It's just a shame Evil Dead 2013 has been taken over by something so unscary, lifeless and frankly boring that it makes you want to cut off your own hand and chase yourself out of the cinema with it. <br/><br/>@JonnyJonJon1"

","To say this is a bad film is just plain wrong. It's not bad at all. Not a classic, but not as bad as everybody is making out. <br/><br/>Where this movie falls down, and where it always was going to fall down, is too many people regard the original as a classic. It doesn't take a genius to work out, if you're going to make a remake/reboot/re-imagining of a movie, don't chose a cult classic. No matter how good your remake, it will always be slated. I don't hold the original in such high regard. Yeah, it was a new take on an old genera, and it had some, then, good effects, and the cinematography was pretty clever, as were all of Sam Raimi's early films. But classic. I think not. I feel the 2nd Evil Dead film was loads better. And as for people slagging this remake off for bad acting do you remember the original?<br/><br/>OK. This movie. Yeah it is pretty gory. But wasn't as bad as I was expecting. The general feel to the movie is unpleasant. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, especially for a horror movie. But there wasn't the underlying humour of the original, and moreover its sequel. I think that's where this version fell down a little. Played it a little too straight faced, and therefore was nothing new. In fact that was my biggest problem with the movie. It was nothing new. It had some well- paced set pieces but lacked any real tension and peril. You didn't really care about the characters, so didn't really care much to what happened to them.<br/><br/>On the plus side, I felt the cinematography was pretty good, and added to the underlying ""unpleasant"" feel of the movie. The effects were good. And yeah, I'd say the acting was OK too. Don't believe all the bad reviews.<br/><br/>All in all, a perfectly watchable horror movie, with some pretty good moments. But a word to the wise. In future don't remake a cult classic. IE. Don't remake the second Evil Dead movie, The Exorcist, The Shining . Yeah I know they remade it as a TV series, but you get the idea."
"mm-39","5","13","25","12 April 2013"," Run of the mill horror movie!
","Evil Dead is a run of the mill horror movie which the remake lives off the past name! Evil Dead has minor character development and the viewer cares little for the cast. The film has more gore then scare. One is more creeped out than scared. Not much film tension with very little scare build up. One sees everything before the scare happens, and the scare build up is done by the numbers. However, there is a few creepy or gross moments. The acting was okay, but I ended up hating all the characters. They have left the movie open ended so they will have the option of creating a sequel. Maybe it will be like Saw or Friday the 13th where they run with the money and make continual parts. I give Evil Dead a five out of ten. My wife says a five out of ten is generous. A slow spring for movies."
"apboyer","9","111","287","15 March 2013"," Finally, a remake done right.
","The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience? That may be a bit hyperbolic (it looks good on the poster) but this new Evil Dead is certainly a lot of fun. The movie starts off with a bang (quite literally) and then we join our five 20 somethings on their way to the cabin in the woods. This time around they're not there to engage in partying and sex. Mia's friends and her brother David (the first letter of each of their names spells out DEMON) have dragged her to their mother's old cabin as a drug free, get clean retreat. The movie doesn't quite seem sure if it wants to be an addiction allegory with Mia literally fighting her demons or if it just wants to use her heroin addiction as an excuse for why these characters are at the cabin and later, why none of Mia's friends believe her when weird things begin to happen.<br/><br/>The film's biggest flaw is that it amps you up at the beginning and then introduces quite a bit of exposition. We hear a lot about Mia's addiction, how David left her with her mother...etc. etc. While I'm not opposed to a horror movie fleshing out it's characters, it only seems to care about fleshing out two (the others are just Deadites waiting to happen) and it does so with a decent amount of downtime before the horror. I read a review that stated that the original Evil Dead films had characters who were defined by how they handled and reacted to the horror, not what happened before the horror and I believe this is the re-make's biggest sin. Yet even the exposition is made tolerable by clever winks at what's to come.<br/><br/>Exposition aside, this film does SO much right. Winks at the original films are all over the place, from Raimi's car to Mia sporting a Michigan State sweatshirt, to a necklace that looks awfully similar to Linda's in the original Evil Dead. Oh yeah and one word: chainsaw.<br/><br/>The movie revs up once Eric (the third most fleshed out character after Mia and David) discovers the Necronomicon. This Necronomicon looks less like a face stretched across a book and more like someone sewed several chunks of flesh together. When Eric finds it it is wrapped in a plastic bag and barbed wire. This doesn't turn Eric away any more than the writing carved in the book explicitly telling him not to read the incantations. In fact Eric takes a rubbing of the crossed out translations.<br/><br/>It is then that all hell breaks loose. Throughout the movie the Necronomicon shows pictures of each stage of horror. At times you wish the book didn't spoil what was going to happen but other times it adds to the tension. One scene in particular works especially well because the book has shown you what is going to happen.<br/><br/>While the movie isn't exactly ""terrifying"" it is often cringe inducing and those looking for blood, gore and practical effects will find a lot to love here. For those fans of the original who can't fathom a remake, especially without Bruce Campbell's Ash, give it a shot. This is what every recent horror movie remake should have been, a loving homage to the original film.<br/><br/>P.S. Stay after the credits. It's Groovy."

This isn't some complex script, its a simple, fun horror movie that is not necessarily a remake but a re-imagining of the original (which I watched after seeing this version to compare the two) It actually takes parts from both Evil Dead I and II and combines them in parts but the basics with the Book of the Dead and the possession of the people at the cabin remain the same.<br/><br/>Also be sure to stick around for the credits and after the credits for a couple special throwbacks to the original."

","Evil Dead takes everything that was great about the original and makes it amazing. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the best horror film I have ever seen; and as a big horror fan, that means a lot. Evil Dead tells the story of five friends who end up trapped in a cabin with an evil demon after one of them accidentally releases it from a book. This film is perfect Lovecraftian style horror. Even alluding to Lovecraft's work by calling the book ""Necronomicon"" which H.P. Lovecraft fans will recognize as the focal point to many of his stories.<br/><br/>While Evil Dead perpetually borders the line between frightening and ridiculous, it does so in a way that keeps you from laughing at the absurdity of it while forcing you to cringe and scream. The story is a simple,yet upgraded version of the Evil Dead storyline we all know. The plot differs in many points but most of the iconic scenes are present or at least alluded to. I strongly felt the storyline was more greatly developed than I had expected and you truly want the characters to survive, unlike in the original. The sub-plot between the siblings gives Evil Dead real heart.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is (Expectedly) violent and gory. I would not recommend taking children to see it, as there are many disturbing scenes. This film is far more graphic than the original ""The Evil Dead,"" but we should expect that considering the advancements in technology since 1981. The differences between the two films visually are not unlike the technological/visual differences between ""The Thing"" (1982) and ""The Thing"" (2011). The effects are enjoyable to look at; albeit frightening at times; however, because it is a reboot, there is a wonderful feeling that you've seen many of the events before, though this time they look better.<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly good for the genre, and the film makes several nods to ""The Evil Dead,"" most notable being the soundtrack, inclusion of a shotgun, fruit cellar, and of course, chainsaw. However, the book unfortunately does not have a face on its cover. There is not a single negative thing I can say about this movie. The absolute best part is the climax. It differs so greatly from the original that I did not expect it in the slightest. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for the entire 10 - 15 minutes (?) it takes up.I honestly believe Evil Dead tops the original in nearly every way (And I loved the original). It was clearly a labour of love for the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is worth your money. All of your money. Watch it a hundred times."

","Fellow horror fans, this is the movie you have been waiting for. This  is the gory horror film that is unlike any other film you have ever  seen! Most gory films have one or two really gory scenes, but Evil Dead  has gore throughout the entire film, beginning to end. Evil Dead is the  ultimate bloody roller-coaster that all of us horror junkies have been  waiting for and it does not disappoint. Evil Dead is not only creepy,  scary and gory, but it is phenomenally perfect. The acting is  excellent, the cinematography is beautiful and the minor details are  perfection. I am confident that you will enjoy yourself, if you truly  love horror and gore. Evil Dead is the ultimate gore-fest!   Here are a couple of tips to prepare you for the Evil Dead experience:  1. Don't eat before you see the film 2. Stay till the very end. There  is a special cameo after the credits. 3. Dress comfortable enough to  squirm in your seat 4. Duck Tape is an unexpected hero (you'll  understand after you watch) 5. And prepare yourself to witness the  perfect American horror movie!"

","I saw an advanced screening of Evil Dead in San Diego and this was one wild ride! First off, don't go in expecting the greatest character development. If you go into this movie looking for character development and such, you are sadly not in the right mindset. Remember how you approached the Evil Dead trilogy? Did you look for character development there? You go for the pure entertainment with the horror, laughs, and gore. This remake, it's the same sort of approach, only it's a huge emphasis on the gore. The gore really delivers in gallons here as there is not a single moment that is dull. Once things start going crazy, they never let up and this movie just becomes insane.<br/><br/>Was it a scary movie? Well, people did scream. I got chills on some parts, and you are constantly on the edge of your seat as you just don't know what to anticipate with each ticking second. I'd say it can be labeled as pretty scary at times.<br/><br/>The acting was solid all across the board. Levy gives the best performance as Mia. She really made you love or hate her and it was to both extremes. The characters were likable overall, despite you not really getting to know them all too well. Then again, did you get to know all of the characters that well in the original Evil Dead? You did not and it is a cult classic. There were some nods to the originals, but I will not say what they were as I feel everyone should experience it.<br/><br/>This movie was an awesome ride with all kinds of blood and crazy moments. This movie will stick with you and it won't completely sink in because, let's face it, you're eager to see the next installment in the Evil Dead franchise. Typing this review, I can say that this movie has not completely sunk in. Great stuff! As for the post-credits, I say ask yourself: would you stay after the credits for a Marvel movie? That should give you a good idea there."
"creedreaper","9","90","236","2 April 2013"," This is how you Reebot a classic with Low Budget
","First of all if you are fan of the original one, then you would know that the Evil Dead's tradition is always been to make a really scary movie with a low budget. And yes they followed the same tradition with this one, but it is impossible to say that this movie was on a budget because it purely just DELIVERED!!! I wouldn't call this to be a reboot/remake, this was more like a really good sequel and filled in a lot of holes left in the original one. Although the story had some similarities with the original, but a lot of new stuff.<br/><br/>I'll be honest I was really nervous that they wouldn't live upto it and by the end I was really happy to say they really lived upto it. I really felt the lady actresses did an awesome job, guys could've done little better but trust me that's the least of your worries once you enter the Evil Dead World. The mood of the film was perfect,it basically complimented the original one in every aspect.<br/><br/>Bruce Campbell, you should take a bow. He started this cult with Sam Raimi and produced this new Evil Dead with all respects to the classic. He made sure the audiences would cringe every time. And the best way to know this is when you see weak hearted people getting up and leaving during the gore scenes.<br/><br/>So let this be a caution for you. This is not just your average horror movie. It's on a whole new league of horror and you must have a strong mindset to watch everything.<br/><br/>Overall I am sooooo happy that after 32 years later, this movie remains alive. I really hope they go through with the trilogy again like last time."

","I get it. I get that all of you die-hard oldschool horror fans out there were upset that they went and made a remake when the original was awesome, because I agree. Many are critical of the effects, or the acting, knowing full well that the original didn't have either of those, and that's not what made it great. If you can manage to pry yourself off your high horse and try to assess this remake on its own merits instead of just comparing it to the original, I think you'll find that the film is better than some would lead you to believe.<br/><br/>I found this film refreshing in that it's a modern take on the more traditional horror genre we grew up on and have been deprived of in the last 20 years. That is what Evil Dead has always been about, the epic horror story! In a lousy horror world of mock-umentaries and first person camcorder BS, its nice to relive a decent horror story with some gory 21st century updates. It's easily one of the better new wave horror films I've seen, probably because it is oldschool at its core.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time comparing the two, just enjoy them both! I think you'll find either film to be more entertaining than another regurgitated blair witch-esque ghost/demon film or ""people who torture people for fun"" junk horror."

If you want to see a modern offshoot that re-imagines the film (This does NOT mean that it does it as good or better than the original!!!!) then this is worth seeing. So what if it has cliché moments here and there? ALL new horror films seem to draw from the same bag of tricks (The Conjuring being the most successful so far) so the techniques here should come as no surprise. Gore, check. A few jump-scares, check. Depth in writing, not really. But, hey, it is what it is. I expected much less when I rented this and quite honestly, it could have been much, much worse. THERE IS NO ASH AND NO BRUCE CAMPBELL. SO FREAKIN' WHAT?!? Take it for what it is or stop your whining people. It's not an award-winner. It's good old gory horror fun. Take it or leave it. And by the way...if the only negatives you have are based off the original, get over it. This didn't claim to be a scene-by-scene remake, and I'm sure that even if it was and even if the almighty Bruce Campbell was the lead actor you would still have some sort of bone to pick.

","I do understand that some people are angry with this movie for various reasons. People are eager for the Evil Dead series to continue, so while there was always talk of that happening (right now there is an entry for Army of Darkness 2 for a 2016 release), a remake came first. A remake that the director didn't want Bruce Campbell to be associated with, so he could do his own thing. Something some fans surely didn't appreciate either of course.<br/><br/>But cutting ties does make sense in this case. And while I'm a big fan of Bruce Campbell and would have loved to see him in here somewhere, I do respect the directors choice of not wanting that to happen. There is also the fact, that the movie tries to be as serious as possible. So it's more like the first Evil Dead than the movies that came after it. And it sort of works too, if you let yourself into it. Is there one particular character that is more than annoying and does things you could/should kill him for? Yes, but judging the whole movie just on that premise would be unfair to it and wouldn't help your viewing experience. Whatever the case, the movie has good effects, it's nicely told and acted too.

","Please, I am begging all of you not to see this movie. It is not because I especially care how people waste their time but my fear is that if many viewers watch this crap and even worse - like it - then companies are going to make that kind of horrors again and again and again. And what I mean by ""that kind of horror""? Basically the formula works like this: introduce a group of young people with girls wearing always something super tight and made wet by some incident in the plot which is really a cheap trick of writers; acting skills are optional; gather all characters in a lonely cabin in the woods with only one road which is cut off right away. By the way, where are those cabins? If anyone has seen some recently, then perhaps alert the government and they could be given to those who had lost their houses in the recession. Another important element of the formula is to avoid any substantial conversations which may conflict with super heavy amount of action with people screaming and running constantly and instead limit the dialogue to few self-explanatory statements such as:""something is wrong here"", ""Oh my God!"", ""let's get out of here"", "" ""you will all die tonight"" or ""fuck you Satan!... There must be lots of black,greenish substance pouring out from mouth of the cursed; there will be blood, dirty water,mud,broken glass, ugly faces appearing all of a sudden in mirrors to be met with yet another scream,doors which always close and very strange trees without leaves. There also should be a few mythical genetically deformed Ozark type of creeps to run after characters, or just watch them through windows and maybe eat their flesh. And let's us not forget about The Book which gives answers only young do not read nowadays with the exception of one guy in glasses. It is always a nerdy type who knows first The Truth and tries to warn others but he is being ridiculed until it is already too late. In my opinion The Devil should communicate via cell phones or text messages. Even Vatican uses Internet. And really Satan! - those old hints with shadows, axes, dead dogs and heroine speaking in tongues are becoming a bit tired, don't you think so? I strongly suggest that you do some makeover of your helpers and modernize the way you communicate with victims. Now dear viewer, if you need to watch this movie because you want to avoid mowing lawn,doing dishes or you can't sleep (my case) - then, there are all legitimate reasons for watching this colossal waste of money. Otherwise, avoid it at any cost and rather read the Holy Bible or the Communist Manifesto. Or knit yourself a nice pair of mittens or tea cozy. Enough said."

It takes some new turns so it's not a complete plagiarism, and it still manages to set the setting completely right. I didn't laugh once though, which was a shame, because I found all the other Evil Dead movies to be hilarious (even the first one). This one therefore takes a much more serious tone, which is not bad... but I liked the fact that the Evil Dead movies could be so silly but it didn't take away the disturbing content in them. This one just abandoned that. But, it has tons of gruesome and disturbing moments that will please the fans of this genre! <br/><br/>So, why the low score then? Because Bruce Campbell. This was such a dumb idea to reboot, seriously. Ash was the character who made the movies so much more entertaining, and without him, this just feels like our typical gory teen movie with bland characters that could have used its ambition (which it does have in my opinion) on something else more interesting.<br/><br/>However, it's one of the more gruesome flicks I've seen in a while, so I give them that."

The reason you remake a film is because the original (in this case Sam Raimi's classic Evil Dead II, not Evil Dead) is so memorable and powerful that you attempt/hope to recreate some of that magic (unless you're just trying to cash in on the name which is the only excuse for this crap). The writers and director of this film have no idea why Sam Raimi's film is so great. And that is obvious 10 minutes into this awful version. If the makers of this crappy version are reading this let me educate you. Evil Dead II is a classic because Raimi paces and shoots the film is such a way that the audience never gets to catch their breath. There's a million gory bloody kids get cut up in the woods movies, that's not interesting. What Raimi did was frantic camera shots, one after the other, unusual, bizarre, different, making it almost impossible to guess what would happen next. This film moves at the pace of a bloody slug. The director of this mess needs to go back to film school."

","I gave this one three stars b/c some of the gore was good and gory. Otherwise, I would have given it 0 stars but gore takes work, so I threw them a bone. However,if you have no plot and no characters, it's hard to give a sh**t or feel anything when the gore hits you. Would it kill these guys to even pretend to create something passable as plot. The big setup here is one of the girls is going cold turkey at their long forgotten cabin in the woods. The cabin was so clearly a set and the lighting so bright it ruined any sort of atmosphere. There are no characters at all. They didn't even try to give the characters any motivation except scream yell and bleed. That Shiloh Fernandez was the worst of the acting bunch. Don't waste your DVD rental on this one. I did. I regret it."

","--There aren't really any spoilers, but if you don't want to know anything, you shouldn't be reading reviews anyway. Just in case: This review may spoil basic plot details about a movie without much of a plot to begin with.<br/><br/>This movie absolutely sucked. A terrible remake, with a bunch of favorable ""rent-a-reviews"" designed to increase box office numbers. It was chock full of awful dialog, ridiculous new ""rules"" and theology, added due to lack of creativity, quality new ideas, and writing in general. It had completely pointless, and undeveloped characters (especially unforgivable considering this is a remake, and already had character foundations from which to build).<br/><br/>This pile of crap was an unfocused mess created to make money off the backs of fans of the original, while containing unintentionally cartoon-ish gore, and the vocabulary of a troubled 13 year old, in order to appeal to the younger generation of horror fans. There was barely enough decent footage to make an appealing trailer, which admittedly got me out to see this in the theaters to begin with. <br/><br/>Anything new added, outside of the original, was so weak that even a novice horror fan would find it cringe worthy. I know this was a work of fiction, yet within this fictional universe, there was way too much reliance on suspension of disbelief to find it even mildly entertaining.<br/><br/>The script was riddled with profane dialog (which I'm normally not against) in a futile attempt to be ""edgy."" Even the gore was too silly, forced, and added nothing to the suspense or horror. Any nods to fans of the original were also forced, and out of place. <br/><br/>The ""junkie trying to get clean"" aspect was poor excuse to initiate the story, and didn't carry as much weight as it needed to be a major plot point. (Besides, it's 2013, who does heroin anymore anyway? Haha!) <br/><br/>Sadly, this ""movie"" did well enough in box office numbers to justify all of us having to suffer through another sequel. Even though I will be boycotting all subsequent releases of Evil Dead (outside of a continuation of the original series, which at this point, especially with Drag Me to Hell, and the fact that this remake has the Campbell/Raimi seal of approval, will probably be a stinker) even the idea of them continuing this excuse of a remake with a follow up, sickens me.<br/><br/>The fact that a 33 year old movie on a shoestring budget, that was a directors first feature, blows a fully produced movie, with a well paid writer, modern technology, and a decent budget, out of the water should be a shame felt by the entire cast and crew. How anyone could have enjoyed this, even if they had never seen the original, thus had no high expectations, is beyond me."

","Brilliant. I enjoyed it a lot, and was scared- Only reason really being jump scenes, though. Despite knowing most of them were coming, they still made me jump! The lack of CGI made it even better, more... 'Believable'. I really enjoyed the lack of CGI, it really was rather convincing. I enjoyed it a lot, and I sat through the credits because I liked it so much. Not better than the original, for the original holds a place in my heart as a classic film-- But if you are disregarding it's relation to the original Evil Dead trilogy, you can say honestly, it's a great movie. I am easily pleased with horror flicks, I will admit. But this was probably one of the few movies to scare me, and I loved it. I hope they have an uncut DVD version to come out, I'd love to watch that. I'm very excited for the rumored sequels, and hope to see more work from Sam Raimi and Alvarez soon."

IMDb ratings to date are 9.8 for 18-and-under, 8.0 for aged 18-29, 7.1 for 30-44 and 7.5 for 45-older.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a mathematician to figure out what's going on with this reboot: The people who loved the original refuse to like this one, and those who either haven't seen or don't care about the original love the reboot on its own terms, and for the same reasons. Like it or not, the flavor of movies and genres change just like everything else, and the bloody/campy horror of the 1980s just isn't the horror of today. Kids (and kids ARE the target audience for this reboot, aging hipsters) relate to the world differently than we do. They have a whole different catalog of experiences and expectations for horror, and they're scared of different things.<br/><br/>I'm 32, so I'm right on the line of Gen X and the Millennials, and I didn't see the original until 15 years after it came out. I liked it, and I knew it was a great horror movie, but I didn't worship it like my older sister and her friends did. But, bear in mind that by the time I saw it, the first Scream movie was only a year away. Standards change, and so do people. And the simple fact is that this movie's target audience (teenagers and early-20s) love it on its own terms. That's the same thing people would have been forced to say about now-crotchety hipsters back in the 1980s.<br/><br/>The fact is, this is a great horror movie for our times, and for the audience it was meant for. Yes, if you're over 26, Evil Dead is ridiculously gory, seems soulless, contains gratuitous tree-torture-porn, and the actors are neither recognizable, interesting nor original. The thrills seem cheap, the action cynical and the dialog is a bit too self-consciously witty. But that's what this audience grew up with, and its what draws them in. To them, Scream is ""classic horror.""<br/><br/>So, as a wise man once said: If the music's too loud, you're too old."

While this is not in the realm of ""A Serbian Film"", ""cannibal Holocaust"" or films along those likes this stands its ground. I personally think that the characters were almost written to be bland so that when all hell is breaking loose they can convince when needed. Jane Levy is just amazing when it comes to portraying what absurdities that she has to go to. I will not say much more than that of the 1200 who attended the premier last night, a couple hundred left because they could not stomach the gore or intensity of the film. That is as matter of fact that I will get, with one thing. The tree scene in the original was taken to a whole new level in this movie. <br/><br/>While it is not the original film I am glad it did not try to remake it 100% but pays homage the way it needed and when the pace picked up it never let off the pedal.

After uttering the sacred words the Evil Dead return once again and this time it's not quite so laughable. The original movies were comical while this was straight up disturbing.

","¨No! You don't understand. There was something in the woods... and I think it's in here with us... now.¨<br/><br/>Hollywood has seemed to have run out of fresh ideas when it comes to making horror films and year after year they keep on bringing us either remakes of classic films or sequels. Evil Dead is perhaps one of the best known cult horror films of the 80's, and Sam Raimi has decided to produce this remake of his original film. Other horror remakes are coming out this year (like Carrie) so I don't think this will be a trend that is going to disappear anytime soon. Despite not being a horror fan I decided to watch this film because of newcomer Fede Alvarez, who made a name for himself in my home country of Uruguay with a music video titled Panic Attack where the capital city is completely destroyed by huge robots. Alvarez managed to accomplish this feat with a very low budget and he also directed some short films as well (El Cojonudo) which garnered the attention of some Hollywood people. Discovering Alvarez's potential they decided to put him in charge of the direction of Evil Dead, a film he himself claimed to have been influenced by as a child. I don't blame Alvarez for accepting this offer because anyone in his shoes would have done the same thing and it will probably help him grow in this industry, and perhaps in the future he will be able to produce his own personal projects. I appreciate the fact that Hollywood is looking for some outside talents, and in my opinion Alvarez doesn't disappoint here. It's impossible to remake a cult film like this and make it better, but somehow he manages to be unique in the midst of the predictability of the genre. He has proved to be very talented, but my problem with this film is that I really despise this genre so it was hard for me to criticize it fairly. I think these campy gory horror fests are all pretty much similar to each other and the only thing that really changes are the effects which over time become more realistic. This was just too gory for my taste and I never felt scared, only disgusted which isn't something I look forward to in a movie. I'm not a fan of the Evil Dead franchise so I can't honestly say if it lives up to the expectations of the fans. <br/><br/>The film is closely tied to the original film in that it involves a group of five friends who travel to a cabin in the middle of the woods and discover some mysterious book which summons the dead. Mia (Jane Levy) barely survived a drug overdose and her friends have decided to bring her to her family's old cabin in order for her to recover. Her friends, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), along with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) promise to do what it takes to keep her in the cabin no matter how bad her craving for drugs gets. This isn't the first time that Mia has suffered from a drug overdose, but her friends are determined it will be the last. Once they arrive at the cabin they smell a strange odor and find some dead animals in the cellar. Some kind of ritual has taken place and that is where Eric finds this strange book. He makes the big mistake of opening the book and reading out loud some strange passages. As soon as he does this something evil comes out of the woods and attacks Mia. That is where the horror begins to take place and all hell breaks loose. A storm prevents them from leaving and they are on their own against these evil forces. <br/><br/>Evil Dead is extremely gory, there is a lot of blood but hardly any scares. It also has some funny moments like in the original film, but it just didn't work for me. A much better movie is Cabin in the Woods which does some interesting things breaking the genre and taking it to new places. This version is an interesting homage and some fans will probably enjoy it, while others will hate it. In my opinion Alvarez's touch in this film makes it a little more tolerable, but I really don't like these type of films unless there is some originality. The performances were pretty strong for a gory film, I enjoyed Jane Levy's lead performance and Pucci also had some interesting and funny scenes. These characters are as stupid as pretty much every character we've seen in a horror movie. Who in their right mind would open a book like this and read the passages out loud in the middle of the woods? It is all part of the genre and we just have to play around with that fact. I really didn't care for these characters either; it was hard for me to empathize with anyone of them. I never felt like I was being transported into the movie, but the effects were pretty realistic and well done. If you are a fan of gore you might enjoy this.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I really don't get it what people are looking from movies nowadays. When I go to the cinema or when I read people's reviews on any kind of a horror film, I always stumble upon hearing/reading: ""pssh, this is not scary!"", ""omg, whatever, this is stupid"", ""this is not even realistic"". It is just dumb how people treat great stuff that have been done for them. It seems that people focus on the wrong things when it comes down to watching movies. There are actually hardly any realistic scenes in ANY MOVIE. And then there are people who hand out the ""the original was better!"" argument. I mean, seriously? - All the remakes and the originals are very different from each other, so what the hell are you expecting? <br/><br/>The movie:<br/><br/>Right away I felt taken by the movie when the intro started. The cinematography is done really well and has this artistic feel to it. The situations people go throughout the movie are tense. I like how everything is served. Didn't actually get into the details with the main story as it seems not to be a movie where you would need to. The location looks awesome and some of the best scenes take part in the woods. Jane Levy is doing a really good job in the movie. You can really tell how she tried to push herself to the limits without looking fake. And I think it is the hardest part with a horror film - to give out strong emotions like that. You can see it well during the situations when she is slowly becoming fully possessed. There are parts in the movie that do make me laugh but I'm still not sure if they're supposed to or not. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>There are some scenes which have this ""epic feel"" to them, but they don't really work out like they should. The huge amounts of blood should have looked a bit more realistic but regarding to the amounts they used in the movie, I can understand this downside. They have fixed some things in the DVD tho. <br/><br/>I give 9 out of 10 to this movie because I think they made the same mistake as ""The Purge"" did - TOO big promotion and TOO big promises before the movie is out makes people get TOO excited. Because people are right about the scariness in this movie. It is more of a tasty gore movie.<br/><br/>Otherwise I really, really enjoyed it. Went to see it 2 times in the cinema."

","There not much to expect out of a remake except total disappointment for the most part and that's what happened with this remake of a horror classic. This movie was terrible on many levels from the stupidity of blood rain to killing the person who's supposed to be Ash. Focusing on Mia who is having problems with drugs, death of mother and trying to bond with her brother David; this girl gives no reason why she should be important when she is depressing and over reacts to everything. Normally in a movie there is at least someone you can get behind and enjoy, but seeing this film there is no one that is enjoyable to watch. They should all die!!! Why is Natalie even in this movie? She doesn't even say much and makes the stupid decision of going down to the basement like the blonde bimbo she is and suffers big time. Who would've thought that David was the coward in this movie even though he's supposed to be the one that survives and becomes badass, but that's not the case here we got someone who thinks that this is some sort of virus from a dead cat instead of realizing that it's stupid to think that especially since a virus doesn't work this way as it does in the film. If anyone deserves to live in this film it's Eric because he was out through hell and basically suffered more than anyone else. When Mia gets brought back to life after being buried alive it made no sense as to why she didn't have any burns on her face from when she burned herself with the boiling water from the shower head plus David thought it would be a good idea to strip his sister down and put a red dress on her how thoughtful. In the last part of the film Mia becomes Ash because she uses the chainsaw and in a way tears her hand off what a way to show woman empowerment in a film that shouldn't even been made."

"ScottAmundsen","1","3","4","29 September 2015"," Boring Does Not Even Begin to Describe This Unnecessary Remake
","I approach today's onslaught of remakes with trepidation; ever since Gus Van Sant started the trend in 1999 with his dreadful carbon copy of PSYCHO, I usually avoid these retreads like the Bubonic Plague. And the remake of THE EVIL DEAD (1981), a film that I loved for both its audacity and its willingness to laugh at itself, really set my teeth on edge despite the imprimatur of both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>Long story short: They didn't do much with the basic plot (five college friends gather at a remote cabin in the woods and end up being possessed by demons living in those woods), except for throwing in a bit about one of their number being a drug addict and the reason for the gathering some sort of half-assed intervention.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is more or less a copy of the original; the elements are tossed around like vegetables in a salad, but the premise remains. What really gets me about this movie is that it is even more bloody and violent than the original and yet with all the action happening on the screen I found myself falling asleep.<br/><br/>The acting is somewhat better than the original, and so are the production values, but the overall look of the thing is grimy and dark; the original had a color palette made mostly of bright red and was much more brightly lit.<br/><br/>I was wondering if the remake would keep the notorious ""girl-gets- raped-by-a-tree-in-the-woods"" sequence. I was disappointed. It's sort of there, but it's a muted version of the sequence and it's so dark that it's hard to follow.<br/><br/>As in the original, nobody gets out alive. But the last half hour is painfully slow going and hard to follow. <br/><br/>My final analysis: I would never have thought that they could do a remake of the 1981 film that was MORE gory (in terms of blood this one makes the early film look tame; they're swimming in it) than the original and at the same time so utterly boring that in the end it was not worth my time.<br/><br/>Really I just wish they would quit making these awful remakes."

","Summary: It fails to provide enough black humor and scares. 44/100 (C-)<br/><br/>Five twenty-something friends become holed up in a remote cabin. When they discover a Book of the Dead, they unwittingly summon up dormant demons living in the nearby woods, which possess the youngsters in succession until only one is left intact to fight for survival. Evil Dead is directed by Federico Álvarez, he's an Uruguayan director. It also boasts a well known cast like Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez. Moving on, I actually liked the first hour of the film but my main problem is the over-the-top final act. It was too gory and exaggerated. Although its first hour is very entertaining and quite scary, the last 30 minutes are a truly bloody mess.<br/><br/>The opening scene is truly terrifying and extremely violent. I also like that the film does not use too much CGI, the special effects are practical and everything looks realistic. It definitely boasts some bloody and violent moments that fans of the original will enjoy, but another problem with Evil Dead (2013) is that it wasn't genuine enough, it's a shame that the movie relies on gore and forgets about its own narrative coherence. It's excessively gory, especially in its final act, it was too much. Also, most of the scariest scenes are in the trailer! However, it's still worth watching if you're a horror fan. As I said, I enjoyed the first hour, the rest of the movie was pretty messy.<br/><br/>It seems like it wants to copy the unique black humor from the old ones. Moving on, there's a scene after credits that you will probably enjoy, especially if you're a fan of the Evil Dead saga. I recommend it if you're a huge fan of gory horror movies and I also recommend it if you're fan of the franchise, but you shouldn't have very high expectations. I do not recommend it if you're not fan of the horror genre or if you expect interesting characters. In conclusion, this movie is just gory and nothing more, the characters are not engrossing enough and some of the black humor just doesn't work. It's awkwardly unfunny, there isn't a balance between the horror and the comedy. (C-)"
"groovyuniverse","4","3","4","1 September 2014"," Jane Levy is beautiful. The movie not so much.
","(contains MINOR spoilers.)<br/><br/>Confession: At the end of the movie my attention drifted off to the point I started googling images of the stunning lead actress Jane Levy. This example of the movie's failure to captivate me is the sign of it's mediocrity. Or that maybe i need a girlfriend again. Marry me Jane, i'll promise i'll never lock you in my basement. <br/><br/>Good points of the movie: the imagery is great at times, take for instance the scene in the beginning where Jane Levy (there she is again) shows up for the first time, sitting in the yellow smokey haze of the woods smoking a cigarette on a wrecked old car. Her beauty and charm instantly struck me and throughout the movie she showed up to be the best actor of the bunch. <br/><br/>Added to this I enjoyed some of the early scares but that's about it. Like other people already wrote, this movie feels too generic and completely lacks the humour of it's source material. Someone else here also criticized the 'music' and I completely agree. The frequent use of the airhorn was particularly annoying. It is intended to accentuate the more hysterical moments but the sound just doesn't fit and should be left for war movies. It gets worn out quickly and even laughable after a while. <br/><br/>For some people the gore-factor of this movie will serve as a gruesome attraction. I can enjoy a dose of gore myself, when used sparse like in Aliën or completely over the top as in Braindead. The problem for me with the gore in this movie is that all the severed limbs and cut faces are rapidly thrown in your face without any other purpose than to depress you and make you turn a sour face confronted with the gruesome images. It quickly loses it's shock value. <br/><br/>Well, what's there left to say? A forgettable horror movie with a beautiful lead actress."

The story is deeply flawed with blatant inconsistencies and from start to finish, it's astonishingly directionless. So much of its content is mindlessly grotesque without purpose. All physical injuries are wildly unrealistic. Say 'hello' to failed shock value because you will accurately predict every moment -- even when things are way out in left field. The duration is short but somehow feels like forever. It's so stupid I kicked myself for having wasted time watching it. I won't comment on the acting because actors require a decent script and these folks, simply weren't given one.

That's why I and so many others flat out love it.<br/><br/>The remake has the feel of a project written and directed by a junior high drama class that miraculously raised $17 million with a bake sale and hired some really talented performers to act in it.<br/><br/>Major themes are developed and then get lost in the gore and hardware. Mia (the main character) and her brother and three friends travel to an isolated cabin where she is going to try to get over her drug habit.<br/><br/>Mia and her brother, David, have issues. Mia was the one who stayed home to take care of their mother while David was away pursuing his own interests. Either of these is a perfectly valid dramatic theme. Neither is developed. Instead, these ideas are abandoned for a festival of blood, gore, recycled images from Japanese horror movies, a chainsaw, and other hardware.<br/><br/>The other characters are cruelly underwritten. Eric is there because someone needs to read the ancient curse out loud for the plot to kick into gear. Olivia is a nurse, there to take care of Mia's medical needs. Natalie is there because the plot calls for a fifth person to be present to fit the contours of the script.<br/><br/>There are lots of good things about the film. It's well photographed, and deserves special commendation because in the outdoor scenes where it's raining the light is appropriate to a rainy day. Even in the 21st century we still see films in which rain is pouring down out of a cloudless sky in brilliant daylight. The musical score is effective. And the actors seem to have a lot of natural talent that's going to waste.<br/><br/>But the project falters in comparison to the original. The actors plow their way through this with perfectly straight faces. Not a wink, a nod, an arched eyebrow, a tilt of the head. I can imagine them before each scene thinking, ""This script is absolute crap, but Sony Picture is paying me to do this so I'll keep a straight face and soldier through.""<br/><br/>If you do watch this, stay around for a brief clip at the very end of the closing credits that raised my rating from a 2 to a 5.

How can you call it Evil Dead without Bruce Campbell?<br/><br/>My concerns began to evaporate when I noticed Raimi's involvement in the opening credits and were completely dispelled when I realized that the new film shared only the most fundamental plot structure with the original. Both films are about friends in a cabin in the woods fighting a mysterious, purely evil, and incomprehensible force triggered by a mysterious ancient book. Otherwise, the films are only vaguely connected. <br/><br/>So this answered my first question - about remaking a Raimi film. You don't, you simply do something new on the same foundation.<br/><br/>The new Evil Dead is much more of a straightforward horror film and the differences go way beyond the disturbing addition of a crack addict as a central character. Most of the central characters aren't even likable, let alone funny. So much for my question about replacing Bruce Campbell. Again - you don't. <br/><br/>In 1981, Sam Raimi, his brother, an aspiring actor (Campbell) and a group of non-actors and amateur film makers made a horror classic with almost no budget and a great deal of debt. It took more than a decade for them to recoup the costs of this near-instant cult classic though the film was viewed as a ""break-through"". More recently, as one of Hollywood's most respected directors and producers, Raimi gave young Uruguayan writer / director Fede Alvares a shot at creatively re- imagining the film that made Raimi a contender. <br/><br/>The acting is better than that of the original (which should be no surprise since there were really only two actors in the Raimi film), the effects are more sophisticated, but cleverly reminiscent of the Raimi tradition of clever simplicity, and the film, like the original delivers a few good scares despite its ridiculous premise. <br/><br/>Shot for about $17,000,000 (which is not much these days), the Alvares re-do netted a 300% profit before it left theaters. Profitability has very little to do with quality these days, but I say good for them! <br/><br/>The new Evil Dead is worthy and a credit to the original."
"justbob1982","5","4","6","6 November 2015"," Poor remake that misses the point
","Version I saw: UK bluray release<br/><br/>Actors: 5/10<br/><br/>Plot/script: 5/10<br/><br/>Photography/visual style: 6/10<br/><br/>Music/score: 6/10<br/><br/>Overall: 5/10<br/><br/>Unknown director. First-time writer. Unknown cast. These statements describe both 2013's 'Evil Dead' and its predecessor, the 1981 original. However, while Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead' bucked the trend, the new version very much shows evidence of the inexperience of those making it.<br/><br/>Some elements are done well, to be fair. The mobile hand-held camera work turns a budget limitation into an advantage, and the use of Raimi's patent ""camera on a stick"" technique is a fitting tribute, if a little over-abundant. Overall, it looks more slick and professional than the original, albeit with a budget over 30 times bigger (not accounting for inflation).<br/><br/>The screenplay leaves a lot to be desired, though. The characters are monumentally idiotic, undermining any sympathy I might have had for their plight. The theme connecting narcotics to demonic activity, while functional enough as a plot point, is woefully undercooked as a metaphor.<br/><br/>Finally, there is not a shred of humour throughout. While the presence of humour in the original is disputed (I never found it very funny), the series is now best known for its blend of horror and comedy. At the end of the closing credits, we see Bruce Campbell as Ash, the main character in the original, but this only reminded me of what I had enjoyed back then, and not found here.<br/><br/>Alvarez appears not to realize what made the original great, but thinks he does, and set about making a tribute to that. The success of the new 'Ash Vs Evil Dead' TV series shows how wrong he was."
"loriegrissom","1","4","6","21 June 2014"," Horrible, don't waste your time on this movie
","I gave this movie a chance because I liked the original with Bruce Campbell. This movie was boring, not scary, and not campy or funny. They don't seem to even have a concept of what is scary. They seemed to think adding more and more fake blood throughout the movie is terrifying. I don't get why they even bothered making this film. At the end of the film it felt like the actors and the makers of this film even thought it was bad. They did have the chainsaw but it did not even seem cool or important it seemed like an after thought. If you are going to take the time to watch a movie find the original with Bruce Campbell it is a everything this version is not it is funny, campy, and exciting; and the other Bruce Campbell movies are just as good."
"DamianThorn","2","4","6","4 June 2014"," The best part of this movie is the end, because it's finally over.
","First let me say, I'm not comparing this movie to the original Evil Dead. Whenever remakes come along I go out of my way to judge them on there own merits. There have been a few really decent and enjoyable remakes in the past and to my mind they have to be able to stand on their own or their a waste of my time. I don't see remakes, reboots or re-imaginings. I see movies. Films that I will either love, hate or find mildly entertaining. So with that said, on to my review of Evil Dead 2013. Brace yourself for a boatload of sarcasm and some hefty spoilers.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what a person would have to smoke to find this movie enjoyable, in fact even if I were smoking it I'm still pretty sure I would loathe this ""film"". The acting is dreadful, the script might just have been written by a blind man and the editing is so choppy I'm not sure any of the movies creators actually watched the final cut. At no point is this movie frightening or even slightly chilling, in fact it's so boring it might just replace counting sheep if you need help falling asleep.<br/><br/>There are just so many things wrong here that I wouldn't even know where to begin pointing them all out. The ""shocking"" moments aren't at all shocking, in fact their downright silly. In an age where movies are made depicting people's flesh being peeled off, a foul mouthed girl making nasty sexual references to her brother is hardly shocking. Neither is someone getting winged in the shoulder by a shotgun. I wouldn't have thought a demon possessed person would bother with a shotgun, let alone miss when firing from ten feet away but nothing else in this movie makes sense so why the hell should that?<br/><br/>The overall plot, if you can call it that, is no better and it really makes me wonder what the hell the creators of this movie were thinking. I realize they wanted to put their own twist on a classic but really? A bunch of twenty something's drag a junkie out into the middle of nowhere so she can detox. In case of an emergency we've got a nurse, a first aid kit, the junkies brother and sister and a hippie. Almost immediately they find a cellar full of mutilated animals, a book wrapped in barbed wire and a boat load of occult crap but hey, why be bothered by that? I mean, everyone's been there right?<br/><br/>Let's just keep on going without batting an eye. So while the junkie is going through the fastest detox in history, the hippie seems to be the only one bothered by the book. He cuts the wire off and discovers It's written in a dead language but that's cool because he's got a paperback handy for easy translation...they make those ya know. Oddly, he doesn't really need to translate anything because luckily someone has scribbled instructions and notes all through out the book explaining everything. Even the ridiculously obvious illustrations. Some ominous warnings and a few jump cuts later, the movie just gets worse...and worse and worse.<br/><br/>I'm sorry if I seem overly sarcastic but this movie is truly just that bad. Had they not swiped the name Evil Dead this would have been just another straight to digital offering that no one ever would have noticed. Maybe there is some true evil power at work here after all because there has to be some explanation for how this lousy movie got so much fanfare and how it ever made it into theaters.<br/><br/>So why did I even give it a 2 star rating? Simply because it actually looks like a finished movie. By that I mean it doesn't look like it was shot with a camera from a discount store. Beyond that, the movie deserves a 1 star rating...maybe -1."
"jimmerw","1","4","6","1 November 2013"," Comedy??
","My and my lady put this on. The acting was dismal, but we thought we would just carry on through the movie. We thought we were watching a horror, but we were laughing throughout. The silly elements of this movie made us think we were watching a parody comedy. like Scary Movie. When I came here to write a review, I was shocked to read that this was rated as a horror.<br/><br/>We honestly thought this was a comedy. Everything was so cliché, typical horror stuff, and so weakly portrayed, that we laughed through the whole movie, like one of the Chucky movies.<br/><br/>Really? This is a horror?? Young people in a cabin in the woods, trapped with an evil entity. Hmmm, that sounds original. <br/><br/>We thought it was OK as a horror/comedy like Scary Movie. But as a true horror movie?? All we can say is *LOL*."
"leonblackwood","3","4","6","17 August 2013"," The original is much better! 3/10
","Review: This is what happens when you tamper with a classic and you stick annoying teenagers in it...... You end up making an average horror movie, just like loads of horror movies that are on the market right now. The whole thing about the original Evil Dead was the period that it came out and the fact that they banned it. All of the characters in this film were pretty annoying and by the end of the movie, you just want them to die. This reboot really doesn't have the wit as the original and it just doesn't work without Bruce Campbell and his funny face expressions. There are some pretty gory bits in the film which goes a bit too far in places, but it works. The reboot isn't totally bad, but they really did need better characters. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: If there are people out there that read my reviews, I think that you will know that I'm not really into my horrors, but I grew up with watching the original Evil Dead which was really funny and quite disturbing for its time. You will never get an actor like Bruce Campbell to play the role the same and I'm glad that the director didn't try. Bruce Campbell was actually totally against rebooting the franchise, but once he knew that they wasn't going to attempt to get another lead like him, they went ahead with the project. Judging by the money that I've movie made, I wouldn't be surprised to see a sequel soon and I hope that they get rid of the annoying teenagers.<br/><br/>Budget: $17million Worldwide Gross: $98million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the original and who are not the bloody horror movies. 3/10"

","What did you expect????? This would have made a great Tales from the Crypt Episode. Too bad it wasn't just 30 minutes long. This is a good movie for a day when you are inside, drunk, taking care of business and have it going in the background. You can look up every few minutes and say, oh OK, that's what's happening. Spend too much time watching it and you will wind up writing a review listing the reasons this movie is stupid. I don't know how the movie ends for you, but for me, it ends with me not caring and finishing my laundry. Hopefully everyone died. It is somewhat entertaining in the beginning, before it spirals into ridiculousness."
"starcraftbw88","3","4","6","15 August 2013"," Not Quite Evil Dead...
","I'm disappointed to say the least. There were some throwbacks and similarities to Evil Dead, but the nonsensical, tacked on, ending after the credits was the best part. This movie had no business being named Evil Dead other than to cash in on the franchise.<br/><br/>It's a pretty bad movie, carried mostly by its name. The acting is bad, the plot is a contrived mess, and the characters aren't believable or likable. Being a huge horror fan, I would say some of the death scenes and gore were cool, if not mostly unnecessary. It got painful as it went, but the movie managed to keep me watching until the end, at times I felt like ""endure"" might be the better verb. The best way to watch it is to go in with no expectations. If you were a big fan of the original, you will probably despise this."
"epicturtleofthesea","2","4","6","12 August 2013"," Honest Review
","I went buying this film thinking it was going to be more scary than it was. It reminded me too much of The Exocist and there was far too much gore for it to be any good. And the end it just started to get boring with all the gore. Recommend not to buy it it's a waste of money. The whole end part of the movie was very unrealistic and the 'demon' near the end of the movie was unrealistically weak compared the the lead character. And the movie had the clicé ending of the girl killing the 'demon' and everything being OK. <br/><br/>The movie was so bad that my favourite part was the guy talking in the credits. I didn't understand the scene after the credits. The whole movie was bad and I do not recommend it"
"the_real_phantom","10","23","55","10 April 2013"," Great re-imagining of a classic series.
","Awesome movie! C'mon did you guys really just want a comedy rip off of Evil Dead 2 and 3 with better SFX? Let's not forget the original was a straight horror movie. This is a great interpretation. Demons, bloody violence and self inflicted nasty bits. A clever homage to the original series. Also reminded me of the Exorcist in parts. I actually liked how the demons were 'updated' from Sumerian/Lovecraft demons to your more traditional satanic ones :) Maybe some of the negative reviewers should stick to Xena Warrior Princess re-runs. I will be looking forward to Army of Darkness 2 tho and I hope there's a sequel to this one! Groovy indeed."

","This movie is way to disgusting for me. If you like disgusting movies than you should see this one It has no story. Some things are predictable It has errors I honestly didn't like this film. I think that it's awful. And I love horror movies, but this one, God... I thought that this film was going to be very very good, but I guess I was wrong. If you have doubts about watching this movie or not, just don't, go watch another movie. Have a 90 happy minutes watching other movie. That's just my advice you know, you can always watch the movie but if I were you I wouldn't create great expectations about it because I did that and in the end I was very disappointed.

"Vivekmaru45","1","7","13","5 August 2013"," I've Seen More Evil In A Garbage Can. LOL!
","I saw the first Evil Dead(1981) film directed by Sam Raimi, who later directed two more"" Evil Dead 2: Dead By Dawn(1987) and Army Of Darkness(1992) which was his last horror film. Then after a lapse of 17 years he directed Drag Me To Hell(2009) which I feel paid tribute to his die-hard followers of Zombie Horror(myself included!). But Drag Me To Hell lacked the bite(pun intended!) of his original first two Evil Dead Films.<br/><br/>This 2013 remake's script was written by Sam Raimi and produced by Bruce Campbell who played the character of Ash in the Evil Dead Trilogy who did battle and eventually destroyed the Evil. Fede Alvarez was chosen to direct this film. He is an Uruguayan film director and screenwriter. He is best known for his short film Ataque de Pánico! <br/><br/>On to the review. I have been watching horror films since the 1980's. With the help of internet I have seen horror films as old as the 1930's. I saw this remake in my mid-thirties. I am a hard-core horror fan and I have seen the most gruesome horror films which are so disturbing that they linger in your brain afterwards.<br/><br/>Among the ones I have seen are Eden Lake (2008), Marian Dora's Cannibal (2006), The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2003 and the prequel film Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning 2006 as well as Tobe Hooper's Original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2 (1986). Also a separate film Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3(1990). I have also seen Wrong Turn (2003), Wrong Turn 2(2007) and Wrong Turn 3(2008). I have seen Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes and its remake. I have see George Romero's Night, Dawn and Day of the Living Dead. I have seen The Exorcist Trilogy of films written by William Peter Blatty. I have seen The Reanimator Trilogy Of films.<br/><br/>The list is endless...<br/><br/>So nothing is new to me: a hardcore horror fan. I watched this Evil Dead remake from start to finish without a twitch. The special effects in the film are standard. The sound effects these days are awesome with advent of surround sound technology. The direction of the film suffers in the area that there is no real plot in the film. A guy reads an incantation in the book and wham! The evil spirit is summoned and it starts to posses its victims who proceed to mutilate (or mutate LOL!) themselves. There is no clearly defined hero or heroine in the films. The actors are not seasoned enough to be able to lift the film with their on screen presence. There is no real climax in the film.<br/><br/>The first Evil Dead film(which developed from Raimi's short Within The Woods) had a good selection of actors, who despite having no big films behind their backs, made the setting of the film come alive. There was solid atmospheric horror in the film and the zombie-makeup and effects was top-notch. The tension built steadily step by step, which is the hallmark of a good director. The climax itself is awesome and is left for last.<br/><br/>Verdict: I don't think Fede Alvarez has future in directing more horror films. He should either change genres or pursue a career in directing theatrical shows or plays which is more rewarding. This is not due to any fault in the director but because of the over-flooded Hollywood film industry who are making more quantity then quality films. I think people have just run out of ideas.<br/><br/>To all movie lovers: if you have a chance to go to a theater to watch a play, be it a classic, suspense or romance, DO SO. It is much better to go outside and get some fresh air with your loved ones and watching REAL ACTORS at work, than spoiling your eyes glaring at the big screen."
"Twcreconv2","4","9","18","17 July 2013"," Evil Dread..
","This movie is not a bad horror film, but being a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies and Army of Darkness. I was extremely disappointed with this film. I feel as if Bruce Campbell worried to much if a new Ash was to be born than the reference to him would be shattered. Instead he helped give us this . A horror movie that would have stood better under a different name or Evil Dead title. The absence of Ash in an Evil Dead film is quite obvious when you see it . This film feels more like one giant reference to a great film but falls short on adding it to the collection. There's enough gore to hold fans over throughout the movie and only a few moments that surprise you. So if you're looking for a horror film that's bloody and better than the disasters that have come out in the past 2 years this is not a bad choice . If you're looking for an Evil Dead movie blow the dust off your collection and enjoy the fact that a chainsaw -handed-badass -hero existed at some point but unlikely to come through again."

","I'm not one for remakes of classic horror films. I despised the Dawn of the Dead reboot and the slew of other horrid abominations to cinema that have followed in the wake of awful remakes that seem to be the poison of Hollywood these days; however, this was a most pleasant surprise. I will give nothing away as I feel this is a horror film that must be seen. Does it capture the magic of the original? Maybe not as The Evil Dead is one of my all-time favorite films and nothing can quite compare to the grueling and disturbing masterpiece given us by Sam Raimi all those years ago. Does it bring anything new or exciting to the table? You bet it does! This was a film exceeded in its gore factor only by the unsettling atmosphere of the movie. It's obscene, depraved, dark, and filled with violent delight. I was expecting the worst and found myself enthralled and appalled and ultimately so glad that I bought tickets. If you enjoy horror flicks as much as I do then nothing should stop you from seeing Evil Dead. Despite the poor user reviews I've seen this was a true feat of horror filmmaking at its goriest glory."

","After watching oz the great and powerful i realized it was just a cute kids flick so i needed to please my bloody desires with some out of this world insanity. So we drove down to Austin and entered the paramount theater (not going to get into details since i had never been to Austin before and was going for the evil dead i do live in Texas though, anyways) and as the screams and madness filled the theater i could not believe what i was witnessing it was everything i wanted and more, and thats coming from an old school horror fan i absolutely loved the original but have never seen the 2nd one or army of darkness (i will though) but if you really give this film a chance and forget about the original and accept it for a new take on the story you will love it. Some characters i did find quite annoying like David was kind of Annoying... i did enjoy Jessica Lucas character even though one could argue her death was rather nerve wracking, i did like Mia, probably the best character in the movie and Lou Taylor Pucci was really good in this would like to see more from him he was convincing and thats all that matters. The movie had beautiful cinematography, the acting was superb from most of the cast, story was good but actually could have been better, the twist(s) were unpredictable, directing was mediocre i felt kind of awkward through the 2nd half. The movie shines when it delivers on the gore and outrageous mutilation but i wanted this to be more than a gore fest i wanted at least the next ""A nightmare on elm street"" but the movie makes up for its flaws at the end. OVERALL: Don't miss this horror film it may not be our next THE SHINING but it is one hell of a good fun bloody time and even you end up hating the movie you will admire the death scenes and the mayhem in this movie,blood rain, demon lesbian, exorcist like antagonist, extremely bloody and violent death scenes (WARNING! this movie is really sadistic, Alvarez crossed the line, its like watching a sick rapist murder fantasies come to life this is a very dark and just disturbing film and it all looks good), and let me just say i really enjoyed the tree rape scene... this movie is horror fanatic paradise, and last but not least this is not a remake its a new vision of EVIL, on April 5 let it consume you. Its the best movie I've seen so far this year other than side effects, experience it. (if only it was in IMAX) This movie kicked Ass!"
"jmjmann1","10","22","54","2 June 2013"," Excellent old school horror
","Let me start by saying that this film surpassed the original in about every way possible. The acting, effects, directing, and production were far superior to the sub-par value of the original cult classic. People who claim the original was a masterpiece or can't be topped do not understand what good film making looks like (or bad acting for that matter), therefore, making their opinions invalid.<br/><br/>Evil Dead lived up to its hype as being extremely gory and creepy. As a die-hard fan of the horror genre, I was impressed with the film's usage of practical effects instead of CGI to create the very graphic images on screen. Lately, many horror films have relied too much on CGI, which lessens the overall quality. The most impressive scenes to me were Olivia's and Natalie's deaths, and the blood rain/ chainsaw sequence. The latter was visually stunning and had myself and the rest of the audience cheering loudly! <br/><br/>It was quite fun to watch a film where most of the audience at one point or another were watching through their hands, screaming, or looking utterly terrified. I highly recommend this to any fan of horror, but not for a casual movie goer or the faint of heart. Evil Dead is the best horror movie to hit the mainstream in over a decade."

I would watch this again some bits are a bit vile but it follows on from the original films, as it does nothing more than you would expect. A lot of critics have moaned about this film but what do you expect??? the old film with more effects and gore?. i would give this an 8 out of 10! and will be buying this when it comes out on DVD. love the fact the first name of all the characters spells out the word Demon"

Perhaps the audience just needed a good laugh since there are some scary moments in there. I'm not sure if it was intentional on behalf of the director to have one of the characters be really weird and funny (the nerdy guy) but I hope it was cause no one could take his character seriously.<br/><br/>I'm personally not a fan of gore films so the excessive blood failed to creep me out, unlike my friend who screamed every time there was blood on screen (spoiler alert??). <br/><br/>Overall a great horror film, but with a tinge of comedy, which personally makes any horror film less scary (i.e. Insidious)"

","""Evil Dead"" was a good movie that I enjoyed from start to finish, but it was falsely advertised by saying ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"". That would be ""The Conjuring"" in my opinion. The movie did not focus on much of a story, but rather blood, gore and strong use of language, which I enjoyed as I am a fan of slasher films and sadistic violence, but if you are going to look at the movie, expect suspense, but it's not a movie to have you blocking your ears, closing your eyes etc.. I give it a 7. I haven't seen the old one, but I would recommend looking at it as I know my parents and some family members who saw it said that it was one of the scariest movies they have seen."

"RyanCShowers","Null","6","11","21 July 2013"," The Cast & Crew Embarrass Themselves and Sam Rami
","We all can remember the reaction we had to Sam Rami's Evil Dead trilogy back in the late '80s. It involved a collected range from great delight due to the comedic undertone set by Rami, the ""Ewwwww"" sounds we made in our head as blood splattered all over the camera lens, and the moments that scared us enough to take a few bathroom breaks. The first two films were the two most memorable horror films of the 1980s and should be celebrated. Though Army of Darkness didn't hold the stature of the original two, it supplied the viewer a different path of the story and brought the story to a close suitably. <br/><br/>Optimistically, I'll start with the qualities I found credible. From the prologue of, the Evil Dead remake has an eerie look to it that stirs up the suspense in your eyes. The film score in a horror film is so vital, and that's one thing this movie does get right, I really loved the score. The house in which the film is shot in, is styled in a morose manner that makes for a good setting for a ghost story such as this. The make-up design for Evil Dead is overwhelming, the jury is still out whether that means it works for the film or against it. I began to wonder if they just tacked on unnecessary gore-cenrtic tags to scenes to literally stop the story from ascending to anything at all and just please blood craving suckers.<br/><br/>I think if any horror film were to be remade (I still don't understand why we're remaking highly successful, quality horror movies to begin with), The Evil Dead would be a great choice as long as it was tackled without an approach of comedy. The film takes that chance, it's nice to see the contrast in storytelling, but it isn't that successful. Sam Rami's film was cut off from reality, but they knew it and embraced it with their method of injecting comedy to the scares. With this approach, they have to at least pretend this could actually happen to people somewhere in the world, but I never got that feeling of reality once. It retained the tacky qualities of the original, but didn't inherit the quality. <br/><br/>It isn't scary! A few times, it begins to build to something frightening, but it never surmounts that peak. Evil Dead's quick pan-in shots that cut to preposterous demon snaps don't get my fear levels rumbling. The demon shots themselves play like a early development versions of The Exorcist that just took an enthusiastic dose of acid. It's not even well made enough to constitute as a throwaway, entertainment fodder. With little sense of structure, recycled dialogue, characters who purposely go against the way rational human beings problem solve, Evil Dead retains no class and should have ""Tasteless"" written over the DVD cover in fire- engine, red-blood splatter. <br/><br/>One thing Evil Dead attempts to do is create some humanity with a topic about the overconsumption of drug and family issues. Too bad, it collapses in the attempts. At least it tries. Forcing myself to sit through the duration of the last twenty minutes, I stared with a foul look poisoning the screen thinking about the future of this genre. Creativity needs be revived and filmmakers need to grow the story realistically and stop trying to stylize every singly shot of movie. The result of that over-pizazz in horror films is all horror films feel the same nowadays. There's nothing to define The Evil Dead from the movie of the week except its ancestors reputation. We need to take the characters seriously to open up to a movie, we have to take the characters seriously to take the story seriously; and we have to take the story seriously to take the movie seriously. <br/><br/>Poor special effects are a inconsistent aspect of Evil Dead, but the dreadful acting can be found any minute of the movie. The film has the impudence to try to end with symbolism; eject the film from your DVD player before you even have the misfortune of seeing that. Evil Dead should have been retitled ""How Many Times Can a Body Be Mutilated Without Croaking"", that way Sam Rami's films wouldn't have had to undergo such awful representation to the new era of horror junkies. <br/><br/>Rating: 2.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: D"

I have no idea why some people seemed to have hated this film. <br/><br/>Does this film have some its share of mistakes? Yes! But it's an incredibly well put together and fun film nonetheless. Everyone I know who is a horror fan loved it. I say great job to first time Director Fede Alvarez and Jane Levy who did an incredible job and was very creepy.<br/><br/>If you want to have a really fun time at the movies, then go watch this film.

","Remakes are a sensitive subject in cinema. There are camps of fans that will be excited to see a favorite story of theirs remade or re-imagined. Then there are camps of fans that will decry even the idea of their favorite film being remade, heralding the death and ruination of the original. Both sides are equally justified in their arguments, as once an audience sees a film it ceases to merely be a product of the production team. Ownership passes to the audience as the movie is experienced, and as such they are entitled to feel possessive. Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead is one such movie that has amassed a cult following in the 30 some odd years since its release, and feelings have been mixed since it was announced that it would be remade. The director was an unknown, the cast was a mixed bag of TV and indie film faces, and there was a decidedly large absence of Bruce Campbell. All of the ingredients were in place for this film to fail, and fail miserably. Trust me when I say that all of your worries are completely unfounded, and within your darkened theater, you have everything to fear. <br/><br/>The frame of the original's minimal story is present but embellished a bit to provide some weight for the characters. The five friends are at the cabin to help Mia (Jane Levy) detox from heroin cold turkey. Accompanying her are her friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), her estranged brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). There is some past history between the group involving the siblings strained relationship with their parents and each other, as well as some stress between David and the others after he skipped town. There is also a little prologue that opens the movie that gives a little background on what's happening for those unfamiliar with the overall story that also sets the tone of what's to come. These elements that make up the first act yield mixed results, and are honestly the weakest parts of the movie. The story and relationships are decent enough to get you invested in the primary characters but the rest are clearly established as demon fodder. The detox is also a realistic enough narrative ploy to keep them in the cabin until it's too late because, as we all know, heroin addicts will do anything to score another fix. The beginnings of Mia's possession are attributed to her sober manipulations to get back to humanity, so the weight of the situation doesn't hit the group until it's too late.<br/><br/>Once everything kicks into gear in the second act, Evil Dead proves that it belongs among the masterworks of the horror genre. It is a triumph of suspense, gore, and jump out of your seat scares, the likes of which haven't been seen in a long time. Fede Alvarez has the same keen eye for atmosphere and lighting that Raimi exhibited in the original, and for every genre convention that he breezes through he immediately sets a new standard for horror films to come. The amount of dismemberment and brutality on display are felt and experienced with every fiber of being thanks to some impressive makeup and effects. Something worth noting is that the effects Alvarez utilizes are almost entirely practical, leaving distracting CGI at the wayside. He's also smart enough to know that the best horror films are built like roller coasters and that you have to allow for moments of levity to lift some of the suspense. It is darkly hilarious at times and it's this sense of humor that is one of the greatest assets it carries over from the original, while not necessarily to the same degree.<br/><br/>Evil Dead pays its dues to its predecessor in the ways a remake should in the first two acts, and does a damn good job of it. But just when you think it's about to get wholly predictable, Alvarez kicks it into overdrive and flips the whole movie on its head. The finale is unpredictable, ruthless, and visceral to a degree that I didn't think the movie was capable of achieving. Horror films have a notable tendency to fizzle as ideas run dry in the third act, but Alvarez saves the best for last. Truthfully, it's one of the most satisfying and intense horror climaxes in decades.<br/><br/>If you're not a fan of the original, or the genre in general, then Evil Dead won't change your mind. It's not going to be a crossover hit that draws in the crowd outside of the one it's catered to. Also, there are some genre rules that are diligently followed, thanks to its tie to the original, which may seem hokey or weird to a modern audience. For fans of the campy cult classic they grew up with, Alvarez's Evil Dead is the realization of an impressive vision of horror approved of by both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, and that should be all the encouragement you need to see this movie. For those that might still be on the fence, I'm here to tell you Evil Dead is well worth your money. It is everything you want from the established series and then some. By the end you will have laughed, cringed, shrieked, and cheered for the rebirth of a franchise that has been buried in the woods for far too long. Hail to the king baby!"

","As a loyal Evil Dead fan I was a little disappointed with some of the alterations to the Original's most acclaimed scenes. But once again Rami's signature blunt absurdity gave this movie a clever wit of its own. The frustrating stupidity of the characters that can obviously only end badly somehow manages to nicely spark a natural curiosity to see the next sudden scare. The new Evil Dead is extremely gory, definitely scary and very creepy. The well done graphic images are hard to forget and likely to give nightmares. As far as horror movies go I think the new rendition stands on its own merit. And it had to at the advanced screening in Sacramento when the studio surprised the excited fans by announcing that they would be giving away special Evil Dead t-shirts for the premier. But then when they brought them out silently walked past those fans all the way to the back of the line and began handing them to people just arriving and then each person starting from the back of the line."

","From everything I had seen and read it was trying to be more realistic and scary. To me this remake of Evil Dead was neither. Being gory and making the audience feel uncomfortable is not the same as them being afraid to go camping or walk down to their basement for the next week or two.<br/><br/>On top of that was some pretty bad acting. I know the originals were not A-list actors but it was still better then what you will find in this version.<br/><br/>There are a lot of bad things about this remake.

"Uppotukki","9","5","9","19 September 2013"," Might be the best Remake ever made...
","I went to theater thinking that original doesn't exist. Let's just say that I'm a huge fan of originals too. Even with than in my mind this movie was one of the best horror movies i have seen in a long long time. My points...<br/><br/>Acting: Acting is amazingly good for a ANY horror-film and as Cambell said better than in the original. Normally horror acting is sloppy and out of place but this time everyone really acts their parts wonderfully. Specially Jane Levy as Mia. She really make's you hate her in the start.<br/><br/>Gore: Looks amazing. Raining blood, cuts, blood flying everywhere, severed limbs, everything just really works. I really hope that other horror directors decides to cut GCI down and start doing what Fede and Raimi does.<br/><br/>Camera: Raimi used some really really neat ways to shoot in the original and so does Fede. The final scene with Mia piercing abomination with chainsaw and cabin burning behind with blood raining is serious work of art...<br/><br/>Plot: 10 times better than in the original. Whole idea that you can cheat the book is very clever. Even if failed attempt.<br/><br/>No comedy: Just like the original. Many people forget that original Evil Dead wasn't funny flick when it came out. It was real attempt for serious horror movie with lots of blood and screamers with never heard actors and Ash wasn't famous bad-ass. The cult following and comedic remake Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness made people think they are all comedic movies. I mean watch original Evil dead again thinking that you don't know anything about Evil dead. You will realize that there is no comedy and Ash is actually pretty big pussy with zero one-liners in that movie. It's just that after watching Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, EVERYTHING coming from Ash's mouth sounds like one-liner.<br/><br/>In short. Evil Dead 2013 is everything original was. You just need to take of your cult following glasses. Especially since it will ruin on coming Evil Dead films in the future coming from Raimi and Fede.<br/><br/>My last point is about the future:<br/><br/>NOT REALLY A REMAKE: Best point of all. Ash and Mia co-exists. There will be 7 Evil Dead movies. According to Cambell. Idea is that Raimi and Cambell makes Army of Darkness 2 and Fede does Evil Dead 2 with Mia. After that it will be movie where Mia and Ash meets and most likely kicks some Abomination asses doing that...<br/><br/>This plan means that Evil Dead 2013 is not a remake. It's something like sequel. Hard to tell what to call it since i haven't heard about people making remake's to connect with original in future."
"krycek19","8","5","9","22 August 2013"," Don't believe the hype
","*SPOILER AHEAD* This is a bad movie. I don't mind the gore, al though it's not as gross as in the preview, but the story is predictable and boring. As a horror-movie this does'nt work either. It takes it self too seriously. The whole concept is so ridiculous that it needs to make fun of it self to work. The original Evil Dead from 1981 was straight up horror though, unlike the two sequels which were horror-comedies. But the original unlike this remake was much better done. Al though it had a much smaller budget and the effects were not half as good as in this one (they were down right cheesy) it actually managed to be scary. Mostly because of the amazing camera work and because the evil dead was a force living in the woods instead of just ghosts.<br/><br/>But let's go over the things that made this movie suck. It has no Ash aka Bruce Campbell. He made the old movies work, because of his acting and his looks. None of the characters here are remotely interesting, mostly because they're really stupid. For instance why stay in a cabin where the basement is filled with dead rotten cats hanging from the ceiling? Why open a book that is wrapped in plastic with barbed wire around it? Why starting to translate a book with clear warnings on the first pages to leave the book alone? Why decide to stay at the creepy cabin after one of the characters have been first badly injured in the woods then gotten third degree burns on her face? Why not swim across a flooded road when it's obvious that staying will be much worse than trying to escape? All the actors are doing a good job but none of them are the obvious lead that the audience can root for. Every time I thought I figured out who would survive I was wrong and it was really annoying.<br/><br/>Watch the original and avoid this one."
"rhaynes1974","8","5","9","6 July 2013"," Bitterly Disappointed
","Whilst not a total waste of time this ""re-imagining"" of the original Evil Dead forgot one very basic and very important ingredient, FUN.<br/><br/>It's not a fun night at the movies. In fact it's depressing with thinly drawn characters and some homages to the original. The problem with doing homages to the original is that it instantly allows the viewer to cast their minds back to that nostalgically and instantly forget what you're watching.<br/><br/>The film has no heart, no soul, like a MacDonald's cheeseburger it may be edible but there's nothing but garbage hidden under layers of mean spirited gore. The only time this remake comes anywhere close to the original in terms of getting the tone of the film correct, is in its climax, which is reasonably well executed.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the imagery in this film it's nothing we haven't seen a hundred times before, including all the spine twisting, neck cracking, obscenity spouting possessed women from any number of recent efforts. To re-iterate this isn't bad, it's just dead on arrival and frankly, quite boring."
"jasonlecter","4","5","9","2 July 2013"," weak, uninteresting.....has many problems
","evil dead 2013 is a very unremarkable film. first of all, what was said about there being no cgi is a lie. there are at least 4 scenes that use cgi (the opening scene when the girl burns, the scene where the blonde girl gets her arm infected, and the scene where her arm gets shot and she bleeds.....). the direction is not bad but it's not in any way fresh or different from what we're seeing in other horror films today.what really kills this film is the script (characters are very uninteresting and sometimes very stupid), and the acting ( particularly the main lead is uncharismatic). no real scary scenes. the usual attempts of jump scares that don't work and are many times predictable. maybe it would have been better not to associate this with the evil dead title. the ending is also weak. gory but weak. also this film is not really that gory. Japanese films had more gore in the late 60's. Italian films were gorier in the 70's. and American films were gorier in the 80's. granted it's gorier than anything that has been made lately, but if you compare it with some old Giallo and slasher films it's not that much. no idea why Sam Raimi did not direct this. I'm all for letting new directors make remakes, but evil dead means a great deal to the horror community and it was too much of a risk to let a newcomer direct this. overall a nice try, and a pretty standard horror film, nothing special here."
"DarkPrincess1989","4","5","9","14 June 2013"," Its the Witchcraft in the Basement!!
","**WARNING: CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS** Its common knowledge to any hardcore horror fan that Sam Raimi's Evil Dead (1981) was one of the most notorious video nasties of the 80′s. At the time, controversy surrounding the film was high due to its themes of demonic possession and no holding back on the gore factor. The film remains to be a horror classic, making lead actor Bruce Campbell and his character Ash an icon within the genre. I adore The Evil Dead for several reasons, mainly due to the fact it pushed the boundaries for its time and comes across as a fun, campy, edge-of-the-seat horror. I love the jaunty fast paced, camera angles that bound through the film's woodland setting and of course Campbell's performance is fantastic to watch along with Raimi's direction. The sequels Evil Dead 2 (1987) and Army of Darkness (1992) are even more unbelievable and outrageous, leaving a trilogy of cult classics that are to be enjoyed. Its a fair assumption to make that perhaps in the 80′s the film was misunderstood as the video nasties moral panics swept society. Fast forward to 2013 and there really isn't anything to be offended by.<br/><br/>Its a known fact that horror has lost its way in recent years and Hollywood is out of fresh ideas. All mainstream horror seems to offer is REMAKE, REMAKE, REMAKE! The majority of them become glossed up, full of torture porn and mostly miss the point of their originals with the exception of Maniac (2012). Therefore, like every other remake that have emerged in the past decade, Evil Dead (2013) surely didn't warrant one. Its actually taken me a lot of debating on whether to actually give this one a chance. Following much positivity about the re-boot, I decided, why not?. So, could I have lived without seeing The Evil Dead remake? The answer is yes. Understandably times have changed and filmmakers can go as far as they want and this film certainly brought in buckets of blood and gore but that didn't differentiate from the original and they even used practical effects over CGI which actually didn't come across that well. Instead of incorporating a seedy, grotesque 80′s feel, the effects just replicated those of the modern horror film.<br/><br/>Remakes have a tendency for creating in-depth back stories for our beloved films that don't warrant them. I'm all for keeping up the enigma and don't need to question these films too deeply. What you don't know is a much scarier concept. I don't need to know that Michael Myers had a tough upbringing and I certainly don't need a reason for the characters in Evil Dead to end up at the infamous cabin. Director Fede Alvarez clearly had the intention of re-creating the film as scary and bringing in a serious note. However it becomes problematic when in 2013, most of us are desensitized to what the genre offers meaning the film doesn't shock like the original did. What I will praise it on is the fact it wasn't a carbon copy of the 1981 version, it was a smart move not to include the Ash character as replicating Bruce Campbell's unique performance would be difficult, it also means the film can stand on its own. The tone remains bleak through the use of white, black and grey colouring and the way its shot captures an isolated environment, it literally feels like the trees provide no escape.<br/><br/>Alvarez has left the idea open as to whether its a sequel to the original or not and developed a theory that the cabin was bought by a family years after the events of the first movie, ultimately this works as a fan fiction idea. A brother and sister along with friends plan a getaway to the demonic location in order to help Mia, the sister character go cold turkey with her drug habit but soon that pesky Naturom Demonto, the book of the dead wreaks its havoc . The narrative was set up well and had potential but could have worked better without being The Evil Dead, it felt like the film's carnage overshadowed the initial plot and became predictable from then on. Granted, this remake wasn't terrible and certainly not the worst I've ever seen, I'll give that to I Spit on your Grave but its just another pointless remake to add to the rest of them."
"kmholmes","10","16","40","2 July 2013"," Excellent addition to the Evil Dead world
","***Minor Spoilers Ahead*** Before I watched this film I came onto IMDb and read a few of the reviews. I was shocked to read that so many people hated the film as I had been hanging out for it for it from the day I saw the posters at my local cinema. As a teenager, I saw the first Evil Dead film on VHS and it scared the pants off me. It had the right atmosphere and was well directed. I then saw the next two films at the drive-in as they were released and to this day the franchise has been my all-time favorite in the horror genre. For me the 2013 Evil Dead is a welcome addition to the cannon.<br/><br/>Firstly, I don't see this film as a remake.<br/><br/>This is an important distinction that I don't think any other reviewer (especially those panning the film) are making. I kind of see the film sitting in the period right before the destruction of Earth in Ash's alternate universe (as per the end of Army of Darkness). The reason we see Ash at the end of this film is the writers way to hang a lantern on the fact that this is a new story of the cabin in the woods and that Ash's story is somewhat separate from Mia's. And really, the continuity of the Evil Dead world was always on shaky ground especially if you read the final shot in the original series as Ash being possessed (something that never gets explained in Dead by Dawn).<br/><br/>If you walk in thinking this is a remake I think you are going to hate it. They will appear to get so much wrong with the story and the ending will simply look a writer trying to be clever. It's not the case. Simply put: 1. The character names are all different from the original; 2. The plot follows some of the fun stuff from the original but is its own take on the story; 3. A heroine as opposed to a hero 4. A different take.<br/><br/>For me, this version of the film was one hell of a ride that really captured the feel of the original film in scares per second. The acting is great and the cinematography is well coordinated.<br/><br/>I give this a 10/10 :)"
"sandyonmovies","5","9","20","11 April 2013"," Not to be confused with The Evil Dead
","The remake (or should I say reboot) of the horror cult classic was disappointing. The movie wasn't all terrible but it's just not anywhere near the incredibly horrific yet hilarious Sam Raimi version. The original was unintentionally funny, incredibly creepy, the possession is much more entertaining to watch and it stars Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>On it's own, the reboot is deliciously gory (if you're into that sort of thing), surprising well-acted, and includes an interesting twist at the end. (Interesting doesn't always mean good.) It lacked the humor and creepiness the original brought and was instead filled with excessive amounts of blood and gore.<br/><br/>Evil Dead had more of an explanation to why the friends were at a random cabin in the middle of the woods. It's more than just five college friends going on vacation in creepy cabin in the middle of the woods (but seriously, how did they find this place?). That was a nice change in a genre that's full of clichés and unoriginality.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of gore or blood at all. I can't watch any of the Saw films and I barely even watched Hostel. Evil Dead was no exception. I spent most of the film partially covering my eyes or trying to tune out the disgusting sound effects from the gore scenes. The main attraction was the gore and that was the main premise of the movie. There was nothing as good to balance it out. The original had a nice balance of gore and black humor where I could actually watch the movie in it's entirety with only covering my eyes once. That may have something to do with the $350,000 budget that they had.<br/><br/>Jave Levy as Mia, the drug addicted sister and Shiloh Fernandez as Mia's brother David were good casting choices. They did a great job creating their own brother-sister team that differed from the original. Jessica Lucas and Lou Taylor Pucci were strong additions to the group of friends and were great as the supporting characters. The only weak person in the group was Elizabeth Blackmore, not because her acting was in any way terrible, the character was just boring and very forgetful.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a fun, guts and gore filled horror flick that is no where near it's predecessor. The movie will scare you (if you're a baby like me) and gleefully disgust you with it's gory scenes.<br/><br/>As much as I found it disappointing, I would recommend at least seeing it once. 5 out of 10 stars."

I have seen the original films and thought they were pretty corny to be honest. I mean they were scary when I was a kid but I can barely watch them now as an adult. Most of that is due to the special effects that they used in those days. Obviously the technology used in the films from 80's has greatly improved in the 2000 era. The 2013 Evil Dead is probably the best remake of a movie I have seen in years. The story line has changed a little but it works in the film's favor. This film exceeded my expectations unlike remakes of the past{Example: The Wolfman (2010), A Nightmare On Elm Street (2010)}. However, this film takes a fairly realistic perspective and is very gory. If you easily get nightmare then this movie is not for you. I gave this film a ten simply because it's one of the best remakes I've seen and it is one of the few films out there that is good and gory at the same time, which seems to be rare now days."
"rhuenkejr","4","4","7","10 August 2013"," Less Than Impressive Gore Fest Leaves Few Scares
","This is my first review on IMDb.<br/><br/>Usually remakes of horror movies are less than impressive. For example, the remake of A Nightmare On Elm Street was almost painful to watch due to it's all around awfulness. The remake of Evil Dead, however was painful to watch for a different reason. After viewing one of the most gruesome and goriest ""R"" rated films I have ever seen, I was left with mixed feelings about The Evil Dead. <br/><br/>The film written and directed Fede Alvarez, tells the story of a group of friends who go to a remote ""Cabin in the Woods"" to help a fellow friend kick a drug habit. After the affects of withdrawal set upon the main female character and the ever so ""Evil Book"" is found, things start taking a turn for the worse. The next seventy or so minutes is a pure blood bath up until the very end as one by one demonic possession takes over them. <br/><br/>While watching the film, I found myself actually having to look away a few times during some of the most gruesome and gory scenes I have ever seen in an R rated movie. One scene in particular was harder to watch then when James Franco cut off his arm in 127 Hours. The film makers were not shy to show you ever gory detail when it came down to loss of a limb or life. After the credits rolled I was confused as to why the extremely creepy scene from the movie's trailer of the demon girl singing in the hatch was not in the film. The trailer from the film was definitely misleading as some of the potentially horrifying moments were either played down or non existent. <br/><br/>The film was acted sub par by five actors almost no one has heard about. I never found myself caring or rooting for any of the characters in the film and never really cared if any of them made it out alive. In my opinion the best character was the chainsaw used by Mia towards the end of the film. Surely a nod to the original in one pivotal instance when she battles her demon self and places the chainsaw on her newly severed stump of an arm. I also noticed several other nods to Sam Raimi's masterpiece including the ""boom stick"" shotgun and a quick and confusing cameo by a ""GROOVY"" guy after the credits end.<br/><br/>Overall I was mostly unimpressed by The Evil Dead and felt that the movie makers focused to much on ""shock gore"" instead of trying to really scare the hell out of us. Hopefully a sequel is not in the works and Mr. Raimi's trio of films can keep their nostalgia and dignity for future movie watching generations to enjoy.<br/><br/>So, should you SEE IT, SKIP IT or OWN IT?<br/><br/>If blood, guts and more blood and guts are your thing then SEE IT. If not and you're hoping for a good scare then SKIP IT. It's a film you'll probably watch once so most definitely do not OWN IT.<br/><br/><ul><li>Richard Huenke Jr.</li></ul>"

"Robert_duder","10","18","49","8 April 2013"," Bloody, rip roaringly brilliant...the best movie experience I've had in...MONTHS
","This is a big milestone. I went through the entire year of 2012 without finding a single 2012 movie that I thought was a perfect 10. I don't hand them out lightly. A ten has to be near perfection for me, and something I know will be a favourite of mine for the rest of my life. I even hesitated to slap a ten on this but after a day, when I was still thinking about it and excited about when I could see it again...I know. This film was absolutely drop dead amazingly brilliant. They single handedly proved why remakes should and can exist. Some of my favourite horror films are remakes (Hills Have Eyes, Amityville Horror, The Crazies) However, I'm not sure I have ever seen a remake done so well and so poignantly. It is disgustingly, viscerally violent. Does it go for sheer shock value? Absolutely and does it well. I read a great many negative reviews that called out the violence as ""disgusting."" Did you seriously not know what you were going in for? The trailers and the reviews all talked about its violence. I was well prepared for it and it delivered. But the brilliance is that this isn't what it was all about. The story which should be mostly a stereotypical horror flicks works so well and the cast handles everything so perfectly that you don't even realize that it really is just the same old as far as plot. There are definitive nods to the original without once letting it go to a ""campy"" place. The humour is so dark that you will literally feel guilty even chuckling at anything so that makes it complete opposite from the original. And the one liners were absolutely EPIC!! ""Feast on this..."" <br/><br/>Every person in the very small cast is great with the exception of one person. And I don't blame her but rather the character. I will start with her. Elizabeth Blackmore plays Natalie and the character is completely useless. She has no back story like the rest of them and her purpose for being there is strictly to have five people in the cabin. However, she has one truly outstanding scene involving her arm and a meat saw...'nuff said. She just doesn't get any character development to really show off her ability. Jessica Lucas is truly great as a young doctor trying to help her friend detox in the cabin. She really hits her stride when she gets to showcase her demon side which is downright demented and she really shines. Lou Taylor Pucci plays the new-age-ish teacher who ultimately brings the demon out by reading the incantation in the book. Pucci's character is probably THEE toughest SOB I have ever seen in a horror flick. The man takes a beating, stabbing, nail gun, needle and just keeps on coming. He is a machine and such a great character with a touch of being sort of a scumbag in some aspects. Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy are drop dead amazing. They are our heroes so to speak playing brother and sister with a deep back story. You can feel their animosity towards each other and their broken relationship. They handle roles that could have been ho-hum and knock it out of the ballpark. They are riveting to watch and Levy gets the opportunity to really shine as the main possessed person and also a desperately detoxing drug addict.<br/><br/>I actually thought going into this that Sam Raimi directed this but he was just a producer. However, whoever gave the reigns to Fede Alvarez who also worked on the script and is also a brand new director to feature films picked a talent that will be a force to be reckoned with. Usually a director with little experience make for a bad horror flick but clearly Alvarez is that diamond in the rough. He created something that is sheer brilliance, a horror masterpiece. All the pieces simply fall into place and make this an incredible horror movie experience. The film has it all. It does the cheap scares (the loud noises, or weird faces that make you jump), it has gore galore that make you wince in absolute agony, it has a solid story and an even more solid back story for its characters and the origin of the demon. The whole film practically is in the cabin and you would never want it any other way. Its claustrophobic and the pouring rain and ambiance they create is perfection. There are scenes in this movie that were jaw-dropping. Mia, near the end, in the rain holding the chainsaw was pure Gothic art. Many will disagree with me and frankly I don't care because I want everyone to know this was the best film I have seen in MONTHS...certainly years when it comes to a good horror flick. I watch a ton of horror and most of it is so awful that the only horror is trying to make it to the end. This vindicates the horror genre, and the remake genre. I can't wait to see it again and please horror fans do yourself a favour and see this yesterday!! 10/10"
"MaximumMadness","9","17","46","7 April 2013"," Brutal, ferociously entertaining and insanely over-the-top, 2013's ""Evil Dead"" remake is good, old-fashioned gory horror done right!
","Director/Co-Writer Fede Alvarez and producers Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert and Bruce Campbell have done it. They have accomplished the impossible.<br/><br/>They have, in 2013, made a horror remake/reboot that was actually good. Actually startling. Actually worthwhile.<br/><br/>In an age of horrid Platinum Dunes reboots, watered-down PG-13 horror, and awful direct-to-video gore-fests, Fede Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" is a breath of fresh, blood-fueled air, filled with dozens of callbacks to the original series and enough internal originality to make it worth a watch for any fan of the original trilogy and any fan of extreme horror.<br/><br/>Four friends gather at a secluded cabin deep in the woods to help their friend Mia battle her addiction to dope. Among them are Mia's brother David, David's girlfriend Natalie, David's former friend Eric and Olivia. They have decided to band together to help Mia quit cold turkey after an OD left her legally dead before paramedics were able to revive her.<br/><br/>However, after investigating a mysterious, derelict basement filled with animal carcasses, the five find a mysterious book- bound in flesh. Eric reads passages from the book, unleashing a demonic force that takes hold of Mia and begins to spread throughout the rest of the group, turning them into violent, zombie-like cretins that will stop at nothing to destroy every single one of them.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, ""Evil Dead"" all the way.<br/><br/>The acting is actually admirable for a horror film. Jane Levy as Mia steals the show, both in her performance as human Mia, a sad soul going through withdrawal from drugs, and as the possessed-Mia, an insane, twitching ""Deadite"" who is a ton of fun to watch. Shiloh Fernandez as her brother is also well-played, giving a lot of emotion and becoming a begrudging hero-figure throughout the course of the film. Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore round out the group in performances that are decent, but nothing to write home about. (Although this is mainly due to the script, which focuses mainly on Mia and David's relationship as siblings.)<br/><br/>And the script itself is fundamentally solid. It does dwell a bit before the horror kicks in, but unlike some of the more negative reviews suggest, it gives all the characters motivation and development, and creates a good framing for the events to unfold. I really have to disagree with many people who complain about there being no character development or story- there most certainly is character development and there most certainly is a story here.<br/><br/>The film does take liberties and make changes to the formula, but it's all for the better here. It throws fans familiar to the series curve-balls, and leaves us unable to know what to expect next, which is a good thing. It also builds towards a more natural and fitting climax than the original film, and the stakes feel higher than before.<br/><br/>Alvarez's direction is top-notch. Everything is shot brutally and simply, with a lot of little winks and nods to Sam Raimi's style in the original. I also applaud Alvarez on not over-doing the gritty ""shaky cam"" style of camera-work that has been plaguing horror for the past decade. You know what I mean- that faux-realistic look where everything is shot in shaky hand-held in closeup. Alvarez does use hand-held footage, but for the most part, is able to use it wisely and to add to the chaos, rather than distract from it like most films.<br/><br/>The horror and gore is also outstanding. Some have been complaining about the level of gore in the film, but this is ""Evil Dead."" The original was extremely gory for it's time, and this film had to step it up. And it did. This is one of the goriest wide-releases I've ever seen. From dismemberment's to burns to slices to mutilations, this film really pushes the boundaries of it's R-rating. And I'm glad it did, because it captured not only the desperation of the situation, but at times it also hinted at the camp value of Raimi's original. I was shocked that a few scenes were left intact. And the film is all the more ferociously entertaining for pushing these bounds.<br/><br/>This is, without a doubt, the best horror remake since Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" or Carpenter's ""The Thing."" The original film is still objectively a little bit better because of it's purity and low-budget charm... but this comes close. Very close. And it's still darned good fun.<br/><br/>This is brutal, insane, over-the-top fun. Best horror movie experience this year, and one of the best of the decade. Ignore the nay-sayers. If you love insane, over-the-top madness, this is the film for you. ""Evil Dead"" gets a 9 out of 10."
"mvd102000","8","16","43","7 April 2013"," Disgusting, Gory, & Completely Unapologetic
","Fans of this type of horror movie should be very excited. This movie is a class-A remake and fantastic update of a cult-classic.<br/><br/>Those of you who have seen the original know that the film is known for several things. Absolute carnage and a unique development. This reboot of the classic franchise isn't short on either. From the very beginning, the viewer isn't quite sure where the movie is heading. The opening scene (and several afterward) leave you wondering if this is going to be another remake that doesn't take enough chances to stand on it's own, or if it's another that strays too far without finding any common ground with fans of the original. This film walks that line wonderfully.<br/><br/>Now, if you aren't a lover of horror films of all types, you may or may not enjoy this movie. It's disgusting, gory, and completely unapologetic. That isn't all this remake of the 1981 classic has to offer though. The story is going to be something you've never quite seen before in a big-budget motion picture. Not only that, but it sneaks into the film in a very clever way, making everything that happens in the first 40 minutes or so decently believable, yet horrifically unreal. The character development isn't exactly golden, but is definitely above the standard set by the reincarnations of other hit horror films. The acting is sometimes fantastic, sometimes only average, and sometimes a little lacking. It should not distract from the gross imagery, but the dialogue at times can come off as a little awkward for modern audiences.<br/><br/>As an avid horror fan and a pretty big fan of the original Evil Dead movie, I can say without any doubts or reservations, that this movie is by far the best remake of a horror film this generation has seen to date. Enjoy it for what it is, not what you want it to be."
"aodhan_gallagher1","8","5","10","25 September 2013"," I found it an unpredictable, unique horror with outstanding tension.
","If your heart is not completely set on the original horror then this is a terrific and riveting horror film. It contributes to what I believe horror should be. The violence should not be filtered for teenage viewers, it should be chaotic and it should satisfy the needs of true horror fans. For those who say this is pathetic compared to the original, If you were expecting an exact replica of the original then what would be the point in even remaking it? This is an hugely entertaining and quite frankly hardcore gore horror that is completely captivating and achieves everything that a modern horror should. The reboot of Evil Dead is a very unique remake because it interprets it in an entirely different, gritty way, which creates an edgy, thrilling effect that I personally love. The acting is also very strong and the general film making (including tension building and special effects) are spectacular."
"geor9","7","5","10","21 August 2013"," Ignore the butt-hurt fan-boy reviews
","If these reviewers had their ways anybody who even considered remaking a movie from the Evil Dead series would be publicly executed. Though I understand how die-hard fans of the original could feel that way, I don't think this remake deserves 1 star. The original was, and still remains, a genre defining classic, but to blatantly trash this movie simply because it didn't quite live up to the original is a little ridiculous.<br/><br/>For the most part the story is generally the same as the original, the main difference being the protagonist is female.<br/><br/>I think that Fede Alvarez was a great choice to direct. The fact that he is a huge fan of the original shines through in many scenes of the film. He has carefully placed many nods to the original throughout.<br/><br/>The cast is admirable with Jane Levy being the only recognizable face to me in the lead. Having only seen her Suburgatory, I was shocked and blown away by her performance here.<br/><br/>The gore is through the roof compared to the original. There are some cringe worthy moments here and there but they aren't so over the top that they come off as cheesy or laughable.<br/><br/>The cinematography was pretty impressive as well. There are plenty beautiful yet creepy shots of the misty woods surrounding the cabin that, along with the films score, do a great job of setting an uneasy tone.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who even loosely considers them self a fan of horror. Is it going to change your life or the way you look at cinema? No. It's simply an entertaining modernized reworking of a genre classic, and if you keep that in mind I don't think you'll walk away from this movie regretting you saw it. Give it a chance."

After the movie ended my husband and I sat there speechless. I don't not know how or why there's people giving this 1 and 2 stars. I'm going to assume those people think all remakes suck and go into it without even giving it a chance. There is NOTHING I would change about this movie. It scared the hell out of me.

","Well, the remade the infamous tree rape didn't this.<br/><br/>No, let's not complain about that.<br/><br/>You sit down and watch the original Evil Dead and you got an extremely cheap movie that was trying so hard to be a real horror movie that it could only fail in the most hysterical of ways.<br/><br/>They learned from their mistakes. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness were horrible movies with no real budget, but this time they didn't try to be real movies. They tried to be hysterical movies and they won. They were cheap and funny and developed an enormous cult following because of it.<br/><br/>Then Hollywood turned around and remade it. They upped the budget. They turned it into a real horror movie. They made it serious.<br/><br/>And the people that loved the original walked out utterly confused. How is this the Evil Dead? There's nothing funny about it. It's an actual horror movie? What the heck? Instant hatred.<br/><br/>But, a lot of people that weren't familiar with the originals loved it. They watched it coming in fresh and it delivered, well, a horror movie.<br/><br/>How on earth did that happen? How did Hollywood look at three beloved films and figure that the best way to remake them was to take away what everyone loves about them? The world may never know, but that doesn't make the movie good. It makes it an utter failure."

","In truth this was always going to struggle to appease many of the horror hordes, Sam Raimi's original film held up as some sort of religious artifact that should never be tempered with - this even though it was considerably trumped by the sequel (erm: remake). Is it fair to say that even before it was released there were those hating it? It certainly seemed that way. <br/><br/>Can you judge this piece of horror film making on its own terms? Are there a new breed of horror film fans out there whom haven't seen Raimi's trilogy and therefore can go into it and get the tar shocked out of them? I hope so because this is a rip-snorter of a remake. Full of jumps, guts, gore, and genuine moments of terror, with Fede Alvarez and his team adding some fresh touches to Raimi's original nightmare. <br/><br/>It is what it is, a horror remake of an old favourite that ramps up the horror and uses the tools available to splinter the ears - turn the stomach - and fray the nerves. It's illogical, daft even at times, but this is one of the better horror remakes of recent times, a real pant soiler. Bravo you undead muthas. 8/10"

"ccamp89","7","3","5","3 November 2013"," An Anomalously Worthwhile Remake
","This remake was warranted. <br/><br/>God, something about that phrase feels so blasphemous. It's definitely not something I'd ever expected to say after a film, but in this case it somehow feels appropriate. The original Evil Dead is obviously a seminal, classic horror film that can never be truly replicated. But it becomes apparent from the outset that this movie isn't attempting to reproduce what came before. It comes off more as an homage than anything else – a celebration of the first film in all of its ridiculousness and glorious excess. And although this remake doesn't manage to successfully capture the unique, fun-loving tone of the original, it certainly captures all of the ridiculousness and the excess. <br/><br/>Oh the excess. As I mentioned before, I feel that this is one of those rare remakes that doesn't feel like a useless rehash with no purpose for existing other than to fill some wallets while emptying others. As great as the original film is, it's undeniably dated visually. And since so much of the entertainment of the movie hinges on the absurd levels of gore and all-around-nastiness, the dated visuals definitely hinder the film from being as effective today as it was when it was released. The remake fully rectifies this and then some. This has got to be one of the most visually impressive horror films ever made, especially considering there's barely a shred of CGI to be found. If this movie proves anything, it's that there's no real substitute for great make-up and prosthetics in horror. CGI can be a very tricky thing to pull off in this genre and it often ends up making things that were meant to look scary actually look goofy and artificial. I can wholeheartedly say that everything that is intended to appear scary in this movie definitely looks the part. As far as I'm concerned, this is the absolute best that possessed people have ever looked on screen. They'd be downright gorgeous if they weren't so repulsive. <br/><br/>Sadly though, the rest of the movie doesn't quite live up to the stunning visuals. Although the lead actress gives a very strong performance, none of the other actors (or their characters) are nearly as compelling. Also, something about the pacing of the film felt a bit off to me. The divisions between the scenes where you knew something scary was about to happen and the ""safe"" scenes where there was a lull in the action were a little too transparent. It was essentially always obvious when you should get ready for the next scare and when you could take a breather, which made the suspense of the film feel disjointed. Instead of slowly and relentlessly ratcheting up the tension like the original, the remake feels more like a string of self-contained gruesome scenes parceled up and divided by packing material. The tone of the film also feels a little conflicted. It definitely tries to take a more serious, straight-horror approach for much of its duration but additionally sprinkles in comedic elements reminiscent of the original. These two approaches don't complement each other that well and feel slightly at odds. <br/><br/>Despite its shortcomings, Evil Dead is definitely an anomaly- it's a remake that's actually worth watching for fans of the original film. The inconsistent tone, limp characters and disjointed pacing hold it back from being an excellent film, but none of these pitfalls prevent the film from being a ton of fun and the make-up/effects are second to none. I had a great time watching it and I'd expect most fans of the original would as well."
"McQualude","4","3","5","15 October 2013"," Everything a good factory made horror film can be.
","Evil Dead has plentiful practical effects, a setting faithful to the original, and a halfway decent lead actress but completely fails on story and sound. I liken it to a TV dinner; corn, mash potatoes, and Salisbury steak with gravy... lots of gravy. Because even though the mash potatoes taste like Elmer's paste, splash some gravy on there and suddenly they go down fine. Maybe spoon that corn into your potatoes and mix it up, take a bite of Salisbury steak with potatoes and it's dandy; if you have plenty of gravy. Evil Dead has no gravy and by gravy I mean sound. The gravy ties the dinner together so even if the corn or potatoes are lacking, you don't mind as much. Sound (or silence) sets the mood and creates ambiance and is arguably the most important ingredient. Here they play generic music mixed with random noises and the dry instant potatoes just sit in your mouth waiting to be washed down. To summarize the movie: Character acts unreasonably stupid to set up gross out scene. Excellent disgusting effects ensue. Character waits until effects are finished then impotently reacts. Repeat ad nauseam. I hate this type of bad horror film more than any other because the filmmakers had resources, had talent available, and they chose to make a mediocre movie. If you programmed a robot to make a horror film, Evil Dead 2013 is what you would get."
"totodarlo","4","3","5","1 August 2013"," Another remake falls on its face
","Now let me start off saying that the Evil Dead remake is by no means a bad film, in fact if you had called it something else all together and not made it part of the Evil Dead franchise then it might have been somewhat watchable. Sadly this is a remake of a cult movie with a huge following and I can confidently say that a tiny tiny tiny percentage of them will have been happy that this was made. Making matters worse Bruce Campbell not starring as Ash was......the final nail in the coffin.<br/><br/>But lets pretend that its not Evil Dead, lets imagine its just another horror movie and look at it with neutral eyes and what do we have? Oh yeah....just another horror movie.<br/><br/>Production looks great, the Deadites look.....o....k....I guess. And the story is, again rather generic and very predictable.<br/><br/>Again I'm putting aside the fact it doesn't feel like an Evil Dead movie and instead just focusing on the movie itself as an individual, a movie that has been hyped to hell and given rave reviews by damn near every magazine and horror site. But even with neutral eyes I cannot claim this to be anything more than your average kids getting killed off one by one horror flick and without giving anything away I can tell you that it has some absurd scenes that will have you yelling at your television and performing a face palm or two.<br/><br/>The creators tried, I'll give them that. But this is a prime example of how some movies just need to be left the hell alone, if the original reaches the cult status it has with its legion of fans then back away and consider making a sequel NOT a remake that's just going to anger people. Speaking of which get both Sam and Ted Raimi, get Bruce Campbell and make us a real evil dead film please :)"

","Evil Dead is more of a re-imagining rather than a remake, and to be honest I am glad they went this way. I will start off with the stuff I did not like about this film. The blonde and Jessica Lucas are very forgettable, it's not like they were ""bad"", just forgettable. And this next one is more of a nit-pick but it will not be the most terrifying film you will ever experience, hell, it may be one of them, but I hardly doubt it will be ""THE"" most terrifying film you will ever experience. Now I can get to the stuff I liked. Shiloh Fernandez does pretty good acting wise. Jane Levy and Lou Taylor are absolutely amazing. The gore is amazing and even though this might not be the scariest film you ever see, it still has some good scares and shocks and the atmosphere is creepy and unnerving.

Considering that most of the horrific gore-gimmicks were revealed in the prominent redband trailer, why did so many people who didn't want to see 91 minutes of sickening camped up gore go to this movie? I thought it was pretty clear that the film's sole objective was to gross you out with as many different power tools and sharp objects as possible. <br/><br/>The negative reviews should be ascribed to the people who knew what Evil Dead was, saw the trailer, read critics reviews, and then continued to go see a movie which they quite obviously were not interested in. This is not to say that this is a good movie, or more specifically a movie that most people would enjoy. But honestly, you went to a movie called Evil Dead and came back complaining about bad acting, over the top merciless gore, and lack of substance? <br/><br/>Shame on you.<br/><br/>If you have the intellect to understand what this movie is all about, and can manage to find some joy in cringing in the face of all things unsettling and morally depraved, by all means, join in on the fun.

"PureGore","10","18","55","7 April 2013"," Exceeded All My Expectations
","I've been a huge fan of the Evil Dead films for 3 decades. They're a big part of my movie-watching while growing up. During this time, I've shared the movies with all my friends and family. Any new addition to these films would have to reach a very high bar to meet my approval. So when I heard a remake was in the works, I was both excited and concerned.<br/><br/>My concerns grew when I found out the movie would not be directed by Sam Raimi, and would not be starring Bruce Campbell in any capacity. Then I found out this was being directed by a rookie, who also penned the screenplay. I was convinced this movie had ""disaster"" written all over it.<br/><br/>Turns out I had nothing to worry about.<br/><br/>It's been many years since a movie actually got my heart racing, and it was amazing to have that feeling again after so long. Evil Dead is a thrill ride that gripped me and didn't let go until at least an hour after it had ended.<br/><br/>It was also refreshing because there were almost none of the typical moments where I asked yourself ""Why did he do that? That's stupid!"". The premise of the movie gives a good reason for the characters to remain at the cabin long after most sane people would've taken off.<br/><br/>Half the fun of the movie was spotting all the cues taken from the first 2 movies, but given their own twist in this re-imagining. Bitten hand that goes bad and needs to be chopped off? Check! Stump-wielding a chainsaw? Check! Demon locked in the cellar? Check! If you've got a favourite scene in one of the first 2 Evil Dead movies, then there's an homage to it in this movie somewhere. But these cues aren't shoe-horned in for the sake of fan service, they're skillfully crafted into the story line in a way that makes these cues unique and shocking in their own way. It's like the writers took these ludicrous moments from the first 2 movies, and turned them into the genuinely scary devices they were meant to be in the first place.<br/><br/>I loved how this movie kept me guessing. Sure, I think I KNOW what's gonna happen next. It's been done this way in movies countless times before. But the story throws just enough loops in that there's always doubt. I thought I knew how this movie would end, and I was wrong. And being wrong was awesome, because the end turned out to be way better than my expectations.<br/><br/>Mind you, that may not be the fairest way to put it. After all, my expectations were pretty low. So let me state it this way: I can't stand to watch a movie twice in a row, no matter how much I enjoy it. Usually, if I watch a movie, I'm done with it for at least 3 years. But I want to race back to the theatre and watch Evil Dead again RIGHT NOW! And I bet I'd love to watch it a 3rd or 4th time. It was just that much fun.<br/><br/>Do I have a favourite among the Evil Dead series? Not really. I enjoy all of them for different reasons. But Evil Dead stands right up there among my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>(as a counterpoint, my wife watched most of the movie with her eyes half-closed, and felt disturbed for hours afterwards... so this movie definitely isn't for everyone, especially if you're squeamish)"

When i found out this was actually the 3rd in a trilogy, i immediately set out finding the first 2 parts to watch them. Boy was i surprised to discover that the original EVIL DEAD would be one of the most sadistic roller-coaster rides of horror that I would ever experience...<br/><br/>Now i was someone who, upon hearing about a remake, had the immediate reaction of ""SACRILEGE!"" It seemed like such an insanely bad idea. The original is one of those iconic flicks in horror history. Why remake it?<br/><br/>I put off seeing it for the first 4 weekends of it's release, but when I needed an excuse to get out to the movies this weekend, it was the only one on the docket i was remotely interested in, so in I went.<br/><br/>And gosh-darnit if i didn't have a darned similar experience to the one i had the first time i watched EVIL DEAD. The violence on screen was deliciously stomach-churning at times, exactly as the original film had made me feel. <br/><br/>It was lacking in the kinetic, comicbook style of Raimi's original, instead opting for the darker, grainier look of the modern horror film, but the violence was unrelenting. Just when you thought it couldn't get worse in a scene, it always managed to. That's how the original finale of Raimi's classic made me feel. It was like ""Gore upon gore upon gore"". <br/><br/>This won't replace Raimi's classic, but it did a much better job of capturing the feel of the original then I ever thought it would or could."

Once you have, you'll realize that redemption can be just a camping trip, some good company, and a Necronomicon away."

","My film review is on the movie ""The Evil Dead"" (2013). It is a horror film that starts out with a young girl Mia, (Jane Levy) that is addicted to heroin. Her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and their 3 friends take her to their parent's cabin so she can detox. She swears up and down to never touch the drug again and dumps it down a well. When she starts detoxing, she goes crazy and starts hearing voices and steals her brother's car and tries to go home. She ends up crashing and at that point one of the friends, Eric (Lou Pucci), finds a book and reads a passage in it. He ends up waking up a demon that possesses Mia when she's running through the woods. They end up finding her and take her back to the cabin. When Mia gets possessed she starts killing each and every one of her friends saving the brother for last all because in the book the demon needs five pure souls to bring his own corpse up from hell. <br/><br/>I believe that the director's intention was to provide a movie with not only a subtle plot scheme but also the most gore ever seen in one movie. This movie makes the blood spilling in Kill Bill look like someone got a paper cut. Fede Alvarez is the director and I think he did an excellent job at creating the gore affect. Some might say if was a little over dramatic and the actors reaction to their limbs and stuff getting cut off was a little less than someone would react to in reality. I mean Eric was one of the last guys to die and he was shot and shot with a nail gun and beaten by a crow bar and he still didn't die.<br/><br/>My overall opinion on the movie would be an 8 out of 10 the plot and acting was a little weak but the gore and demon affect was spot on. I especially like the special effects they did with the demon and the eyes of the people that were possessed. They turned a hazel looking color which made the watcher know for sure that the characters were possessed."
"brando647","8","4","8","27 September 2013"," A Brutal, Visceral Modern Vision of the Cult Favorite
","This is the part where I make the most obsessive of fans' stomachs churn: I didn't hate the new EVIL DEAD. Not only did I not hate it, I actually had fun with it. It's no masterpiece and it doesn't come close to the level of Sam Raimi's original cult favorite, but it's good enough for what it is. Let's face it: remakes are the current go-to cash grab in Hollywood and just about every film you've ever loved is probably going to be rebooted, remade, reimagined, etc. at some point in the near future. EVIL DEAD might be a popular example as to a property that didn't need modernization, but I believe it to be a lot better than most people give it credit. There are a lot of, admittedly, viable complaints about the new movie but, if you can overlook some of it's problems, there is some awesome stuff here. The movie is an all-too-familiar premise: five friends are secluding themselves away in the woods in a long-abandoned cabin. As opposed to the average 'cabin-in-the-woods' horror movie, these friends have a purpose behind their visit besides boozing and debauchery: David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his friends have gathered for his sister Mia (Jane Levy) to help her kick a nasty heroin habit. They've brought her out to the woods, away from temptation and escape, to help her get clean. The cabin belongs to their family but they haven't used it in a while, and it's since been used for other sinister purposes. In the basement, sitting among the remains of some bizarre occult ritual, the friends discover a flesh-bound book wrapped in barbed wire and unleash an ancient evil with their meddling.<br/><br/>Before I explain why I don't hate this movie, let me clarify that, yes, I have seen the original EVIL DEAD movies but it's been over ten years. I don't own them in my collection, not because I don't want to, but because I'm a sucker for the best edition of a movie on DVD with the most in-depth special features and the EVIL DEAD movies have about three billion different DVD editions and each has their own separate group of special features. When attempting to decide which edition was best, my brain shut down from all the input and I just gave up. Maybe some day<br/><br/>For starters, I love the look and feel of this movie. It's gritty and gloomy, the woods are constantly fogged over and give the cabin an even more remote feeling. This place truly feels like it's own little world and there is no escape when the evil forces join the fun. It's isolated and claustrophobic. Then there's the fact that everything in this movie has a grimy feel. Everything seems wet and dirty, and the colors are pretty muted with the whole movie having a very neutral tone with the exception of the color red. It seems to me the filmmakers really wanted the red here to pop. There's so many earth tones, blacks, and grays that the blood gets an extra visual bang when it explodes on the screen. And explode it does because this movie is easily one of the most brutally violent I've seen in a good long time. Maybe this is because I'm not the biggest horror fan but my experience with modern horror movies is limited to some smaller indie shockers and horror anthologies. EVIL DEAD is incredibly graphic and people with a weaker stomach might want to just skip it. I've got an iron stomach for movie gore but I'll admit there were a few moments in this movie that had me cringing. Dismemberments, immolation, blood, vomit, carvings, and on and on. There should be enough here to satisfy gore hounds, but I need a bit more than that to really dig a movie.<br/><br/>My problem with horror movies, and I've mentioned this in other comments on here, is that there's little focus on character development because we know as an audience going in that most of these characters are just there to die gruesome deaths. No sense in giving a character more personality than your average archetype if you're just going to disembowel them a half hour into the film, right? Well, that makes for boring times whenever there's a lull in the action because I don't care what the characters have to say. At least the characters in EVIL DEAD are fleshed out enough to give them a little purpose. We learn about David and Mia and their tormented histories. Olivia (Jessica Lucas) is some sort of nurse, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) is a high school teacher, and both come in handy a bit with their fun in the cabin. Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) is nothing more than David's girlfriend and serves no purpose other than a wicked little throwback to the original film with the help of an electric carving knife. I'm not saying these characters are well-written, flesh and bloodbut we know a little about them, they're distinct personalities (except for Natalie), and they contribute a little to the film.<br/><br/>Still, above-average horror film characters and enough blood and guts to open a hot dog factory are not enough for me to find more than a passing interest in the movie and, for the first two thirds of the film or so, I wasn't all that impressed. I was entertained enough but I wasn't wow'd. But then we came to the final act. The movie fooled with about an hour in when it seemed everything was wrapping up and coming to a close. I was disappointed and ready to write this movie off as throwaway entertainmentbut then, the movie kicks into overdrive and takes a sudden left turn into CrazyTown. I'm not going to spoil anything here about the end but it was so over-the-top that it saved my opinion of the movie at the last minute."

","A young woman attempts to kick a drug addiction by holing up with five friends in a secluded cabin.  Soon the discovery of a secret cellar leads to the unearthing of a mysterious book, the uttering of ancient Latin and the animation of a great, soul-thirsty evil. After an opening sequence falsely promises a blend of modern horror aesthetics and Raimi wit, the film quickly devolves, Alvarez content on re-imagining Evil Dead as a relentless, joyless splatterama.  When illogical, ill-defined protagonists, dialoguing solely in first act horror sequiturs give way to extended scenes of closeup, hyper-realized violence, Alvarez's inspiration shifts from the source material. Not content with the assigned text, his film begins to mimic Fulci's earlier practical-effect gorefests, only without the inspired lunacy that makes those films so captivating. It's a dire situation when a protagonist has been put through so much torture, yet her victory still feels unearned. Remember all those times you were watching The Evil Dead films thinking ""I wish this was super realistic, way, way grosser and devoid of a charismatic lead""? Me neither. C-"

","The awaited remake of Sam Raimi's THE EVIL DEAD arrived with a sentence, written all over the poster: ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience"". While it's not, since there are things like MARTYRS (Pascal Laugier, 2008 – the most ""terrifying"" film of the new millennium in my opinion), the gore fest that Fede Alvarez offers is one of the most satisfying horror movies in recent memory. <br/><br/>Just like Eli Roth came with his ""godfathers"" Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson, the young Uruguayan Alvarez arrived with the backup of Raimi and Bruce Campbell and without many experience (EVIL DEAD is his very first feature film). Alvarez ain't the disappointment that Eli Roth was with CABIN FEVER and HOSTEL, and without a doubt his next project (it seems it will be EVIL DEAD 2) looks instantly attractive. <br/><br/>The elements of the plot change – the sister of the hypothetically ""new Ash"" (turns to be played by an actor who's too ""juvenile"") suffers of a severe drug addiction. It all starts with her new attempt of getting sober inside a cabin in the woods, certainly. The transition feels natural and it all works: the friends of the girl, just like his brother, think the supernatural changes she's having (you know what type of changes) are just effects of the abstinence. Obviously, we know what it means to have those scenes with the camera quickly moving through the woods. <br/><br/>Part of that fun vulgarity of the original is present here too; there are some moments of pure black humor ready to be appreciated by fans of Raimi. The characters suffer and suffer again and from our point of view it all looks really f****** painful; it's a movie with enough mutilations. When I watched it on the big screen some people left the theater, so the deal is quite simple: if you like bloody movies, EVIL DEAD will not disappoint you for the lack of gore. It's fast, entertaining, and has an emblematic climax with blood literally everywhere, obscenities, and the classic chainsaw! <br/><br/>*Watched it on 02 April, 2013"

","This week I rewatched the original Evil Dead. I like it but I am not the biggest fan of that movie. Last night I came home late and turned on the TV to see the 2013 version. It's a total mess.<br/><br/>Acting is bad, CGI is bad for a 2013 movie. The CGI seemed to be pulled out of a PS4 or something. It was no real horror story, just a reshoot of the original with lots of gare, a few minor scares and a whole load of stupidity. Yeah the story is one pile up of stupid actions take by the characters. And the movie was almost unwatchable because everything was filmed so darkly. It was like they tried to hide the cheapness of it all. It's clear that the supposed 14 million budget is not used for filming but for a marketing campaign with trailers and positive reviews on film sites.<br/><br/>This movie takes itself too seriously and the gore is overdone. It's like they just tried to shock people with gore and more gore. If you like that, this movies is for you. If you want to see horror, this movie is to be avoided. It uses much of the original movie as a template but they changed some things to make it more serious like the rehab part of why they went to the cabin in the first place.

","A straight horror vibe, some extreme cringe-inducing gore and a surprise final act do enough to differentiate this from the original but, while it may be the better film overall, it can't top the raw charm of the cult classic. 'Evil Dead (2013)' is a commendable effort, though. It's certainly one of the better remakes I've seen. The film captures what it is that Raimi and company would have gone for if they had the budget and experience to do so back in 1981, achieving that over-the-top but seemingly 'realistic' gore-fest feel that makes it not for the squeamish. It's probably one of the goriest films I've seen, with powerful practical effects grounding everything in reality and capturing the spirit of the original. Maybe it is just nostalgia or its odd charm that makes 'The Evil Dead (1981)' seem slightly better than this one, because by all counts this is the superior attempt. It honestly does everything the first tried to but does it better. I like it just as much, yet would rather watch Raimi's picture. That's no comment on the quality of this title, though, rather just the lasting, palpable yet intangible allure of that 'video-nasty' that everyone loved to hate and now just loves to love. 7/10"
"gastonhayen-625-993594","2","2","3","10 January 2018"," Fede Alvarez doesn't get the original and this is the result...
","I wanted to love this remake so much, but unfortunately it doesn't hold a candle to the original. Although Alvarez claims to love the original, I doubt he really understands what The Evil Dead (1981) actually achieved. <br/><br/>Let's start with the positives;
* Cinematography is good. The Cabin, the woods, the visuals - great stuff. <br/><br/>Negatives ;
* The cast of characters is a typical group of stereotypes that lack personality. Ash carried the first movie and the interpersonal relationships were believable. Two couples and a guy's sister who just wanted to get away a couple of days. The 2013 characters feel soulless and bland in comparison.The Jock, the nerd, the hot chick...awful. It immediately makes that you don't care about any of them whereas you come to love the hell out of Ash, the haphazard, reluctant hero who turns badass.<br/><br/>* The necronomicon. The original was a mysterious, evil book which didn't divulge what it's intentions were. The 2013 version however...wow. It is practically a step-by-step instruction manual for dummies on how possession takes place and how to combat it. The fact that all pages contain notes in different languages takes away from the mystery - apparently this has happened dozens of times before all over the world. The notes aren't very eloquent either and consist of singular curse words...ok.<br/><br/>* The deadites. The original characters were menacing, broody and disgusting creatures that struggled in their possessed human bodies - which is confirmed in the final scenes. You always felt they were clamoring to come out but were limited in their options. The white eyes were horrifying - I can't get the image of possessed cheryl out of my mind for the rest of my life. This version degrades the deadites to foul-mouthed exorcist like masochistic creatures which never 'feel' right - too generic and too much off the mark.<br/><br/>* The story. This version is so full of dumb decisions and plot holes that I can't even begin to describe them. Again, it falls into the category of horror film tropes which get annoying after 30 minutes. You begin to hate the characters and actually hope they get killed off. The original was way more believable and convincing in it's story and therefore way more terrifying in all aspects. <br/><br/>All in all, this is a generic horror movie that doesn't even start to do justice to the original. I don't know how much creative input Alvarez had but as far as I understand he was given the green light on all aspects - and therefore fails miserably to capture the soul of the original. Watch a blueray of the original instead, it is far superior in all aspects."

I don't scare or ""jump"" easily with horror films but this one caught me a couple times. The ""feel"" of this movie is definitely different than the originals, it felt more like a horror film compared to the original's horror content but comical overacting mood. Both styles and movies are great in their own way, and I love Bruce Campbell as much as the next guy, but it was refreshing to see the new approach and new vision to this remake! (I mean, who really wants to see the exact same movie with different characters anyways?) The Cinematography was beautiful in this film, so props to Aaron Morton, and the acting was on par. A lot of horror films have at least one actor who seems..well, like they can't act. I felt like this film had no weak actors. Now to address the haters. From what I've read on the low votes on this movie was because 1)It wasn't exactly like the originals and 2) It wasn't realistic. As I previously said, I liked how it wasn't the exact same thing and that they are both great in their own ways. So if you think the originals are absolutely perfect and don't want to see anything else other than that, then KEEP WATCHING THE ORIGINALS. You're already setting yourself up to hate anything past them. As for the second point, I'll say ""As if the originals were SO realistic..."" haha! The point of the originals were to be over the top, and they achieved that. This remake may not have been SCIENTIFICALLY realistic, like on how to dismember an arm, but the effects were pretty damn grotesque and real ""looking"" to anyone with a sense of imagination. Definitely far from cheesy. So if you are a scientist/doctor in human biology AND a perfectionist where if tendons tear the wrong way it will bother you, then this film may not be for you. But props to the FX team, I thought they did a fantastic job. I totally recommend this movie to any horror lover."

"marais-alexander","7","2","3","3 November 2013"," The campiness of the original cannot be replicated with CGI
","Part of what made the original so great were the dated - but (because of their cheesiness) - genuinely evocative disturbing special effects and gore. In Evil Dead (2013), we have a dream team of a cast that feels somewhat underused. Underused because people who can really act shouldn't be in an Evil Dead movie. If Fede Alvarez was going to do a very serious take on the subject matter of Evil Dead, then it would have worked. But the tonal inconsistencies between moments of ridiculous splatter, a CGI tree rape, black comedy, and a genuine drama about a heroin addict just don't hold together for me. If you're going to do it grim, do it grim. If you're going to do it cheesy, do it cheesy. Mixing both is mixing oil with water, negatively affecting both. That being said, something also to note is the deaths. While the original was unflinchingly graphic with its death scenes (take an eye gouging, head rolling, head exploding, etc. etc.) this remake's death scenes aren't too graphic. A possessed person's head gets squashed, but there's too little seen to actually make it fully affecting. A film like this, with the reputation of ""being the most terrifying film experience"" in its particular genre of horror, shouldn't shy away from such things. Granted, we may have the censors to thank for this. There are some highlights. The actress who plays Mia does a solid job. I wish the movie could have been as interesting as her performance, because minus the bloodshed her character's spiritual journey from victim to victor is quite inspiring. All in all, see it if you're a fan of the original. Just for fun, compare the two. One thing's for certain, if you're a virgin to the horror genre - this will be quite affecting. If you're experienced, this will be sadly below your expectations."

","It should not really come as a surprise to anyone that this movie is a bit of a gore-feast. I have to admit that I have not seen the original movie from 1981 so I cannot comment as to whether this one is better or worse. Personally, I thought it was quite okay and a step above the classical B-movies that these kind of horror movies frequently turns out to be.<br/><br/>The story is not really very original. Not that it had any chance of being that since it is a remake after all but the ""group of young people get stuck in cabin in the woods while evil things make bad things happen"" was not really the most original one already when the first movie came out. It is a straightforward enough horror movie story and it is quite well implemented.<br/><br/>The special effects (read gore) is well done and not too ridiculous and over the top as in some movies. Some may of course consider that the gore levels that we talk about here are always over the top but then this is obviously not a movie for you so do not watch it. Of course there are some ridiculous moments in the movie though. For some reason they never seem to be able to make a horror movie without them. There is the always present dumb guy that stops and feels sorry when the demon starts to whine in the voice of his girlfriend or sister even though he knows it is a demon for example. The amount of punishment these people take and still walk around is also a bit ludicrous. Warning, slight spoiler ahead! I especially think the scene where Mia pulls her arm so hard that she separates it from her hand is just silly. There is no way she would have the strength to do that and there is even less way that she would be able to walk around afterwards. She would have passed out from shock at the very best.<br/><br/>Anyway, as I said, no one seems to be able to make a horror movie without some silliness in it so I cannot say that I was very surprised. In general it was a good movie though. Well implemented with a fitting scary mood in a lot of the scenes. I have to say that I liked the fact that there was no hysterical teenage beauty queen and actor wannabee running around screaming her head off all the time. Actually, that is another thing that elevates this movie to a slightly higher state than the traditional B-movie state of most horror movies. The acting in general was quite acceptable.<br/><br/>In general it made for an enjoyable movie eveningif you like gory horror movies that is."

","When teasers and trailers were just releasing for Evil Dead, I can't imagine how entertaining and gruesome this remake will be when I get to see it in theaters, and by the time I did, I am sort of impressed by it.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez directed an all-knowing iconic film with the decent selection of actors/actresses who acted surprisingly well with the authenticity they maintain to keep my attention clinging onto the aspects of the movie. The plot is simple: Five people go into a cabin with a dash of evil screwing them up from a book. It's a total horror movie cliché but it was still worth watching. People always complain about the ingenuity that this remake lacks, and I agree with that but in my personal opinion, isn't that what logic and morality comes in to make it real? (aside from some scenes) .-.<br/><br/>The scenes were cunning to an average viewer's sight and I can admit that I lost myself; the screams and jumps that occur during a suspenseful scene just, keeps me cringing on the edge of my seat, it's that scary! The gore was one of the key aspects to make this real and daunting, yet it doesn't do much to increase the ratings from viewers, I mean you can take the hint from watching the trailers and 50 gallons of fake blood, well that was an 'overkill'. :P<br/><br/>Let's not forget Jane Levy's portrayal was what made the movie enjoying, yet cringe worthy to see: The tree vine scene and Demon Mia scene was what let us admire about Jane Levy and her superb acting. Shiloh's acting was yet exceptional to appreciate from some people's perspective, including mine.<br/><br/>Although the marketing on this was mildly misleading: scariest movie ever made, I doubt that, Human Centipede disagrees with that too. It was entertaining, definitely worth the watch, just not worth over $10 to see it."

All of the elements are here to bring this full circle to what makes the Evil Dead special. Is it perfect? No, but it's pretty darn close. A remake of this caliber could never be done to satisfy all Evil Dead fans, but you cannot deny the huge amount of effort that went into it to try. I'm sure most fans were disappointed that Bruce Campbell didn't return to be in this, but that's fine. Bruce himself has said that it's time for it to go in another direction, and they went out of their way to add all kinds of homages to the other films. I'm glad that they decided to do something different instead of repeating the same thing. There are a few small things that I would have liked to seen changed or omitted, but they are few and far between. Anyone claiming that this is nothing but a gore fest should probably go back and watch the original films again.

","I watched the original, ""The Evil Dead"", not long after it came out on video in the early 80s. It was low budget and, while the story was pretty basic, at least it made sense, thus:<br/><br/><ul><li>No-one had a choice. All events were unavoidable once the book had been read out loud.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ""hero"", Ash, isn't injured by an entry wound at all - he just gets lots of blood and guts dumped on him and hit by a poker. Hence he is never possessed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nobody makes any really (and I mean really) stupid decisions.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Nobody who is possessed can be retrieved.</li></ul><br/><br/>In this version all four of those rules are broken, most of them multiple times.<br/><br/>This film goes for over-the-top gore, but in so doing it just loses any fright power it might have had. The more understated original is far more frightening.<br/><br/>I'm giving it 3 stars - two more than it deserves - because at least they tried to make the ending somewhat different to the original."

","Well , this movie is really something . A friend told me to watch evil dead and i watched this one , not knowing that this was a remake from an older movie . I've gotta say , this movie shocked me the first time i watched it . Usually , movies don't make me sick . but this one managed to do it . Its not as filled with horror as it is with gore , but it works . What annoyed me though , was that the guy (Eric) reads aloud something from the Book of the dead even if it's written in the book not to read anything aloud , bad decision but it's a horror movie , so yeah .
From the burned-alive girl in the prologue , Olivia slicing half of her face , Mia slicing her tongue in two by licking a knife , Natalie slicing her infected arm to Mia ripping of her arm from under the car and then slicing the demon in half with a chainsaw , this movie really impressed me , shocked me , made me sick and made me feel the pain of the characters . It's different from the original movie , but i still like it . I would recommend this movie but only to people with a strong stomach ."
"dakjets","3","1","1","27 April 2018"," Just silly. Don't waste your time or money
","It seems that the reviews to this one are either top-notch or completely bane. I gave it a shot. But unfortunately, this is just incredibly bad.
First, the storyline is not credible. Why iwould these young people travel together? It does not show that they like each other either in the first place. And then they'll be together on a hut in the wasteland. Strange. The beginning of the film made me think this is crap. When the scary things begins to happen, they characters act so stupid that it is almost comical. Not logical in a thin, thin story that makes no sense. A better script would probably have been useful.
No, this is far from good enough for me. I turned it off after about one hour..."
"markelia","Null","1","1","18 February 2018"," What do you want from this film?
","If you want the original Evil Dead, there are some connections to the older film here and some new additions.
The set feels nostalgic and remiscent.
The brutality is certainly here, lots of cringy gore.
No censorship, some sexually disturbing shots (a bit like the older one).<br/><br/>The story and characters are somewhat deviant, however. I thought that the script and the acting were weak at the start, but I think that Mia really got into her role once things picked up. The rest of performances were sub-par and the characters themselves were boring and had no depth/interrelationships that were notable.
 
BUT, as far as horror movies go, I still think this was a good movie. I watched it alone in the dark, so that may have added to the thrill a bit, but it certainly has the potential to keep you biting your nails and jumping off your seat every once in awhile. I think that the opening scene, by the way, was PHENOMENAL. So well done in my opinion, one of the best openers for a horror.<br/><br/>If you watch horrors with the same mindset that you have for all other films, I'd say it's a 5/10.
If you watch horrors with the mindset that you're going to be watching a horror (as I do), I'd give it a 7/10.<br/><br/>That being said, to name a few horror movies that I hold in high regard:
Conjuring films, The Thing (old one), The Mist, The Ritual, It Follows, The Others, The Village, The Witch."
"Brc123","6","1","1","24 April 2015"," First half was great, second half fell apart...
","I would like to state that I have never seen any of the other Evil Dead movies (even though I definitely should), so I will be reviewing this as a stand alone film and not comparing it to the movies it was remaking.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this movie had a very solid first half. I even went into this movie with pretty low expectations after reading and watching some spoiler-free reviews that didn't give it very favourable ratings. The opening scene was pretty freaking creepy to me and it helped introduce the viewers to the concept of ""possession"" that they will be using in the film. It became apparent, the dark tone that the film was setting for itself right from the get-go and it complemented the film very well. The scenes where the demon was released and Mia getting possessed in the woods were really freaky in my opinion. The scares that they provided felt quite genuine and not tacked on. The movie was setting up rules for itself to follow later in the plot (an example would be ""If the demon feasts on five souls, it'll get released from hell""), and at this point I didn't understand the criticism the film was receiving. The first two deaths were very gory and disturbing and the shock value added to the scariness of the movie. Sure, there wasn't all that much character development happening, maybe a plot hole or two, characters were making stupid decisions, but like 95% of horror movies are plagued with of all that but worse these days. I thought the movie was on the right track.<br/><br/>Fast-forward to right about after the second girl died and the movie was starting to go down the drain. Characters decisions became more and more dumb. Scares became cheap and tiresome. A bunch of random sh*t was happening and it actually started to become boring. Logic became less and less apparent (How did Mia speak completely fine in the grave when she cut her tongue in half with an X-Acto knife?). By the finale, the movie literally threw all of the rules it set for itself out the freaking window. I thought the demon need to ""claim"" five souls before it could rise from the ground? It only possessed four people and one of them got unpossessed (Mia) before it even came out of the ground. That's three souls, not five. Does that one guy who never even got possessed but burned to death in the house count? Because that's still four. Does the dog that Mia killed count?! God, if you're going to try to set up some weird demon logic for your movie, you should at least stick to it. Well, apparently the weird demon/abomination thing rises from the ground anyway for an epic final battle! Jk it's not epic, it's just predictable and boring. Mia rips her own arm off like it's made of mashed potatoes because the demon thing flipped a jeep on her arm. It ends with Mia killing the abomination demon (still don't even know what to call it) and walking off into the sunrise without one of her freaking arms. Are we expected to believe that there is any hope for her and she won't just bleed to death? The bridge was taken out by the flood and I don't think there are any accessible towns nearby. Oh yeah, and they tried to throw in some weird twist in the last 3 seconds by zooming in on the book flipping pages, like it did earlier in the movie when something bad was gonna happen. But it just felt so tacked on and lame. So yeah, to conclude, the second half was pretty terrible.<br/><br/>For some of the things I haven't addressed like the acting, score, atmosphere, and cinematography. Well the acting wasn't as bad as other reviews have stated in my opinion. Jane Levy's (Mia) performance was actually really good and Lou Taylor Pucci's (Eric) performance was also pretty solid. The three other actors who played David, Olivia, and Natalie, their performances ranged from good to mediocre. The score was nothing to remember at all. The atmosphere was actually very well done, very creepy and unsettling. And the cinematography was also quite impressive (for instance, the shots where it showed the demon chasing a character or going to a destination through the forest in first- person view).<br/><br/>All in all, it is an alright horror film. The first half was great, the acting was pretty good, it had a creepy atmosphere and the cinematography was quite impressive. But it was brought down by a tragic second half, some cheap scares, flawed logic, plot holes, forgettable soundtrack and its failure to stay consistent with its own rules that it set for itself at the start.<br/><br/>6/10"
"burlesonjesse5","5","1","1","4 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Evil Dead
","The tag line for the poster of this movie reads ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" Talk about false advertising. Evil Dead (remake of the original The Evil Dead (1981)) is probably not even as terrifying as a episode of Scooby Doo. Which begs the question: why is it so important for horror films to be remade. I just don't get it. Is it to make money? C'mon, that shouldn't be the reason. Is it so a new generation of fans can experience a second rate version of a beloved classic? Hope not. Here's an idea, how about watching the darn original. Really, enough is enough. So far there have been remakes of The Fog (2005) (absolutely dreadful), The Amityville Horror (2005) (a Ryan Reynolds movie so I don't need to say anymore), Halloween (2007) (watchable but Rob Zombie is no John Carpenter), and Nightmare On Elm St. (2010) (far and away one of the worst remakes of all time in any film genre). There is one exception though. The remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) which came out in 2003, was pretty solid. But we all know what happened after that, Texas Chainsaw The Beginning (2006) and Texas Chainsaw 3D (2010). Lord help us.<br/><br/>Anyway, sticking somewhat close to the plot of the original, Evil Dead tells the tale of 5 friends (one of which looks like a cross between 90's rocker Kurt Cobain and 70's folk singer Sammy Johns) who while staying at a log cabin (literally in the middle of nowhere), are tormented and tortured by evil forces beyond their control. You see, they entered the basement and found a book entitled, ""The Book of the Dead."" This book is bad news because reading it brings back, or propels demons to enter from the nearby woods.<br/><br/>You get the point. What makes this Evil Dead a lousy and tired exercise is simple: there is a lot of blood and gore but it's just not that scary. When a film is scary to me, it haunts me for days. I have trouble sleeping. I think about it long after the credits roll. The only thing rolling when I left the theater was my eyes. The acting, though not necessarily Oscar worthy in most horror movies is monumentally bad in this one. The lead actor and I guess hero (Shiloh Fernandez playing the character David), looks like a cross between Vincent Gallo and Joaquin Phoenix. That's about it. His acting range is about as wooden as the log cabin that is shown in the first five minutes. The other members of the cast try hard with the stale script. But in the end they give off the vibe that they're just happy to be in a film in general. The biggest omission with these characters is being in any peril or actual real danger. When they're being tortured by the demons, you can barely hear them scream. It's almost faint I tell you. And the scares (or lack there of) which are typical of good horror films, have that ""seen it before"" feel in this one. If you want a truly terrifying movie that takes place in a log cabin, go with Cabin Fever (2002). It's underrated, not seen by hardly anyone, and its premise and execution of that premise, will chill you to the bone.<br/><br/>Let's face it, most moviegoers after seeing this mess will probably prefer the original The Evil Dead (1981). I'm one of them. It had a grainy old school look to it which I liked. It wasn't the most terrifying movie I ever saw but I do give it points for being comedic and over the top. This remake however is not comedic and it is over the top but not in a good way. I will give it credit though for actually trying to break new ground. It adds a subplot about David's sister (Jane Levy) harboring to get over her drug addiction therefore throwing out a different reason for the five characters to venture to the woods. And the special effects, they garner it at least one extra star from me. They aren't too shabby. But again, you need more than just your typical gross out horror tactics to make a good film. Honestly, i'd have to say that Evil Dead suffers mostly from just being flat out stylish.<br/><br/>All and all it's maddening that the guys from the first Evil Dead (Bruce Campbell (star) and Sam Raimi (director)) actually wanted to produce a reboot of the movie that made them a household name. Guys I never thought I'd say this but this stinker of a film is ""dead"" on arrival."

"mingtooter","5","1","1","18 January 2014"," What just happened?
","Well, this seems like a love it or hate it film. Honestly I cared so little about the characters I'm trying to remember what happened. Another bunch of handsome 20-something year old Dawson's Creek cast-offs shuffle around trying to add an entirely unnecessary emotional emphasis. ""Here we are on this fun movie roller coaster. Mom used to love roller coasters."" oh, Jesus...<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's original seemed multilateral - being equal parts frightening, shocking, ridiculous and funny. It was a labour of freakish love, and the dynamic direction and Campbell magic weighted out the lack of detail and story. This new version just seems gory. Really, viscerally gory. I get frustrated by modern horrors' apparent inability to build tension over a period greater than around thirty seconds before an orchestral stab, or a loud screech. Predictable as hell. <br/><br/>There's a few nods to the original, and it's genuinely not terrible, but it leaves you wondering what it was all for like most reboots. Alvarez deserves at least a smile for using the most fake blood I've seen since Lone Wolf and Cub. <br/><br/>I think if I had to sum up the film in a word it would just be 'unpleasant'. To me it didn't seem to have a lot more going for it. If you want to be grossed out and get your date a little closer, maybe it'll do the job. Certainly not out of tension and tongue-in-cheek thrills, though. All the violence without the fun."
"DarthPaul85","6","13","39","7 April 2013"," Fan of the original- not happy with this version.
","First I must post a disclaimer- this is not a poorly made film. It was shot very well, edited well, the effects are awesome, the sound and music is appropriate. Technically, this is a well made film.<br/><br/>And I'll admit, it has a good ending.<br/><br/>And yet...<br/><br/>The original had none of that- and somehow is much better.<br/><br/>I will put it this way- the original had heart, and this movie does not. This movie has an ""agenda."" It coldly moves down the checklist of ""cool things from Evil Dead"" and connects the dots without any fresh ideas or uniqueness.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is about the characters. This movie could have been good if the characters were better. There is only one character I liked in this movie (the sister), and even then she wasn't directed very well in every scene. Every other character in this movie I disliked. The girlfriend is pointless and we don't get to know her, the men are fairly stereotypical and don't have any endearing qualities, and the other woman has personality, but she's bossy and aggravating. Even with the awkward acting of the original, each character there was like a real person, and nobody was defined by their role in the movie (Ash wasn't even the ""hero,"" he was just a guy!).<br/><br/>The other problem is the writing. In addition to some painful exposition scenes, the writing is uninspired. It just takes the ""Evil Dead top 10"" tropes and inserts them in wherever it can. Sometimes this even results in scenes that repeat themselves. Other times it results in drastic shifts in tone- a movie that is mostly serious that suddenly has over-the-top dialogue and violence (for no other reason than ""the original did this"").<br/><br/>Finally, the tone is a mess. It was marketed as a serious scary movie, and having seen it, I honestly can't say if it's supposed to be ""so bad it's good"" camp, or a ""serious scary movie"" that just fails to be scary. Now, the original had the same problem, but the original failed so badly at being scary it's quite entertaining. This movie doesn't fail bad enough. It either tried to be scary earnestly and ended up having a few scenes that just feel out of place or forced, or fails to be ""so bad it's good"" because it's so damned heavy-handed in the beginning.<br/><br/>So the result is a polished, stylized version of a story that was too silly to be taken seriously 30 years ago, that continues to take itself too seriously now. But lacking the charm, the camp, the endearing characters that made the story tolerable (if not enjoyable).<br/><br/>So to end on a higher note, I do have to give the film credit for a strong visual style, ""fan service"" (I suppose), and a good ending. The ending was great- it almost made up for the entire movie. It was the only part of the movie that felt fun, and *inspired* by the original rather than *stolen* from the original.<br/><br/>Bottom line, if you're a fan of the original, you're likely to be disappointed, but many fans of the original also like this one, so maybe I'm the exception.<br/><br/>And if you've never seen the original films, then this will probably strike you as a well-made gore-fest of a horror-flick by today's standards."
"FailPrime","10","16","51","7 April 2013"," Re-Imaging not a Remake....
","This isn't a review in a sense of me saying if the movie was good or bad, because the movie overall was brilliant. I am writing this to address some of the idiot who are reviewing this movie as a remake, when it clearly states on the posters, when Raimi and Campbell have stated that this movie was a re-imaging, and not to be considered part of the original cannon of what Raimi started. Most of you clearly never watched Evil Dead 2 which was a plot less botched attempt at remaking Evil Dead with a story that fell rather flat and wasn't anything close to the first one. <br/><br/>The acting in this re-imaging wasn't the greatest but it wasn't horrible, the gore was over the top, but that's what made this movie great. Stop expecting it to be a remake. Read some articles and interviews with Raimi and Campbell and educate yourselves on what was being done, what was said to the director of this film, and how THEY felt about it, Raimi wanted Evil Dead redone he has wanted it REDONE/RE IMAGED since the 80s, which is why EVIL DEAD 2 was the same damn movie as EVIL DEAD. Don't spout of stupidity because you're stuck in the 80s, and you just want to complain because it's not the movie you wanted.... Get over it. <br/><br/>And @ACIDSQUIRTYNIPPLES... either you are trying to troll.. or you seriously need to take an English class.... I don't even know what that was an attempt at, and everybody who reads that loses about 50 IQ Points per sentence...<br/><br/>Summary: Movie was brilliant, Campbell will be in Army of Darkness 2, they've already discussed this. Raimi was happy with the turn out of the film, as he has stated several times, learn to read then you would know it's not a REMAKE. Thanks and have a great day idiots."
"MisterNicholas","8","9","25","13 June 2013"," Evil Dead: A Brilliant Horror Remake
","I could go on and on about how amazing I thought Evil Dead was. But I'll let you guys experience most of it for yourselves. For now, I'll just go over what really stood out to me, and what I think could have been done better. All in my opinion, obviously.<br/><br/>The first thing that immediately stood out to me in this movie, was the amazing cinematography. The shots are beautifully thought out and crafted and it instantly draws you in. The opening scene alone has amazing shots, and has the perfect amount of ""what the f**k"" moments. Throughout the movie, the story flows nicely. There are a couple moments where I feel the characters make pretty stupid decisions, like sending a girl back into the cabin knowing there's a demon locked inside. It's pretty obvious what happens after that happens. <br/><br/>As for the gore...there's lots of bloody goodness! After the first 30 minutes or so, it's pretty much nonstop, and the chase final scene literally rains blood. So if blood makes you squeamish, this movie is definitely not for you. It all looks very nice though, every little bit of gore looks extremely lifelike and adds to the brilliance of this film. <br/><br/>I don't want to give too much away, so I'll just keep it short and sweet for now. But I do recommend this movie, even for people who aren't fans of the original. Unlike that, this remake isn't meant to be comical in the least bit. Just bloody violence from beginning to end! 8/10"
"qbolb12","8","12","36","6 April 2013"," Absolutely nothing wrong with this remake.
","All of you hipster fanboys/fangirls should really calm down giving this movie bad reviews. Your nostalgia is interfering with your ability to objectively rate this movie. I happen to be a HUGE b-rated horror film lover. Evil Dead was a movie i grew up on, watching numerous times. When i heard a remake was coming i was for one very excited and 2 very skeptical. I went into this movie after reading all of the bad reviews here on IMDb expecting the movie to be horrible. Was i so very wrong. It was Gore galore. The grusomeness of the kills and the makeup make this movie worth it alone. No this movie is not original, it is a REMAKE. Why would it need to be original. Although the writers and director did a very very good job of not following the original to the T. There is just enough nostalgia in it to give you the warm and fuzzies. But the beauty of this film lies on its own accord. If you are a horror movie fan i sincerely recommend this movie. If you are some lame hipster that already thinks this movie is going to suck because its a remake, you should stay home sip your chai latte and listen to mumford and sons. For the rest of us.......there are PLENTY of worse ways to spend an hour and a half. GO SEE IT. JUDGE FOR YOURSELF."
"jdesando","Null","44","170","4 April 2013"," As good a scare fest as you'll see today.
","""Am I sure? Of course not! It's not a science book!"" Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) <br/><br/>If first-rate gore is your desire, look no further than the remake of Evil Dead. If you are a purist about this horror genre, having waited through the many satires since Romero's Night of the Living Dead, including Sam Raimi's campy 1981 Evil Dead and the more recent Cabin in the Woods, then stop right here. Director Fede Alvarez does it right and straight.<br/><br/>Why not! Even to remake Evil Dead as Raimi fashioned it is foolishly to court comparison with a cult classic, a successful story of teens imprudently hanging out in a haunted cabin. In Alvarez's iteration, the zombies are lifelike and the dismemberments realistic, each with its own rationale, just as the reason this time for staying in the cabin makes some sense.<br/><br/>Having found an ancient Book of the Dead, Eric gives the above statement, a free pass to gross us out even if the gore makes no sense or the strategies to thwart a resident evil are weak or too random to be effective. But make no mistake about the presence of shotgun and chainsaw, tropes from earlier scare fests, they are featured and used, along with very effective nail gun and ubiquitous gasoline. The special effects to make you cringe are well done, and the psychological-thematic underpinnings pretty impressive.<br/><br/>After all, brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) did abandon sister Mia (Jane Levy) and their mother long ago, so it seems some kind of retribution is in order. Additionally, because the women in the film make more mayhem than the men, as in the current American Idol contest, misanthropy trumps misogyny perhaps to comment on the current state of feminism.<br/><br/>""No!

With so many remakes, it is plain to see that a director can make or break the story. <br/><br/>Evil Dead I thought was a very refreshing, modern take on the original! Of course it isn't exactly the same, but why should it be? I know people want it to stay true to the story (and it does) but where is the excitement in seeing the exact same thing, only in a more current time? There are changes but nothing drastic. One thing that I feel was done for the better was the gore. If you enjoy gory films, you love this. It spares no mercy in that department. Also, if you're a fan of the original you'll definitely enjoy the many ""easter eggs"" thrown in throughout. Overall, I loved the movie. Sure, it wasn't perfect but I didn't expect it to be.

"jamisondaline","10","24","88","5 April 2013"," Fantastic remake of The Evil Dead (not Evil Dead II)
","As a card carrying deadite fanatic I went to this movie with the bar set high and I wasn't let down. Whats great about this movie is that for once a remake strikes a balance with frights, novelty, and lip service.<br/><br/>I was very surprised to see some mixed reviews for this film but found the rational given for in most of them was actually based on a fallacious premise that this was a remake of Evil Dead II. If your looking for a remake of Evil Dead II, your gonna have a bad time. Go see Cabin in the Woods if your on the market for a lighter take with more goofiness. The original Evil Dead is still one of the scariest movies ever, and this movie did an excellent job of holding its own.<br/><br/>Like the -original- Evil Dead, slapstick comedy is low/absent while scares, violence, and gore are raining from the sky. In retrospect the decision to exclude an Ash character was a stroke of genius and allowed me to really enjoy the hell out of this movie without trying to compare and contrast a role that any fan would agree could only be filled by Bruce Campbell himself.<br/><br/>With the assistance and blessing of all the original key players (read the credits and note the Campbells, the Raimis, and the Taperts) the unproven newcomer Alvarez has outdone himself in crafting a great horror experience that will surprise both fans of the original and new comers alike. The fresh take on the old story is still peppered with dozens of clever throwbacks to the original without feeling forced or distracting.<br/><br/>The gore is bar none with classic effects taking center stage with CGI functioning as support. The result gives Evil Dead a look and feel that is coarser, chewier, and more... sinewy then recent comparable horror films. Wash it all down with blood by the buckets and there you have it. Great casting. Great effects. Great scares. Great movie. Enjoy."
"eremiko","9","22","80","5 April 2013"," Great, great film.
","In short; I gave it a ""9 out of 10"" solely because three things don't line up/get answered. <br/><br/>But, in full... I have been an avid fan of the original Evil Dead, making connections to it in other movies and video games and the like. When I found out they were remaking the original, I could not wait to see it for myself. And if anyone else is in the same boat as I am, we will recognize that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell just didn't have the funds for their true dream. I think Bruce was the one who said Evil Dead 1-3 were collectively the very first script for one film. This remake is the closest thing imaginable to that original script. When Sam and Bruce called this ""a new vision"" that's really just the way any viewer needs to enter this film. If you sit there thinking ""that's not in the original"" then you will not enjoy the spectacle before you. This is as much of a masterpiece as the original, but for different reasons. The original taught us that with enough heart and willpower, you can create a staple in pop culture. This film has proved that all things get better with time.<br/><br/>Now keep an open mind and appreciate this as a stand-alone film, if need be. But at least go see it once... or more."
"santiagonunez16","9","4","9","19 October 2013"," Finally a remake worthy of the original!!!
","After years of remakes of classic horror and cult movies, this one finally does it right. The classic still stands the test of time but this one can do what no other horror film has been able to do in years...actually be scary. Modern technology has enabled Hollywood to add some terrific special effects with lots of gore and violence. Beyond the gore and violence the story is pretty much the same. This time the hero is a heroine which actually plays better in my opinion. Fans of the original Sam Raimi film will not be disappointed. He was afterall, one of the producers on the film. Stay tuned after the credits for Ash fans!"
"callanvass","9","4","9","30 August 2013"," One of the best horror films I have seen in a long time. You best buckle up; the ride is absolutely insane!
","I was seriously appalled to learn that one of my favorite horror films of all time (Evil Dead) was being remade. There was nothing but abhorrent disdain for the months leading up to it. Even the trailer didn't get me pumped. I refused to go to the theater to support a ""remake"" let alone one of my favorite Horror films. Then some major buzz for this film commenced. It was really mixed. My interest began to rise a little bit; not much, but a little bit. I waited a few weeks once this was released on DVD before finally pulling the trigger. Well; I have now seen it and I can officially say. It's been a LONG time since I've had this much fun with a horror film; holy hell! Right from the intense and somewhat disturbing opening I started to get the feeling in my gut that everything was going to be OK. Like always; my gut didn't fail me. I admit that this is a remake, but I would also consider this a love letter to the original. It has some very sly winks to the original that are expertly done. The suspense here is top notch and had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, along with a few boo scares as well. The character development isn't the greatest; I would have loved for it to go deeper between Mia (Jane Levy) and David (Shiloh Fernandez) but I was too busy having a blast to let it bother me. I was able to care about the characters more than the original though. Aside from Ash; I never really boogied to any of the other characters very much. Here I had at least three characters that I wanted to live, and that is something I can honestly not say about the original. What about the violence? Let's just say it gets downright nasty<br/><br/>Being rated R certainly helped this bad boy; I'm not gonna spoil all of the red surprises you'll see in this film, as it gets pretty wild, but here is a few examples. A girl cuts her face off with a shard of glass; there is a succinct scene that involves lesbianism, but you sure as hell won't be turned on by it, that's for sure It's a wickedly twisted scene. It's one of the goriest films I have ever seen, and it arguably might just be nastier than the original. It made me flinch a few times, and I have a very strong stomach. There is also a couple of tributes to Evil Dead II; yes, sir. Fede Alvarez did his homework, and he is clearly a fan of the Evil Dead series. Jane Levy makes for a perfect heroine. She is sympathetic, vulnerable, and a cutie to boot. She goes through hell and back, and I couldn't have been more impressed by her. I also loved the added twist with her being a drug addict. It added a bit more turmoil and emotion. Shiloh Fernandez was solid, if a bit whiny at times. I dug the connection between him and Mia (Levy) and he came through for the most part. Lou Taylor Pucci plays Scottie's role in the original, and he is way more likable and courageous. He had some great scenes, and I loved him; Jessica Lucas (Olivia) plays the most unsympathetic character in the film, and I wanted to back hand her one at times. She did well with what she had to do. Elizabeth Blackmore (Natalie) has one memorable scene. I won't spoil it<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Is it as good as the original? Not quite, but I loved this film. It's not very often I feel so pumped after watching a Horror Movie, but Evil Dead did just that. It never stops! It doesn't give you time to breathe at times. Its haywire, it's insane, it's shocking; it's everything a Horror movie should be! You won't think of it as a ""remake"" at least if you're smart, you won't. I can't praise this movie enough. The people that trash this film in my opinion should not be watching Horror movies anymore. I was bitter too when Evil Dead was remade, but I ended up having a lot of fun. Don't be put it off by it like I was, and don't over hype yourself either. Go in to the movie like you would anything else. Bring on Evil Dead II! Hell; if the rumors are true. Combine both series to make a cross over for Army Of Darkness II (or Evil Dead IV; whatever you wanna call it!)<br/><br/>9/10"

"shiningartist77","8","8","23","20 July 2013"," A gory festival of fun and horror
","First of all, it saddens me to see so many people giving this movie one star based almost entirely on comparisons to the original. Scrolling seven pages, I have not seen one legitimately fair review. If anyone reading this has ever seen the kind of trash movie that actually qualifies for a 1 star you will KNOW that this is not even close to that.<br/><br/>Now let's get into it. This movie is quite entertaining.<br/><br/>Writing/Plot: You have the basic premise that we've all become familiar with. Five friends take a trip up to a run down cabin in the woods, someone reads from a cursed book and (pardon the pun) all hell breaks loose as the group tries their best to survive. While this is ""technically"" a remake (or a reboot I'm not sure what they want to do with this) it is not an exact retelling of the classic movies with updated visuals. There is no Ash, and there is no comedy. It is strongly reminiscent in its events, but it does have its differences.<br/><br/>-For all the people complaining about plot holes, lame writing and generic story, if you are a fan of horror this should be of no surprise. Horror's are RARELY known for their Oscar winning scripts. Stupid decisions and conveniently placed dangers are part and parcel for this genre and in this film aren't even distracting (I didn't notice or care, I was having too much fun). You should know automatically what you are in for the second you decide to watch this movie. In that aspect it is excellent. The story we all know, and if you are an Evil Dead fan, you will be even more familiar with it, that's not to say it's all a rehash though. There are some twists to give a fresh breath to even the old fans.<br/><br/>Scare Factor: This movie doesn't have a lot of psychological scares, it's much too in-your-face for that. It does build up a bit of tension early on before the ""S"" hits the fan which is nice and it does have a few ""jump"" scares. However, this movie as you will know if you've seen the trailer relies much on gore. It's a shock value movie which is just plain fun. This will really test how much you can take. The use of live props over CGI also really adds something quite enjoyable to the ride.<br/><br/>Acting: It's good. Works with the movie just fine. Anyone who complains about it is just looking for reasons to hate. (for bad acting see Mark Whalberg in The Happening)<br/><br/>Score: Excellent for the movie, eerie then 180's to terrifying. Worth a purchase on its own.<br/><br/>Overall: Don't compare this to the originals. It's not meant to be funny. It's got the plot, but it attempts to be it's own film, and successfully so. If you want Bruce Campbell hilarity, go watch the original. That's not what this is, it's a dark retelling of a classic story. If you are a horror fan, you know what the genre is, what to expect, and you'll have great fun with this. If you aren't, what are you doing here?"
"rickseckergarrett","7","8","23","11 April 2013"," Is it great? No. Is it better than everything in the past 5 years? Yes.
","You need to know one important thing when you go in to see this movie. This is a re imagining. It's not meant to be campy or quirky. It's meant to be scary.<br/><br/>Because this is a re imagining, NOT EVERYTHING is going to be faithful to the original Evil Dead movie. You will however, get a lot of nice call backs to the original. Those who have seen the original Evil Dead will be able to point out clear distinctions to lines or scenes that were very similar. <br/><br/>However, the plot has gone through a total transformation. Is this a bad thing? Well, for open minded people, no. And if all of us of original fans remember, the first movie didn't have much plot to it either did it? Bunch of kids going to a cabin, and finding an evil power. That hasn't changed. But the reasoning for the people there is much more sympathetic, it's not ""Oh us crazy kids going out to a cabin to have sex and drink beer."" Granted, the reason they are there is kinda stupid, but you don't grow to hate any of the characters. They don't make stupid decisions, they don't contradict themselves, and while sometimes the discourage got a chuckle out of me, their responses to each other is very real. Only once did I find myself saying ""Don't do that, it's going to get you killed."" And luckily I was wrong. These characters have a firm grip on how people would deal with a situation like this (according to each of their characters and back story.) I also never found myself WANTING a character to die, like in most horror movies. And in my book, that's a huge plus. There are a couple Hostel moments that might make you squirm in your seat, but it's not stupid pointless torture. My only complaint would be that sometimes the voice of a possessed would sound silly, reminding me of the scene in the original ""I'll swallow your soul!"" However one of the best things of this movie is that they don't CGI the heck out of it.<br/><br/>However, in the end I was satisfied with my ticket purchase."

","Don't get me wrong, 6.5 to me is a good score but if you don't think it is don't let that sway you away! This is a great remake- a great version- of this story. They incorporated a lot of good elements from the original and gave it their own f'd up twist and it's amazing. The acting is phenomenal, from every single actor and I loved the practical effects they use- makes it seem so much more real. I really hope the second one is just as good!"
"TheMovieDoctorful","10","3","6","8 August 2019"," A Better 80s Horror Remake than 80s Horror Deserves
","There was a lot of hype leading up to Fede Alvarez's remake of Evil Dead. To say the least, I was not one of the ones buying it. I was firmly convinced there was no way that a darker take on the franchise could work, that Evil Dead without camp was like Fall without College Football. Rarely have I been so happy to be wrong. Evil Dead (2013) is not only one of the best remakes ever made, it's actually the best Evil Dead film to date, even topping the seemingly unsurpassable Evil Dead II. The film somehow captures Raimi's dirty, nasty and ruthless style even better than any of Raimi's Horror movies did, feeling mean spirited without ever being tasteless.<br/><br/>Evil Dead (2013) does what no Horror movie since The Blair Witch Project has pulled off; making me feel like a small child in an expansive, frightening world that still had some evil, black magic left in it. It's the kind of film that makes me fear the forest again, fear the unknown of the wild lying deep in the ominous backwoods near where I grew up. While The Blair Witch Project feels like watching home movies, Evil Dead (2013) feels like a twisted childhood fairy tale brought to violent and visceral life. Alvarez's visual style in everything from the dying, rotting woods to the delapidated and worn down cabin feels distinctly nostalgic in a way that hit me so much harder than I was expecting. I never thought that an Evil Dead film could hit me so personally, but this one absolutely did. It takes the hyperbolic fantasy of the Evil Dead franchise and turns it into something raw and real without ever losing personality and coming off dull, as so many dark reboots do. That's all without mentioning Alvarez's exceptional use of dolly shots, expanding the tracking shots that defined the original Evil Dead with some of the best uses of dolly zooms I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Jane Levy's performance as Mia is one of the best the Horror genre has seen this decade. While the female characters of previous Evil Dead films have felt underwritten at best and demeaning at worst, the characterization of Mia furiously rises from the sludge of its predecessors and figuratively beats them to death for being less intelligent than it. Her internalized horrors becoming something very literal, very external and very real, dragging all who surround her to a sadistic, nightmarish Hell, is spinechilling to witness. Levy makes Mia's increasingly belligerent and violent descent into madness something truly tragic and worth investing in. The gentle softness of her natural cadence juxtaposes brilliantly against the enraged ferocity of her vocal delivery (""I'm such an idiot."" she seethes, in one of the most heartbreaking line deliveries of the decade, ""For thinking that for once I could count on you!"")Levy can very easily consider herself added to my list of Poison Ivy fan castings with her intense performance here.<br/><br/>Lou Taylor Pucci is one of the most underrated actors working today and it kills me that this is his only mainstream Hollywood Horror role as Eric. He's the only one here who really gives Levy a run for her money. Eric's increasing anxiety and fear of what he's done and what horrors he's responsible for, juxtaposed with his increasing introversion and aggression, is performed phenomenally through Pucci's cold stares and increasingly shaky delivery.<br/><br/>The writing is equally excellent. The way that this film captures fractured-but-strong family relationships; some broken, like between Mia's mother and her children, some in danger of breaking, like David and Mia. If The Wolfman (2010) nailed the dynamic of a family relationship inherently monstrous, Evil Dead (2013) nails the dynamic of family relationships that are made monstrous from something good, rather than doomed to spawn something vile from an aggressive and socially Darwinistic party. The film balances its inevitable tragedy with an unexpected level of triumph; David's rescue of his sister is a heartwarming and oddly humanistic decision reminiscent of the very best literary works of Stephen King. It's a truly rare narrative path for a modern tragic Horror film to date, giving it its very own unique throne in the pantheon of the decade's best Horror.<br/><br/>You'll notice that almost all cable screenings of Evil Dead (2013) refuse to go any direction but uncut. There is nothing but good reason for this. The rawness, the spectacle of its graphic and uncensored nature, (almost capturing the feel of found footage tonally at times) is something that was never meant to be contained. It's a ruthless and often cacklingly violent film, like a rabid predator shoved into a tiny cage. For perspective, this and Inner Demons (Which I greatly look forward to discussing) are the only films to make swearing genuinely scary since the aforementioned Blair Witch Project. Just as those films should never be censored, neither should this one be.<br/><br/>Evil Dead (2013) isn't just the best Evil Dead film to date, it's a better definitive 80s Horror remake than the very vast majority of 80s American Horror deserved. One of the biggest surprises in its outstanding execution in a decade all too full of them. Please, Mr. Alvarez, may I have some more?"

Thats just wrong. The whole thing is bad and waste of money, time and life. Poor human cells. They needed to absorb this king of stuff.

"fedor8","Null","3","6","28 January 2014"," Utterly pointless mono-colour remake.
","Doing a remake of a classic horror flick that anyone can download hence every horror fan must have already seen is not far from pointless. The destroyed bridge, the happy-go-lucky severed hand, the tree-rape: it's all here – again. The predictability of ED makes it a rather joyless experience, making one long to see the originals again.<br/><br/>It's fantasy, sure, but there must be an ounce of logic even in a demonic horror tale. Shiloh gets shot in the shoulder, and yet how does this affect him? Not at all, apparently. He gets bashed, beaten and pulverized repeatedly but this only seems to temporarily stop him. In other words, ironically, he exhibits the same kind of supernatural powers as the demons. If the good guys are invincible and have a few extra gallons of blood in their bodies then I believe it is the duty of the filmmakers to inform us of this, because it can't simply be assumed off-hand. From what I'd seen here, Shiloh must have lost around 150 gallons of blood – with no medical staff around to re-fuel him, mind you.<br/><br/>During her first attack, Mia makes the entire house shake, and then speaks in a deep, demonic voice. Despite of this very OBVIOUS supernatural occurrence (that would turn Richard Dawkins into a believer instantly), the others still insist she's having withdrawal symptoms. The blond nerd dabbles in witchcraft but fails to tell his friends a single, solitary detail about what he'd done or read in it, or how it relates to Mia's behavior – until very late in the game. That's just plain stupid, and reveals the writer's opinion of his viewers' intelligence. Admittedly, most movie-goers are buffoons.<br/><br/>That whole brother-sister family-history back-story is extremely uninteresting, yet it keeps popping up throughout the movie, as if anybody who'd bought a ticket to watch an ""Evil Dead"" remake actually gives three flying dungs.<br/><br/>Not to mention the horrible modern look of ED, a visual equivalent of borsht, just one dark green tone for the duration; that's all modern horror films ever give us. Don't these modern directors know that a horror or sci-fi tale can also be told in NATURAL colours? Get the original."

That's right, folks, a chainsaw), gleefully thrown in for good measure, is what gets you all wet & wild & wanting more and more, then, yes, this Evil Dead reboot (coming 30 years later) will most certainly satisfy you to its very last drop.<br/><br/>And, if Evil Dead doesn't get those insatiable, horror-hungry juices of yours flowing at full force, then I don't know what the hell would.

Evil Dead's ""cabin-in-the-woods"" scenario was painfully predictable (Well, what did I expect?) - And, yes, its characters were just there to be annihilated in the most hideous fashion imaginable (Well, what did I expect?) - And, yes, the dialog was just plain dumb to the 10th power (Well, what did I expect?)....<br/><br/>But, with all of that s-h-i-t aside, I think that this slightly above-average remake was something of a triumph in its re-telling of horror-run-amok in terms of keeping in pace with today's standards of in-your-face, down-your-throat, and up-your-ass terror.<br/><br/>What more can I say? <br/><br/>*""Cute"" trivia note* - <br/><br/>There are 5 principal characters in the story. Their names are David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, & Natalie. If you take the initial of each of these names, in the order that I've listed them, they spell out the word (Are you ready for this?) ""DEMON"".

"MitchellCombden","7","3","6","5 October 2013"," solid horror flick! a good remake as well! solid 7/10
","i like what Fede Alvarez done with this film. this is a perfect example of what a good remake should be! Fede takes what Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell built into a cult classic and created a very impressive directorial debut with the evil dead remake. he dropped the comedic elements for the most part and focuses more on the over the top gore that's now become necessary for a horror film's success these days (ex- saw, hostel) in the mainstream. the mostly organic gore FX were utilized very well in the film. the same setting is kept in the remake and the plot is pretty much the same as the original with some slight changes which works well of coarse. the absence of the ash character hurt this one in a way but i was still impressed in the main character department. Jane levy did a great job in her role and the rest of the supporting cast were good. the biggest negative here though is the wasted potential in terms of creativity. there were definitely opportunities here to be much more creative and add that special something that the film was missing. overall this film had great tone, genuinely creepy visuals, amazing special effects and some good acting, it just missed out on some creative potential that really would have beefed the film up into the upper class of horror. I saw it in the cinema as well and it was a awesome thing to finally have a R rated horror film to go to instead of all those recent PG-13 ghost movies that flood our theatres now. do not pay attention to all the negative reviews (1,2,3 stars) its simply die hard fans of the original crying for no reason and jumping on the band wagon. this film is great! 7 stars out of 10"

","Over thirty years ago, several young film students named Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell had an idea for a movie with a premise of five college students away for the weekend in a remote Cabin in Tennessee who become possessed by Demons and try to kill each other off. Now it's 2013 and can you guess who the producers are? The Storyline is thisMia, a drug addict, asks her brother and three friends to come with her to a cabin to help her go cold turkey. While she's going through withdraw, her friend Eric finds a book bound with human flesh and wrapped up in a garbage bag. Don't forget barb wire also! Eric translates some passages in this book and the demon procession begins! Fede Alvarez makes his film directing debut here and he attacks us with gut-wrenching moments throughout the movie. Instead of having Raimi mentor this virgin director, Alvarez came out swinging with his own version of this film. The $17,000,000 budget drenches us with blood, guts and gore! The special effects are extremely well done. Every single character is inflicted with severe pain and pretty much, if there was a theme to this film, I think it would be pain! And I mean that in the best way possible! I totally understand the disappointment in this film and sometimes even hatred by the so called die-hard fans. Even when I first saw the spoiler trailer on you-tube, I was skeptical but still interested. After watching this film, I realize Alvarez, Raimi, and Campbell wanted a fresh, new direction in these chain of movies. In my opinion they hit the mark on the spot. Even though Evil Dead 2013 is a remake, I consider it as Evil Dead 4 after Army of Darkness. By telling myself this and my readers hopefully, it makes this movie more understandable. The only main issue I have with this film is the lack of the character ""Ash"", which was played by Bruce Campbell in the original. I might be in a minority with my die-hard friends but I give this film 3.5 stars out of 5."

Packed with jump scares there's blood - more blood than you can possibly imagine coupled with gratuitous and graphic violence, a nail gun, chainsaw and claw hammer action.<br/><br/>It's dark, ominous, gritty and wonderfully shot by Fede Alvarez. The special effect and music score a worthy of note. The opening is reminiscent of a million torture-porn films and adds little to the proceedings, although the series is known for irregular continuities, if anything the setup robs Evil Dead of being a sequel to the original. In addition, there's a odd homage after the credits that takes Evil Dead 2013 stand alone stature. It's as if Raimi and Co. couldn't cut the umbilical cord to the original video nasty, or avoid backlash from fans.<br/><br/>The cast are a group of good looking kids and on the whole the acting is pretty good, lead Jane Levy is exceptional. But the group of twenty something Americans has been done to death and steals any novelty away from Dead by default. Nevertheless, there's a welcomed gender change and duel role that allows Levy to really excel.<br/><br/>All in all as someone who avoids horror-comedy I thought a serious remake would be a good idea, that said, The Evil Dead 1981 was a basic concept and it was its style that made it. It goes to show that you should be careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>To Alvarez's credit as horror film it is skilfully made, and if you've not seen its 1981 counterpart it excels. Nevertheless, if you're familiar with the Evil Dead, its novelty, choppy charm, resourcefulness and it's mix of scares humour, you may feel that this in some peculiar uncanny way falls short. There's a reason archetypal books don't get rewritten - the same could possibly be applied to cult films.<br/><br/>Ultimately, even with it's 'Evil Dead' shortcomings it's an entertaining piece of horror and still a must for horror fans."

","Something people don't understand about remakes is that the entire point is to ""remake"" the original to be something that younger movie-going audiences (that weren't around for the originals) will enjoy. Altering parts of the plot and making a new story is part of the remake franchise. This film was no exception. If you're a die-hard fan of the original odds are you won't like the remake. However, today's younger audiences see originals (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Evil Dead) to be cheesy and dull so the only way to make these films more appealing to younger crowds is to add a bit of gore and a bit more story. Is this film cliché? Of course! The original film set the standard for what cheesy horror is all about so the remake's full attempt was to be cliché as well. Regardless of how it compares to the original it has gore, the supernatural, and an overall eeriness that makes it worth watching.

","So Evil Dead and it's spawn are some of my all time favourite movies, and Bruce Campbell is one of my favourite hams, I mean actors. That said, this movie was the one that Sam Raimi was trying to make all those years ago with the first Evil Dead, a straight up horror movie, gore fest that will make you jump, and cringe at every beat. This remake had a few wonderful nod and wink moments, like seeing Mia sitting on Ash's car near the beginning, or a fight scene in a flooded room that felt very much like the bottom of the well in the Army of Darkness, but it left the campiness behind and played it straight for us. In the original the one scene where Sam Raimi thought that they'd crossed the line was the tree rape scene, and even though they came back to that scene in this one, it felt more visceral, and more important to the movie, instead of it just being there, it felt like there was a reason. If you love a good horror movie, this is the best I have seen in years."

When I heard that Bruce Cambell's character Ash was not in the movie I was a little skeptical, But I was very surprised how much I ended up liking this movie after the ending. And that was kind of the problem with the movie too. As I was watching it, I didn't have any feelings for most of the Characters. The only characters I cared for were Mia (the main character) and her brother. The others were very zombie-like,emotionless and seemed like fill ins, I didn't really care to see if or how they ended up. Because of this the movie was more gory to me then scary. It's only scary to me when I develop feelings for the cast and I didn't get that for most of the movie. There were some funny parts, but nothing compared to Sam Raimi's versions. All in all to me, the character Mia is what saved this movie. Ash is still cool and Mia is sexy cool.. If you are a fan of the original, stick around after the credits."
"Aaron1375","8","8","24","10 April 2013"," More blood than the original, may or may not work for you
","First, I shall say this right off the bat, I enjoyed the original a bit more. This is mainly due to the fact I love watching Bruce Campbell in anything. As I was watching this film, I could not help myself but ask, ""What would Ash do?"" That being said, I thought they did a good job with the remake and it was not to far off the original. The plot was different enough to keep me wondering what was going to happen, but it paid homages to the original. It did subtract a few laughs, but it did add a lot of blood and gore. Though, I do not remember the original Evil Dead having to many laughs. I remember it being more of a straight horror film, it was really the two sequels where large additions of comedy were added. So why I keep reading reviews saying this one subtracted the laughs had me a bit confused as the original Evil Dead to me was a straight horror too.<br/><br/>The story has the same premise of friends going to a cabin in the middle of nowhere. However, the reasons for them being there are quite different, as this is no relaxing getaway. Instead, it is a trip to help a young lady detox and get over a substance abuse problem. There is something in the basement though, as a ceremony took place there. A book is also found there and one of the friends, for some unexplained reason, really has to find out what the book is saying and he accidentally releases a force that will possess and tear apart the group of friends in most brutal fashion. At first, they think the young lady is going through withdrawals as she is attacked trying to get out of the woods, but they soon realize there is something evil at play here.<br/><br/>The rehab part of the story works as there is no way anyone was going to the cabin they featured here for a pleasant stay. Most would have left after what they saw in the basement, but they were trying to help their friend. The gore was ramped up in this film, making it one of the more gory films I have ever seen on the big screen. I have seen worse though on DVD. This film relied a lot on tension, too as I was never quite sure how things were going to play out. All in all, they did a good job of making a different film, but still in the spirit of the original. They paid homage to the original by having the camera moving through the forest as an unseen force, there was a scene that was like the tree seen from the original and near the end it paid a bit more homage to the second film with a chainsaw.<br/><br/>So a good horror film, for me anyway. I have heard many people say they enjoyed the film. However, I have heard others who did not care for it much. Just depends on your tastes. I like gore and blood and such...add to that a supernatural presence and you are most likely going to have a film I am going to enjoy to some degree. Others though may simply think the film was a bit too brutal, or gory just for the sake of thrills and the story was lacking. I can see this too, as the behavior of the David character at times had me nearly yelling at the screen! So I enjoyed it, mainly for the bloody romp it was. The gore effects were way beyond the original film, making my girlfriend avert her eyes through most of the kills and attacks. Still, though I think the original is the better film. I kept thinking, ""Ash would have had this wrapped up by now."" It was also nice in this one that if computer generated graphics were used, they were not apparent. So, I enjoyed this film and the original. In the end, though, it was nice being able to watch a horror movie like this in the theaters for me. I like a bloody gory film."
"davidrfc4","8","9","28","19 April 2013"," A Very Groovy Homage
","Firstly let me get this out of the way, the reviews on here for this film are just shocking. I was excited to see this movie ever since it was announced and while the critic reviews pumped me up, the user reviews disappointed.<br/><br/>I was scared when I went into the theatre last night, the first night of the movies release in the uk. I did not know what the film was going to be like, so i crossed my fingers and hoped for the best.<br/><br/>Let me first say what is wrong with this movie. The characters feel flat, not your usual dime a dozen meat bags who usually occupy horror films, but for as far as this film goes it just does not have the character development it deserves. the second problem is the overuse of jump scares, if like me you enjoyed the evil dead films for the gore and not the laughable jump scenes then this may come as a disappointment, this entire thing is a lengthy collection of jump scares ranging in quality.<br/><br/>However when this movie does something right it REALLY does something right. The last 15 minutes of this are truly something to behold for true evil dead fans and fans of classic practical gore effects. That said the gore is beautiful, tons of unsuspecting girlfriends sat in the cinema last night screaming and mentioning how they 'were going to be sick' it was a lot of fun. While the movie is nothing like army of darkness and takes itself completely seriously the black comedy is there, if you are an evil dead fanatic then you should be able to get a chuckle out of a woman cutting her face off with a shard of glass.<br/><br/>There are a lot of throwbacks to the original evil dead's which i will not spoil here as well as a distinct 'exorcist' vibe going on with the deadites. All in all this is a movie well worth the £6 admission for the gore factor alongside a few good jump scares if only for laughters sake, throw all this in with a great post credits bit and you have the perfect reboot/re- imagining/quasi-sequel to Sam Rami's classic evil dead series."
"Im-not-all-here-myself","8","9","28","11 April 2013"," A commentary and review from someone who's actually seen the movie
","After actually watching the new movie last night, I came to this sight and began reading many of the ""reviews"" and came to the conclusion that a lot of the reviewers didn't like the movie because they either hate the movie simply for existing or hate the movie because it didn't live up to unrealistic expectations or they haven't actually seen the movie. That being said, I admit that the film ain't perfect, but it was an enjoyable experience and overall, I liked it a lot! Is it a re-make or a re-visioning? IMHO a re-make sticks to the original source material with only very minor changes. A re-visioning uses the source material as an overall premise only but takes it in a different direction. Using that criteria the new film is clearly a re-visioning of the original and should be viewed on it's own merit. I've seen the original films dozens of times. I've even read a couple of books about them. I'm no expert, just a fan, but I can tell a good film from a bad one. On it's own, the new film was well made. The script was lean and fast paced. The gore effects were good. The young cast was as good if not better than some in various other recent re-visioning. The film didn't break any new ground, but it was entertaining and one of the better ones out there. The film begins with a short prequel that attempts to set the mood. Personally, I didn't care for it. I understand why it was included (to explain the presence of the book, etc) yet it looked like it was added at the last minute. There are standout performances from Jane Levy (Mia) and Shiloh Fernandez (David) as well as relative newcomers Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. The characters behave like you would assume. Even Olivia (Lucas) a trained nurse acts appropriately when she finally realizes that she is way out of her depth. Blackmore's character (Elizabeth) could have had a bit more to do though. Director Fede Alvarez, a newcomer to feature film-making does a decent job of pulling together a fast paced, gory ride. Even the obligatory gold Oldsmobile was present! Originally rated NC-17, a few cuts were necessary to ensure an ""R"" rated film. Hopefully, an unrated version will be available on Blu-Ray. The gore SFX were good enough to convince some people that it was all CGI! There are few jump scares and the pacing is a little too fast to build up a decent atmosphere in parts, but the overall feeling of helplessness does come across in the latter half of the film. Overall, I thought the film was an enjoyable experience and it succeeds in paying homage to the original while still standing on it's own. Now to respond to some of the more negative comments. The new movie takes itself too seriously. The original film was NOT MEANT TO BE FUNNY! Raimi and company wanted to make a serious movie that scared the Hell out of the viewer. What most people find funny in the original film is, actually, due to amateur acting, and a minuscule budget (no re-takes). Several reviewers have even mistaken humor in the 2nd and 3rd films for being in the first! The gore was emphasized over storyline and character development. The gore was the major selling point of the original film! The original film was released with an ""X"" rating for GORE. It was primarily due to Stephen King's ""ferocious"" review that it got major distribution. Character development? What's Scott's last name? How do Ash and Scott know each other? There's almost no background given for the original characters. The gore and visual effects were the main concern as per Raimi and Campbell themselves. In comparison, the new version has better character development by far! Too much CGI effects. If you believe that then you haven't seen the movie, nor have you read anything about the making of the movie. Either that or the physical SFX were SO GOOD that you couldn't discern them from CGI. From day one, everyone involved in the new film has stated that CGI was only used for a couple of touch-ups in post-production. The acting in the new movie is terrible compared to the original. Have you seen the original? Richard DeManincor (Scott) blows his lines twice! Ash gets ""trapped"" under a 10 pound bookcase! Re-watch the scene in the new movie when Mia begs David to take her home. Compare the intensity of her performance against any performance in the original film. The dog and it's death was unnecessary. This is only IMHO but the dog was the one that found the basement door. Also, because of the dog's death, David storms into the bathroom to confront Mia only to find her scalding herself in the shower. This leads him to drive her out of the woods thereby discovering that they were trapped. It was a simple way to get the plot moving in a logical manner. The witchcraft/Satanic angle was dumb. Yeah, the intro could have been done better. The movie simply doesn't go into details and is meant only to explain the presence of the book and all the dead cats. There are other issues I could address but I got other stuff to do and writing this review was a good time killer and hopefully, a bit informative. All I can really say is that everyone's tastes are different and trashing a movie based on misleading or false information is pretty low. I recommend that if you're considering watching this, or any other movie, watch an online preview, read a few reviews, take everything with a grain of salt then decide for yourself. If you think the movie is your cup of tea, it probably is."
"BooFez","9","9","28","10 April 2013"," I found the movie very enjoyable to watch
","We have a girl. A girl with an addiction to drugs. Mia (Jane Levy) decides to better herself and quit her addiction cold turkey. With the help of her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and her friends, she is determined to get through the withdrawal process once and for all. They choose a remote cabin deep in the woods with no outside influence to help Mia recover. While cleaning up the cabin, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), one of Mia's friends, finds a book and decides to read it. Not knowing the evil he is about to unleash, Eric reads the book out loud. The fight for survival now begins.<br/><br/>Not really sure where to take this one. I am kinda of on the fence. Director Fede Alvarez teeter totters from a brilliant really dark horror movie to an average film. I believe if he would have stayed on track with the way the movie started out and focused on the darker side of evil, he would have had a masterpiece.<br/><br/>The character development was sparse. We picked up bits and pieces about the characters as the movie went on but nothing that really impacted how the story was told. Even with the lack of background, the actors did very well. Their reactions to what transpired were very believable and true. Shiloh Fernandez could have played a stronger character. He lacked the take charge attitude a lead actor should have and kind of got lost in with the others at times but overall they all did decent.<br/><br/>Any GORE fans out there? Well we have some gore for you! Minus one scene, Fede Alvarez kept the gore coming. He was able to throw more and more gore into this movie without making it a grind-house featurette. It was very well done, believable and as tasteful as gore can get.<br/><br/>I also want to give credit to the entire makeup department. I absolutely loved the disfigurements they came up with and were able to put together. The cuts, bruises, missing limbs and hacked-up faces were outstanding looking. I am looking forward to the special features on Blu-ray for this.<br/><br/>I did not compare any part of this to the original Evil Dead as I believe every movie should have a fair shake. I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. The way the demon plays with the characters and unique gore scenes are a huge draw. What the movie lacks in story and guidance, it makes up for in cinematography and good ole fashion gore."
"trnjamesbond","7","9","28","8 April 2013"," A Gory Roller-coaster Of Horror Fun!
","I went into the theater with an open mind I really did not know what feeling to expect from this film, the original Evil Dead was campy and fun to watch, also it had awesome cinematography for it's time and creates a depth in the atmosphere around the characters in the film, and gave life to the surrounding woods that the cabin resides in.<br/><br/>In this new version we have a young group of adults that arrive at a cabin in the woods, all for some type of radical drug intervention therapy, for the main character David's sister, things begin to go awry like in the original film, but done in a more life like sense, not so campy in this one. It takes a bit of time to get things rolling, but once events from the ""Book of the Dead"" start to unravel, we get to see some excellent gore and make-up effects, that the first film should of had but did not(well not to this extent). <br/><br/>I really liked the characters of the film, we get to know them and like them, David(Shiloh Fernandez) tries his best to deny the fact of all the events that just took place, that there must be some logical reason for them, even until the very end, just like Bruce Campbell did in the original.<br/><br/>We also get to see some throwbacks from the original included in this film, which is a good thing. Kind of a ""hats off"" to the fans of this series. Sam Raimi, Rob Tappert, and Bruce Campbell obviously had a close watch on the director Fede Alverez, these elements really show through in this edition.<br/><br/>The cinematography was well done, the demons in the film we have all seen before in other films, but it's what they do to themselves that really sells the demon characters.<br/><br/>Let's move on shall we? The gore! I understand that some people thought it was over the top.<br/><br/>Now as a true fan of horror and gore, I didn't think this at all. Has anyone seen any of the ""Saw"" films? I didn't think the gore was at all taking away from the original story, back when I was a kid and seen the Evil Dead for the first time on VHS I thought that was kind of gory. Now we have newer films like ""Saw"" as I mentioned, and ""Hostel"" these films make the original Evil Dead seem like a kids film(as for the gore I mean). I truly don't see what the big deal is. It seems to me that the Producers of this film finally got to do what they wanted to, and not be under minded by the MPAA. Evil Dead 2013, I can say I really liked it, it had great character cohesion, excellent camera work, and the fact that it wasn't filled with terrible acting, and girls with fake boobs running around topless. <br/><br/>We all remember the terrible ""Piranha"" remakes don't we?(If you don't know what I mean then that's a bonus for you). That film that I just mentioned strayed so far away from the original film that it was degrading to my intelligence, and all the rest of us that love horror.<br/><br/>The Evil Dead was also tweaked a bit by changing the reason why these characters were going to the cabin in the first place. I liked that they didn't use the traditional young adults ""going to the woods storyline"" just to have sex and do drugs(This could of happened if it was directed by the Michael Bay horror film revamp industry). This film is not perfect in any way, but I would definitely watch it again, not as much as the original I will always cherish that version.<br/><br/>Final Thought. This new vision is an updated more polished version of the original, but I feel it will never replace the magic of the original cult classic. I am also not a fan of most recent remakes, but this is worth a watch. Finally a remake that made me feel glad for taking the time to watch it, I actually didn't feel let down leaving the theater this time around for once. Bravo!"
"T-Fizzle","7","10","33","8 April 2013"," A decent horror movie
","If you enjoy horror movies, this is a good flick to check out. If you like good movies, it's a bit of a bore but it's still a lot of fun to watch. This was the first horror film I've ever seen in theatres and I had fun watching it. It does what it's supposed to do. Is it scary? It has it's moments. Is it disgustingly-gory. Oh yeah.<br/><br/>For starters: The characters are your typical horror-movie based teenagers that go somewhere far away from society to have some fun...only to have that fun taken away by something evil. To the film's credit, the character development wasn't too bad. Two of the teenagers are siblings and they had this conflict about their mother. It was surprising to me because I'd didn't expect a film like this to have that kind of back story. I won't give away too much for those who haven't seen it yet, but there is this one guy who gets brutalized in the film and yet he still takes it like a champ.<br/><br/>As for the effects: Yeah. Believe what everyone says about the violence in this movie. This is some of the most brutal, disturbing imagery you will see in any movie. The effects were brilliant. I heard Sam Raimi tried to use as little CGI as possible, and it shows. Very few scenes feature CG effects. You will question as to whether or not some scenes contain CGI. If you have to ask yourself that, it's very likely it isn't CGI.<br/><br/>What I didn't like: This is just a nitpick. When the possessed characters talk with that Venom-like voice and they swear, it kinda ruins the horror atmosphere for me. I don't know why. I just don't find them that threatening anymore when they swear. Most of the time, I just laughed. If you have seen the red-band trailer, you'll remember the end where the girl in the cellar is taunting one the guys by singing. THAT is a lot scarier than hearing her shout out, ""Come down so I can suck you cock, pretty boy!""<br/><br/>Overall, Evil Dead is every-bit as nasty as everyone says it is. The story was decent, the characters were enjoyably stupid, and the effects were top notch. I advise you watch this film with a large group of people."

","First of all I am 56 years old and I have been watching horror movies since I was 7 or 8 years old they are my favorite genre I love these kinds of films,I am a huge fan of the original trilogy,that being said I watched the new Evil Dead with an open mind and thought it was a very good film,it had all the elements that most remakes do not have including rewatchability ,I cant understand all the negative reviews. What do people want anyway its far superior than most horror films these days and certainly better than almost all of the remade ones.I can tell a lot of fans of the original did not watch the new one with an open mind so go back and give this film another look!"
"CameronJH","8","8","25","11 June 2013"," Better than some people claim
","Before I first saw this film, I had read numerous negative reviews by self-proclaimed die hard fans of the franchise as well as many great reviews by professional film critics and I really had no idea what to think of it. The most I had experienced of the franchise prior to this was the first half of the first film and a musical version of it I saw in Las Vegas last summer, so I was essentially going in blind.<br/><br/>I was honestly expecting this film to be nothing other than a stupid gore fest that would get boring after the first half hour, thus causing me to leave the theater and attempt to get my money back or at least see something else. All of that was quickly forgotten once the film began to escalate and take hold of me in a vice-like grip, refusing to let me go. I was very surprised and pleased at how they were able to have everything interesting and keep the adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>A film like this that can grip your bones with fear and incite an almost animalistic terror in your guts while managing to stay fresh is a film that horror fans such as myself find to be a real breath of fresh air from the ""horror movies"" of the past ten years.<br/><br/>I would only recommend you watch this movie if you are open-minded about having a new and different light cast upon the Evil Dead franchise. But if you aren't and want to stick to what's comfortable for you, then that's fine, too. But if you watch it anyway, then I promise that you will hate it and complain about it and discourage other people from seeing it, which would be unfortunate because it really deserves much more credit than it's being given right now."

","In case of the characters sadly there were only 2 characters that stood up. It was only Jane Levy and Lou Taylor Pucci who I cared for in this film. Sure Shiloh Fernandez did great, but it needed something to spark. As for Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore, I don't really know, because I never cared for them.<br/><br/>It never did live up to the tag line ""THE MOST TERRIFYING FILM YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE!"" but alas the final minutes of the film really was suspense, over the top gore with the FANTASTIC SCORE of Roque Banos! I just did not want it to end! The final minutes of the film were shocking, HELL YEAH! I just saw a female Ash! It's definitely worth seeing from beginning to end! I just love both movies, the classic and the rebirth! <br/><br/>*Cough* Sequel *Cough* Sequel<br/><br/>May now crown thee Mia/Jane Levy Queen of Evil Dead!"
"ktjaneroot","9","10","34","8 April 2013"," I think you missed the point, mate.
","Before actually making the effort to see this installment of the Evil Dead franchise in theaters, I strongly suggest you watch The Evil Dead, The Evil Dead 2, and Army of Darkness first! The fact that this movie shares a name with the original does NOT make it a remake. It is NOT a remake, but a ""rebirth"", as one of the film's trailers suggests. It's based on a completely different set of characters than from the first film - note that Shiloh Fernandez's character is named David, and not ASH. Though the group of friends in this film bear striking resemblance to the original kids in the cabin, it's leading up to something MUCH bigger - something, that from my research, will be explained in Army of Darkness: Part II, which finally has the green light. Many other fans I've talked to about THIS particular Evil Dead film all came to the same conclusion right off the bat - This isn't a remake, but a sequel. A flash forward. Please keep all of these things in mind as you watch the film."
"mdnobles19","6","10","34","7 April 2013"," Could have been worse but should of been better
","Evil Dead made a big mistake by having a bold statement printed in large letters across its poster, saying THE MOST TERRIFYING FILM YOU WILL EVER EXPERIENCE. Unfortunately for the more experienced horror fans this film is not that terrifying, with not much true scares delivered, to me it failed in that department. <br/><br/>When I first saw the original The Evil Dead I was in 6th grade and I remember really being spooked by it and could never get that pencil in the ankle part out of my head. I think The Evil Dead was the first really gory movie I've ever seen at the time and made me love horror films even more and really check out the classics. The acting in the original was laughably bad, but in an entertaining and charming sort of way, with a charismatic protagonist Bruce Campbell as the iconic Ash. Of all the old horror films I've seen in the past The Evil Dead wasn't a true favorite of mine, Poltergeist is still number 1 on that list, which is also being remade to my dismay. The original also hasn't aged too well either and watching it now is more for laughs than anything else, but I always admired its atmosphere and DIY gory and brilliant practical effects. You can't deny that The Evil Dead much like Halloween before it, paved a way for horror films and unknown horror filmmakers trying to make a breakthrough, it made a lasting impact for sure.<br/><br/>The new Evil Dead isn't a horrible remake and in fact it's the most loyal and not watered down ones out there and amps the violence and gore up to the brilliant extreme! It gives several nods to the original but makes it its own, some scenes though happen too fast and there wasn't enough suspense and I never thought I would say this but the pace was way too fast making the experience all too predictable. I absolutely loved the look of the new Evil Dead atmosphere; it stays true to the original's atmosphere but polishes it to perfection. The remake doesn't surpass or improve and fix the originals problems but didn't quite fall below it either; it can proudly stand side by side. This isn't groundbreaking again or will help the horror genre move forward but it could of been way worse. Also the last 10 minutes of the film was insane and much better than the first half.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part was uneven but an improvement over the original. This is Jane Levy's movie though, she delivers a memorably creepy and to me breakthrough performance as Mia, who is fighting a heroin addiction and agrees to go to a remote cabin in the woods with her brother and friends to finally kick this shameful habit to the curb for good. Right away strange things start to happen, which leads to the discovery of the book of the dead and the controversial and still uncomfortable tree rape scene, which isn't as prolonged this time around but just as sadistic. The evil dead soon takes over Mia's body and all hell breaks loose and blood covers the screen. Jane Levy is really put through the ringer in this film and has such a challenging and layered role to take on and she succeeds in flying colors. Jane stole every scene she was in and her character is the only one worth rooting for, as the other characters seem like cardboard cutouts of unsuspecting horror film victims. A new scream queen is born and that's Jane Levy! Shiloh Fernandez who plays Mia's brother David, Lou Taylor Pucci who plays Eric, Jessica Lucas who plays Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore who plays David's girlfriend Natalie all do their best, but their characters fell flat to me and underdeveloped to give a damn and their characters made some pretty idiotic moves and common horror movie mistakes. None of them where annoyingly distracting though and their demises were very brutal, I just wish their characters had more to do than to just serve the plot especially Jessica Lucas, who they totally underused here. <br/><br/>It's pretty amazing that this is director's Fede Alvarez first major and full-length film as it's expertly and confidently crafted, his future as horror filmmaker looks promising as it's permanently planted and can't wait to see it grow. You can see his love and inspiration for the original film and with guiding hands like the original director Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell who are the producers, they couldn't do that much damage from the get-go. The writing is a different story as it all came up flat to me. Fede collaborated with Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody who she wrote the sleeper hit Juno and made a semi comeback with Young Adult. Diablo Cody seems to be delivering hits and misses, Juno was great, Jennifer's Body was OK but fell flat, Young Adult was again great but once another horror movie comes along her signature sharp, witty and meaty dialogue disappears. Of all horror movies Evil Dead deserved to have that kind of dialogue, it was all just too damn serious and if you are not going to back up the bold statement in your poster at least bring on the twisted laughs and sharpness.<br/><br/>Overall, Evil Dead's downfall is that it was much too over hyped and overrated much like The Cabin in the Woods."
"theungoliant","5","4","10","13 May 2013"," A bad film with the odd good bit
","Here's what you should know.<br/><br/>STORY - It felt like a first draft. Underdeveloped characters that I'm supposed to care about, a bucket load of questions left unanswered, dialogue that had no thought put into it - it added nothing new to the Evil Dead story, so why remake it? ACTING - Some good, some bad. The poor man's Mila Kunis was great, but the archetypal stoner was unbelievable and felt like a read-in.<br/><br/>CAMERAS - ""Let's just make a 90 minute tribute to Instagram!"" Nope. You've got a huge cinema screen: use it. Don't disregard 90% of the shot by using pull focus that goes so far as to cover up important details. Some of the imagery such as the burning bush and the angel's descension were pretty impressive, but they were so scarce that they felt as if they didn't fit.<br/><br/>SET & EFFECTS - Probably the film's strongest point, forgetting the cherryade vomit scene. For me, the lighting created the mood. It made you feel damp and uncomfortable by bringing the forest and cabin to life.<br/><br/>THE ENDING - Without spoilers, this was great to watch, but nothing else. I didn't care about what was happening, who was what, who the hell that person is. But hey, it was so over-the-top it was impressive. More visuals like this would have been great.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION - If you're wanting heat-turning gore, step right up. But if you want to see a good film, best go somewhere else. I'd wait for the DVD release if I were you."
"kiran-gordhan","9","9","30","12 April 2013"," Long Evil the Dead
","For the fans of the Evil Dead, the newest edition to the franchise might be regarded as heresy or worse, capitalist branding of a beloved culturally acclaimed trilogy. It's hard to imagine the Evil Dead sans Bruce Campbell but it has happened and what I can say is that a vibrant, fresh and iconoclastic horror genre is approaching. Just as Tarantino has embraced a comical sense of blood in his recent films, Fede has breached new territory by incorporating gore as a horror mechanism rather than just a shock tactic. Technology has granted us privilege in art; directors are privileged enough to present the best utilization of technology. The horror genre has pushed many boundaries and yet is somewhat slighted for not being quite as prestigious enough but it's time that features like the Evil Dead break headway into universal film culture.<br/><br/>This re-imagining is nothing short of a brilliant story told with a tremendously enjoyable prologue from generations prior. As I understand it, this is set in the same location decades after Ash blessed the woods with his most noble jaw-line. I think, after one viewing I'm not as certain, an orange rusted Olds rests as a seating prop for Mia at an early point in the new film. That's the most homage I detected for Bruce: the film is detached while respectful and does not rely on the established. I must re-iterate, this is afresh take on an original and very entertaining plot. Another remarkable facet was the lack of cell phones. The cabin didn't even have a phone to use. The movie had the intensity of Twelve AngryMen by only allowing the six dedicated characters to interact. Given the rigid standards we, as an audience, placed on film makers the ability of ED to maneuver expertly about and still present a polished product is fantastic.<br/><br/>Blood and gore are staples in a horror flick. Almostexpected really but how often do we anticipate blood and guts in movies? Moreoften than not, unfortunately. We are conditioned. What separates ED from Sawand Hostel is the blatant disregard for camera technique to enhance the effect but rather the mutilation is highlighted. With the camera focused on a blade piercing a tongue in two, you wince and get that second glance at the split tongue unlike the gore-horror-shock-show when after you wince you see a bloody tool and dripping prosthetics. Once more, this film is reaching new boundaries because it isn't the shy kid in the back angrily hearing stupid, timid and mediocre responses and not having a voice, this is the kid hopped up on speed spouting things you wish you had never heard causing thoughts you never wanted. It is the type of thought that relieves you of anxiety. This is where the gore, and if you're deprived enough: violence gets a bad rap. Quentin Tarantino releases two movies that portray blood gushing from the human body as Old Faithful and everyone accepts that he is just a guy crazy over exaggerating but the flicks still demand credibility for ascertaining reality. Fede employs a legitimate amount of blood per wound, very dissimilar Freddy's drenching massacres (poor JohnnyDepp) and Django and demands very little; severe head trauma hardly flooding the room and machete wounds that bleed rather than gush. Simple and satisfying yet misunderstood.<br/><br/>If blood were to emanate from the human body in the fashion of Inglorious Bastards or even the Boondock Saints, we would all be more blood than tissue. A pretty floppy premise, really. I think these films serve the purpose of reminding us it isn't real and we don't have to imagine what it would actually look like or resemble to be torn apart that effortlessly. Iguess the ED does a rather great job of making a large number of the audience uncomfortable, beyond just gore and blood effects. Mind you, the scariest thing you will witness is you attaching to any one of the five friends. Still, this is the greatest thing to happen to horror since Cloverfield and the Poltergeist.Horror has become so removed from scaring the audience, and I mean actually terrifying the audience not just quick jumps and terrors, but lasting leaving amark that it has almost become forgotten. The ten dollar price tag is again appropriately assigned to thrilling ride.<br/><br/>The only film more disturbing in terms of material is FunnyGames and that's directed by a psychopath."

","Great movie with a ton of throwbacks to the original films. Things such as the yellow car, quotes, old voice overs, the necklace witch quotes, and a huge handful of nods to the original 2 films are made. It overall is a great film. Be an adult and watch it your self form your own opinion. (don't spam others with hateful comments.) With no cgi used in the film (yes everything is a prosthetic) and plenty of messy/ gory parts to make you squirm, it is a great movie with a huge throw back to the original films that is sure to make you squirm. Destined to be a new classic. It will be a definite buy on DVD for me. It is also confirmed there will be a few sequels to this and an army of darkness 2. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the quirkiness of the original and to any one is a fan of horror movies. also the more support you give for the film the more likely you are to get more Bruce quotes and such"

","One of those great remakes that are just as good as the original but without copying it. Instead, It gives it's own flavor and color but always remembers it is still Evil Dead.<br/><br/>This is the movie where TASTES will decide whether the movie is better or worse than the original.<br/><br/>The FILM as a whole, is just fantastic. As a horror film it does everything it's supposed to have. Great dark scenery, great pacing, really cool violence (this includes death scenes and other moments where blood is shed)<br/><br/>And as a REMAKE it does everything right.<br/><br/>Why do you want to see a remake that does EVERYTHING scene by scene like the original???? To see better special effects??? the original effects where fine!! if you are going to make a film that was already made, then you BETTER bring something new to the table.<br/><br/>But you ALWAYS got to stay true to the original. You CANNOT bring something new without respecting the original, and i believe this film did that.<br/><br/>All the beats form the original where there, but they gave it their own twist. all the moments where there, but with their own flavor.<br/><br/>It was like Watching Evil Dead all over again, but as a COMPLETELY NEW EXPERIENCE.<br/><br/>Think of it like this. What if somebody else did Evil Dead instead of Sam Raimi?<br/><br/>That is this film, and THAT is why i think all remakes should be that way. It's a what if scenario, have all the familiar queues but have something new happen.<br/><br/>Totally recommend it"

Expecting more Paranormal Actvity/jump-scare BS that seems to creep it's way out from the pits of Hollywood's armpits. However, though it's not as good as the original it was one of the goriest and better horror films to come onto the big screen for quite sometime. I like how they used as little CGI(computer generated images)and mainly used practical effects like makeup and fake blood. It was quite refreshing to say the least. Although the story was kind of weak and the acting wasn't all that great, the hardcore gore and cringe-worthy imagery was totally worth it.

"Welshness","8","8","26","19 April 2013"," An Honest Review
","So the hype, yup even the poster cranks that one up a notch by saying it's the most terrifying film like ever!!!<br/><br/>I'll start off by saying that a lot of the reviews on here are from people who have not even seen the film, they started bashing it before its release so. Ignore any you see before the date of the film's release.<br/><br/>I've watched the original, scared the hell outta me as a kid and respected it a lot more as a film lover over the years.<br/><br/>This film? It's a different sort of Evil Dead, it's what I like to call Glossy Horror, the sort of Horror film that looks good with a good budget and doesn't wanna make you hurl by looking cheap and nasty.the best way to walk into this film was by thinking ""this is a spin off"" it's TOTALLY NOT!!! But a lot of people are comparing it to the original and it just kept the basics. A revision. There were a lot of things in the original that didn't make it into the 2013 version, such as the demons creepy playful singing and laughing and just being bat sh!t cray!!!! But then there are things about the 2013 version that was just amazing to watch such as the finale!!! What a showdown!!!<br/><br/>It's not a scary film,, it's really not and a lot of peoples reviews just made me think that they were putting it on for the sake of looking tough but I'm not sure if this is what they were going for but it doesn't go for the cheap scares, its more ""watch whilst this chick totally messes her face off you still watching? Of course you are! You paid for it!"" but the film is very WTF!!!<br/><br/>If you're a hardcore film lover then this is a good film, if you're not so much then I would say this might be too intense for you it's a very graphic and violent film and there a certain films that I won't watch again just because they cross the line and are unnecessary, <br/><br/>An example, Hostel part 2, girl being hung upside down, that for me was too much. Walking out of the cinema, my partner and me got chatting and he felt that this film crossed the line too much, so I guess its your own thoughts<br/><br/>The acting it's a strong cast, the BFF was the best of the bunch, it seemed that she had more to give and it was a shame she was first out!! Mia was a strong focal point but bad editing and sound effects caused her best lines to run away with her and some lines actually sounded a little slurred she came into her own in the final act and if it wasn't for that scene, I would have written the character off as a body count as we didn't really see much of her before and during as she was well a mess the bro was a misleading ASH if you wanna call him that, he was one to route for, Natalie was the most underwritten, a line here and there and then when there were a few less characters left I was waiting for her to ""nail it"" and, ummm she didn't it has nothing to do with the actress who was brilliant, I just wanted more from the character which she never got the chance to do and finally, that guy that's always a stoner and does the wrong thing like read demonic books? Actually one of the best, completely surprised me, a lot of heart and not what to expect, his last line was just sweet!<br/><br/>The film shots are beautiful, I think they managed to capture every single good angle of darkness the only reason I didn't get the full score was just down to one thing from the Original. Ash has to survive the night alone. This was truly an amazing horror scene back in the day and I was always on the edge of my seat and to have the rights to work with the original and not use this was just a waste, the clips from the trailer that didn't make it into the film were just frustrating as this is what I call false advertising and I hate it when they do this. The film did dip a little in the middle <br/><br/>But overall, it's a good horror, its bloody, its fresh and it's a lot of fun! <br/><br/>One last note, the music was excellent, the sound of a WW2 alarm ringing out was epic!!! Sharp and clever!"
"garydow","7","7","22","8 May 2013"," Don't compare to the original and you'll enjoy it more!
","We know the story - teens in a remote cabin albeit for a different reason to the usual (sex & booze) who then open the gates of hell and are forced to fight evil and try not to get bumped off in a variety of gruesome ways. All fairly routine so far and, in truth, this is little different to a number of similar films in the past. Cabin In The Woods tried to change the formula but this reverts to type and for all the negative comments, I actually enjoyed it as popcorn-put-brain-in-neutral fodder. <br/><br/>I think the key to 'liking' this is not comparing it to the 80s classic - the story is similar but it's really not a like-for-like remake at all. <br/><br/>I wouldn't call it scary, more an excuse for some gross-out effects - including one with a Stanley knife which is borderline unwatchable - and a couple of scenes which made me squirm (and I've been watching horrors since the late 70s). Equally I did jump on a couple of occasions and actually laughed once (the ""my head hurts!"" bit!).<br/><br/>People will see it for the same reason as me - I enjoyed the original so I wanted to compare - but try and forget it's a remake and that the title is the same and treat it as a separate film and you'll probably enjoy it more. I did."
"matthw-truesdell","8","9","31","8 April 2013"," A Groovy Summer Blood Fest
","A Group of friend's journey on up to the Ol' Cabin in the Woods— Really, if you know the plot to the original, you know the evil dead story. However for all the new gen of fans, that haven't seen the original there is a kind of different story— A recovering heroin addict coming off from an over-dose close friends decide it's time to stop using drugs ""Cold Turkey"" So they journey up to the family Cabin that the brother and sister use to visit when they were kids. Strange smells coming from the basement? Time To Investigate— Finding a book called the Necronomicon, and reading from said book, sees our would be hero's being possessed one by one until there is but one soul survivor.<br/><br/>I went into the evil dead like most people, having hope that it pays homage to the 1981 classic, which I hold close to my chest as one of my favorite horror films— boy was I wrong, this in my opinion is nothing like the Sam Raimi classic, a few classic camera angles thrown in a time or two, but in all retrospect this is a complete different film, squeamish look away— the evil dead movies in a whole aren't for everyone anyway. Strong stomach is required and this one takes that to a whole new level. missing appendages in every corner of the film, I really don't see how they got away with an R-Rating. This movie was a blood bath. Nice creepy atmosphere, it won't scare the avid horror buff, the jump scares are rather predictable, the acting is rather mediocre kinda like the original, potty mouth demons, we've heard that before which reminded me of The Exorcist more then the Evil Dead— I don't see anyone quoting lines from this movie in the near future. But all in all, it is a great film, if you don't mind the bloodshed which was one of the bloodiest films I've seen in awhile, it does the franchise justice, and I really hope to see more horror films from this director, without a re imaging of an old title, I think they have serious talent. the kill scenes were really well done, with what I could tell I didn't see much CGI, it feels like they tried to keep it authentic. It's a real polished film, the humor is still there although it's toned done a notch, you will get some chuckles out of it. Mostly depends on your personality. ""One of The Scariest Movies"" I think not, although some scenes did give me ""Goosebumps"" it is though a great throwback horror film, you must remember the original wasn't known for the best acting, best story, it was known for the blood, gore, comedic atmosphere. This one was all that then some— This just feels like a summer horror flick to me. And rather you like it or not, it has the possibility to be a timeless classic. I'm not going to spoil anyone's thoughts on this film, we all have an opinion I recommend to go into this film as a blank slate and just sit there and enjoy. if your on the fence about this film, just see it. it is worth watching ignore any negativity this is one of the best well done remakes(rebirths) in recent years. People will complain about anything, Take negativity with a grain of salt and who honestly cares. It's a summer blood bath that's what it's supposed to be, just like the original. A great film in my opinion— looking forward to the uncut blu-ray release. It will defiantly be getting a lot of future plays from me. Is it like the Classic ? No. It is entirely a Peripheral to the franchise. And a great Flick."

","Usually I don't like horror films. Most of horror films looks so unrealistic and boring. But I liked the Evil dead series from the beginning.I still remember how scared I was after watching the first Evil dead film when I was just a little child. I also liked next two episodes as well and loved the comedic nature of those two. The next one was scary too. But to me this latest episode is the scariest of all. It almost have the story line of the very first Evil Dead film. Some scenes are extremely similar but that does not harm the quality of the film. Unlike in many now a days horror films this film does not contain any nudity and I really appreciate that.Actually I personally believe that eroticism and horror are entirely different paths and not to be crossed. If the film is a success you wouldn't need a naked woman to keep watching a film. This film is a very good example to prove my saying. All horror scenes are highly graphical and extremely scary; most importantly they do not appear unrealistic. The last scene in which the main monster dies is the only scene I found less scary and unrealistic. I personally believe that it was not the way to go for a such a powerful evil and it should have been more possessed."

","I've never seen the original so I can't compare the two but based on this version of it, it's terrible in my opinion. A group of young adults go to a cabin in the woods... hmm, that has never been done before. The plot is boring and predictable. There really isn't much of a plot, a dude opens a book of witch craft and all of them become possessed and start killing each other. That's it. The gore is also exaggerated. I can appreciate a good amount of blood and guts but it's just overused in this movie. Maybe the purpose was to distract the viewer(s) from the lack of substance within the plot.

"jukangliwayway","3","3","7","23 August 2013"," The most terrifying film you will ever experience. NOT.
","That's actually the most deceitful movie tagline of all time -- and I'm not amused. Using a gazillion gallons of fake blood is not terrifying. A deadite basically knocked-off from The Exorcist isn't terrifying. A series of quick ""scary inserts"" and loud sound effects supposedly meant to make the viewers jump off their seats isn't terrifying. Lots of severed limbs and vomiting isn't terrifying. NO. NO. NO! Not one bit in this movie is terrifying! <br/><br/>Okay, I'm not at all a biased reviewer. So let me start with the good points. First of all, the cinematography/photography & lighting is really good. It definitely has that eerie atmosphere fit for a horror movie, and there are great shots that add to the visual quality of the film. But then again, there's a shot somewhere which greatly reminded me of The Walking Dead, is that a good or bad thing? I don't really know, but it makes it less special. Secondly, it's really nice to see a movie which utilizes practical effects rather than an overload of CGI (that to me is the bane of today's film industry), which is also a nostalgic nod to the Raimi original. Third, is the smart decision not to do a FULL REMAKE of the original. Alvarez did a slightly different take on the story and mood, and that to me is his advantage - because seriously, who could ever replace Bruce Campbell or remake the original Evil Dead? <br/><br/>Since this is a splatter horror flick, then let's consider the gore. Yes, it's gory, especially made obvious by the veritable fountain of blood. But is it cringe-worthy? I don't know if I'm too old for this or I've seen too much gory movies, but this didn't do anything for me. The only genuine reaction that this movie elicited from me was when Mia was trapped in that small niche and Abomination Mia was plunging that big ass machete or something, hitting Mia in the leg and arm. That's it. Otherwise, the gore was over-the-top it became funny at times, which considering the serious tone they presented to us, I'm sure it's unintentional. There's just too much blood and repetitive crap that after a while there's really no more shock value. <br/><br/>We also have a bunch of uninteresting characters that I really couldn't care less seeing them getting hacked, bashed, slashed, nail-attacked etc. Alvarez spent a good chunk of the first act trying to establish an emotional connection with the characters, but they're still so severely underdeveloped. Mia was okay. Now, I'm not saying that Ash and his gang were the epitome of fully fleshed out characters, of course not. But Raimi didn't focus on that, he didn't expect us to invest on the characters' personal lives. He gave us a fun-filled, gory, scary cabin action. 2013, on the other hand, tried to add depth, but failed. It's a wasted opportunity really. They could have just spend the time telling us more about the demon, (no Deadite term referenced at all) instead of wasting our time making us like characters which are utterly, so painfully unlikeable.<br/><br/>I don't like it. I don't hate it. I don't care about it. Those expecting a good remake or just a good horror flick, turn around, this is not it. Unless you enjoy a movie with lots of blood, dismemberment, & stupid characters, then fine. Go ahead, feast on this mother-effer.<br/><br/>If you want to read my full review, and read more about my comparison, click here. thanks! http://strangereview.blogspot.com/2013/08/evil-dead-2013-why-this- remake-is-so.html"

","As a big fan of the original ""Evil Dead"" film, nay, strike that, a fan of the original trilogy, it was a bit hard to approach this movie with a neutral stance.<br/><br/>But in all fairness, then this 2013 version of ""Evil Dead"" is a good enough way to introduce a new audience to the franchise. However, was it a necessary project to see the light of day? Hardly so. In my personal opinion, a continuation after ""Army of Darkness"" would have been better off.<br/><br/>The effects in this 2013 version was good, although they were visually great and gory enough to keep most gore-hounds happy, then they just lacked that special touch that is found in the original trilogy. As campy and out of date by today's standards, then the original trilogy just somehow pulled it off better. I suppose that is part of the cult legacy.<br/><br/>This fresh and new take on the original story did have some striking similarities to the first two movies, yet there were parts that deviated far, perhaps too far (I am, of course, talking about who ends up with the chopped off hand, the chainsaw and walking away as a sole survivor here). And no, I am not going to ruin it by saying who it was. However, I will say that this twist and turn from the original story didn't sit well in my stomach.<br/><br/>The book, Naturon Demonto, was just more wicked and vile in the original trilogy, with far better illustrations, glyphs and sigils. But of course, that is not essential to the movie itself, it is just a horror nerd like me noticing and commenting on that.<br/><br/>The possessed people in the movie were actually quite interesting to look at, especially with the mutilations and gore they were subjected to. However, the eyes just lacked that shiny yellow color as seen in the original movie. But still, there was some pretty interesting effects and ideas to be seen here.<br/><br/>As for the people cast to portray the roles in the 2013 version. Well, they were doing good enough jobs, but they had pretty big shoes to fill out, to which they managed to do well enough in their own right.<br/><br/>For me, as an avid fan of the original trilogy, then this 2013 version was sort of a disappointing, although not surprisingly so, revisit to the 1981 cult classic. But for people not old enough to be familiar with the original movies, then the 2013 version should provide adequate entertaining, and hopefully light an interest in watching the original trilogy.<br/><br/>Watch the movie up to the very end after the credits are done rolling, it is well worth it."

And also, you wish the dead for everyone. Of course, the movie has some twists. And some really effective moments, full of fear. Entertaining, with good cinematography and rhythm, a good gore effects. I recogniced the car of Raimi and I missed the steadycam of the first version.

"wilr2001","8","7","23","20 April 2013"," Now I understand the mixed reviews!
","Just got home from watching Evil Dead and it's only now that I understand why it has received such split opinion.<br/><br/>First of all, Evil Dead is a great, entertaining modern horror film - fact! <br/><br/>What Evil Dead doesn't do so successfully is capture the original's creepy, cursed-like atmosphere - fact! <br/><br/>So, if you score this about around a 7, 8 or 9 out of 10 I totally get it - and I'm with you. If however, you scored this a 5 or under, I think it's likely because you expected the film to reflect the original's notoriously creepy, low budget, relentless fright fest quality. Even the original's hammy acting aided it's atmosphere - I still rate the original ""The Evil Dead"" in my top 2 or 3 horror films of all time.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though I really enjoyed Evil Dead from beginning to end, I have to admit, I really, really wanted the film to creep me out in the same way the original did in the 80's - but it didn't, and that's the problem. Still, I gave this a solid 8 out of 10 as it is probably the very best out of all horror remakes of the last 20 years. Evil Dead looks and sounds great, the acting is decent, there's plenty of respect and nods to the original and there's gallons of blood! <br/><br/>...And when was the last time that happened? Not perfect, but I enjoyed every minute!"
"DobbyChelloveck","8","7","23","11 April 2013"," Evil Dead is an absolute blast!
","I'm actually baffled to see that Evil Dead is sitting at a 7.4 on IMDb, not because I disagree, but because every review on this site is absolutely tearing the movie apart, and that's a shame. I may be the minority here, but I had a blast with the new Evil Dead. While it didn't blow me away like last year's Cabin in the Woods, it was a lot of fun, and that's more than I can say for most recent horror movies. <br/><br/>In all honesty, I don't know what kind of expectations had for this movie. If people were expecting groundbreaking levels of intelligence, they clearly were looking in the wrong place. A movie named ""Evil Dead"" isn't meant to make you think, it's meant to entertain you, and this new variation of the classic horror film definitely entertained me, albeit in a different way.<br/><br/>Evil Dead hasn't changed its plot much from the original. A group of teenagers go to a cabin, they open the infamous book, and all hell breaks loose. The story does have an interesting twist, where the now female protagonist (played wonderfully by Jane Levy), is a heroin addict sent to the cabin by her friends to help quit her addiction cold turkey. The new twist to the story isn't exactly necessary, but it helps add a deeper level of drama.<br/><br/>However, drama isn't what the movie is about. The movie has the same intentions as the original – to deliver plenty of gory scares. Evil Dead succeeds well in shocking the audience with its absolute brutality. As someone who rewatched the original specifically in preparation for this remake, I can confirm that the movie plays out largely in the same way as the original. It has sadistic scares left and right, combined with small doses of scattered black humor. Yes, I'm well aware that the movie isn't nearly as funny as the original, but that's not the movie's goals. This is an Evil Dead for a new generation, and it does a fine job fulfilling its goals.<br/><br/>One other thing to note is that Evil Dead is a technical triumph. Unknown to many, one fun fact about the movie is that it doesn't feature a lick of CGI. This movie is all clever filmmaking tricks. If you think back to the original Evil Dead and remember the god awful makeup and effects, you'll come to appreciate the masterful technical work of Fede Alvarez.<br/><br/>The movie is obviously not without its flaws. Besides Jane Levy's character (Mia), the rest of the cast is pretty bland and forgettable, and I'm not just talking about the performances, I'm talking about the actual characters. The characters aren't people you're going to be upset about if they die, which has become pretty standard for horror movies. The overabundance of forgettable characters in horror movies is precisely why this doesn't bother me as much as it does everyone else. Think back to the original Evil Dead – now think about the characters. Aside from Ash, who were you really attached to? Though it would be nice to have some characters with depth, I've come to expect it from these kinds of movies. The movie isn't about characters with layers upon layers of depth, it's about bloody fun.<br/><br/>The other flaw I'd like to point out isn't necessarily the movie's fault, and it does nothing to keep me from enjoying it. However, some people may have a problem with this. Evil Dead isn't anything new, so for those looking for something with the intelligence of say, Cabin in the Woods, I apologize. Then again, the movie IS a remake. If they twisted the plot too much, people would be even more enraged. The plot stays true to the original in more ways than I expected, but keep in mind that this isn't a movie that will revolutionize modern horror movies, though some positive aspects of this movie should be noted by aspiring filmmakers.<br/><br/>As far as horror movie remakes go, Evil Dead succeeds. I will agree with everyone, it's not as great as the original, but it's still a blast. With buckets of gore, impressive effects, and plenty of jabs at its big brother, Evil Dead succeeds.

","The original was creepy, full of gore, had bad acting, a shoe-string budget but was a hell of a lot of fun. You got an eerie feeling from the moment it starts and it does not leave you until it's over. In short, The Evil Dead (1981) is a masterpiece in horror.<br/><br/>Now, take that story, add a budget, some good acting, gore, but take away the eerie feeling and the fun, and you have Evil Dead the remake (reboot?).<br/><br/>Nowhere near as good as the original in my opinion, but for a horror or gore fan, it's definitely worth a watch for the gross out scenes alone.<br/><br/>I will admit there are a couple of funny moments, and I did enjoy the familiar elements from the first 2 films creeping into this new movie in various forms, but it's no original.<br/><br/>By today's standards a very good horror movie by far.

I especially appreciate the very low use of CGI in all those scenes, I found it hard to believe there was little CGI. The plot was a little different, considering there was the character who had a drug problem and all that jazz...<br/><br/>I appreciate the ending, I honestly was surprised that Jane Levy's character was the only person to survive (well, most of her, that hand just didn't wanna stay for long)... Plus, the one dude that looked like Jesus Christ was pretty funny, especially the part when he was shot numerous times by a nail gun. <br/><br/>All in all, I thought the movie is one of those films where you would appreciate to see with a bunch of your friends, because who doesn't love seeing your friends gross out to a film where blood & gore is its forte?"

","I absolutely loved the new Evil Dead! If you have any interest at all, see it.<br/><br/>It's not so much a retelling of the first movie (as far as the first had a ""plot,"" ha ha). It's more of a sequel that takes place in the same cabin with the same evil forces. Other than that, the reboot holds it's own and has a story that actually makes good sense, e.g., there's a reason for the twenty-somethings to go to the cabin, and their reasons for sticking around are feasible.<br/><br/>The characters are likable. The music is excellent. The thrilling scares come-a-plenty. Gore-fans will be pleased with the rivers of blood. (It's hard to believe the MPAA approved this for an R.) Even the credits are beautiful.<br/><br/>Just realize this one doesn't have the same campy tone. There is a lot less dark humor, but, strangely, it doesn't really need it.

"zardoz-13","8","14","57","5 April 2013"," Graphic But Not As Great As The Original ""Evil Dead""
","The harrowing imagery alone makes the ""Evil Dead"" remake worth the price of admission. ""Spider-Man"" helmer Sam Raimi directed the original ""Evil Dead"" back in 1981. He swirled horror with humor in a low-budget scream-fest with a no-name cast. Despite its crappy special effects, this supernatural splatter-spoof ranks as a cult favorite among gorehounds. Raimi went on to direct two sequels, and Bruce Campbell attained the status of B-movie hero. The skewered cinematography, atmospheric settings, and maniacal urgency made this contrived 85 minute nonsense unforgettable. Comparatively, in his directorial debut, writer & director Fede Alvarez, abetted by co-scenarists Rodo Sayagues and Diablo Cody, has preserved the premise of the Raimi classic. Nevertheless, he has shunned Raimi's ghoulish but campy approach. Moreover, the Uruguayan native has ramped up the gore far more than Raimi dared. In fact, Alvarez has knocked the bottom out with some elaborately orchestrated carnage that makes the ""Saw"" movies look tame. One scene depicts a girl mutilating her arm with an electric carving knife. The MPAA must have felt in a charitable mood when they gave ""Evil Dead"" an R-rating ""for strong bloody violence and gore, some sexual content and language."" The visual CGI effects are designed to make you regurgitate. Make no mistake; Alvarez has conjured up one hellacious nightmare of a movie. One of the girls acts as if she were auditioning for ""The Ring"" (1998) rather than ""The Evil Dead."" She crawls around on her hands with her hair in her eyes and blood and gore all over her body. Indeed, the isolated cabin-in-the-woods plot provides an excuse for ample mutilation, rampant dismemberment, and buckets of blood. Unlike the original, Alvarez's ""Evil Dead"" doesn't duplicate the bucolic rape of one of the girls. Alvarez doesn't plunge the bole of a tree between her thighs as Raimi did in the original. Instead, Alvarez has a sinister witch cough up a skein of black licorice that crawls up and into the struggling girl's mouth.<br/><br/>In the 1981 original ""Evil Dead,"" five Michigan State college students cruised up to a ramshackle cabin in the middle of nowhere to enjoy Spring Break. They discover a tape recording and a book fashioned from human flesh in the basement. One of them recites passages aloud from the forbidden text. The combination of the Book of the Dead being opened and its incantations being uttered summons evil. Predictably, all Hell breaks loose. The big change in the remake is Alvarez provides an incendiary prologue. Two men manhandle a girl into a basement and lash her to a post. The girl's father incinerates her while a crone mutters incantations from the same Book of the Dead. As an opening gambit, this torture scene prepares us for the pandemonium that ensues. Level-headed college students made up the original ""Evil Dead"" group. The remake deploys a group of friends rehabilitating one of their own. Mia (Jane Levy of ""Fun Size"") has a monkey on her back in the form of heroin. After spending several years apart from each other, she is reunited with her older brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez of ""Red""), who knows nothing about her addiction. The two share some bad memories. Namely, David left Mia to contend with their dying, mentally distraught mom. Not only is Mia a heroin junkie, but also this isn't the first time she has tried to conquer her craving. As Olivia (Jessica Lucas of ""Clovefield"") informs David, she and her friends don't intend to let Mia bail out of the treatment. For the record, David is the vague equivalent of Ash (Bruce Campbell) from the original. Alvarez has given all the characters different names. This time around, Olivia and company plan to keep Mia isolated in the woods while she endures a cold-turkey withdrawal. No sooner has this been said and done than Olivia's bespectacled boyfriend, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci of ""Fanboys""), finds the Book of the Dead, made from human flesh, scrawled in blood, and bound by barbed wire. Foolishly, Eric reads aloud from this tome. Meantime, Mia stumbles outside into the woods. Suddenly, vines, branches, and roots trap poor Mia in the underbrush and hold her captive for an evil witch. This lesbian witch spews profanity from her vile, wretched lips, and a licorice like skein of black sludge slithers up into Mia's mouth. At this point, ""Evil Dead"" leaves mild behind and turns heavy-duty.<br/><br/>Alvarez wallows his cast in blood, gore, and more. You know when you see a battery powered nail gun that somebody is going to use it on somebody else. Before things get really gory, a poor old pooch is slaughtered, but canine's death is staged off-screen. Everybody suffers horribly in ""Evil Dead,"" and nobody truly escapes without either sacrificing a body part or donating enough blood to revive a corpse. The most iconic scene in this savage saga occurs near the end. A one-armed, demon-possessed character gives another demon- possessed character a lobotomy courtesy of a chainsaw through the mouth. Essentially, ""Evil Dead"" lives up to its title with oodles of evil and death. Further, Alvarez takes his subject matter seriously enough that you could suffer nightmares from his over-the-top depiction of malevolence. Of course, we don't give a hoot who gets what in the end. The characters qualify as one-dimensional victims. ""Evil Dead"" spends most of its time trying to gross us out with its graphic detail. If you're squeamish, you should shun this remake with its bad night in the emergency room blood and gore. As remakes go, ""Evil Dead"" tops the original in terms of its polished production values, but its authentic looking gore doesn't surpass its predecessor's sense of humor. While the characters have more to occupy themselves with in the remake, nobody generates the charisma that Bruce Campbell did the original. Incidentally, if you sit through the end credits, you will see Bruce make a cameo."

"shotokan-cat","7","2","4","20 May 2014"," An enjoyable film, as long as you don't compare it to the original too much
","This was a good modern horror in it's own right, if slightly forgettable. However it didn't quite live up to the dark humour of the original, but if judged as a film in it's own right, which in this case it definitely should be, Evil Dead is worth watching, with enough thrills to satisfy the modern horror enthusiast. The original concept was utilised, but there were enough differences in the execution of the plot to keep the film fresh. The trope of the abandoned cabin in the woods is certainly an overused one (that has even been recognised enough now to be inverted and examined in other films), and some of the situations in it were a little tenuous, but generally the film was still of quality despite these potential pitfalls. But then, a remake of Evil Dead couldn't really be set anywhere else but a cabin, could it? I did miss the fun clay-mation scene that was there at the end of the original, but once again, I am bias (and something like that might have just looked forced in the context of the rest of the remake). So yes, overall, though a little unoriginal (but then - it is a remake), a pretty good job was done with this film, though maybe a little more dark humour like the original would have made it better. Too many modern horror films are cynical without the little twist of laughter that made films like Silence of the Lambs and Texas Chainsaw Massacre infamous."
"miketunney777","8","2","4","29 November 2013"," A ""reboot"" that pays homage to the original.
","Before I proceed, I will correct a common misconception of the movie; it is a reboot which isn't a direct sequel but combines familiar ground with a different concept. A remake refreshes the original but contains the same basic picture. That covers that. No on we go.<br/><br/>I went to see this not knowing what to expect (divided opinions from the Evil Dead fanbase and mixed-to-positive reviews of critics further intrigued my interest in seeing this film), and I was overall impressed. It undoubtedly pays homage to the original: Chainsaw hand, amazing gore effects, tension-driven camera-work, and the idea of young adults going into a cabin in the woods only to be drawn to a cellar containing The Book Of The Dead. The story is more developed this time around, giving some insight about a young woman whose troubling times with her now-deceased mother, abandonment from her bigger brother, and drug addiction lead towards her ""divine intervention"" with the help of her brother, and supportive friends to ""detox"" her of her addiction and let go of her emotional turmoil. The characters don't have much time to grow, but you really get to feel for the lead character. Like the original, the book gets read, and one by one, they die until the final character remains only to be tortured and mutilated along the way.<br/><br/>(SPOILER)Tense and terrifying from start to finish, rarely does a modern day horror film make such an impact of delivering horrifying tension, gory scares, and consistent thrills while emotionally stooping to the lead character's role as she loses her friends and brother. It lacks the gross black humor or campiness of the original, but it's an excellent film in many ways and truly delivers the goods for any horror film enthusiast."

The director have a very interesting ideas of presenting the action especially in the most valuable moments where you expect to see the difference with the decent Hollywood horrors.

"GrantKanigan","Null","2","4","13 November 2013"," A Major Disappointment and an Insult to the Horror Genre
","While the original was self aware, goofy, had great, self made special effects and a lovable lead in Bruce Campbell, the remake completely misses the mark. Obnoxiously violent, gory, sadistic, misogynistic and cruel, this isn't ""fun"" horror in the vein of say ""Cabin Fever"" ""Tucker & Dale Vs. Evil"" or even the first two Evil Dead films. This isn't exciting like Friday the 13th or A Nightmare on Elm street or Halloween is. It's not scary like The Shining or the Exorcist. This is pure, unadulterated GARBAGE. Hell, ""Troll 2"" is better than this turd. The actors are pathetic, the cinematography is dark, unfocused and jittery and the writing is choppy. We switch from lead to lead, without any character development to speak of, (save for the lead's archetypal druggie character), and some characters exist only to scream, get tortured and die. Usually people like horror films or engage with them because they either care about the characters or have a strong hate for the characters. Neither applies here. Aside from Lou Taylor Pucci, (and I'm saying that because I've seen his past work and know it's not his fault his character isn't given much to act upon), every actor is a cardboard cut out. Alvarez is dead in the directors chair and thus the film is void of any self-awareness, humor or meaning. This is, by far, the worst film of 2013. A completely unnecessary and stupid remake. A book the length of War and Peace could not adequately describe my loathing of this abomination."

Keep that memory fond, because there's nothing like that here. <br/><br/>I honestly hated every single person in this movie for one reason or the other. They literally do things (stupid things) to make you hate them. I wanted everyone to die, I wasn't empathetic and I didn't care.

I thought, great, a remake that can stand proud next to the originals. Well, that's not the case. First of all the characters were not at all likable and I didn't really care whether they'd die or not. The film had nothing original, many scenes were ripped off from the first film which I wouldn't mind if it was done well, but it wasn't. The movie was not really all that scary, which is a sad thing considering that it's a horror film not to mention the remake of one of the scariest horror films I've ever seen, the original Evil Dead. Looks like they decided to play it safe with this one and just produce a generic horror flick to cash in on the Evil Dead title. The movie as a stand alone horror film is alright, just your average horror flick to have a good time with friends and this is why I'm giving it a 5/10. I decided not to judge it as an EVIL DEAD movie because I don't want to let my disappointment get the better of me and give 2's and 3's to movies that don't deserve it. I should let you know though.

If you've watched the original Evil Dead, you will quickly realize its not the same campy, tongue-in-cheek horror that we all came to love. Instead, this film was supposed to be a more serious horror (as per directors words). While they did indeed retain the creepy camera movement thru the woods (when demons were summoned) and the necronomicon, little else remained. Ash has been replaced by a drug addict woman and jock Scott has been replaced by hippie-looking Eric. Also 2 of the characters are brother and sister.<br/><br/>This film did delve into the occult a little more than the original, but the exorbitant amount of expletives uttered throughout the movie was a complete turn off, and I definitely missed the ""we're gonna get you"" lullaby sung by Linda.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was sort of OK but I miss the hilarity.

","Entertaining, gory, and surprisingly fresh- Fede Álvarez's take on the classic horror flick is a surprisingly fun and scary remake that doesn't hold back. The main cast is pretty good for the most part, mainly Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez who play brother and sister in the film. The cast is rather small for the flick, but as for the other actors, they are certainly not as consistently good as the two leads- but they provide just enough into their performances to make them tolerable and pretty enjoyable. The cinematography is quite interesting and excellent, providing a fresh glimpse into the tale we all know. The script can struggle with uncertainties of how it wants to tell its story toward the beginning, but as it goes on, the film becomes very enjoyable, and quite fun to watch. It can be incredibly gory, violent, and downright grotesque, but it's all in good fun, and quite amusing to watch just how far the film is willing to go to push the limits. In the end, I was delighted to say that Evil Dead (2013) was a surprisingly decent remake that holds true to the original by also providing something fresh and exciting.

Had a hard time finding out what the frightening part of the movie was. This was just a lot of bloody violence and something about witchcraft. If it was about jumpscares, you could see it coming from a mile away. It scares people based on how they would define fear.And 'this' is certainly not what I would call 'fear'. Its just a lot of blood splattering out whenever the time says so.

But that wouldn't be possible in any way anyway, beacuse the original movie is indeed so original, could never be remade and never should but this movie is not trying to make a copy and I do believe it's intended as an homage.<br/><br/>Now, as horror movies goes, this one is nothing above or under the norm.

","""Evil Dead"" (2013), had a lot to live up to, but I think it actually managed to surpass the original. With the blessing from the original creator, Sam Raimi, ""Evil Dead"" (2013) surpassed the original 1981 classic in every way imaginable. They amped up to Gore to 11, and stayed true to the original in the process, by sticking with practical effects, which look amazing! The amount of blood in this movie is unbelievable, and it really is a treat to watch. Though, the acting is a little bad at times, this just adds to the spirit of the ""Evil Dead"" franchise, and makes it a more enjoyable experience. Also, this movie manages to scare, while also being a little goofy with it's dialogue and over-the-top blood and gore. Some of the scenes in this movie, are legitimately frightening, (and this is coming from someone who watches horror movies for fun, and prides themselves on not being easily scared.). All in all, ""Evil Dead"" (2013), is a movie not to be missed and a contender for greatest horror movie of the 2010s."

"influxtwo","7","0","0","2 May 2020"," The good outweighs the bad in a rare case.
","Revisiting this in 2020 was pretty interesting and satisfying. I needed that much time to let my thoughts on this film marinate. First let me cut to the chase the main cast, you could tell they put all their effort and trust in to this crew. The dedication from most of the cast and the make ups and gross-out initial story progressions were part of the extreme highlights.<br/><br/>I think it's cool that they filmed majority of the film in order, in order to benefit from the cast's understanding of the escalation in the story. All of the pieces were there to fit in the spots. Jane Levy was committed, exhausted, and beautiful. Jessica Lucas was her usual excellent and persuasive self, I love her subtlety and realism, and always thought she was an underutilized actress. The other main actors all looked and acted their parts well both alive and especially dead. The practical make ups and unique body horror/ contagion / almost sci fi parasitical nature of the plot's re-tweaking all worked surprisingly well for a one-off.<br/><br/>But that brings me to the weaker aspects. The story doesn't make much sense, and it's glaringly obvious especially towards the end. Even for Evil Dead standards. They couldn't really tell what vibe they wanted to go for in some parts. Gore was the top priority, and although that plays out well, especially with the deadite's, the sense of it wears thin by the end. Some of it works awesome, some of it seems a little lazy and contrived. It's a mixed bag.<br/><br/>The writing and script suffered the most I think, and a lot more than is fair for the actors and their dedication to the roles. Had the writing and script been stronger, the good visuals could've benefitted a lot more from it. The end was a scattered wtf moment. But the initial production was not bad.<br/><br/>I see this as an enjoyable horror film for the most part but the flaws are very evident. Some of it could've even just been fixed in editing, how they didn't notice or retweak some of the flaws in post-production is a bit of a mystery after all that work and effort of the cast.<br/><br/>I really think Bruce Campbell should've been the truck driver at the end. If they were going to turn on the campy faucets to that degree, might as well take it all the way home with more than an after credits one-liner. Overall not the worst it could've been. The potential and glimpses of talent still shine through. But some of the contrivances, nonsense, rushed editing, and unintentional campiness was a little all over the place I can admit.<br/><br/>I think most of the cast did great and I still think with that said, I like this film more each time I watch it. The good outweighs the bad in a rare case. It took me a while to accept this film as a part of the main series. But I think I've finally wrapped my head around it as a sequel more than a remake."

","Ok first off I want to say this was a pretty good movie. But a terrible evil dead movie. It also missed the point of the original entirely.<br/><br/>Evil dead 1981 was a movie that absolutely terrified me as a kid. I got started with Army of darkness and eventually found out evil dead 1 and 2 were the predecessors. I was expecting hilarity one liners and over the top action. But what I got was something even better and this is where Evil dead 2013 misses the point entirely.<br/><br/>The evil dead trilogy is basically a decent into madness and trauma. Ashley William's slowley becoming Ash. In evil dead Ashley Williams is a romantic shy educated young man. He has a girl he wants to spend his entire life with. As the madness ensues he basically does nothing heroic and freezes being saved by scotty over and over through out the movie. Ashley William's is a wimp.<br/><br/>Evil dead 2 he is becoming Ash after the cabin has driven him literally mad. We see him change into a womanizing witty idiot who is a badass with a chainsaw hand. Before our very eyes.<br/><br/>Evil dead 2013 we follow David and he starts of a wimp like ashley then he slowley becomes a hero. To be killed off and were forced to then follow a character who we do not sympathize at all with after the first 10 minutes of the film when she is the first character to be possessed? Its dumb and I do not understand that choice. This is why this should have been called the cabin and not the evil dead."

","Pros:
1. Jane Levy (Mia) gives an amazingly bone-chilling performance.
2. There is a minimum reliance on CGI, and the CGI that is implemented is done so appropriately and to really good effect.
3. The gore is well-designed, brutal, and unforgiving.
4. The dark and dull colour palette helps to reinforce the tense and foreboding atmosphere.
5. Abomination Mia (Randal Wilson) is on the receiving end of an extremely satisfying death.<br/><br/>Cons:
1. The acting, for the most part, during the first half of the film is really wooden.
2. The dialogue is really clunky and forced, especially when the character of Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) delivers the exposition.
3. The score is often incredibly overbearing and annoying.
4. Some moments of horror are unintentionally funny as they are presented in a cartoonish manner.
5. A couple of the characters, unsurprisingly with these types of horror, make moronic character decisions to prolong the horror.
6. The last 10 minutes are almost entirely unnecessary."

","I'll say up front I was not expecting it to be such a gore fest. I should've known by the original but I guess I figured the original was so overly campy that a remake would be a little less so. I was wrong. Lots of cringeworthy gore in this flick. I'll also say I am not a gore fan but I won't rate the film based on that because if you happen to like gore, you'll love it.<br/><br/>I'm glad they stuck mostly to the original. The few things they changed I think improved the story. For instance, instead of a few friends meeting up at he family cabin to get wasted, which is tired and played out, they are there to help a friend get sober. It's a welcome change from the norm. I also like all the hat tipping they did to the original film. The fast zooming through the forest, the necklace, incorporating the original actors in some way. I won't go through them all but it's nice they kept one foot in 1981. But speaking of including stuff from the original....<br/><br/>Something I did not like was not including the famous ""were gonna get you"" scene from the trailer, especially since it's the most memorable part of the original film. I was looking forward to it the whole movie but they if never happened. Disappointing<br/><br/>The acting was okay. I liked mias character. She seemed genuine in her acting.

","""Evil Dead"" is a 2013 horror film directed by Fede Alvarez starring Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez. Given the current global pandemic and the recommended measure to avoid human contact I thought it was time to check out a film about a group of friends who practice social distancing. Or kind of. They might summon the most evil forces of ancient magic, but therefore don't contract a dangerous virus. Alright, let's put the jokes aside. The people who know me also know that I consider the original Sam Raimi flick as one of the greatest horror films of all time and even adore the sequels, just for it's sheer amount pioneering filmmaking and groundbreaking kind of horror it deals with. It's always an absolute pleasure to rewatch it over and over again and it always amazes as if I was watching it for the very first time again. Reading the previous sentences probably gave you a small glimpse of my endless love for this low budget movie and probably leaves you thinking ""Oh, what's his opinion on this heavily discussed remake then?"". Before watching it, I also wondered what it would turn out like. Surprisingly, it's not even as horrendous as I thought. At least in terms of quality, I mean. What mostly surprised me in a positive way is how the film elaborated a whole new premise that at the same time honours the original flick tremendously. The reinterpretation now deals with a group of friends who try to help their mutual friend to get off drugs and become clean again. The location and general story remain the same, but there's a whole new character constellation that has rough edges and unresolved conflicts that slowly begin to uncover. Except for Natalie each and everyone is at least explored a little and plays a more or less significant role in this story, but the main focus lies on the bond between the siblings Mia and David who still haven't fully recovered from a shared family tragedy. It might not sound like much, but it's so pleasant to see protagonists with personalities and values they believe in. Makes it so much easier to care about them in the process. At least does this count for the two siblings. The others are pushed back in the background too much in the process, but considering that it was sorta predictable makes it tolerable in some way. Furthermore, the premise makes the character development more convincing, as they only slowly begin to believe that what is happening to Mia isn't only hallucinations resulting from her drug abuse. Gives it more of a realistic touch to it, you know? Makes it only credible that they firstly try to explain things reasonably before accepting that sinister forces haunt them. Next to this, the story changed its primary focus tremendously. That's probably the only issue I have with this film. While the original packed me on a deep level and is an atmospheric thrill from the moment on the Ash's car arrives at the cabin, the remake obviously concentrates on the effects and disregards to elaborate the feeling of massive threat. I don't want to say that I wasn't scared at all, but I was missing the infamous atmosphere that made the original so outstanding. Thus I was less terrified than I originally expected. Therefore it has shown that's it's an absolutely brutal splatter instead.
Oh boy, those effects were definitely bloody and absolutely gruesome. Most of them had me exclaim some words that are too inappropriate to mention here, but believe, it was so realistic it felt like I was experiencing it myself. What also attracted my interest was to see that this film is obviously a major influence for ""Resident Evil 7"", practically even more than the original flick. I love this game, just saying. The film might offer some corny lines of dialogue, but fortunately offered enough surprising twists to let me ignore them. In the original it was clear after the first incident that Ashley would survive, but seeing that Mia would be the lone survivor after previously having been possessed was a decent twist. To be honest, Jane Levy's performance is the secret highlight of this film, as she literally shows her whole emotional range. And yes, it's also mentionable that she absolutely nailed to convey the feeling of terror only with her facial expressions, especially her eyes. The story goes on with another few pleasant surprises and some welcome homages to the Raimi films and in the end even unfolds the maximum of gore horror that was absolutely stunning to witness. Another surprise I totally didn't expect was that everything even worked as one big metaphor for drug addiction, coming down from it and facing one's demons. Mia walking towards the sunrise after leaving all behind, simply appeased the poet in me. All in all, this is a well made readaptation of a beloved classic that manages to successfully create something on its own and at the same time honours its source material. It's an absolutely gory experience with a few new aspects that result from a different but not terrible approach to become the one infamously grotesque film of its respective generation. Considering that it's heavily cut in mainstream stores and rarely available as an uncut version, makes me think that it has more or less reached its goal. It's far away from being the original film, but I'm bold enough to say that it at least deserves to be called ... groovy! I mean, Ash approves in the end, why wouldn't I?"

","The original Evil Dead (1981) is to this day one of the scariest demonic possession horror movies I have ever seen it gave me nightmares as a teenager and now as an adult really made me appreciate just how unique the movie was and still is almost 40 years later with great makeup and practical effects that you just don't get in horror movies today so when I heard Evil Dead was getting a remake I went to see it on day one and honestly I was a little disappointed by it.<br/><br/>The movie follows a girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who has come to her family cabin in the woods with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) his girlfriend and her best friends as she attempts to go cold turkey and beat her addiction to Heroin when they arrive at the cabin they discover that someone has broken in and trashed the place and they discover a room in the basement full of dead cats and ritual items mainly a book titled the book of the dead a passage is read from the book awakening a demon within the woods Mia begins to go crazy hearing voices and steals the groups car but crashes it into a nearby swamp where she is chased by the demon she is then possessed and begins harming herself and the others as one by one they each get taken over by the demon and attack each other aswell as harming themselves by severing limbs cutting themselves and even burning there own skin with hot water now they must try and survive the night and kill the possessed each other.<br/><br/>I recently rewatched the movie on Blu Ray and honestly it isn't a bad movie by any means in a lot of ways it's actually pretty good especially when compared to most horror movie remakes like Friday the 13th and Halloween if you forget it's meant to be an Evil Dead remake then actually it's pretty enjoyable but if you try and compare it to the original it's just not gunna meet your expectations.<br/><br/>The makeup effects are pretty good and there is an absolute ton of blood used throughout the movie especially in the movies decapitation scenes and climax but sadly most of the gore is CGI based which let's it down a little but it's to be expected in modern day horror movies.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to any horror movie fan especially if you enjoy movies heavy on the gore and doesn't go overboard with it's jump scares if you have never seen the original Evil Dead (1981) then I highly recommend watching that first as it is a far better movie but in the case of this remake just enjoy it for what it is an hour and a half of gore and screams."

","Probably the least interesting thing in this film is the cast of characters, who are basically just there to be put through the wringer then killed. The performances are fine, but it's the dialogue the characters are given that lets them down, because it often feels forced or melodramatic - sometimes the dialogue is deliberately perverse or profane, Ã  la ""The Exorcist"" (1973), but it's more silly here than shocking.<br/><br/>The premise that Mia has come to the cabin to go cold turkey is a decent justification, but then no justification is given for why Eric reads ancient text from a book wrapped in barbed wire that he finds in a basement full of dead cats. Nevertheless, it allows for some awesome, over-the-top horror set-pieces, including self-inflicted mutilations and amputations, brutalisation, and chainsaws through the skull.<br/><br/>And these horror scenes look great - there's awesome makeup and prosthetic work, and when the blood really comes it's just magical. The cinematography is lovely with both fixed and moving shots, though some of it feels like it's trying to imitate the original ""The Evil Dead"" (1981), particularly the handheld quick-cut stuff. The score is okay but generic, but it's the sound design that annoys me - it's mostly pretty good, but the unnecessary inclusion of a ghost girl in the film means there are at least three occasions where the audio will completely drop out for a couple of seconds (good use of silence), only to be followed by an obnoxious demon scream (cheap and lazy).<br/><br/>Really this film is about the spectacle of absolute carnage, and while I appreciate the attempts at emotional hooks and arcs, they really do just fade into the background when people start puking blood and tearing off their own limbs. In other words, it's just good fun.<br/><br/>7/10."

4) There was also a high amount of camp value to the original film series. This one eliminates all the humor. Seriously, where is the hand running around giving people the finger as in the ED 2? I think the whole movie gave the viewers the finger.<br/><br/>If you have seen the original, you can wait to watch this as a rental. This won't make my collection as did the faux skin covered DVD.

The effects are admirable. You can tell they didn't use computer generated effects by the quality. I'm not a gore fan in horror films because they usually substitute the story for the gore, but this wasn't the case here. While I didn't laugh as much as I did with the original Evil Dead films, this was still one of the funnest theater experiences I've had in a while. <br/><br/>You already know if this film is up your alley or not by the trailers, so critics are irrelevant in this case. A lot of love was put into this re-imagining by Raimi and the promising director Alvarez. The female lead was also wonderful and, as far as lead females in horror go, could potentially become iconic. She absolutely steals the show with some very memorable scenes and a face made to show fear.

","This movie is actually really good as an homage/sort-of remake, though in all honesty it could be a sequel to the original trilogy; it's less a remake than a re-imagining/retelling. Instead of redoing the entire story we've already seen with the same old characters, this film opted instead to tell a new, different story that follows the same basic plot while doing things a bit differently. This is certainly for the best; any attempt to replace Ash with a new, non-Bruce Campbell actor would have been a fatal error on the part of those involved .<br/><br/>In this story, David has come to a getaway with his girlfriend to meet some old friends of his and his sister Mia, who the group is attempting to get off of drugs. Things take a turn for the worse when one of them finds the Necronomicon and reads aloud from it, calling forth the forces of hell.<br/><br/>This movie does a good enough job at telling the same basic story as the original Evil Dead, and even throws in a bit of Evil Dead 2 to the mix. They pay tribute to the chainsaw, the severing of the hand, the POV force of evil, the Oldsmobile, even the tree rape! Still, it doesn't do everything exactly the same; the detoxing of Mia is actually done really well and realistically, and adds a dash of realism to this story. <br/><br/>The acting isn't awful, but it's not really amazing either; still, it's better than most modern 'horror' films. The amount of gore is what you'd expect from a modern horror film, though in all honesty it's just as over-the-top with its gore as the original films. <br/><br/>Of course, there are two problems with this film, and they're kind of big: The first is that the Necronomicon is never explained at all, or even named on-screen. Its origin is only implied, and it's implied it's the same as in the original trilogy, but you wouldn't know that unless you have watched them. This is a bit annoying if you aren't a long time fan. <br/><br/>The other problem is how the deadites are summoned: One of the group reads aloud from the Necronomicon, despite multiple warning notes written in blood inside the book, which he sees. In the originals, they had an excuse, as there was no way of knowing that the tape recording they listened too would summon evil. There's no excuse here, just plain and simple idiocy.<br/><br/>Still, it's hard to fault this movie when it's such a good tribute. It probably would have ended up a lot worse without Campbell and Raimi's involvement. Overall, it's a very good movie and one of the best re- imaginings out there if you give it a chance. Still, it's even better if you think of it as a stealth sequel to the original, and that soon we'll get a movie where Ash and this movie's hero team up to destroy the Necronomicon once and for all.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a solid standalone film, and certainly one of the better horror films to come out in a long time. It's best to go in not looking at it as a remake; you'll find a lot more to enjoy that way."
"EmperorPalpy","7","18","79","5 April 2013"," A fine homage
","For a remake of a classic horror film, the ""Evil Dead"" of 2013 does many things right. It has its missteps, yes, but through the vast catalog of recently produced, generic horror remakes, this one is indeed handled with care.<br/><br/>The franchise creators, Sam Raimi, Rob Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, all step in to create a ""fresh"" take on the series. They brought along Fede Alvarez and put him in the directors chair. Wise choice? I'd say so. Fede is easily a talented director, but where he somewhat lacks in character development, he gains in style and finesse.<br/><br/>The film looks great. I can't imagine anyone disowning the movie for its poor photography, production design, or practical effects. On many levels, it excels upon the original... but these are different times. Whereas the original ""Evil Dead"" directed by Sam Raimi had a strong cast of likable characters, the remake becomes slightly hit or miss. All there is to say is that Jane Levy shines. Once the narrative of Mia comes into play, the film truly starts.<br/><br/>Granted it doesn't live up to the cult status of the original, it still carves its own path by attempting to pull off a completely different experience, which it is. You can compare them, but they are really completely different films, and I love it for that alone. Consider every horror remake you've seen that had no originality... complete copy and paste of the original. This does not fit that criteria. This hopes to bring a new ""Evil Dead"" to the table.<br/><br/>And on one last note... the musical score in this movie is brilliant. Without it, I wouldn't find it as intense or thrilling as it is."
"movieman016","8","7","24","10 April 2013"," Movieman Review
","Recently saw the new Evil Dead and for a short and sweet review, in my opinion, it was pretty good. <br/><br/>PROS: The gore (which is one of the main reasons for the remake, higher budget, more money to gross us out) Same eerie feeling from the first one. Different take. Didn't follow the original story line but yet didn't stray to far away.<br/><br/>CONS: Acting was sh**ty No development of characters so you really didn't feel anything when they got hacked up. More plot holes then the road that led to the cabin. <br/><br/>Overall, the good out weighed the bad. It was a movie that could have done so much more, but yet still made me feel satisfied when I left the theater. 8/10"
"PoisonKeyblade","10","22","103","4 April 2013"," Perfect in every way
","Evil Dead, simply put, is a new horror classic. It's a remake of the memorable 80's time capsule The Evil Dead (a film which has actually aged quite splendidly thanks to some impeccable filmmaking), but this new film is a creature all by itself. Directed by Fede Alvarez and featuring very little CGI (if any), Evil Dead is the horror movie by which all modern horror films should will be looking up to years down the road.<br/><br/>The most immediately distinguishing and intriguing characteristic about this new Evil Dead is how polished and neat the storyline is able to flow. These aren't just some people coming to hole themselves up in a cabin for awhile with no particular rhyme or reason other than that they just want to have a good time. David (Shiloh Fernandez) comes to the cabin to help kick his sister (Jane Levy) Mia's drug addiction with some of her closest friends, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore). Her addiction is becoming a downward spiral and negatively affecting everyone around her. As a last effort, the group decides the best way to get Mia back to normal is to hole her up in the family cabin and not let her leave. <br/><br/>The movie takes its time to let us know the characters before bad things start going down, even though the opening scene kicks things off pretty deliciously as it marks the audience's first introduction to a deadite. From there, things don't kick into overdrive until Eric starts playing around with the flesh-covered book they recover in the basement. After this, really bad things start happening rapidly that lead to blood. Lots and lots of blood. To discuss what happens in further detail would be to divulge entirely too much information.<br/><br/>The directing is slick and stunning with some phenomenal camera-work and shots that rival anything you will find in the original movie. To compare Evil Dead to the original is unfair, though, because the original movie is a product of its time and the best possible movie it could have been at that time. Evil Dead is polished, precise, perfect down to the last scene of the movie which will stick with you long after the credits have rolled. The cast couldn't have been better, either, with Shiloh Fernandez and Jane Levy especially standing out as the brother and sister duo. Each of the five main roles contributes something significant to the flick and there isn't a single player involved that the movie could have done without. The new design of the Book of the Dead is flawless and creepy: while it might not be a face like the original, the skin on the cover and the pages within are still effectively chilling.<br/><br/>If you are a horror fan in any fashion, Evil Dead is the must-see movie of the year. At this point, I'd be shocked if any other horror movie this year comes close to matching the brilliance, brutality, and spectacle that is developed over the course of 91 minutes of terror. Evil Dead is a modern horror classic that you have to see to believe. Bring on the sequel!"
"david-tsbernardino","7","6","20","24 June 2013"," True and wonderful tribute to B movie slashers
","Evil Dead remake, by same producer Bruce Campbell as the 1981 original, succeeds in capturing the feel from old horror B movies! The first segments of the movie are still believable, but soon enough we find a blood bathed B movie flick that leaves to your consideration to hate it or to love it. It's really up to the viewers to decide if they like this kind of movie: completely unreal and sometimes laughable, but THAT is the true essence of it! Applause for almost no CGI usage, just as in the original flick, and the old school techniques for special effects (make-up, etc). Highly entertaining, if you are willing to accept this genre, this is a true and wonderful tribute to the B movie slashers that were so popular back in the 70's and 80's, and should be enjoyed accordingly to that feel. Evil Dead is not to be taken seriously and is laughingly entertaining. Very good!"
"admarple","7","6","20","12 April 2013"," Effects? Check. Required elements? Check. Characters? ...
","Evil Dead is just one of those movies that can't be reproduced. Playing it with the same tone as the original is only possible with an artificially low budget, and audiences would simply guffaw at the attempts to reproduce a delightfully twisted B-movie. Playing it as a true horror movie is the only apparent option, and that leaves you with droves of viewers complaining about a film that has 'none of the charm that made the original film memorable.'<br/><br/>So when tasked with directing Evil Dead, what do you do? Well, you're probably going to play it pretty straight and gritty as a horror movie. But what do you need to do to make it work? I'd say there are three things you need: (1) practical visual effects, (2) opaque homage, and (3) refreshed characters.<br/><br/>(1) was a success. We've got a single scene with some CGI-looking splash as a car crosses a creek, but beyond that the visual effects are spot on. There are the gory and over-the-top moments, but there are also little things that are creepy or cringe-worthy, but it all looks like it was actually captured on film. For a film with so much shock value, I was actually surprised at how well tension was maintained throughout the film, and how the threat of pending violence was just as important as the bloodbath that had already occurred.<br/><br/>(2) was done pretty well, too. We know the premise for Evil Dead: twenty-somethings spend the night in a cabin, find a book that wakes a demon, and are gradually possessed and dismembered. Someone will lose a hand, the way home will disappear, there's a chainsaw, a fruit cellar, and a creeping forest. Evil Dead keeps those elements intact, but it keeps the plot from being transparent to anyone who's seen the original. It stops and starts, it moves elements around, it plays with the audience's expectations .<br/><br/>(3) is were this movie struggles. Casting a Bruce Campbell-like lead doesn't fit here, so we've got five average-Joe characters instead. Unfortunately, none of them are particularly interesting, and all but one of them are played hammily. I thought the drug addiction was a nice idea, and I appreciated how it played into the first third of the film. Unfortunately, it took a backseat to demonic possession, and we never got to see Mia struggling with both addiction and hellspawn. I suppose having 5 uninteresting characters does have one benefit. Rather than getting attached to a single protagonist, we start wishing for everyone to be possessed so they can wreak new and interesting havoc on the others. It's a slight positive, but it still doesn't make up for the lack of any solid performances.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie, but I enjoyed it on a pretty base level. The production and tone were enough to make it good, the ideas incorporated were enough to plant seeds of potential greatness, but the lack of any worthwhile characters keeps this in the B-movie range for me."
"Melvin-soderlund","7","6","20","10 April 2013"," Drug Addiction and The Evil Dead
","Where to start? My opinion, I suppose. The movie was good. I really did enjoy it on the surface, and really liked the subtext of the film. It retained a level of cheese that is consistent with the original film. And of course about as much blood as anyone could care to see in a movie. But why remake The Evil Dead? What is this film trying to tell us? That drug addiction and rehabilitation is a bitch! The main characters names are David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, and Natalie. If you turn these names into an acronym it can form an anagram to spell DEMON. M' Mia is at the middle of it all. We are told that the reason for coming to the cabin is to get Mia through the early stages of withdrawal. Mia throws the last of her drugs down a WELL so she can get WELL. The girl that she sees while being raped by the trees is herself. Im not sure if it's the same actress or not, but they do resemble one another. This resemblance is her addiction which she ultimately conquers and defeats at the end of the movie. There is a marijuana leaf on the wall between David and Mia during the bedroom scene when Mia says whatever was in the woods is here with them. We are told that her drug use medically killed her and she needed a defibrillator to resuscitate her back to life. This is also mirrored at the end of the movie. The syringes attached to the apparatus are apparently associated with heroine. Her necklace i.e. her will is broken and can be seen lying on the ground in the shape of a skull towards the end of the movie. After she is revived from death she uses her will to defeat her addiction. Many injuries are associated with habitual drug use. Natalie's arm rots to the point of amputation. Common with prolong heroine use. Olivia cuts her mouth and jaw with broken glass. Chewing tobacco contains fiberglass and causes mouth cancer. Eric gets stabbed in the eye with a syringe. Again the syringe could be a nod to heroine use. Could also be a reference to Mia's vow to stop using. Cross my heart and hope to die, stick a needle in my eye. This is definitely a movie I'll be seeing again. The blood, gore, and cheese that I love about the classic is abundant in this re-imagined nightmare. And I can't wait to decipher more subliminal messages that have to do with the subtext of substance abuse and recovery. See the movie!"

The setting and atmosphere were very creepy, but it's not 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' A group of friends are meeting up at a cabin to help Mia quit her drug problem, cold turkey. When Eric reads from the Necronomicon (in this film, it's called Naturom Demonto) all hell breaks loose, unleashing demons to possess the souls of the group.

","Evil Dead (2013)  I'm not a big fan of horror films this days because mostly of them are  really bad, but I have to admit that this one is good and very  entertaining. The effects are really good, the performances are OK, but  what I like the most is the plot and the way they present it to us,  because it has a purpose, is not only a group of kids doing nothing in  a forest, is not scary but is defiantly DISGUSTING, if you don't have a  strong stomach don't watch it, because this film is in another level of  nasty and gross. Is not only ugly is also funny but not in a pathetic  way it's in a sarcastic way, of course people that don't believe in  this kind of ""satanic"" things are going to find some ""silly"" parts. I  loved the end, I wasn't expecting that at all because is always the  stupid girl crying but this time we have a ""bitch"" with attitude so I  enjoyed the film. BTW the movie is about a group of friends that go to  an old forest house (they own the place) to try to help one of the  girls that is a drug addict but long time ago some people made a  ""ritual thing"" there so they found a book and the curios one open it  and set free a evil spirit. This movie is a remake of Evil Dead from  1981."

I can't believe the reviews, that I am reading here. This is one of the best horror movies. An instant classic just for the gore. This just reminds me of how good ""The Dawn of the Dead"" 2004 remake was good. These people rating it low, and saying they are horror fans, and complaining are the PG-13 wanna be horror fans.<br/><br/>True horror fans are the rated R or Unrated movie watchers. If they can't handle it, then stay in the PG-13 groups that will never be true horror fans. I saw the viewing of the first in theater last night, and there were so many clapping and laughing at the over the top gore, and that is great. I am mind boggled at the stupidity of people tearing this masterpiece apart just for the heck of it, and also other masterpieces, and giving the crappy PG-13 ones better ratings.<br/><br/>Learn the rules of horror, and PG-13 is not the rule of horror. Directors that do PG-13 for horror, just can't think of anything good to make the fans excited. I recommend this movie to everyone that is the true horror fans, not the fake wanna be crappy PG-13 fans that are lame, and make up excuses to not see it, because of the gore."
"enjoiskaterguy","8","6","21","23 April 2013"," A Clever and Relentless Bloodbath of a Remake with a Dominating Female Lead
","In his full length feature directorial debut Fede Alverez, this film Evil Dead starring Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore, was the film that Sam Raimi set out to originally make. And this remake came out swinging. And this remake came out swinging. Produced and given the blessing by the creators of the original trilogy, Bruce Campbell, Rob Tapert, and man himself, Sam Raimi, this remake was indeed on the road to success.<br/><br/>The story stays relatively consistent to the original. A group of friends go up to a cabin, discover an evil book, and evil is awoken, only to reek havoc on the souls on the young bunch. But what separates this movie from the original is that this isn't a generic cabin in the woods, college party turned wrong movie. Many claim this movie lacks depth but what they fail to realize is that this is a remake of one of the first cabin-in-the-woods horror films. The main character Mia, played by the amazingly talented Jane Levy embarks on this trip to finally rid herself of heroin addiction and is accompanied by her brother and close friends to beat it once and for all. Might this 'Evil Dead' just be a metaphor for Mia's never-ending quench for Opiates? This level of depth was a welcomed addition to the remake and adds character development as the story progresses. As Fede Alverez first film the movie acts decently balanced. It keeps consistent with the story, plot holes are filled, the pace is okay, and the dialog is decent but nothing special.<br/><br/>The acting was, in comparison to the original, more evolved and surely fulfilled the expectations set by A-class movies. Jan Levy, the star of this film, dominates her dialog, executing line after line with sheer fright and is convincing the whole way through. I consider the move to have a female lead an absolute spark of genius . Audiences want more Female leads who can command the screen. Actresses like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens, Carrie Fisher in Star Wars and Linda Hamilton of Terminator 2. And Levy blew it out of the water. Veteran actress Jessica Lucas was also quite good. Although she didn't get the same amount of screen time as Jane Levy, she is just as good and is a welcomed addition to the Ladies of the Evil Dead. The third female character Natalie, played by Elizabeth Blackmore is mainly pure cannon-fodder. Her only purpose in this film is to be subject to the evil that lurks within the woods. I have a feeling that she was wrote in latter in the script merely to spread the carnage out throughout the actors. She does do well in some parts later on in the film, but overall she wasn't a very interesting or developed character. This is what holds the movie from achieving success. The audience needs to care about the characters and this only fueled the fire of making an unreliable film. The boys in the film aren't that much better. The brother of Mia, played by Shiloh Fernandez had his head so far up his rear-end that he couldn't focus on the acting. I think the idea that he was playing a major role in a big production film got the best of him and instead of taking charge and really understanding his role, he focused more on what his hair looked like before every shot. The last of the main characters, Eric acted by Lou Taylor Pucci only barely shines. His delivery is okay, he seems believable but the lack of screen time and character development just pronounces him as target practice for the deadites early on.<br/><br/>What shines in this remake is the fact that the Director and producers wanted to make it clear that NO CGI was used in this film. This is something everyone should have known going in to see this film because most people just assume everything is CGI today. ""Computers did not dare try to recreate the horror that your eyes will see"" should have been their tag line. On the Evil Dead's IMDb crew page, there is no listing for animators, 3d modelers, or 3d texture artists, but there are about a dozen ""visual effects artist"" which is quite ambiguous, but i will take the word of director Fede Alverez and original creator Bruce Campbell that there was none...Rob Tapert has hinted though that this is not entirely true during a screening of the film back in March(probably referring to the beginning scene). The film's attempt to create the ""Most terrifying film you will ever see"" will intrigue most, and when you understand that all the shots are essentially done with practical effects and a reported 100,000 gallons of fake blood was used to recreate this movie., the scenes then seem that much more gross and indeed terrifying.<br/><br/>What is also worth mentioning is the directors style. The cinematography and camera work itch closely to that of Sam Raimi but with a less jerky roller-coaster ride. The lighting, atmosphere, and color palette is quite something. Alverez shows that he is in it to win it. The film also has quite the number of nods to the original and films like the Exorcist. It acts very much like a throwback.<br/><br/>It ends with a revving climax, resulting in activating the gag reflexes in the audience and screams of joy from fans of the series. I have learned that if you go into a theater or watch a movie with a certain expectations then you will be most disappointed. But if you take it for what it is then your outcome will be that much more rewarding. This remake stands on its own as not only a successful addition to the series, but a decent remake worthy of recognition.<br/><br/>...and remember to stay till after the credits for a special treat."
"jdearvil","7","4","12","23 July 2013"," What are you expecting?
","That's the question to ask before you see this. Are you expecting a carbon copy of the original? If so, then why bother? Just watch the original. And all these reviewers dying to see Ash...Ash didn't come in to his own until parts 2 (a remake in itself) and part 3 (a movie even Bruce admitted he didn't like). So if you're expecting a bad ass, one handed chainsaw wielding Ash, then you'll be disappointed. <br/><br/>However, if you want an original horror movie based on material created by Sam Rami, but not the exact same movie, then you're in luck. Because if you're anything like me, all I expected from this movie is blood, gore, cheesy acting, and more blood...and thats it! And it delivered. Do you honestly think when Sam and Bruce made The Evil Dead they were worried about bad acting, too much blood, or any of the other crap that people here are slamming them for? No, and if all you are wanting is a copy of the original, i say again, just watch the original. <br/><br/>Oh,and for the DB's that say there's no homage the original until the credits, how about the car in the first few minutes? Yes I know its not the same one Sams dad bought, but its meant to look like it. That's an homage dude. And only one of about 20 I saw the first time I watched it. <br/><br/>Bottom line...good movie, worth the time, as long as you're not a pertinacious DB"

I only watched this film, and I am sure other fans watched it for the same reasons, because the original filmmaker, Sam Raimi, and the original star, Bruce Campbell, gave it their blessings by signing on as producers.<br/><br/>This remake has a better budget, better effects, a better plot, and, arguably, a better cast. This didn't add up to a better movie. I was enthralled by the original movie because I was shocked by it.

"arran_armitage","7","3","8","23 August 2013"," An interesting twist to the demonic theme.
","Compared to the original Evil Dead film made in 1981, this remake has much more twists and turns, making it a film full of high-tension. As well as the characters having actual back stories, causing the audience to feel a large connection to the saddened characters. Though being very different from the original, the change in characters and script is done in not a disappointing way; though in a way that leaves you not knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>In my personal opinion, the remake is better than the original. I found that the original was a little too unrealistic and frankly the characters died because of their own stupid actions (like wondering off into a forest in the middle of the night). However in this new addition to the Evil Dead franchise, the characters are put in situations that they didn't put themselves in, making you feel large amounts of sorrow and leaves you wishing you could have helped them in some way.<br/><br/>Now, I feel like I should leave a warning here... If you don't like gore, stay away from this film. I personally love gore, but only when it's done in a clever way. This is why I liked Evil Dead (2013). And lets not forget the fantastic acting from Jane Levy. If it weren't for her, a majority of the scenes would have been far less intense. She brought total terror to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this film a 7/10. Not the best horror film ever made, but still done in a genius way. I say give this film a go."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","7","3","8","13 August 2013"," Re-birth of the horror genre
","I reviewed the original Evil dead movie a couple of months ago saying it defined the horror genre in its essence. I had no real expectation that the remake would do the same, only this time, it re-defined the genre.<br/><br/>The story. Actually, an interesting element of the entire movie. It actually has a story. Something deeper and more meaningful that the original. Even though it is not very complex and multi layered it gives the movie another dimension, something more than being just a meaningless horror flick. The ""cold turkey"" element is the one I am talking about. It almost gives one a chance to see the events and perceive them from a different point of view - a medically provable point of view. Furthermore, the movie itself is divided into three parts. The first part is a bit fuzzy and not really well connected but one can neglect that if not a lot of attention is paid. The first sequence remains a bit of a mystery, and only the people who saw the original Evil dead will know what that was all about. Now, if targeting new audiences and introducing the evil dead franchise to a new generation, this could/should have been better explored through the movie. The second half is the gory one. I have never seen anything like this in my life. It is more disturbing than it is ugly or bloody (and believe me it's bloody), so the actual emotion is not disgust, but terror. The O-my-God-what-is-about-to-happen-now kind of terror. And when you see what happens you simply can't believe what you just saw. It does hold you on the edge of your seat and it gets the job done - it terrifies you to the bone. But, the real masterpiece is the third part. Not the longest one, not the goriest one, but surely the most entertaining one. All that was missing was the iconic Slayer song/album playing in the background.<br/><br/>The music. Interestingly, it followed the original recipe: keep it simple. The music fits perfectly into the sequences, it literally grinds you from the inside while you are witnessing the horror on the screen, but the most fascinating part was the siren. It was used a few times, and every time the timing was perfect. It was like an injection of panic and adrenalin straight into your heart, and the emotion it creates is indescribable. The atmosphere is what made the original a cult classic, and the atmosphere is what makes this remake so good. Of course, the music contributed to that, in my opinion, more than everything else.<br/><br/>The gore. This movie is full of it. Especially in the second part. The thing is, a single Tarantino movie has more blood and gore in 30 min than this movie has in total, but the claustrophobic space the characters are in and the amount of time that passes in between two bloody sequences is so short one has a feeling it is the bloodiest movie ever made. So, if you can look pass the gory part you will understand what makes this movie so horrific/terrific. But the gory elements will satisfy even the most hardcore slasher movie fans.<br/><br/>The acting. Really nothing to say here. Absolutely clichéd characters with one that stands out - Jane Levy. She has a nice future ahead of her if she continues like this. No landmark or iconic roles in this movie, but still, they get the job done.<br/><br/>Overall, is Evil dead the most terrifying movie you will ever experience? Actually, yes. The experience is like no other movie you will ever see of this type (except for the original movie). It scares you to the bone by using clichéd elements in a way you haven't seen so far, dare I say, that you will never see again. It follows the original concept, but is enhanced by the effects available today. If Sam Rami made The Evil Dead in 2013 instead of 1981, this would be what it would have looked like.<br/><br/>This remake should be a warning to all horror writers and directors that this is what horror movies should look like. As the original film defined the horror genre by using elements that were later on segregated into different sub genres (possesion, slasher, psychological etc.), the remake redefines it, showing the world it can still be scared in the way Sam Rami once intended - Evil dead scared."

Evil dead has more mind bending, freaky, scary as hell shots with just enough gore to make it seem so freaking real. It takes a lot to creep me out and make me jump...Evil Dead had me actually frightened. I saw the original Evil Dead and it was awesome but this one blows it out of the water. I have seen hundreds of horror movies and without doubt...this one deserves an award. It kept me on edge with non-stop unexpected, bold scary scenes that just blew my mind. It had its own creativity like no other movie..it's an original for sure. If you like horror movies and want to be actually scared and not just grossed out...you have to check this one out! Hint...a little surprise if you stay until the credits are done...YOU WILL ENJOY THIS MOVIE!!"
"wiserender","8","13","59","6 April 2013"," Delivers hyper realistic horror but no comedy.
","No Spoilers are in this review, just honest opinions. Like most people who first heard about this remake I immediately checked out the IMDb to see if Sam Raimi was the Director (He is not) and if Bruce Campbell was going to give new life to the hero ""Ash"" we all know and love (No Again).<br/><br/>The Director is Fede Alvarez, a first time feature filmmaker from Uruguay who's short film Panic Attack! went viral and caught the attention of Raimi and the other producers. The hero of this version was played by Shiloh Fernandez. This actor is best known from Little Red Riding Hood and Deadgirl, the latter being a very original twist on horror.<br/><br/>In this climate of desperate cash grabs with all these remakes, reboots and spin offs I had every reason to hate this movie going into it but I was surprised. The reason for the group to go to the cabin was totally different from the original and the strongest element of the writing. If you are hoping to see an Evil Dead with the same tone as the original I'm sorry to say it is not there. The over the top gore, the creative camera work and comedic elements are absent on this trip to the cabin. What the remake does deliver on is amazingly strong cinematography and a hyper-realistic take on this story filled with practical gore effects.<br/><br/>According to IMDb Diablo Cody did a pass on the screenplay but it seems like everything from her draft was dismembered from the shooting script. This movie could have used some smart lines and more defined characters. Instead within the first 20 seconds as all the characters meet at the cabin they announce each of their jobs. What someone does for a living is a great incite into character but this was forced into the scene in an unnatural way. Diablo Cody did not get screen credit in the film so there you go.<br/><br/>Fans of the original will be happy to know that the score, the props, the camera blocking and editing will bring you back to the fond memories of Evil Dead 1 and 2. The tree attack scene was great and used reverse motion. Scenes like this and others take place at roughly the same running time as they did in the original film. For the modern horror film goers this new Evil Dead will be artfully shot and top of the line. I recommend this movie but not to people who want the fun independent over the top style of the original. Stay for the clip at the end of the credits, you'll be glad you did."

","The new hit horror film ""Evil Dead"" is a re-imagining of Sam Raimi's horror classic of the same name. You've probably heard this kind of plot before as it has been re-done over and over again. A group of teenagers head out to an old, dreary cabin in the middle of the woods to get away from the commotion of the city and help their friend overcome drug addiction. Upon arriving in the cabin, they notice a foul smell coming from the cellar. As they investigate, they find tons of animal corpses hanging from the ceiling, as well as a mysterious book full of strange writings and illustrations of satanic creatures. One of the teenagers begins to read the book despite the warnings written on the pages. He unleashes an evil force that is capable of unimaginable cruelty.<br/><br/>Bear in mind that this is an ""Evil Dead"" film, so it is pretty obvious logical thinking is thrown out of the door. I can't really say i thought this film was awful, but I really don't think it is very good. The acting is just like the rest of the film, not really bad and not really good. The film's major strong point is the outstanding special effects and the beautifully filmed shots, the visual style is beautifully haunting. It transmits the dreary tone of the film to the viewer as well as provides eye-catching visuals. Another major strength to the films is that the director, Fede Alvarez stays very faithful to the source material of the original ""Evil Dead"". He almost always uses practical effects for the gory scenes of the film as well as for the scenery. There is little to no CGI in this film, which is astounding. This made the film feel extremely brutal and at times hard to watch. The major problem with ""Evil Dead"" is that there is no character development for most of the characters, the two main characters have some character development, but the other three seem to be in the film just to be killed off later. It is also frustrating to watch the characters making completely ludicrous decisions, this is a regular problem is modern horror movies that continues to annoy the hell out of me.<br/><br/>This is a film that can be a lot of fun, but when you look at it from a logical perspective, it becomes really annoying. It's major strengths are the special effects and how faithful it is to the original. Although it is an enjoyable movie, it is full of plot holes and annoyances. I would recommend it if you are looking to have a entertaining movie experience, other than that, I can't really recommend it."
"superferb","9","6","22","13 June 2013"," Perfectly crafted shock movie
","---There shouldn't be any major spoilers in the beginning of this review, at the end there are so watch out please---<br/><br/>First of all, i just saw Raimi's original THE EVIL DEAD a couple weeks ago. I'd never realized it existed before, and only came across it because of this remake. So i watched it with a very open mind and i did really like it and could easily see why its fans have always been so passionate about it. I don't't think it is a scary film at all, though it does have some thrilling moments, especially when the deadites pack out their filthy and mean language. However, it is a very cheesy movie and it doesn't try to hide that but instead makes its trashiness a virtue.<br/><br/>Now the remake. They basically took the premise of the original and some of its best trademark moments, but other than that made a movie that is a totally different kind of thing. ED is a much, much more serious movie, and with a lesser director, a lesser DOP and lesser actors, that approach might well have resulted in a catastrophe. But ED is just plain excellent filmmaking. Everything in this movie is so exceptionally well crafted, that it just grips you, thrills you, disgusts you, and sometimes makes you cover your eyes, even if you're a hardcore horror minded, gore-resilient kind of person.<br/><br/>The cinematography is absolutely outstanding, and i honestly rate it as one of the best examples of creative, effective camera work i've ever seen. Never heard of Aaron Morton before, but he is hugely talented, always finding an intriguing spot to place the camera and very smart in how he uses light and darkness. Especially with scenes ""in the dark"", which are always hard to pull off so as to make the viewer see it without using ridiculously unrealistic lighting, his lighting is very intelligent and just works perfectly. The Closing sequence (chainsaw, blood-rain), is visually amazing.<br/><br/>Score and sound-effects are perfect. Right after the intro scene, the ""EVIL DEAD"" title is shown, accompanied by a blasting mix of sounds and instruments that will cause you a massive goosebumps attack. It goes on like this. The sounds alone are good for a couple of serious jump scares, and you hate the filmmakers for succeeding with one of the oldest and most clichéd horror film tricks, but they do pull it off... again and again. Finally, when the credits started rolling, i actually said to my friend who wanted to leave quickly ""wait a minute, i like the music here"". Yes, apart from perfect effects, the score is also very cool and just very high quality.<br/><br/>I'm not a native English speaker, but as far as i'm concerned the acting was very, very tight without a weak moment from any of the cast. This of course has also a lot to do with directing, and in this movie, you can clearly see what a difference a director makes that knows 100% what he is doing and who has a strong vision in his mind about what a shot is all about and what it is supposed to do with the audience, and what he needs from his actor to get there. The scene after the tree-rape, when Mia tries to convince her brother that there is ""something in the woods"" is real, real filmmaking art.<br/><br/>----------NOW COME THE SPOILERS!---------- One last thing: in this movie, it is actually raining blood!!!!!!<br/><br/>Again: IT RAINS BLOOD! A SOAKING WET GIRL STANDS IN FRONT OF A BURNING CABIN WHILE MILLIONS OF LITERS OF BLOOD ARE POURED OVER HER AND SHE OPERATES A CHAINSAW FROM A FORCEFUL LUNGE STANCE AND DISMEMBERS A DEMON WITH THAT FRIGGING CHAINSAW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>Wrap-up, and comment on the hate-reviews: EVIL DEAD is a great film. 9 out of 10 stars because the final demon was a little weak and could have been made harder to kill.<br/><br/>THE EVIL DEAD is also a cool movie but totally different.<br/><br/>If you wanted this remake to be exactly like the old one just with modern ""graphics"", you're probably 12 years old."
"sylarsbrain","9","6","22","21 April 2013"," My review of Evil Dead 2013 .
","A warning to all going to see Evil Dead, don't be expecting much in the way of humour if that's what you're looking for you will be sorely disappointed and I suggest digging out you're copy of Evil Dead 2 to get your fix. There are some laughs to be had In an, ultra violent demonic hybrid of You've Been Framed and Jack Ass, sort of way - things to make you go OWWWWWWW! lol One character gets bashed from wall to wall in a nod to the comedic thrashings Bruce has been know to take. This film to me resembles more the Japanese creepy ghost girl films and even the original Exorcist than the 1st E.D. but Remember haters of this version we'll always have the classic Bruce Campbell trilogy and nothing will change that! so stop your bitching and moaning 'oh they've ruined a classic' have they? It still exists! right? I for one am glad they've gone a different route with this one, people were going to gripe whether it was too similar or too different to the original, this is the movie Sam Rami, Bruce Campbell and the other fellow lol wanted to make all these years later and kcuf that's good enough for me! as for being a cash in the guys have been planning this revamp for 13 years. The Cabin and woods looked amazing and I liked the more believable (if less iconic) new look of the Book of the Dead, also Bravo for the complete use of physical effects over CGI that is a great accomplishment these days. I really liked the use of the cold turkey storyline I thought it added a great overall element and gave the others a reason not to believe the addict once demonic forces take hold and added mistrust amongst the group. Something they used from the original(s) which was put to good use was when the possessed appear normal again you sympathise with them they are confused and don't know why they are there, is it really them again or is it the demon taunting you? Could you kill your loved one when they are crying and pleading with you? What if you were the one who was possessed and suddenly someone you trust is hurting you and you have no comprehension of why? I love those mixed emotions those scenes bring and am glad they touched upon it more this time round. It's hard to pinpoint this flick as a remake or sequel it is in fact more another chapter in the Cabins history but in a way like with comic books when a new artist and writer come along and take a beloved character and put their own fresh spin on it e.g. when Todd (Spawn) McFarlane took over the marvel Spider-Man comics and brought his own unique vision to the creative table.<br/><br/>I also want to address the bad points as this film is far from flawless there is some bad continuity (necklace, healed burns), a pointless character e.g. the timid blonde g.friend (who does have some great nasty scenes tho) a little bad acting here and there and a couple of bad lines e.g. ""Feed on this...mutha f**ker"", its just had Hollywood thinking its hip chucking in a line ending with ""mutha f**ker"" lol i mean it worked for Arnie in the 80's but not here! There is a cheesy scene involving a car battery which I thought boarded on Twilight Esq (cringe!) and the movie could have definitely done with more of the classic shaky cam! Despite all these flaws I feel this is one kick Ass roller-coaster ride of a horror flick that had me grinning with anticipation all the way through and I give it 9/10 but without my little complaints above it would have easily made a perfect 10 in my eyes! Sure everybody wanted a BC cameo in the actual film but even Bruce agreed that his appearance no matter the context would add an element of cheese to an otherwise serious story. All the so called real horror fans who absolutely hated this would have probably been on the director's dick hailing him as the new king of horror had this movie not shared the same title as the 80's (far from flawless but totally awesome) classic, you can say it's not scary however it is incredibly creepy and unnerving and how exactly do you scare the modern audience who at the click of a mouse can see youths torturing others to death with screwdrivers? If people can name a mainstream American horror movie in the last 15 year with as much intensity and balls as this one, I would be surprised! Today's version might seem a product of the age of torture porn to some but it's brutality used is the modern equivalent of how Mr Rami had made his original, using every sharp tool in the place to dismember and slash! :D"
"ChipNoirD","8","6","22","14 April 2013"," Hearkens back to the golden era of Splatter
","I have this quirky habit of judging films based on what the director/writer promises, rather than marketing or any sort of standard set by a previous installment or source material. If I were as judgemental as most people are comparing Evil Dead to The Evil Dead 1/2, I don't think I'd have nearly as many series I'd enjoy. Horror has many different flavors and angles, and within even the most solid series the style can fluctuate greatly.<br/><br/>So if you're the type with hardcore standards and discerning tastes only for the most perfect films, this review will not serve your purpose. There are other films that can satisfy you in that regard. <br/><br/>What I will say is that while this film is full of more holes than fossilized swiss cheese, it didn't once stop me from enjoying it. Are the characters paper thin? Yes. Are the effects over the top? Yes. Is the plot weak: Oh hell yes.<br/><br/>But I like that about splatter films. They're films you turn your brain off for, and enjoy the over-the-top roller coaster ride of blood, guts, and 'splatter' as the genre is named for. There are few films that I can think of that go to this level of practical horror.<br/><br/>So I'm quite happy. If you're looking for something highbrow, pushing the envelope of what stabs are our hidden psyche, and questions our very humanity...Don't watch this.<br/><br/>But if you're looking for a fun Troma esq bit of gore, akin to the original Evil Dead, Braindead, or any number of low brow films, give this a shot."
"mawoo-658-619114","8","6","22","12 April 2013"," I've seen some terrible remakes, and this isn't one of them.
","Okay, so I wouldn't necessarily call this a remake, as I would a fresh view from new eyes.<br/><br/>I have to say that I'm not sure why people are giving this movie such grief. Would it have made you happier if it wasn't called Evil Dead and was just a movie that was similar to one that already existed? I have to agree that there have been some miserable remakes *cough.. Alice In Wonderland*.. but that might just be the nature of the beast.<br/><br/>On one hand if it doesn't hold true to the original, then it's a piece of Hollywood trash that's just a cashgrab on the name for greedy execs, am I right? .. but wait a minute! If it's TOO true to the original then it's a piece of trash ripoff that ""didn't have to be made""..<br/><br/>So it's a double-edged sword.<br/><br/>I agree that movies sometimes need to be remade for the sake of the creative integrity (Batman, common now) and I agree that there are crap remakes (insert Burton/Depp movie here.) But I also agree that sometimes a fresh eye can keep the fandom moving forward for new generations...<br/><br/>So anybody looking forward to some new Darkness?"
"olderwisermike","8","6","22","11 April 2013"," This movie lives up to the originals in every way.
","I have to say, honestly, this movie is one of the best horror movies I've seen. However, calling it a HORROR movie is a bit of a stretch. Maybe it's because I've seen a lot of scary stuff, that I'm desensitized by it? But to me, it's just, not that scary to me. However, the practical effects of this were pretty damn good. When Mia dragged her tongue across that exactoknife? I cringed. When Eric pulled the needle from below his eye, I did cringe! In the climax of the movie, when Mia ripped her hand off from under the truck, I CRINGED! Not only that, but it had some decent throwbacks to the originals. I can't remember them off hand, but they were clever. Oh, and spoilers to anyone who hasn't seen it, stick around after the credits for a surprise. You will not be disappointed. I give this movie 8 Chainsaw hands out of 10."
"jaguiar313","8","19","96","4 April 2013"," Remake of horror classic is a bloody, scary blast!
","The original Evil Dead is one of my all time favorite fright flicks so, I was very apprehensive about a remake. With Sam Raimi, Robert G. Tapert and even Bruce Campbell on board as producers, I hoped the material would at least be treated with respect. Now having seen this new vision of one of the all time horror classics, I can say not only was the material treated with respect but, it is one of the best horror remakes and one hell of a nasty, scary, bloody blast. The best thing is that co-writer and first time director Fede Alvarez smartly takes the basic premise and does his own thing with it. This version has heroine addict, Mia (Suburgatory's Jane Levy) being taken by big brother, David (Skateland's Shiloh Fernandez) and 3 friends to an old family cabin to try to get Mia to quit her habit cold turkey. But, someone has been in the cabin since they were last there and something gruesome has definitely gone on inside with blood stains and dozens of dead animals hanging in the cellar. Of course there is also a mysterious book and within it ominous warnings that it not be read... so, of course, someone does... and at the same time Mia is alone in the woods... uh, oh... I don't need to tell you that soon Mia is possessed by some horrible demonic entity and the gruesome blood soaked nightmare begins as the ancient evil wants to claim them all. Alvarez really crafts a strong, gruesome and scary horror of the likes we haven't seen in a while. It's vicious and nasty with top notch gore and make-up that is done the old fashioned way without any CGI. When limbs fly... and they do, it is good old fashioned prosthetics and I loved the lack of CGI when it came to the ghouls and gore. Alvarez and co-writer Rodo Sayagues (Diablo Cody was supposedly hire to work on the script but, if she was credited, I missed it.) basically give us enough elements of the original to make it recognizable as an Evil Dead flick and thus fits in with the series but, makes the flick it's own animal. And that's the way to do a remake like this. And Alvarez is the real deal who knows how to make a good old fashioned horror movie complete with suspense, tension and intensity, not to mention, plentiful scares. He also gives the film a strong atmosphere and I really liked his visual style. He gets good work from his cast too, especially leading lady Levy whose character has a few stages to go through from heroine addict to a demon possessed creature to... well, you'll have to see to find out. Shiloh Fernandez is also very good, after a lifeless performance in Red Riding Hood he shows us the actor we saw in Skateland was no fluke. The rest, Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric, Jessica Lucas as Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, do fine making their characters more then demon fodder and they are all likable enough to make us afraid for them when all hell breaks loose. The flick is not perfect but, any flaws are minor and can be overlooked due to all that is done right. Evil Dead 2013 may not be as groundbreaking as the original and only time will tell if it will be highly regard like it's predecessor but, it is a strong, visceral horror that gives equal parts suspense and scares with all the goo and gore. Maybe not quite a classic but, a film worthy of the title Evil Dead. Well done!"
"fborrego88","8","9","38","7 April 2013"," THE EVIL DEAD isn't evil and dead. Its very much ALIVE!
","Thinking I'd never see the light of day with these tanned body, lens flared remakes Micheal Bay's production company seems to be popping out these days, "" A Nightmare on Elm Street"" ""Friday The 13th"" to name a few, comes a grisly look at a motion picture classic. The Evil Dead Remake, may fool you into believing that all its characters are dumb. But... thats where it posses you! At its core, lies one of the most cynical horror films imagined in the last 5 years. Im talking, extravagant camera work by the fantastic, Aaron Morton, great performance from a young cast, and BLOOD. Although the plot is kind of thin, the intelligent script holds everything together. A infectious thriller in some parts, a grisly horror with morbid humor sprinkled on top in others, what more can you ask for!"
"creamofbeats","9","12","56","6 April 2013"," Remakes suck....but this was Excellent!!!
","As a true Evil Dead (part 1) fan, I have to admit, i walked into the theater assuming nothing could top the original. Some scenes were just foolish and not quite like the original, and certain elements were missing, like the attic door scene popping open, or the card game scene where Cheryl was floating, BUT there were many scenes that took me by surprise. I really like that this still feels like the original, but it is not (for the most part) predictable. Old school Evil Dead fans will not be able to assume what will happen next. The start/end is nothing like the original, there are a lot of added scenes...it follows the original storyline, but it doesn't. Once you can get over that aspect, I think anyone can enjoy this version as much or more than the original."
"DustinRahksi","6","13","62","5 April 2013"," Same old bland stuff.
","When I heard that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were backing this I had hope. But when it comes to remakes, you shouldn't get excited over them. I'm going to begin my ranting and raving now.<br/><br/>Brief trailer thoughts: Before I get into the movie, I want to talk about the future of horror, or should I say lack of a future. There were three horror trailers, two about home invasions, and the other was that garbage Carrie remake. Why can't we ever get good horror movies any more, you either get a gore fest or generic ghost story. I am currently creating horror stories that are miles better than anything I have seen in years, it's just sad how low horror has stooped.<br/><br/>The film: I am a fan of Raimi's three films, evil dead 2 being my favourite. I must admit this is my third favourite out of the bunch, mainly because I really didn't care for Army of Darkness. The opening scene was rather dull, you don't learn anything, it was a horrible opening. Then we meet the characters, I didn't care for any of them, Eric may have unleashed the demon, but he was the only one I liked. The movie was pretty boring until stuff started going south, once that occurred I never lost interest. The atmosphere is high at some points, but fails to remain constant. The woods are the highlight, they look great, I loved the grey tones and the rain. The only notable gore effects were when that girl cuts her arm off, that was awesome, the rest of the effects have been done before. These are the only good parts of the film. Every thing else was garbage, it seems explicit violence was all this film had to offer, to bad I don't care about that kind of stuff anymore. It's a shame this one didn't stand out much, but it is still better than most horror films. I gave this a six, I also gave Texas Chainsaw a six, I have to say I liked Texas Chainsaw better. Oh, and I should mention this film isn't even remotely scary or suspenseful, because you can already predict how the film is going to play out.<br/><br/>It's the second best horror film of the year so far, I sincerely doubt there will be anything that could knock this film or Texas Chainsaw off of their perch, so for that I say give it a watch.<br/><br/>I find it amusing how bad all of these reviews are getting trolled, it's hilarious how may thumbs down these got, mine went from a 4 out of 5 people agree, to a 4 out of 26 people people agree in the matter of a few hours, I love it, it's hilarious, keep crying."
"danster08","9","6","23","20 July 2013"," Surprisingly Good Horror Movie
","I am not sure what people were expecting from this movie. Being a huge fan of the original trilogy, I had low expectations. Yet I went into watching this film trying not to compare it too much to the original. It is, after all, a re-imagining of the original. So, yes as much as I would like to have seen Ash in this film, it really would not have done justice to have another actor try to play the part. And with it being a complete re-imagining, they could not have just had Bruce play the part.<br/><br/>I thought the film makers did a good job of creating a movie that was both new and old. It did pay homage to many aspects of the original film, but without completely copying them. Some of the characters were unmemorable and stupid at times, but that is normal in a horror movie. I think people forget they are watching a horror movie sometimes.<br/><br/>I thought it was a good choice to use actors and actresses that were not known. Usually when a film does this, it suffers from overacting or just plain bad acting. That was not the case here. Yes many of the characters were hollow and underdeveloped, but who cares in a 90 minute horror movies where you know most of them are going die anyways? The one area that I was a bit disappointed in, was the demonic faces. At times, especially in the beginning, there was a bit too much CGI. I do think it got better as the film went on. But one of the things that made the original films so great was the use of great makeup effects rather than CGI. Honestly most of it was quite well done, but occasionally you could tell it was not.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this was a great addition to the Evil Dead franchise. Perhaps not as part of the Ash trilogy, but as a stand alone tribute."

","I don't understand why everyone is hating on the movie, I'm a huge fan of the original but even I could enjoy this movie. The lack of comedy the original had was a bit of a let down but it made up for it with Raimi's gore factor he's famous for in his movies. It's also been said that this wasn't so much of a remake as somewhat of a continuance of the original. The rumor is that there is 3 more possibly to come and I look forward to seeing them also. Don't let all of these bad reviews stop you from checking it out. I stand by my opinion that this is an awesome movie without a doubt. I will be adding this movie to my collection of Raimi films, right next to my Evil Dead Trilogy. Keep it going Sam, you haven't disappointed me yet."
"tharperic","7","6","23","19 July 2013"," Oh, the moronic fanboys on this site...
","Though the movie wasn't perfect, it deserves no where near the 1/ 10 rating that most people I saw giving it recently. When I see 1/10 ratings, I either think of fanboys or people who really know nothing about rating movies (if you really want to see a movie worthy of a 1/10 rating, please rent Ax Em). I have chosen to give this movie a 7 (really a 6.7 out of 10 but I rounded up). The positives were that a lot of the kills were different from the original movie so it wasn't as similar, a different and more solid story on why they are there instead of the original, the characters have a little more depth than the original, the acting wasn't too bad, some of the gore scenes were slightly newish and not as overly cliché in most horror movies, the occurrence of the demons seem to come in play earlier than the original, and it seems the cabin's didn't change too much. Now the negatives: the blonde girl's acting wasn't really that great, the weird prophecy thing with the 5 souls really was kind of dumb, but it does kind of give more of a goal for the demons than the original's to where they only wanted to kill so it is more of a so-so criticism, not enough chainsaw, not enough effectiveness when the actors were to change to demon transformations, ending wasn't really sufficient, there was a point or two when i thought they had more of enough reasons to leave, and I felt the actors took too long for them to interfere with a demon when someone would get attack (example being the nail gun scene). Other than that, this movie deserves its rating. Please either rent or buy. It is pretty good. Not perfect or the best, but better than most people will recognize it for."

I was amazed.<br/><br/>I don't go to the movies often, but here was a film I was more than willing to pay to see.<br/><br/>Much of the negative reviews I've seen do either one, or both, of these things: Remember the original 'The Evil Dead' with their nostalgia glasses on OR remember part II and the original as one entity.<br/><br/>This movie is light years beyond the original. It hurts to say it, but it is. The acting, directing, story, and effects are all vastly superior.<br/><br/>It's not as if this film erases the original. It still exists and you can watch it whenever you want. But, if you compare the two, it's obvious this is the superior movie.<br/><br/>I, for one, loved every minute of it.

","First things first, this movie is not at all a ""remake"". A remake implies that all aspects of the original film were going to be evolved and morphed into a new film, and that is not what this film is. The character of Ash (brilliantly played by Bruce Campbell) isn't even in this movie. The original 1981 masterpiece is about 5 friends going out to an isolated cabin to party and go wild, and slowly but surely they become possessed, tortured and killed off. This film follows the story of a girl trying to shake her addiction to drugs and her four friends go along with her to help her with this difficult transition. Second, this film, unlike most horror film remakes, actually stay true to the tradition of building suspense and affection for the character before killing them off in gruesome manners. Evil Dead has everything you would expect a horror movie of 2013 to have: sex, blood and drugs. This film a tour-de-force of gore, mayhem and good times that is not to reckoned with. See it, because to those who say it isn't worth it, trust me - they're wrong!"
"sandgrenhnc","9","6","23","14 April 2013"," Great entry into the Evil Dead franchise that earns it's name
","I've been seeing a lot of user reviews on here bashing this movie, and I honestly don't understand why. For everyone calling Evil Dead a money grab and poor remake, you are way off base. <br/><br/>This is a re-imagining not a flat out remake. The director was asked by Sam Raimi himself if he wanted to be a part of it. So stop bashing it and saying that none of the original people had anything to do with it. Sam and Bruce both consulted on the film to keep it true to what an Evil Dead movie should be. <br/><br/>Now that I got that off my chest, here's the review. <br/><br/>Evil Dead whole heartedly earns it's name. It's fast paced, brutal fun for anyone who has enjoyed the other films in the series. The acting, while not the best I've ever seen, is still good enough to keep you interested. And the detox back story gives a real reason as to why they would go to the remote cabin. The special effects are top notch, and the pace is just right once the carnage starts. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, and would gladly go back to the theater for a second viewing.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the films in the Evil Dead series, you will enjoy this one as well. Just don't go in expecting to see Ash running around with his chainsaw and shotgun dropping one-liners on the undead. Go in with an open mind, and you'll be treated with a brutally good time that earns the title of Evil Dead."

","I went in to the movie with low expectations because of hearing many bad reviews. However I was quite pleased with the film. <br/><br/>The story line picked up and got exciting pretty quickly. Once the movie got going, you really couldn't relax until the very end. It was very intense, although I will say it was not as scary as anticipated. It was more suspense and gore, opposed to fear. <br/><br/>The special effects in the movie were pretty good, besides the demon voice - which made myself and the audience laugh most of the time. There was some great violence and gore; you will have yourself a good cringe.<br/><br/>I liked this movie because it kept my attention the entire time and made me laugh, cringe, and also tense up with suspense. The movie was better than I expected but still not incredible."
"magnetiko7","8","5","18","21 April 2013"," Neither terrifying nor terrible
","I'm a horror fan and I had been waiting for this film for some time trying to keep my expectations low (since the film was advertising itself as 'the most terrifying film you will ever experience' which actually meant 'it might be a good idea to check it out' to me.) So I watched the film with four friends at the cinema today and after the film I was the only one who didn't regret watching it. Although one of them said 'at least we did something different' but he was most probably referring to going to the cinema. The original film was one of the first horror films I saw as a kid and it really did terrify me then but this one was just a horror-flavoured blood bath (almost literally in some scenes) and kept me on the edge of my seat for quite a short time. Nevertheless it kept me watching and I didn't get bored. I don't think this film is underrated or overrated but generally speaking, even the best horror films are underrated. No horror film gets a 10 or even 9/10. All in all, I recommend this film only to horror fans."
"EmmaDinkins","8","5","18","11 April 2013"," Chix Chat on Film review: Scary remake no comic relief
","A remake is always a risky undertaking because it will invariably be compared to the original. In the case of Evil Dead I couldn't shake thoughts of two other films,' The Cabin in The Woods' and a short which I had the pleasure of viewing at SXSW 'Hell No', unfortunately I did not get a chance to see Evil Dead at SXSW, which was also screened, but I decided not to miss out on it. This update of the original campy horror flick was a veritable blood bath or perhaps I should say blood shower, but no matter how you slice it there was a lot of blood and gore. The reason that it brought CITW to mind was that I saw that film recently and it was somewhat patterned off the original with five young people in an isolated cabin, although there was some comic relief in Cabin. The fact that this story was played out so straight just added to the fear factor. I only buried my face in my hands once to avoid the on screen mayhem, which is pretty good considering that any film with a demonic possession theme gets a license for any nature of next level bodily harm. This group came to the cabin to assist Mia (Jane Levy) with her personal demons and decided that this was the best place to help her. Mia's brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is described as 'absent' when the going gets tough, so of course he chose this situation to step up. The group enter the cabin and find that is smells of death but still stay and then ignore every single hint and warning that could avoid unleashing evil, thus the horror is set in motion. HN came to mind as I watched every opportunity to make a sound decision quickly get passed on which makes it clear that if the characters employ good rational sense it would make for a very short horror film. The special effects used to create the gruesome slice/dice, boiled flesh, dismemberment and such, was visually too frighteningly real, again adding to the fear factor. If you have an appreciation for a great horror tale where you get to see beautiful people tortured from the inside out and the outside in then this is the film for you. I found it to be entertaining and scary. The scenes with the nail gun where graphic enough that I never want a nail gun around me again. I give it a green light."

Great gore with solid acting! To all those who rated this movie a 1 star or 2 stars, give your head a shake seriously! There is no way this movie is worth anything less then a 7! After I watched this version I quickly downloaded the original.

"smartiesbattlefield","10","14","71","5 April 2013"," My wife and I Review and critical review helpful(hopefully)
","First my wife: She hate the amount of gore in this movie and she thought there should have been more scares but she did come to terms that it did deliver pure evil and stay true to Evil Dead. 6/10<br/><br/>My Review: Loved it(Majority)! 10/10 I'm a big Evil Dead fan since the original.<br/><br/>Helpful review: <br/><br/>CONS: Okay to start off, it had a lot of gore and scenes that would really traumatized you. The scares and suspense could had more and less gore. I think that would made the movie close to a 9/10 instead of 8/10 but they still kept it to its true origins: PURE HORROR. The director wasn't great with his direction with this movie especially since he has done anything this big and I thought they should have given this task to someone that is more experiences and also true to the meaning of PURE HORROR. For example; The camera was upside down for a good minute after the intro and saw no point in the cinematography. Plus kept changing scenes from a birds-eye view. Not a good start. It would been better if they if the camera was from came from a birds-eye in the back and followed like in Evil Dead 2. The lighting(In opinion) in the dark scenes wasn't dark enough and if they made it darker, it would probably add more scare feel to it. <br/><br/>PROS: The actors were surprisingly did pretty good because you sense their fear and their pain. They also didn't do anything that would be a typical horror scenes like the old saying ""Curiosity killed the cat"".They do anything stupid like ""Where does this dark places? Oh, now I'm dead!"" It was more they had to do it or they were checking on someones well being. The plot was brought together really well and had a deeper antagonist. It made more sense to have a common trait or a thing in this decade to bring these character together and play out smoothly. antagonist was the usually but simplified to one common entity and made it easier to grasp. The book of the dead was made fantastically. The print wasn't written in blood but the details and art made up for it. The introduction really caught my attention and most of the audience. From then on I was sucked in the movie. The effects were awesome. It brought back the old horror movie effect without over killing the CGI. The effects made it feel real and mentally painful, LOL. There are many scene in this movie that will make you want to scream in acne. If you do see it you'll understand.<br/><br/>Overall: The movie stay true to horror. Plus it still stays on the lines with Evil Dead and doesn't drift off into something different or a disaster like the Carrie remake or the Fright Night remake. This movie wasn't a reboot, or remake. I can honestly say it was a fresh re-image of a cult classic horror movie. Though I a true fan of Evil Dead and horror movies. I gave this movie 10/10 only because I love it and hope horror movies come back booming to the old days with the modern times. This one of my favorites and always watch this every Halloween. Now, I anxious to get this on blu ray/ DVD combo pack. Now, If I was a critic I would give it a 7.5/10. It's worth that much.<br/><br/>PS I heard there was a Bruce Campbell cameo after the credits. I don't know if it is true but you'll find out."
"The-Stalingraduates-review","8","3","9","24 August 2013"," A great ''re-imagining'', not ''remake''
","I would like to get this out of the way in saying that this film is not a remake, its a re-imagining. it takes the basic concept of Evil Dead and uses it for its own purposes, never truly changing much, but expanding upon other parts that the original didn't and looking at other things differently whilst maintaining that core concept of Evil Dead. And boy was it fun to watch.<br/><br/>For starters, the practical effects were top notch, absolutely fantastic. The licking of the Stanley knife, the woman cutting her arm off with a electric meat knife, Mia getting her arm trapped underneath the car, the nurse Olivia ripping her face apart with a blade of glass, it all looked so good that it made me cringe and feel slightly sick, which shows that it works very well. In comparison, the small amount of CG that they did use felt quite awkward and silly compared to the practical effects, but very very little was used, so my complaints are minimal on this. <br/><br/>The characters, quite honestly, weren't all that great. the only person's name i remember is Mia, mainly because she is for the most part, the central focus of the movie, but thanks to IMDb's casting list, i now know the names. Mia's brother David, is quite useless for most of the film and is quite honestly boring for a fair majority of the movie. Eric, the guy in the glasses, i liked a bit more because he was actually trying to take action, but i spent the majority of the movie wondering when the hell he was going to finally die. He is stabbed in the shoulder with glass (which is 'repaired'' with duct tape), stabbed repeatedly in the eye with a hypodermic needle, shot at least around 30 times with a nail gun, which at one point, nails his arm to his chest. Then he is attacked with a crowbar, smashing his hand in half (which he also ''repairs'' with duct tape)and hit a couple of times over the head with the crowbar, which i thought would surely kill him. nope. He still lives until being stabbed in the stomach with the Stanley knife a little later on, where he finally decides that death is a good idea. He was one resilient b**tard. The nurse Olivia is trying to take action with Mia's drug problem, but doesn't last that long and is soon offed in a pretty nasty fashion. David's girlfriend, Natalie has about 4 or 5 lines in this movie, not really featuring to the point that i actually forgot she was there. Overall, the characters, i couldn't really care for due to the lack of development for them, but the actress who played Mia i believe did a very fine job in the movie, being the only character i could give at least a single sh*t about. The exposition in the beginning of the movie is pretty laughable as well, but i believe its just trying to move things a bit quicker, but yet somehow, the movie felt slow in quite a few places, so indeed, the pacing was a bit off in this one.<br/><br/>Now for comparison to the original, which is one of my favourite films. obviously, it doesn't hold up the original and i didn't expect it to, so it was a good choice to move away from the original and make something else with the same concept. I loved the references, the Olds 88 that Mia is sat on in the beginning, the porch swing out the front of the cabin, the evil camera view, the cutting the arm off moment, Mia losing her arm as well, the necklace, the boomstick and goddamn it the chainsaw. A big smile spread across my face when that appeared and it was not disappointing in its usage. The one reference which i have mixed feelings about is the tree scene, which they somehow make more horrifying that the original did, to which i just sat there and cringed the entire time it happened. But the one that i got most excited about was right after the credits. Ash Williams in the dark, gruffly says the word ''Groovy'' then turns to the camera and thats it, but that is all i needed to get extremely excited. The chin is returning for another round with the Deadites and i cannot wait. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun film. Different, but yet the same as the original and works pretty well. Its not really scary, but incredibly gory and is not for the faint hearted when it does get bloody. The characters,as i said, couldn't care about all that much due to lack of development beyond ''hey, I'm your brother and your my sister'' or ''we used to hang out years ago'', but what the movie did get right, it did quite well. its creepy, slightly unsettling, disturbing and i would definitely say worth the watch, especially for classic Evil Dead fans, so go see it if you haven't. Now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to go wait very eagerly for Army of Darkness 2."
"thejoshl","7","11","53","6 April 2013"," Horror filmmakers better be taking notes - this is how a remake is done folks
","This gut wrenching, blood-soaked remake pays it dues to the source material, managing to pleasantly surprise the die-hard fans of the original trilogy while establishing its own identity for newcomers to the franchise; a true homage to the 1981 cult classic. Horror filmmakers better be taking notes because this is how a remake is done folks.<br/><br/>Obviously the film differs significantly in plot from original. Consider this a ""rebirth"" rather than a ""remake"". As I'm sure you're all aware the film focuses on a young girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who takes a trip to her families old cabin for a drug intervention, bringing together old friends and her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) to help her through it. Mia's loved ones swear to each other no matter how bad things get they won't let her relapse again and it's not long before all hell breaks loose when her friend Eric uncovers the ""Book of the Dead"" and reads a passage from it. The demon quickly latches onto the first soul it can find (Mia) and then the fun begins. The set up is actually extremely clever. So when Mia starts telling stories about there being ""something"" in the woods the others all brush it off as a drug addict hallucination. The demon quickly takes over Mia and makes a promise to everyone that they are all going to die that very night. It's as much a promise to the audience as it is the cast. Next we have 60 minutes of nail guns, chainsaws, turkey cutters, mirror shards and needles all being used as you can imagine. It's the most rated R fun you'll have all year.<br/><br/>Director Fede Alvarez doesn't let us down, he makes the cast go all out doing indescribable acts of violence to one another, each actor out doing the next pushing the R rating as far as it could possibly go. He also keeps the overall tone serious which only falls short for a bit before the climactic scene. the climactic scene being the best thing I've ever seen in a horror film.<br/><br/>The actors all do a decent job with the occasional poor line delivery - which I read as intentional comedy. One thing they all manage to really do well is cry out in pain. A strange talent however I couldn't believe how much of a difference the actors made to the violent imagery. They all had very convincing performances as kids getting sliced and diced by one another. Jane Levy stands out being consistently good throughout the entirety of the film – you'll be sure to see her in other things after this.<br/><br/>The cinematography was interesting to say the least with odd lighting choices and even weirder camera angles, which at first I didn't like but it quickly grew on me. I was really glad the 'Raimi- cam' (which I just refer to as just the Demon POV shots) were back and better than ever. That being one of many throwbacks to the originals just one I thought was worth mentioning. Unfortunately the score was rather forgettable but for everything they lack in music they gain in sound design. If you're someone who closes their eyes to avoid gore you will have no luck here, the sound effects are so good you're going to have trouble not imagining what's happening on screen with such convincing noises of bone's crushing and skin peeling. The FX in general are probably this films greatest success. Going back to the old fashion way of things and using make-up/prosthetics really shows the talent in such a CGI heavy industry today.<br/><br/>The film does a great job of pleasing its targeted audience however don't go into the film expecting to be terribly frightened. It's really not a very scary film, although I never found the original very scary either so I don't see this as a negative aspect. I know there have been lots of complaints about how the film isn't scary but I was glad to see so few jumps scares in a horror flick and to be honest the idea of close friends becoming demons and torturing you to death is scary enough for me.<br/><br/>Beware though, this film is not for the faint of heart. When I say that they pushed the R rating as far as it could go I mean I don't understand how this film actually managed a theatrical release. It had everything you would see in an NC-17 film. If the idea of gore makes you uneasy, pass on this film.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a great remake to a great cult classic and I suggest anyone who is a fan of the horror genre to check it out.<br/><br/>7/10*<br/><br/>Also if you are one of the die-hard fans mentioned earlier make sure to the stay after the credits. You won't be disappointed. <br/><br/>Be sure to check out my review site: thejoshlreviews.com"
"revengeoftheshockstar","9","6","24","19 July 2013"," If all the people who hate this movie made a horror film, it would be grade-A-trash
","*I'll try to minimize any spoilers.. there will be a couple<br/><br/>Seriously just blows me away what cattle people can be. It's like they decided to say half their gripes before they even went to the theater. Seriously, it's why there are some movies I'm very picky about who I'll watch them with because it bothers the crap out of me people who can't just relax and enjoy a film and get into it. No! Instead, if they are even paying attention to the movie, they gotta sit there and try to pick out every little storyline detail and ever little edit which didn't specifically go their way or ""follow their vision"" for Sam Raimi's film. Well I got news for the later folks... It isn't your film or your vision and there is a reason why your Doritos cheesed fingers weren't there in the studio directing under Sams guidance. Especially with remakes and homages to cult classics, these elitists are just the worst sometimes. I don't understand how they sit and enjoy anything made after 1995. They probably don't.<br/><br/>As for the movie, I had high expectations, the Evil dead series being one of my favorite movies from growing up. I had to accept there would be some things different with this film with cgi and a big budget. So believe me I went in the theater with my critic hat on. Some of the CGI was a little too computer gamey for me but for the most part they made good of physical effects nicely polished off with CGI, kind of like the effects in Pandorum. I thought it was a nice touch but probably my only real gripe is that they could have done a tiny, little bit more of the realism to balance the CGI. <br/><br/>The actors did fine if you ask me. Yeah, in the story the characters made some stupid decisions but isn't that kind of what happens in horror films? I see a lot of people complaining about the stupid mistakes the characters made in the story but considering everything is supposed to have happened fairly quickly in the movie I really don't think they were actually so exceptionally stupid compared to your average horror film character. The fact they dabled with the book like fools when they find it made sense with traditional Evil Dead to me. I guess some people just didn't get that or agree. Maybe the part where they split up with the blond girl was pushing the stupidity level a little bit, I'll give you that but really they didn't have the characters act as stupidly as I've seen in a lot of cult classics which seem to get better reviews.<br/><br/>There is a really good couple of scenes with the blond hair girl. I'll just say those specific parts had me feeling weird for about a day or two.<br/><br/>People don't understand how she died and came back and how her soul still influenced the rise of the Abomination. Why is it that in the old Evil Dead these kind of supernatural details you are allowed to play out with your imagination and people do, yet fanboys refuse to be imaginative at all now? It's really not that hard to imagine that maybe her soul was still considered in hell until the abomination was defeated.. I just feel like people are trying to make movies way too explanatory. It's the reason why movies are getting so dumbed down, because critics want everything spelled out for them.<br/><br/>I love how they did the chainsaw. And one of my biggest beefs with all the negative reviews is this expected demand for Ash to be a main role in this movie. You of bad reviews would be bitching if they tried to have an Ash in this movie and here is why. Bruce Cambell is too old to be the same young Ash and they were going for more of a dark/realism than a slap-stick silly homage to ED2 and AOD. If they tried to have someone play Ash, omg now that would have just not worked at all. I was really glad they made this a new story and kept the same basic setting. <br/><br/>It was a really great homage and one of the best films I've seen this year. Definitely going to buy it. If you haven't seen it, please give it a chance. Just enjoy the movie because they did a really good job on it imo. If you sit there like half of the nerds giving bad reviews just picking apart the movie piece by piece or you just fondle your lover for an hour and complain the plot didn't grab you attention then you wont enjoy it. If you let the directors take you on this modern revival of Evil Dead horror and you have an open mind, I think you will enjoy :)"

","I had modest expectations going into this movie. I was ready to be disappointed, and I was hopeful to be impressed. Both happened. But unlike many critics, I found the film has more identity than meets the eye.<br/><br/>The remake stays on the basic path forged by the original - a simple, disturbing, darkly funny gorefest. The production values are much higher however, and there's more of an attempt to develop a story amongst the bloody chaos. And here lies the good and bad/Evil of the modern 'Dead.<br/><br/>This is not an amateur work anymore. The lighting and cinematography are done professionally and there is meaning behind the look and feel of the film. It's far removed from the raw look of the original, so I feel the pain of purists. But this high level of production not only gives the film a unique look, but also a texture. <br/><br/>Many details work in concert to create such an effect - color-saturation and high contrast, the peeling garbage back over the Necronomicon, and the incorporation of water and its accompanying sloshing sounds to name a few. There's also a highly memorable siren that howls during intense moments to ratchet-up the intensity.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, a ridiculously trite backstory, lack of character development, and the inability to build-up momentum make it hard to appreciate the wonderful depths of the details. Any sense of dread is extinguished by premature reveal, and there are few effective moments of foreboding. This all leaves the terror predictable, hardly startling, and rather boring. It wants to be its own movie, but can't break free of the original's grasp, leaving it in a disappointing in-between.<br/><br/>For Evil Dead, the devil is in the structure and writing, not the details. The script isn't so much charming as it is weak, and this reduces the effectiveness of any scares. The film leaves it up to the gory details and texture to carry audience interest, painting a wonderfully tangible film on a boring canvas, leaving it devoid of much excitement."

","personal rating: above average. <br/><br/>i've been watching a lot of modern horror movies, but this one struck me as very different. as soon as it started, i knew i had to stop expecting a valid attempt at a horror movie in order to continue. this movie didn't do any of the things that i usually consider ""good"" for any movie. but where it surprised me was how it worked on a conceptual level. <br/><br/>it's hard to top the established best horror/gore movies, so why not go the other direction? what i saw being done here was an exploration and cauterization of the accidental weirdness of the 1st 2 evil dead movies. using that set of tools, a very different story is able to be told.<br/><br/>instead of seeing a set of characters dealing with a situation, we get a seemingly lifeless/soulless group dropped into a meat grinder. this is congruous from the start with the lack of color that permeates the print. this is our realty. a trip with a bunch of teenagers in the modern age has no endearing qualities. it's dry and disappointing, with the people looking like zombies going through the motions of a forgotten life. it's a statement about state of story writing. <br/><br/>i submit that the tree rape was a thrill simply because its done to the movie's hero. the treatment of the hero was altogether fresh, and is part of a larger picture. she only becomes a possible hero at the very end, after all her friends have given their lives for her. they have added up what little humanity they had as individuals and created one real person, where none had existed before the trip. <br/><br/>the climactic blood rain sequence i felt was particularly cathartic. its not realistic so much as symbolic of the change that is occurring in the hero. she is beating a crippling addiction. instead of running she is fighting for the 1st time in her life. she loses an arm which is a small price to pay for the suffering that occurs in other countries in order for an American person to use heroin. <br/><br/>there were many references to the old movies which i saw as a kind of worship. you see it in the inclusion of silly demon voices as well. it's not a failure to nail easy things, but a blatant homage to the gods of horror. such is the state of us as fans and makers of the new. in the timeless tradition of artists going back to ancient times, when we make a picture we obnoxiously mark it with the symbol of our own creators. it doesn't need to help our picture, it's just the right thing to do."

","Yes, the new Evil Dead was a real blood fest with a believable storyline, good acting (Jane Levy is great!), a scary/disgusting ""villain"" and an astounding (!!!) soundtrack.<br/><br/>As you probably already read, this is not a remake, but a new approach to the Evil Dead universe. It still has the main elements of the series but delivers a completely new story, new scares and winks at the audience a few times (specially old school fans), but not so much in comical way, like on the original movie. <br/><br/>A special note on the powerful soundtrack: for me, it really made the difference in this movie, contributing to create some of the most nerve wrecking sequences I've seen in the past years.

That being said, I couldn't have been more wrong. With this movie, the horror genre has finally caught up with the rest of cinema. This film is truly a sight for sore eyes, both in gore (they used 10,000 gallons of blood) and cinematics. Balance that with a solid storyline and above-par acting, you have a film you can't miss.

","Evil Dead the remake was an awesome successful remake. This should be on top with other remakes. The practical effects were super amazing and very bloody. They looked so real and gross which made the film much better. Even know the actors weren't the best in the world each one of them gave an awesome terrific performances once or twice in the film especially Jane Levy as Mia. Also the cinematography were nice. especially when two scene's stood out ''!contains spoiler!'' the first 15 minutes when David and his friends drives to the cabin and all of the nature so beautiful and it was film fantastic with all off the good shots they'ed got. And second was ''!contains spoiler!'' when Mia is running through the woods and the demon is chasing her it was cool because everything was foggy and muddy and the nature blend right with it. This scene is one of my favorites throughout the movie. But for me it does lacks humor,it does has some humor but i wish it had more like the original. And also, even know is a horror movie it does lacks some horror and suspenseful parts. there were scene's that were scary but i wish it could be a little much better. But some of the gore can replace some scares for other people who hates gore. I will say that Evil Dead the remake was awesome and it respects with care to the old too and it was really successful. I would possibly actually see a sequel too."
"Field78","8","2","5","12 February 2014"," With all the liquid bodily fluids, a solid remake!
","When word got out that Evil Dead, one of the most beloved horror/gorefests of the previous century, would get the remake treatment, most people were less than enthusiastic. Every decent horror movie from those decades had probably already been remade, and not even classics like Halloween proved untouchable enough for studios to stay away from. Most of the time, these 'reimaginations' (as they are euphemistically called) lacked the skill, bravado or craftsmanship of the originals, and even if they managed to match their quality, they often lacked creativity, originality or daring vision.<br/><br/>I love the original Evil Dead films for their energetic pacing and humorously icky approach to horror, so I wasn't convinced either that an Evil Dead remake was something the world needed. On the other hand, I was too young to watch the Evil Dead films when they came out, so they are not sacred to me, and I like to keep an open mind to all developments in the horror genre. Unexpectedly, the new Evil Dead was released with high praise from many critics and fans, and as far as I'm concerned, Evil Dead can take its place among The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and Dawn of the Dead (2004) as horror remakes that can peacefully coexist with their respective originals. Why? Because they take what was good from the original, yet also add something new. They start on the same road, yet don't walk it all the way to the end, taking the occasional sidetrack that brings a few surprises.<br/><br/>Both Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell co-produced the movie, stating a desire to revisit their beloved first project, and do things with it they had not done yet. Usually, when the original creators say something like that, it seems to mean that they were notified about the remake, and received a sum of money in exchange for taking an executive producer's credit and providing active support for the new movie. But Evil Dead Reborn is different. The original film had such a massively inventive display of special effects and in-your-face energy that it was easy to look beyond the holes in the screenplay and the technical shortcomings; audiences these days won't fall for that so easily, but the writers came up with a great screenplay that allows for plenty of scares and physical horror, without resorting to a lazily-written re-thread. We start out on comfortably familiar grounds, in a cabin in the woods, where a group of young people inadvertently awaken an old evil that takes possession of them, one by one. One of the nice touches is that when the terror starts affecting the ex-drug addict, the rest initially explains it away as on of her drug withdrawal hallucinations. Needless to say, when they finally get smart and want to leave, the bridge is gone and there is no escape. <br/><br/>One big departure this movie takes from the original is the tone. Where the original movies were violent and gruesome, yet appropriately slapstick due to the anarchistic photography and excessive amounts of gore, the remake is more serious, sincerely terrifying, nerve-wrecking, and has some well-timed shocks. Two aspects of the originals were kept: the frenetic pacing, and the copious amounts of bodily fluids. Where most horror movies muddle through introductions and set-up, and don't pick up speed until well after an hour (leaving only thirty minutes until the end), this movie shifts into high gear after 25 minutes, and keeps speeding up until the end. And in a day and age where studios try to contain the amount of splatter in order to not scare off the general public and keep the movie financially profitable, we get showered with amounts of gore quite unheard of since the eighties. I found it disturbingly pleasant to see such an old-school amount of blood, rotting flesh and severed appendages flying around, which could have easily become ridiculous, yet nowhere does it completely undermine the creepy punch the movie delivers.<br/><br/>Although not overtly goofy as its predecessors, this movie isn't without its subtle yet crude humor, for instance when Eric slips over a piece of skin that Olivia has just cut from her face; the improvised amputation with an electric knife, the nail gun antics, and the final appearance of the true star of each Evil Dead movie: the chainsaw, which makes for good old-fashioned mayhem. It is fun to see how the creators have added new elements, such as the Abomination, and found ways to present big and small elements from the originals with inventive twists. <br/><br/>Of course, many people will think the original was perfect, and the remake is useless by default; they complain that it is too much of the same, or straying too far from the source. Some say it is ridiculous with dumb characters. Well, what horror movies doesn't contain characters doing unwise things? Most horror plots are actually moving forward due to people doing ill-advised stuff. What can we say? Times change. The original movies had their shortcomings as well, but they were a perfect product of their time, and work exceptionally well within that context. The makers of the remake acknowledged that modern audiences have different perspectives of horror movies, and I think they did a fine job translating Evil Dead to a new era. Bruce Campbell himself helped to get it made, and he concludes the movie in a post-credits scene with his signature 'Groovy!' Who am I to argue with Ash?"

","This gets 2 only because the premise had promise; interesting, that no one would believe the girl who encounters a demon because she's withdrawing. Not great, not original, but OK. However. That's it, and the reviews here praising this idiot slasher crap seem to feel it's worthy of being a genre itself - that is, moronic scenes setting up mutilation. I don't get it. I don't get why the dude feels the urgent need to read aloud the words in the forbidden book, especially as he reveals having some respect for this sort of thing. Don't get how a Wal- Mart carving blade can slice through bone or how a girl does not immediately bleed to death after. Then again, nobody bleeds realistically here. Back to the lovers of this: are you seriously claiming that inane reactions make a movie work, as in the ABSURD (and tired) moments of emotional pause when the demon takes the brother down memory lane, or the idiot blonde goes into the cellar cause Mia sounds kinda scared? Worst of all is the math. The book makes it clear: five souls taken, then the real abomination comes with the blood rain. Four, demon. You only got four. Nurse, brother, idiot blonde, and book dude.

"falcata_claymore","6","2","5","13 September 2013"," A genuinely pretty okay labor of love
","Evil Dead is the heartwarming story of a young woman struggling to overcome her substance abuse problems with the help of family, close friends, good old fashioned willpower, and a mystical book bound in human skin. She stumbles and relapses, but she eventually finds the inner strength to tear her own hand off and literally saw addiction in half.<br/><br/>I'm just kidding. But only kind of. Of course, most of you know that this is, in fact, a remake of the ultra-low budget 1980 horror classic and icon of geek culture The Evil Dead, which launched the careers of director Sam Raimi and star/coolest person ever Bruce Campbell. One of these people has been slightly more successful than the other, but to be fair, the other got to replace their hand with a chainsaw, so it's a trade off. If you think that the idea of remaking The Evil Dead sounds sacrilegious, then there are a few things you should know: first, Evil Dead is produced by Raimi and Campbell, and it was supposedly their idea to remake it. Evidently, they wanted this remake to be the movie to be the darker, more serious movie that they originally tried to make back in 1979. Secondly- and this may seem controversial to you- The Evil Dead is not a great movie. Think about everything that defines an Evil Dead movie in popular culture: the cool one-liners of Ash Williams, the sawed-off shotgun, the iconic chainsaw hand, Bruce Campbell's speech about shopping at S-Mart, the juxtaposition of insane, off-the-rails horror imagery with slapstick humor. The thing that all these things have in common is that none of them are in the first movie. Everything that we associate with The Evil Dead is actually in either Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness. Those are great movies. In fact, Evil Dead 2 is the greatest horror-comedy ever made, and if you disagree with that statement, then you are wrong.<br/><br/>The point is, that if there were ever a well intentioned horror remake with a genuine reason to exist, it would be Evil Dead. And for the most part, this remake does work. Sure, it has flaws, and it copies a little too much from Sam Raimi's bag o' film making tricks, but this was clearly a labor of love by the people involved. Specifically, it's the kind of labor of love that involves a metric ton of fake blood. It's this point that I would normally remind people that Evil Dead is not for the faint of heart or stomach, but c'mon- it's a remake of The Evil Dead. While this movie constantly skirts the line between an R-rating and an NC-17, most recent DVD releases of The Evil Dead actually carry an NC-17 rating, so you really ought to see that coming. If you couldn't figure out that this movie is gruesome, I don't know what to tell you- maybe movies just aren't your thing. Of course, the gore in this new version is far more realistic- long gone are the days of spaghetti intestines and red tempera paint blood- though the violence is still cartoonish in nature, even if it's more real in execution. No pun intended, I swear.<br/><br/>Like any remake that has ever worked, Evil Dead does not completely copy the story of its predecessor. It keeps the basic concept, but it is a different film with different characters and different motivations. Most notably, these five people actually have a reason to go out to a cabin in the middle of nowhere that kind of makes sense. As mentioned earlier, one of the characters is trying to quit drugs cold turkey, so she, her friends, and her brother travel to the middle of nowhere so she'll have a harder time relapsing. It's not a good idea, but it's certainly better than going to a cabin in the woods to drink and screw. However, that isn't to say that it doesn't resemble the original in very obvious ways: it keeps the demon-vision zooming camera stuff, and it has numerous sequences that are very clearly re-workings of events from the original and its sequel. Moreover, if you're familiar with the original trilogy, nothing in Evil Dead is going to surprise you; the plot may differ from the original, but all the beats are in the same place. It's a pretty okay horror flick; yes, the gore is the textbook definition of excessive, but it builds up nicely, and it is often genuinely scary, even to someone as hard to scare as I. It succeeds mostly as a modern companion piece to the original films, but it's not without its flaws.<br/><br/>Evil Dead takes more risks than most films, but it never goes off the rails in the way the originals did. While this is a better movie than the original on a purely technical level, that's not what made the originals so good. The Evil Dead ultimately succeeded because it made up for its lack of budget in sheer ballsiness. It wasn't great, but it sure was memorable, and it was truly scary in a way that really sticks with you. Nobody's going to accuse it of being forgettable, but it never reaches the highs that it should.<br/><br/>But still, Evil Dead is a good movie. It's worth checking out if you're a fan of horror movies, and fans of the original will get a kick out of it. If you want to see it, you should see it. But it's not a great film, and it's not really worth more than one viewing. But hey- it's still worth one more viewing than 95% of horror movies made in the last fifteen years, so there's that."

The evil has immense powers like entering into bodies through improbable cavities, closing & opening doors with finesse & playing mind games to name a few.

","Before I start, I should say: I'm reviewing this as an avid horror movie fan. this is NOT a movie for everyone. it's super brutal, and it means to be. If you're not a fan of gore, don't see it. bottom line. okay, HERE WE GO!<br/><br/>Being quite a huge fan of Sam Raimi's Trilogy, I had quite the high standards to be met for this film when I first heard about it. Once the red band trailer was released it showed very strong promise.<br/><br/>I just saw ""Evil Dead"" tonight, and I can confidently say it blew my expectations out of the water. Not only as a fan to the franchise, but as a fan to the horror genre. I think explaining why it's a great horror movie in general will equally explain why it deserves it's title of an Evil Dead rebirth.<br/><br/>First of all, the plot is a breath of fresh air. Instead of ""partying teens get picked off by a masked serial killer"", or ""haunted house with 70 minutes of jump-scares and 10 minutes of actual events"", there is real depth. Mia, a (trying to be) ex heroin addict is attempting to go cold turkey with two of her closest friends, Olivia and Eric, her estranged brother David, and his wife Natalie. David, Mia, Eric, and Olivia used to be very close friends, but David left for a job in a shop in Chicago right around the time that his and Mia's mother grew fatally ill. <br/><br/>David left his sister in her time of need, and didn't keep in touch with his friends. This led Mia into a downward spiral of drugs, leading to her eventually over-dosing and being pronounced legally dead and being revived by a defibrillator. Also, Eric has some resentments for David abandoning Mia as well as himself/their friendship.<br/><br/>I only mention how important the relationships are, especially the drug addiction, because Mia had tried going sober before and didn't last due to the withdrawal symptoms of heroin being basically intolerable. Her friends expect she'll say anything to get back to drugs, and that she'll hallucinate. SO! when they find the Book of the Dead and Eric's curiosity leads to some passages being transcribed (honestly, I'd be curious about it if i found it too.), the evil it releases that Mia sees is immediately dismissed.<br/><br/>It may seem expected, but it being a refreshing premise is undeniable. The premise isn't the only refreshing part though! there are also the characters. Horror movies have a pretty common curse with this aspect. I'm talking about the typical stoner, whore, jerk, idiot, etc. It's an easy way to make the audience desensitized to the scenes, which is generally fine. If you loved every character in a horror movie, then people wouldn't be able to sit through most B horror movies.<br/><br/>That makes all the madness that much more real. In other movies, you see someone get killed and think ""finally. that person was horrible. those were some cool effects!"" Mia seems to be of college age, and just lost her mother. clearly very troubled. David is a hard working, honest man who isn't great at handling his emotions. Natalie is sweet, concerned, supportive. Olivia is an RN, and Eric is just a high school teacher. No one is drunk, unintelligent, or has any unjustifiable vices that make them an easy person to lose. there really are no reasons to hate these people, or wish anything bad on them. I can't think of many horror movies that can pull that off (maybe the exorcist?), and Evil Dead does it well.<br/><br/>The momentum of the movie is steady, but keeps at a good pace. Definitely not a normal roller-coaster type horror movie that drops in some action every 5-8 minutes or so with one climax. it's more like all important back story and character development, then once the tension starts it keeps going until it spins out of control. other than a few tasteful breaks in momentum, it's almost constant madness til the end. I didn't find it dragging on anywhere, every part was necessary.<br/><br/>Some would say that the gore would be excessive, and I wouldn't argue with them in a general sense. In a personal sense, I wouldn't take out one bit of it. then again, I can handle that kind of stuff. I cannot stress enough though, this movie is NOT for everyone.<br/><br/>I don't want to ramble, I've covered mostly everything I'd like since I don't want to give out any major spoilers. The last thing I can say is, if you're a true deadite, I can confidently say you'd love this movie. unless you're a pretentious hipster that wants to hate it to be different, but if that's what's up then I would dismiss your opinions anyway. Not just deadites though, horror movie fans in general...check it out. if you normally don't like horror movies, don't try this one. <br/><br/>that is all.<br/><br/>Thanks!"

","I have seen all three original Evil Dead titles dozens of times each and I love each of them equally but separately. The Evil Dead is a brilliantly disorienting splatter film with little to no plot, dizzyingly bizarre camera work, and a cast of kids that couldn't act their way out of a mud puddle. Evil Dead 2 is a slap stick gore comedy based loosely on the events of the first film. The gore and scares are softened with rainbow hued fluid instead of blood in most cases and punctuating each death with campy humor. Army of Darkness is a swords and sorcery adventure/comedy the thrives on it's own campy goofiness and lazy story telling to produce a uniquely cinematic adventure classic. <br/><br/>There seems to be some misunderstanding about Evil Dead 2013. A lot of supposed hardcore fans of the original seem to think that The Evil Dead was full of humor and the reboot missed the comedy mark. Well hombres, unless you think the line ""party down"" is a real laugh riot then I think you are remembering the wrong film in the series. Ironically there is more humor in the 2013 version.<br/><br/>Another complaint the sycophantic internet neck beards seem to have is that the acting and story were sub-par. Please reread my previous synopsis of the original and understand that the character Mia in the reboot emotes more in her first 10 mins on screen than the whole cast of the original did in 90. The only thing different about the story this time around is that the kids have a reason to go to the cabin and the demons have an actual motivation for killing everybody.<br/><br/>Evil Dead 2013 is like a wet dream for any fan of the original. It's riddled with horror convention, plump with demonic imagery, and soaked in blood. This is a horror film that would be very much at home among the blood and guts films of the 80's so if that is your thing like it is mine please ignore the poser fan reviews and enjoy the senseless carnage. For those not interested in senseless carnage, skip it."

","Before I start this review I want to say that I'm a super hardcore Evil Dead fan, and that my excitement for this film was incredibly high, so were my expectations. With that said, I absolutely loved this film. Was it by any means a perfect film? No it wasn't, it definitely had it's flaws, such as underdeveloped characters, and poor dialogue. But this didn't bother me at all; I actually like bad dialogue. It's a horror movie you don't need strong characters always, and the characters that needed development did get it by the end of the film. Now onto the positive. The film looks visually amazing, everything from the effects to how it was shot. The cinematography was outstanding, and really showcased how beautiful New Zealand is. I mean I can't get over how awesome it looked, also the camera angles and techniques were just incredible. I liked that they used similar ones to the original, and still kept the Deadite P.O.V. The effects which for the most part were practical looked incredibly real and believable, I did notice CGI used though, which didn't but me. But 100 percent practical, definitely not. Not only was this film visually good but the sound worked very well. The score helped to create tension, and flowed well. It is also beautiful on its own, I definitely plan on listening to the soundtrack. Even though the characters didn't really have development, the film was still paced well. Setting up things without being to excessive than just letting loose. When things take off they really take off, there still were a few slow spots though. I actually did find some of the moments a little emotional, at least more than the original. You can actually feel for some of the characters at times. The acting was great, at least I thought. The dialogue made the acting seem bad at times, at least during the beginning but when it was good the acting really shine. Shilloh Fernadez did was very believable for the most part, and Jane Levey really stole the show as Mia. Playing a believable junkie without going to over the top. This was just such a well made horror film, and you can really feel director Fede Alvarez's passion for this franchise. Even with it's flaw Evil Dead is still a bloody good time. And stay after the credits for a special treat."

","Evil Dead (2013)<br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Remake of the 1981 classic has five friends going to a creepy cabin in the woods so that one can kick a drug habit. Soon after arriving the group find a weird basement containing a book, which one ends up reading and releasing a deadly curse. For the past twenty years there's been buzz on whether we'd get a fourth film in the original series or if someone would dare take the challenge and start something new. While I don't think this is quite as good as the original there's no question that the filmmakers put a lot of time and effort into the film and they've managed to make something that will probably be seen as the top of its genre in its own time. EVIL DEAD really packs quite a punch on a number of levels. I'm one who feels that gore is never scary and I think that's true here but it's somewhat different. Director Fede Alvarez builds up a rather creepy atmosphere, which certainly helps the impact of the film but he also manages to make the violence quite gruesome. I wouldn't call the violence scary but it's certainly got an intense shock level to it that makes it quite effective. The entire look and feel of the movie is terrific as you really do get something that soaks up the low-budget and manages to use it as a positive. I thought the director really did a great job at building up the loneliness of the woods and I thought this here added to the atmosphere. I also didn't hurt that the five actors gave such good performances. There's nothing Oscar-worthy here but all give cast members really turned in strong work and best of all is that the screenplay gave them something to do and managed to make us like each and everyone of them so that by the time the violence starts we can feel something for them. This here is something missing from a lot of horror films today. To say EVIL DEAD is a great throwback would probably be an understatement but I think the film proves what can be done when you get a director, a cast, writers and producers who want to do something right. EVIL DEAD is a gory, creepy, violent, over-the-top thrill ride that isn't flawless but it's certainly at the top of its game."
"robo042-1","9","13","70","5 April 2013"," Ten things you need to know about this film.
","The facts:<br/><br/>1) The film is produced by Sam Raimi who was the producer/writer/director of the original and Bruce Campbell who played the lead role of Ash as well as produced the original film. <br/><br/>2) The film is directed, however, by newcomer Fede Alvarez and this is his first feature film (much like the original was Sam Raimi's first feature film).<br/><br/>3) Fede used no CGI for the production of this film. Much like how the Bourne movies benefited greatly from utilizing no CGI, this decision pays off big time for the 2013 Evil Dead as all the scenes came out looking hyper realistic.<br/><br/>4) The camera work and overall cinematography is simply first rate which is truly remarkable given that it's Fede's first feature length film.<br/><br/>5) There is more exposition in this film than in the original Evil Dead. We're treated to a prologue scene as well as given more detailed back stories for the film's central characters. This was the only decision I really questioned. To me, back stories and explanation and all that are irrelevant to begin with and takes away from the realism. Individuals in real life horrific situations aren't going to be near as concerned with why they're in that situation as much as they are with how the hell they're going to get out of it. That's my one and only beef with the re-make. The time spent on exposition was time wasted in my opinion.<br/><br/>6) The comedic element is much darker and much more borderline than the original. While the original was filled with seemingly unintentionally comic scenes, this remake is filled with scenes so dark it's hard to tell if it's intended to be black comedy or not. ""Are you serious?"" is a question you'll likely find yourself asking at various moments. An example of this is a scene where it is discovered that one of the characters has amputated their own arm and then calmly states, ""I did it, I feel much better now."" A fan of the original should recognize the humor both in it's nod to the original films and in the ridiculousness of a character who just amputated their own limb claiming that they're ""better now"". However, given the hyper realism of the amputation and it's bloody aftermath, this and many other examples of dark comedy may be lost to some moviegoers, especially those unfamiliar with the originals. The characters make dumb decisions because the original characters made dumb decisions and even though the consequences seem much graver this time around given the films gritty realism, it's still funny as hell to watching these stupid kids make stupid decisions.<br/><br/>7) To those fans anxious about ""who is supposed to be Ash's replacement"", Fede gives a definite answer with a twist. I won't spoil it as it provides a pretty good plot twist to fans of the original films, but I will say that the decision I believe was truly inspired. Some fans inevitably didn't approve but as a die hard fan myself, I loved it.<br/><br/>8) If you're not familiar with the original films some aspects, including the aforementioned twist, may be lost to you. Since the original film was the basis for what has become modern horror movie tropes, those unfamiliar with the 1981 film may not appreciate the 2013 takes on all these tropes. Without the original, Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead may come of as simply a bloodier more gruesome version of a typical horror movie. And in many ways it is, but that's because the original Evil Dead set many of the standards for what is now consider to be typical fare for horror movies these days.<br/><br/>9) If you've seen the original films but didn't like them, then you probably won't like this one much either. Go read the late Roger Ebert's review of the film. He didn't like the original Evil Dead much either and gives a pretty accurate view of how you'll probably feel about the 2013 version.<br/><br/>10) If you're a fan of the originals, then you'll be doing yourself a grave disservice by not seeing the 2013 version in theaters. Even if you don't enjoy the film as much as I did, true fans of the franchise need to go see Sam and Bruce's newest addition, otherwise you're not a true fan."
"jmt53636","9","13","70","5 April 2013"," A remake that really gets it right!
","One thing I do have to say about Evil Dead right off the bat is that I saw it at the premiere showing in theaters, so there was a crowd. And I just find that in general horror movies are the most fun to see in a crowd at a movie theater, because you can all experience the same shocks, scares, and dumb jokes together. So, in saying that, I have to say this was a movie that was really FUN to go see. This is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've had at a movie theater in a while. If you're interested in seeing this while it's in theaters, try to see it before it's too late, because you're gonna have a good time.<br/><br/>Now...aside from the experience, how is the actual movie? Well...really awesome, honestly. Remakes are generally pretty pointless, and remakes of horror movies in particular usually suffer the most. There was even more pressure put on this one too, since the original Evil Dead from 1981 is a cult classic, and one of my favorite horror movies. However, this updated version is one of the few remakes that gets it right. This could be in part because Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, director and star of the original, served as producers on the movie, but I don't want to say that because it discounts the great work everyone else put into this remake.<br/><br/>One thing that surprised me about Evil Dead is how little of a remake it felt like at times. It'd be very easy to simply do a scene for scene retread of the old movie, but instead this version adds its own different characters, story lines, and intense moments. However, that's not to say elements of the original aren't in here. On the contrary, Evil Dead pays a lot of respect to the movie it's remaking by adding a ton of nods to it, some obvious and some more subtle. So the final product is a movie that takes an old concept for a movie, makes its own great movie out of it without copying, but also pays a lot of homage to its source. It works perfectly.<br/><br/>The basic premise is one we've all heard of before. There's five people out in a cabin in the woods. A book of the dead is found in the basement, and opening it releases evil demons that are out to possess and kill them. What Evil Dead adds to the mix is it centers around the main character of Mia, who is there in the cabin along with everyone else to try and kick her drug addiction. I thought this brought an interesting dynamic to the beginning of the movie, because where most horror movie characters just refuse to believe something is going on when they're warned, when Mia starts seeing the demon in the woods, the other characters have a reason to believe she's seeing things, because she's going through withdrawal. From there though...the movie is just a nonstop ride of gory scenes. Saying anything more than that would spoil the experience. However, if you're not into blood/gore, definitely stay away.<br/><br/>My only real gripe with Evil Dead is its script. The storyline is a little ""eh"" at times, the dialogue can be a little cheesy, and worst of all the characters mostly just aren't likable, at least until the end. Script issues aside, Evil Dead is fantastic and does everything right. I was really impressed with Jane Levy as the main character of Mia, who really brought everything to the table with her performance. Everyone else is mostly unknown actors, but they did fairly well most of the time. Fede Alvarez really did a great job directing this. One of the best things about this movie is that in an age where everything is done with CGI, Evil Dead uses only practical effects in the movie all throughout, and the end result is much more satisfying. There is a TON of blood and gore to be found here, so fans of that will eat this up. Possibly the most blood I've seen in a movie, at least in recent memory.<br/><br/>All in all, major props to everyone who worked on this movie, I really enjoyed it. No, it's not as good as the original, but I didn't expect it to be. What we do get, though, is still one of the best horror movie experiences I've had in a long time, and a remake that really gets it right. Whether you're a fan of the original or just want to see a good horror movie, Evil Dead satisfies."

","After a long hiatus i'm returning with a review of the new evil dead movie,first off i'm usually standoffish on remakes,but i actually had good vibes about the evil dead remake,its updated quite a bit for the new and younger horror fans who never seen the 1982 original,so there's plenty more gore and blood,and some clever cg scenes,one actress i recognize is Jessica Lucas who i remember from another good movie clover field,and like the first one there are 5 young people,2 guys and three women.and yes its the woods,there is the book of the dead and i really don't want to give the plot away but prepare yourself,it is a nail biter and if you don't like blood,guts,and gore don't watch it,in the theater i saw this people were laughing at some scenes,probably because like me we seen it all before,but this movie is more brutal and yes scarier then the 1982 original,too bad Bruce Campbell did'nt do a cameo.this would've been a good 3d movie,oh yes and about the book,it is bound in human skin,when you do decide to go see evil dead,keep repeating to yourself,its only a movie!but like Donald pleasense says in the horror compilation film terror in the aisles 1984,but sooner or later you must leave the theater,mind you this did'nt give me any nightmares but some of the scenes were so brutal they wee hard to forget.they did change the title by the way,instead of the evil dead,its called evil dead.awesome movie,check it out,8 out of 10."
"SpencerRianBacon","9","5","20","26 April 2013"," Very Impressive
","I saw this without seeing the original. (After which I did see the original, but that is a different review for a different day). This movie starts out with a scene that totally sets up the tone, which also gives us a wonderful sneak peak at what to come, the beginning being the scene where you first see the demon, and they can shut off the ""evil demon routine"" and be the real person. I really enjoyed that, i loved how they played that up in the movie, which gives a great moral fight with some characters. Then we see the characters we are supposed to like, but really the only character I cared about was Mia, the main girl (which i thought was really well played by Jane Levy) and for his credit the main guy David wasn't bad either. The filmmakers also give really great updates from the original that in my opinion improve on it. I won't spoil it here though, however its really good. I also really wanna touch on the gore, the movie uses practical effects so much that it becomes a love letter to people who grew up with ""no CGI"" it gives us so much of what we loved in the original with great references and also a lot of BLOOD, i loved the BLOOD, but its so bloody. LIKE WOW that was a lot of blood. In the end this movie hearkens back to the old days, gives us a horror character that you care about, (Which i didn't say before but that is still impressive especially for a remake to even have one character to root for) and a lot of blood (i cannot state that enough this was so bloody) I personally had a lot of fun with this movie, and is a movie i will be buying when released on blu-ray. It deserves to be next to Cabin in the Woods, The Evil Dead, and Evil Dead 2. Well done guys, well done."
"njharris94","7","5","20","20 April 2013"," Its not the original, but so what.
","Now, if you have seen the original 'The Evil Dead' and expect this film to follow in its foot steps like the classic sequels, then you are going to be disappointed. That's because this film is a far cry from the original and should be treated as such when watching and reviewing the film yourself.<br/><br/>This film in my honest horror film lover's opinion is certainly better than the modern horror films being churned out in the 21st century. Though not an original concept the film certainly should not be branded as simply another trashy horror film filled with drugs, blood and sex. Which is unfortunately what most horror films have gradually become. This film however contains no sex, no drug use and an unbelievable 'Tarantino Worthy' amount of blood. Though to some this may appear to be a way of creating cheap scares to put the audience at unease, i find this to however not be the case. The amount of the blood, though ridiculously over the top is reminiscent if i remember correctly, to the original films with the ridiculous amount of blood used to make the audience burst out with laughter. This film though trys to take a more serious and 'frightening' approach to the Evil Dead franchise.<br/><br/>Though the film does not scare, as im sure those who've watched it know, the film certainly puts its strengths more into the gory effects, 'make you jump' moments and attempt at creating more of a back story involving the brother and sister Mia and David. The back story itself i think fits very well with the films concept of there being no escape from the cabin and the evil unleashed from them being there. The visual effects themselves i thought were fantastic, and the fact that they aimed to create these effects with as minimal cgi as possible is the best way for films to be nowadays. The effects themselves aiming to create the scares and jumpy moments were very effective in my opinion. The visual effects of skin decay, dismemberment and demonic possession etc are certainly more horrifying for a modern audience and more realistic. But this was what makes classic horror so beautiful, as the effects are far more cruder in design but far more creative and require more imagination than your average teenager with a 3D modelling program on their household computer.<br/><br/>When watching this film, if the classic film sits happily in the back of your mind, then this film may disappoint you depending on what you're expecting. But if the original has not sat in your disc tray then shame on you, but that also means that you're not expecting the film to surpass the original film so loved by many. This film is merely a re imagining of a cult classic and merely aims to create a new story from the Evil Dead concept of a group of teenagers unwittingly releasing a deadly evil upon themselves through reading passages of the Necronomicon.<br/><br/>As a classic horror film lover, i'm ashamed to say i saw the trailer for this film before i had even seen the original and for some reason was procrastinating when it came to see the original. And when watching it was simply blown away, which is what modern horror films just simply don't do anymore when the best horror films weren't even released in this century. So i knew that this film was not going to live up to the original and didn't enter the cinema with false hopes. But nonetheless i have to say i wasn't let down by this film as other people claim to have been. Yes its a remake and therefore another unoriginal concept but i was simply drawn to the fact that the attempt to reboot had been made, as with Dawn of the Dead (2004) remake and The Thing (2011) prequel. Which in both cases the originals far surpass them in every way as classic horror masterpieces, but that still didn't stop me from watching them, and enjoying them.<br/><br/>So if you are going to see this film don't expect perfection in story telling, dialogue or acting (Shiloh Fernandez for me was far too wooden) as this film is not. When watching this film just embrace the valiant effort made to reboot the classic Evil Dead series and i have to say i cant wait to see the Evil Dead sequels to follow. The fact is remakes/reboots and unwanted sequels are always going to be made and there are going to be those who either love them or hate them. Which one are you?"

","I wasn't sure if I was going to go see this movie at the theater but I am glad I did. So many bad reviews here but I have to say it was better than the original. I love Jane Levy in this movie. She did a great job and made me see her more as a serious actress than just a funny teen in ""Suburgatory"". Lou Taylor Pucci also did a great job. They were my favorite characters. It wasn't scary for my taste but it was very gory. Not in a cheesy way which was nice. I paid for 6 people to see this and I was happy with my purchase. If looking for a bloody good movie, this is definitely for you. Plus I got to see some really good previews to upcoming scary movies :D"
"slasherstudios","8","13","71","5 April 2013"," Gore, Reborn
","Going into the new ""Evil Dead"" reboot/remake/sequel, my expectations couldn't have been lower. If ""Texas Chainsaw 2D"" taught me one thing, it is to avoid all trailers, TV spots, and clips for upcoming horror movies. Who wants to spent $11-12 on a movie when they've already seen the ""good"" stuff for free? With that in mind, I went into ""Evil Dead"" having no clue as to what to expect besides hearing from a few internet bloggers that it was supposedly one of the ""goriest movies ever made"". All I knew was that I loved Ash and I loved the original (I'm a bit less fond of the sequels). The original creators were on board with this remake, so how bad could it possibly be? Turns out, it is not bad at all. ""Evil Dead"" is in fact one of the very best horror movies of the last few years.<br/><br/>As the film begins, we watch as a teenage girl is kidnapped and tortured by a good of townspeople including her father. They accuse her of being evil, a charge she most certainly denies. Her father pours gasoline on her as he prepares to see his daughter light up in flames. She begs for him to take mercy before taking the form of a possessed demon. He lights the match and the demon promises that he will indeed return. So far, fairly interesting if nothing like the original film.<br/><br/>We flash forward to modern time as we meet five college aged students who are staying at an abandoned, dilapidated cabin the weekend. Their goal, is to get their best friend Mia (wonderfully played by Jane Levy in a role that had to be torture to endure) off the drugs once and for all. They make the pact that whatever they do, they won't leave the house until she is cured. Something tells me they are going to regret that promise come morning, that is if they survive to tell the tale.<br/><br/>A look through the house reveals a strange basement sells with dead cats everywhere and a book wrapped in plastic and barbed wire. Of course, it doesn't take long for one of the memories of the group (shockingly the smart one, Eric, nicely played by Lou Taylor Pucci) to read from the Book of the Dead to unleash the spirits once again on the group of five. Turns out if the demon is able to feast from five souls in a night, the dead will rule the world again? Five good looking college students, five souls, the spirits are going to be having a buffet tonight. It is up to the leader of the group David (the very handsome Shiloh Fernandez who is the heart and soul of this film) to save the day by destroying the book, the cabin, and possibly his sister Mia's soul.<br/><br/>Words cannot simply describe the experience of watching ""Evil Dead"" (2013). For a remake, it feels more like a sequel than anything and I really mean that as a compliment. This is the rare movie that stays true to the original while adding a strong new story, likable characters, and more blood and gore than you will likely see all year. It is relentless in its terror and atmosphere and actually made me feel uneasy at several key moments. If this film had to be cut to receive an R rating, I can't even imagine what the original NC-17 version looked like. Not everyone is going to come out of this film with the same admiration that I had for it. Those that like their horror ""fun"" may feel a bit drained by the entire experience but I left the theater shaking. Yes, I found it to be THAT good. If I see a better horror movie this year, it will be a damn good year for the genre as a whole."
"colemac96","10","11","58","5 April 2013"," I loved this movie.
","Let me begin by saying that the original Evil Dead is my favorite movie of all time so this review will in fact be biased. If you came into this movie expecting it to be as good as the original then you were going to be displeased. It wasn't the original, it wasn't trying to be the original, and it wasn't trying to beat the original. Please get that through your thick skulls. The new one was partially produced by Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi, that means any and everything put into this movie had to go by them. Trust me, Bruce wouldn't let a movie be made that he felt wasn't in the best interest for the franchise. A common complaint is the amount of gore that is in this movie. If you didn't want to see gore then DO NOT watch a horror movie. Yes it is a lot of gore and blood but honestly it fits into the movie nicely. This ""rebirth"" is about as good as a remake is going to get, so quit whining. If you don't like it or want to watch it then don't. I absolutely loved the gore and the effects. I loved the camera work, I loved the set/cabin, I loved the props, I loved all of the references to the original. I loved almost everything about this movie(notice I said 'almost'). The only things that I didn't like was the fact that Olivia just died(or maybe disappeared I really don't know) after getting beat by a piece of toilet. She should have gotten back up, at least according to the known ways of killing a deadite. The other thing that bothered me was that Mia was just completely free from the demon after being buried. It just didn't add up. Anyways, if you're a true fan of the original series I suggest watching this. It is a very fun and nicely done film."

","Very bloody and pretty scary reboot with no-nonsense approach to gore that not quite on par with its predecessor but definitely stands out from the string of modern horrors. The main problem is the screenplay which tries to add some ""life"" to main characters but fails miserably. As a result the movie comes to a halt near the end when surviving characters start digging into their family problems - it'd be better to leave these sentiments on the cutting room floor. Nevertheless, if you are horror film fan, new Evil Dead is definitely worth your time and money. <br/><br/>P.S.

"phoenix_kim","9","5","21","19 April 2013"," Brutal remake
","Just decided to throw this short review in here to counteract all of the purist hate I've recently seen.<br/><br/>First off, yes, it will divide fans! But it is one hell of a ride. The violence is excessive, raw and unfiltered. But is a fun experience if you take it for what it is. The original is still there in all its glory; this is just another version, which I thought was fantastic.<br/><br/>Going in, I knew that it wouldn't even come close to the tag-line's claim. Actually it didn't really come across as scary at all, but again, that's not what I was expecting. I had a good time, and my original scepticism turned to high approval.<br/><br/>Worth a watch, especially with friends!"

","Her brother David, his girlfriend Natalie, and friends Eric and Olivia take Mia to the family cabin in remote woods so that she can go cold turkey with her drug addiction. Unfortunately, we know that the cabin has recently been broken into and used as a venue for exorcising a demonic presence, and those carrying out that ritual have rather thoughtlessly left behind the book containing the ritual needed to summon the demonic thingummy back again. Even more unfortunately, Eric is the sort of idiot who not only finds it necessary to cut off the barbed wire which is used to bind the book - a bit of a hint there, together with the DO NOT READ THIS messages written all over it - but then to read out the ritual. And the demonic wotsit, which decides to take up residence in Mia - who is already having a fairly miserable time even before all this - isn't very nice.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead more or less singlehandedly created the ""video nasty"" genre in the UK. But that was back in 1981, and the film which resulted in cries for blanket bannings was given away free with a newspaper not so very long ago, so I suppose it's not unreasonable to expect a remake 30 years on - produced, it appears, by Raimi himself and also the star of the original Bruce Campbell. And some other bloke.<br/><br/>The posters for this movie contain a lot of ""Scariest film ever""-type quotes. Well, if you've never seen a horror film before, maybe that's the case. I will say this - it is very gory, and there are a handful of made-you-jump moments, plus some very loud sounds. But it contains no real surprises (even without seeing the original), nor even much of a sense of menace. It is a serviceable but unexceptional horror in the modern manner.<br/><br/>How does it compare with the original? Well, the original had the benefit of being exactly that - original. Despite looking dated in terms of its effects (and not to mention being made on a budget of ninepence) Raimi's movie blazed a new trail which many others have subsequently followed. That is not the case here, although the new version shows clear evidence of more money having been spent on it. Also, hindsight shows Raimi's movie to have had a darkly comedic edge to it (perhaps not obvious in 1981), whereas I suspect it is unlikely that anyone will be discovering humour in the remake in 2043."
"baumer","8","10","54","6 April 2013"," Gory, grotesque and will leave you exhausted. The ballsiest horror film in quite some time
","Evil Dead is perhaps the riskiest, ballsiest, most gory horror film I've seen since the 80's. Once the book is opened and the demon stuff begins, it's an exercise is the grotesque. For the 60 minutes or so that this takes place, it left me exhausted watching it. One character in here, the one who stupidly reads the book after he knows he is not supposed to, goes through more pain than any horror movie character I have ever seen with the exception of perhaps some of the rapists in the new version of I Spit On Your Grave. But that's debatable. Anything and everything that can happen to this guy, does. In short, he gets messed up real bad.<br/><br/>The movie is not perfect as it is hampered by some really bad acting in some parts and by some really annoying characters in others. But horror movies are known for this so if you can get past really egregious performances in some spots, then you'll be fine. It's a small complaint really, but it does take away from the overall rating. Another point I have to bring up that bothered me a bit is that the Ash character ends up being a woman and maybe because to me ASH is ASH, he is a man, then I would have liked it better if David would have lost his arm and becomes the hero. That was one of the cool things about the original is that it didn't follow conventional rules. Women are always the hero in horror films. But in Evil Dead, Ash was. I wasn't comfortable with the change in this one. <br/><br/>And finally, even with a bigger budget, the tree rape scene in this one wasn't nearly as good as the original.<br/><br/>But those complaints aside, the movie was everything they said it would be. It made the audience jump a few times and the humour was also there like in the original.<br/><br/>The good in the film is everything else. Shotguns, hammers, nail guns, knives, glass, syringes and fire is all used to mess people up. I remember reading that in the original the cleanup on the set every night was a nightmare because of all of the goop they used for the blood. I can't imagine being a cleanup member on this set. There was gallons of blood used here and sometimes it looked more like molasses mixed with chocolate syrup mixed with red dye. It was pretty disgusting at times. I also enjoyed how duct tape was the answer to everything in the film. If you have a hole in you the size of China, just use duct, it'll fix you right up.<br/><br/>As mentioned, once the book is open, the pace the film plays at leaves you exhausted. It doesn't slow down in the least and every other scene someone is cutting their own arm off or getting attacked with a nail gun or getting violated by nature. It's a truly terrifying film.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I enjoyed it but not on the same level as the original. And there's nothing wrong with that as the original is one of the all time great horror films. But if you are in the mood for a bloodbath where blood literally spews on screen, this is the film for you. It does not disappoint.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","5 friends go up to a cabin in the woods to help one of them detox from some drugs. Going cold turkey proves to be more difficult when the uncover an ancient book of the dead, which is bound in human flesh and inked in human blood. When one reads from the pages, it unleashes an evil so grotesque and profound that nothing can stop it. Of course, someone reads from it....<br/><br/>Let me tell you where this review is coming from. I LOVE the original to death, it's my favourite horror film of all time. I've seen the red band trailer and I read the script, so I knew exactly what was going to happen. Did that hinder my enjoyment of the film? A bit, knowing some twists in the narrative makes the film lose some freshness, but I don't think the decision to stay true to the script was not all that great a choice. The film is a flawed attempt from people who love the source material. I can still give this remake a passing grade.<br/><br/>Where the film excels is the most obvious point I or anyone else will make in their reviews. The practical effects, mainly the gore. With only a few noticeable scenes in CGI blood, this film decides to use the gore that most horror fans are use to. It looks real, feels real and is actually refreshing to see. People were sad about the news of an Evil Dead remake until the RedBand trailer came out and they saw the carnage on screen. Most of the 'shocking' gore bits are in the trailer (tongue slice, face saw, arm cut, etc) So I don't think there will be a lot of surprises here, but they excel at presenting it in such an over the top, yet serious fashion. <br/><br/>The film looks great with some nice camera movements that add to the unsettling atmosphere. Once the crap hits the fan, it's a no holds barred blood fest. This remake plays it straight, offering little to no camp that can be found in the original series. There are obvious winks and nods to the original, involving chainsaws, hands and tweaked famous lines, but for the most part this entry tries to separate itself from the original. This is where it succeeds and fails in my opinion. <br/><br/>The reason they are there is a nice little way of keeping them there. One character has to detox from drugs, so obviously she will be the first one who senses something is wrong here but no one will believe her cause she's coming down from the drugs. This is the little bit of character background they try to squeeze in. This film is not concerned so much with character backstories, yet they try to present some to the audience. It makes for an odd and slow build up for the carnage. When it hits, we don't care about any of them either. I even forgot that the girlfriend was there because she disappears for most of the first act only to show up for her own gruesome scene.<br/><br/>The film is not scary at all. I was terrified of the original, this one didn't even have me jump at those cheap jump scares. I was scared of the cellar in Raimi's version. Here I think it is just gross. That's the main theme the film wants to get across it seems. It wants to gross you out, not terrify you, not make you smile, not make you care about anyone, just make you squirm at the blood. I have to give the film props for at least trying to separate itself from the original by making the story a bit of its own thing. Whether or not this works is another story. The one giant misstep, in my opinion, is when they try to make the evil and actual thing. The book reads that HE is coming, HE wants your soul, etc. The evil should not be characterized by a single demonic entity. I always envisioned the evil dead as multiple dead scary things. This is one direction that the film takes to separate itself, it fails in that aspect. <br/><br/>Finally, the climax of the film. There is one scene just before the climax, I have to add, which is mind boggling dumb. I was rolling my eyes reading the script and had hopes they would change it, they don't. Never before has the evil been so easily defeated and never more have I been so disappointed at a story choice. After that we get a bit of a character shift and the climax is a bloody mess. Again, this chase sequence feels less Evil Dead and more Friday the 13th stalker-ish. While it is thrilling to watch and ending with a bang, it feels out of place. <br/><br/>This Evil Dead is gruesome, but some fun is to be had. A flawed remake that could have been so much worse. For those interested, there is a little after the credits bit that, even though feels half-assed, is a nice fan service moment."
"richieandsam","7","4","16","1 May 2013"," I liked it, but did expect more.
","EVIL DEAD<br/><br/>I was looking forward to this film so much... I hate the way everything is being remade at the moment... but seeing as Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell were both involved in this, I thought it was going to amazing! It was very good... but I was still disappointed.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of people that go into a cabin in the woods to help their friend get off of drugs... she is going cold turkey. They discover in the cellar a load of dead animals and a book that is wrapped up in barb wire. One of them opens the book and starts to read it, which then lets in the demons that take over their bodies and goes on a massive killing spree.<br/><br/>I really liked the idea of them going there to help their friend... it makes a change. In most horror films, they always end up in the cabin in the woods just for a holiday or a trip out etc... finally a different excuse to be shacked up in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>There was so much gore in this film... and I loved it. The ways that the murders happened were really well done and some where very inventive... but unfortunately, most of the ways they happen have been seen before. It seems the guys making it wanted to scare the audience with shock value other than being actually scary. You saw everything (almost). There was no mystery or moment that had me on the edge of my seat wondering if they will get out alive. It was pure violence.<br/><br/>The other way this film might have scared some people was the jump scares... there seemed to be a lot of them. So many times in the film, there were things jumping out or loud noises right in the middle of a quiet period of the movie... they were put there to make everyone jump. It's a shame, because this is a cheap way of scaring someone and I am not a huge fan of it in horror films. I like it to happen once in a movie... but when it happens so many times it loses the effect. This film did not make me jump once. I was expecting most of them to come.<br/><br/>The acting was actually quite good... I have never heard of any of the actors in this film, which is a very good thing for a horror. I always find it to be more believable when you don't have a familiar face on the screen. That way you have no idea if they will survive or not. We all know that if there was a horror film starring Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp, the likely hood of either of them dying is very slim. Although it is possible as we found out from Scream... poor Drew Barrymore.<br/><br/>The whole cast was great... not one bad actor among them. I hope their careers take off now from this.<br/><br/>The make up and special effects were very good. I can't fault it at all... everyone looked really freaky and scary. I really liked they way they looked when they were possessed.<br/><br/>All in all this film was really good... But I guess I was just expecting it to be a bit more mystery and was hoping I would have to use my imagination more. Sometimes that can be more scary than seeing everything.<br/><br/>I will give this film 7 out of 10. But I was expecting to give it a higher mark before I went to see it.<br/><br/>Maybe it would have been slightly better if Sam Raimi directed it.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:<br/><br/>https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl"
"Radish4ever","5","4","16","20 April 2013"," Fails to put Groovy in the evil dead movie
","I was never a huge fan of the original Evil dead, however I admired how a movie can be made so well on such a low budget, and of course it made our video nasty list in the UK in the mid 80's. I did find Evil dead 2 extremely funny and a lot of gory fun at the cinema a few years back but did not have hugely high expectations for this. Its a remake that does throw in a couple of interesting changes from the original though, the book being indestructible for one thing (reminded me of the excellent Fri13th TV show - the antique shop) and the explanation of why 4 young people would stay in a cabin in the middle of a forest, which was to cold turkey off drugs. Apart from that adds little else. The film also throws in lots of gore and buckets and buckets of blood at the screen and although I did not hate it the film, I did not love it either. Watch for a extra scene after the end credits. Definitely going to cancel my cabin holiday now lol. Compared to the original I would favour this one very slightly.<br/><br/>A generous 5 out of 10, it did the best it could. Not bad but Definitely not groovy!"
"jboothmillard","8","5","22","21 April 2013"," Evil Dead
","The original 1981 version, starring Bruce Campbell (who here produces with original director Sam Raimi) is one of my favourite scary movies, with its over the top blood spill and dark humour, but I was actually looking forward to reboot, I heard it was going to be more scary than funny. Basically five friends, car shop owner David (Shiloh Fernandez), school teacher Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), recovering drug addict and David's sister Mia (Jane Levy), nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) meeting at an old cabin in the woods. The group have gathered there to help Mia get clean after an incident where she overdosed and for a moment was medically dead; they agree that she will attempt to escape, so they make sure they will stop her. Soon after arriving there is complaints of the smell, and under the rug they uncover a cellar door, and going down to investigate they find animal corpses wrapped in barbed wire, a shotgun and an old book covered with a black trash bag. Eric takes the book out , and he scrolls through it to find many strange demonic images and translations scattered in big letter, and he traces and reads out hidden words from the pages, awakening a demon. Mia starts being haunted by the demon, and she begs to leave the cabin, but as agreed the group refuse to let her leave, but she gets away and tries to drive away, but she ends up crashing the car and running into the woods, where she is trapped in the thorns, and possessed they tangle her up and the thorny black tendril rapes her. The group find her and take her back to the cabin, they refuse to believe her claims thinking it she is suffering hallucinations from her drugs habit, but after finding the dog killed with a hammer and Mia severely burning herself with boiling water in the shower David is prepared to take her to hospital, but the bridge is blocked by a flood. Back in the cabin they are about to sedate the drug addict, but she grabs the shotgun and shoots her brother in the arm, and in a demonic voice she says that they are all going to die, she momentarily collapses, but then wakes to vomit blood on Olivia's face, and she falls into the cellar to be locked in by Eric. Soon after Eric finds Olivia is possessed as well as he catches her cutting her own skin off her face, and she repeatedly stabs him trying to kill him, until he grabs a large piece of the broken sink and smashes her head and kills her. David helps him with his wounds, and Natalie check son Mia when she sounds unpossessed, only end up bitten on the hand and with blood being vomited on in the mouth, and moments later the black infection in her hand slowly takes over her arm and will spread, but still focused she grabs an electric knife and severs her arm off to stop possession. Eric is convinced that reading passages from the old book he has released an evil that will one by one take them over, and attempting to burn the book it is futile, and he explains that the book details a demon that will take over five souls and cause the sky to bleed and release the Abomination from Hell. He also explains that the book says that there are only three ways to end the terror, burying the first possessed person alive, dismembering their body, or burning them to death, David of course refuses to do any of these things, and then the two of them are attacked by a now possessed Natalie with a nail gun, until she is hit to death with a crowbar. As the only one left David decides to listen to the words of the book, and he soaks the cabin with gasoline and plans to the set it on fire with Mia inside, but he changes his mind and goes to tranquilise Mia, but she attacks him, and before dying Eric saves him, and David buries his paralysed sister wrapped up, unconvinced by her momentary return to normality and upset by her taunting. He knows that she is dead, so he quickly unearths her and improvises a defibrillator to bring her back, but she does not respond to the electric charge, but when he looks away she is suddenly awake and no longer possessed, and Eric momentarily comes to warn them of their doom, before the cabin and he are set alight, with David inside. The final stage of the prophecy from the book has occurred, so it begins raining blood, and the Abomination comes from beneath the ground and chases after Mia, in the process she gets a few deep flesh wounds, and her arm gets trapped forcing her to pull it off, but she kills the demon grabbing a chainsaw mashing it through its face, the remains sink into the earth, it stops raining and Mia walks away, but the old book remains. I can only think of a few good examples where a remake, or reboot, has turned out as good as, if a little better, than the original, e.g. True Grit, I Spit on Your Grave, especially in the scary movie market it is difficult to remake a film considered a classic, but this one succeeds. The cast, especially Levy, are good, the new story with the terror first seen as cold turkey visions is clever, the removal of original character Ash doesn't matter, and the change to rehabilitation trip instead of vacation is interesting, but of course what made this film for me was indeed the still over the top gore effects, with scenes like blood falling from the sky and chainsaws going through faces it is spectacular to watch, it has jumpy and funny moments and good music too, it is a fantastic horror film. Very good!"
"NightmareOnElmStreetFan","1","3","11","20 September 2019"," Trashy mess, god bad, awful flick, poorly paced - lame excuse of a movie that breaks all the rules
","I watch this film last night and i still don't like it. I hate it in 2016 and since than I have not seen this film until yesterday and i still don't like it. I am going to get a lot of hate for not likeing this film and a lot of votes down for my review. I am alone on this and I think this movie is god awful, terrible flick. It is not a good movie at all, it is not a scary original concept. It wasn't scary or creative enough, this film broke a lot of rules. Some people think this movie is better than the original ""The Evil Dead"" that movie is old school classic horror film this movie is trashy mess. I will explain why I still don't like it:<br/><br/>The movie is boring, the pacing is god awful slow. This film broke a lot of rules from the original The Evil Dead (1981) movie. Since when in The Original Evil Dead trilogy you saw people burning the cabin down and burning bodys? Or burning people alive, since when? Shouldn't be in the book of the dead a passage that could call it off the evil mean spirits and suck them in a portal of hell? That was in Evil Dead 2 and they did not use that concept in this movie! The rape scane in which Mia (Jane Levy) was raped by treas was laughable and when she was possessed by evil spirits was a mess and she was a joke. It wasn't executed well, it wasn't original, it wasn't believable. All the characters are terrible and not likeable. They went and killed off likeable characters. The filming locations are terrible, they were filming in New Zealand. The filming locations of this movie was god awful. The music was terrible, the acting was irritating, The movie was nothing new or fresh.<br/><br/>If actress Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie would at least survive or been a main heroine I would like it. The actress Elizabeth Blackmore was at least likeable good, but no they killed her off! Director Fede Alvarez probably did not like the actress, so he killed her character off, well thanks a lot Alvarez! Actor Shiloh Fernandez as David was good likeable. I would give it pass if in this movie David would be the main hero and survivor at least but NO! Alvarez killed him too, he did not care!!!! The actresss Jane Levy as Mia was ugly gross and god damn ugly she was not beliveble enough as the main heroine! How did she know how to use chainsaw against an evil possessed demon? It wasn't writen in the book! The movie has a foul bad language. Every character in every sentence is swearing. The only swearing I heard from Ash was in Army of Darkness and that was it. I do not tolorate bad launguage in this movie!<br/><br/>Why did they had to burn the cabin? Why did this movie killed animals? Since when in the original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy were killing animals? Mia kills dog and the movie kills cats. I guess this movie has no respeact to living beings animals. Mia played by Jane Levy was a drug addicted who get possessed by evil spirt and just like that her brother David bury's her. Kills her and get's her alive like that on a miracale fantasy way. The effects for the ""Evil Dead"" mean spirits were awful not beliveble. Mia riped her hand off after she got stuck by a car but she wasn't hurting, she wasn't in pain like seriously? Mia should passed out or been in shocked without an arm it is impossible to rip your hand off like that.<br/><br/>This movie breaks a lot of rules from the first original ""The Evil Dead"" movie. A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge breaks the rules from the first movie, but that movie get's crap, get's complain by fanboys it is gay, it breaks all the rule but this movie dosen't break the rules? Get 's better raiting by fan boys and get's the praise but A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge doesen't ? Some fans prefer this movie over the original movie. I am like what? Why? really? How is this movie better than the original film? It is based on original film and the story is not new, it is not decent it broke all the rules with terrible cast. So how is this movie better than the original old school horror movie? It is not even rated NC-17 it is hardly rated R, it is not gory, the blood is fake. Some people even prefer this movie over Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn I am like what? Does this people know how to rate a movie? How is this remake or reboot better than Evil Dead 2?<br/><br/>The filming locations in New Zealand in the woods were awful. The weather was lousy. Why the crew did not went filming the movie locations somewhere else: why they did not filmed the movie in forest Scotland? the forests there are beautiful places area. In Glasgow they are beautiful forest there too. Or in Tennessee US like was the original film shot, why did they not use those filming locations. They could filmed this film in North Carolina, USA like they filmed the sequel, better atmosphere there than is in here. The main heroine did not used shotgun or chainsaw that well. Jane Levy was ugly in this movie. Eric played Lou Taylor Pucci was a dumbass because, he released the evil spirits and he was responsible for the murder of his friends. Eric, Mia and Olivia played by Jessica Lucas were not likable cast.<br/><br/>This movie was way too overdramatic for my taste and not that good. The Evil Dead (1981), Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn are MILES way better old school classic horror films, this film failes to be a good horror film. A Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2: Freddy's Revenge get's crap and has lower raking and it is still better horror movie than this reboot is! Yes I like Freddy's Revenge more. The Hills Have Eyes (2006) is a bloody slasher reboot that is MILES way better than this reboot and the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"" movie. That movie is a real horror movie this is NOT! The Blair Witch Project (1999) is a better horror movie in the woods, that movie is better yes I like it better than this ""Evil Dead"" remake. Friday the 13th (2009) reboot is better than this reboot.<br/><br/>This is poorly paced excuse film, they bringed Bruce Cambell on the end of the credits and his face is stone cold and he doesn't make nothing for me. This movie is a failure that's all I have to say. This is my review of a poorly paced lame excused of a movie that was only cash grab. P."
"deatman9","6","8","43","6 April 2013"," Not as good as I had hoped.
","This movie was entertaining enough for the most part but I felt it lacking overall but that may just be because I had heard about this movie about a year ago and I have been waiting ever since then so I was hoping for something really good that could have lowered my opinion of it.<br/><br/>The first thing you will here people say is there is tons of gore. Now I don't know If I have became totally desensitized over the years from watching some of the disturbing movies I have watched but for me this movie was not that gory. It had a couple moments with some pretty intense gore but the scenes were very short. I fear that they had to cut many scenes out of it.<br/><br/>Overall though despite the hype it was a decent movie. The acting was good for the most part and it did have some creepy moments in it however I think many of the creepy parts were cut out and toned down seeing how many of the parts in the red band trailer were not in the movie.<br/><br/>Not as scary or as gory as I had hoped but I have seen every scary and disturbing movie out there so my opinion may not be valid as I don't get scared."

"mayostrain","10","2","6","29 April 2014"," Horror gore lovers
","This is definitely a movie for gore lovers, to say that this was a bad movie simply because of the gore is a bit much, horror is horror of all kinds. The story is great like the original from beginning to end with a few reminders from the original in the reimagining. I think props and blood and guts have a good deal in horror movies, I can appreciate a great ghost story or an insane family, but not to have gore and massive amounts of blood also helps its part in modern day horror films. Even in a comedic way, the amount of blood is staggering and sometimes there to just freak out the audience. So join us evil dead fans in your support for making this movie as good as it was meant to be."
"mattimelb-three","9","2","6","7 December 2013"," They did everything right!
","I am the biggest fan of Evil Dead original, and this new Evil Dead was brilliant! So you've heard the ""fans"" of the original say they didn't like the remake? What a bunch of wonkers! I hope I can say wonkers on here? (I had to change the 'a' to an 'o') Anyway, I have watched Evil Dead ever since I was in my teens. Adam and I have had nights where we just watched Evil Dead all night. Often the second and third following, and we love all the movies. I was one of the first people to own Evil Dead 1-2-3 on DVD. The reason for this was that you couldn't buy it here. I had to get someone to buy it from the US for me. I ended up getting multiple copies with slightly altered bits. I love each DVD I got. Anywho, I just wanted to stress that I am a fan of the original but still loved the remake. I don't think they could have done it better. It's a great movie with some fantastic scenes. Of course, it's horror, so it has quirks, but it's just more to love about it. Why didn't I give it 10 then, because I am yet to give a movie 10/10. I loved Looper and Chronicles of Riddick, but they are still a 9. A show would have to blow me away first before it got 10/10. Maybe if it written by me ;) My short stories are out there for movie makers to read, so you never know! To finish up, if you like A-B-like grade horror (because this had a slightly higher budget than other crap horrors), then get it. You'll like it as much as you did Cabin in The Woods (note, these two shows are not similar, but they are both good horrors)."
"LeonLouisRicci","2","2","6","26 October 2013"," No ""The"" in the Title...Because there is nothing Particular
","This one has Absolutely No Chance at becoming a Cult Movie because it Lacks Virtually Anything that is a Prerequisite for such an Elevated Perch.

"mergatroid-1","7","2","6","16 October 2013"," A great movie
","I am a big fan of the original movies even though the second movie was basically identical to the first movie. I loved the Army of Darkness. Great camp there.<br/><br/>The first two movies were low budget attempts at semi serious horror. At the time they were made, this wasn't exactly a common type of movie, and they were just about as low budget as a movie could get.<br/><br/>That was OK though because of the talent of Campbell and Raimi. They made the movie what it was. I really don't understand why they made the second one though as it was basically exactly like the first one.<br/><br/>However, both of those movies evolved into The Army of Darkness, which was way less horror and way more comedy. That was fine too, as it gave us something different from what was expected in an Evil Dead movie.<br/><br/>Fast Forward to 2012 and we see what Raimi really wanted in his originals. True horror, and lots of realistic blood and guts. The plot is very similar to the first two, but as others have mentioned, there is no ""Ash"" in this movie, which I did miss, but it really didn't take anything away from this movie as it stands on its own as a great horror movie.<br/><br/>So, what you will get is: The cabin in the woods (check). The roads impassible (check). The necronomicon (check). Multiple dumb teenagers just asking for it (check).<br/><br/>At this point, things take a change for the serious. Unlike the previous films, this is not a comedy, or a cheap horror film. This movie goes all out to show us exactly why people should stay away from books bound in human flesh. If this was back in the 60s or 70s, they would likely be giving away barf bags.<br/><br/>I've read some of the reviews from some fanboys who think the first movies were the second coming or something. They were really fun movies, and I love them, but they were not great movies by any stretch of the imagination. The Army of Darkness came closest to being a great movie, but it was more comedy than horror, while the first two were obviously going more for horror, but were low budget affairs.<br/><br/>I believe this is what the first movie would have been like if Raimi had the cash to make it at the time.<br/><br/>So, if you want to see a real horror flick, with lots of blood and gore (and really, not ""just for the sake of blood and gore"" but because, as we know from the earlier movies, blood and gore is what you get if you read that damn book) if you like horror, absolutely see this movie. Just be ready for a real blood bath."
"offbased","8","2","6","28 September 2013"," The best remake of a horror film since Dawn of the Dead.
","Supercharge remake (or Sequel) to Sam Raimi's cult classic lacks the innocent low budget charm that made the original so beloved by many but make up for it with a savage look at human frailty that goes for the gusto in brutality and gory shocks. The acting here is much better in my opinion than the original film ( Save for Bruce Campbell, whose goofy and charming presence can't be matched). The real highlight here is Jane Levy, who is not Bruce Campbell by any means but brings a brave, gutsy bravado that in my opinion is just as good as Campbell's performance in the original. Her performance as Mia is the film's biggest strength and with out it, i don't think the movie would have worked nearly as well. Levy manages to give a dark and complex performance that is a tightrope of nerves and raw talent. Her performance really lifts this film above and beyond its horror roots and gory set ups and the film benefits greatly from it. The special effects in this film were superb and while the story is not an original idea, at least it makes the reasons for those kids being in that cabin plausible and makes the characters more human than a group of dumb teens looking to score in more ways than one.<br/><br/>Its with out a doubt the best remake of a horror film since Dawn of the Dead and i hope we see more of Jane Levy in the sequel.<br/><br/>B+"

"Nothinggrandproductions","2","2","6","8 September 2013"," Filled with all of the Horror Clichés of the past 10 years
","When the idea of an Evil Dead remake was announced, I was nothing more than confused. Why? Why does this need to exist? The three Evil Dead films make for a solid trilogy of fun, over the top, horror-comedy flicks that are unbelievably entertaining. They had no place being remade in the first place but let's forget that. This film isn't Evil Dead even if it has the title. Rather it goes for a serious approach and only really takes a few elements of the original film. That doesn't change the fact that almost everything about this film is stereotypical horror that has been released in the past 10 years.<br/><br/>The movie begins with a strange opening sequence that feels completely out of place and by the end of the film, seemed to exist for absolutely no reason at all. It was simply a fluff piece to start the film off with something exciting which already feels cheap. Then we move right on ahead to Mia (Jane Levy), David (Shiloh Fernandez) her brother, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) who is David's girlfriend. And don't worry, none of those characters matter because you won't care about any of them. Sure, that's most horror movies but there isn't ANYTHING redeeming about this film in regards to plot, characterization, any of that at all. Look at a film like A Nightmare On Elm Street (not the atrocity of a remake) which has an interesting character like Freddy Krueger and the film focuses on the use of dreams. Evil Dead just focuses on being as bloody as possible like nearly every horror film in the past 10 years.<br/><br/>All of them arrive at the cabin for a typical stupid reason except it isn't the stereotypical one surprisingly. Rather, Mia is recovering from heroin cold turkey in the middle of the woods at a cabin with her friends. So, no really, how dumb are these people? Go visit a doctor and get proper rehab! The film proceeds to eventually turn Mia into the zombie-thing and takes itself so unbelievably seriously for no reason. Some of the performances will give you a laugh though. The line delivery can be equivalent to some bad b-movie you saw last week at 4 A.M. sometimes, which therefore, causes some great cringe. Or maybe you'll enjoy it when one of the characters get turned into a zombie and starts peeing on the floor. Or how about masses of blood throw up? Tree rape used as exposition? Nail gun fights with zombies used in a serious context? Sure, I'm nitpicking. I just can't help it because it's been awhile since a film has really just left me unhappy.<br/><br/>Did I mention how none of this is scary or terrifying in anyway? You've seen it all before. Loads of blood. Buckets of blood. We have literal raining blood at one point (which I won't deny, was actually a good atmospheric choice). I'm not sure how this film got advertised as ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"" covering half the poster. Not once did I feel remotely scared, I was cringing mostly at the stupidity of it all. None of this is unique. Or interesting. Or good. If you've seen some of the horror films released in the past 10 years, you've seen this movie probably. Sure, the special effects work is great and it's nice to not see much CGI at all in a horror flick but that doesn't change the fact that none of this is unique as much as it tries to be this so-called ""re-imagining."" <br/><br/>I sincerely wanted to love this film. As I said before, when it was first announced I was just questioning why. But, then again, it's modern Hollywood. Then, the trailers came out. I was shocked. The movie actually looked fantastic. I was going to see it in theaters but never ended up doing it and I finally managed to watch it on DVD. My expectations had dwindled down by this time and I went into it with fairly low expectations, just expecting something that would be entertaining for 90 minutes. Rather, instead I got horrible performances (for the most part, Jane Levy does a decent job), unbelievably dumb characters, and a been there done that feel. And an ending that was obviously done to force a sequel. Seriously. But to avoid full-on spoilers, I won't talk about that. The thing is, I really expected this movie to avoid the horror genre tropes and stereotypes. Instead, it emphasized them. The entire film was stereotype after stereotype while some of the violence, horror, and gore just made me cringe, not because I was disgusted (none of that really affects me nowadays), rather because of how much it's been done. I don't think I have much else to say, I went onto ramble more than I should but I don't care. Forget this film and all of the mass of remakes that keep coming out."
"jjq224","7","2","6","3 August 2013"," Don't read the ""haters"" reviews.

Why would you want to see an exact duplicate? This isn't the 80's anymore and camp is not necessary in horror films.<br/><br/>Second, yes, there is no Ash - and you know what? Bruce Campbell, who is a producer of this film, was OK with that and in fact said in the extras that they specifically didn't WANT to have Ash in it. That period is over and done with it.<br/><br/>Third, contrary to some of the comments, Sam Raimi co-wrote and produced this remake. So to say it is a slap in the face to him doesn't even make sense.<br/><br/>I truly think 90% of the ""1"" rated reviews didn't even SEE the movie and are writing a review based on the three facts above.<br/><br/>Was it scary, not really. Was it gory, sometimes - and yes, WAY over the top at the end.

","In the intro we meet a sweet girl about to be immolated by her parents. her mom recites lines in a foreign language from a book. The girl isn't so innocent, but possessed, and burning her alive is the solution to rid the evil.<br/><br/>Later we meet 5 kids at a cabin, 3 girls and 2 guys. We learn that they aren't there for fun but for an intervention. One of the girls is a hopeless junkie who ODd repeatedly and nearly lost her life. Her brother is there, his girlfriend, and a couple- he's a school teacher and she's conveniently a nurse and brought all the medication necessary to have the girl stop drugs cold turkey.<br/><br/>The next day the girl, Mia, is starting to show withdrawal symptoms, she smells something. Sure enough, the kids eventually go the basement and find countless dead cats hanging from the ceiling as well as the burned post and the book from the intro. The book is covered in black plastic and bound with barbed wire.<br/><br/>Mia starts losing it more and more and the teacher guy decides to browse through the book and pronounce some of strange words which awakes some evil force in the woods. When Mia escapes, drives into a ditch and stumbles through the woods she encounters some girl/ghost that spits out some branches that make it to Mia's nether regions. Back at the cabin, Mia flips out and attacks everyone till they lock her in the basement. The nurse decides to cut her mandible off with a piece of glass and the other girl cuts her arm off with an electric carving knife. At some point finally the teacher guy realizes what he has done. And that they're not dealing with some disease or just madness. The ways to eliminate the evil are rather brutal and gory, and Mia's brother doesn't have the guts to go through with any of those until he has no choice.<br/><br/>The original Evil Dead is one of the few great horror movies that could deserve a remake given how long ago it was made on a small budget. This Evil Dead is more of a new vision of the original. It's true to the motifs- the book, the clock, the basement, the chainsaw, etc. but it doesn't make much of a cohesive whole. Lacking also is some humor. And as with most movies these days, character development is near zero, we can't care about any of these people, and this movie is also somewhat unclear about who the main character is. It tries to get us to think that it's the brother, but it wouldn't be a 2000s movie without a female heroine so out of no good reason we get just that. Completely unnecessary is also the usual creepy J-horror evil girl who comes out of nowhere. The book talks of the evil force as a ""he"" not some girl. Also weak are the sounds and voices. The original Evil Dead used voices and sounds very effectively to create a scary atmosphere. This version doesn't at all. What this one does offer though is a lot of blood, violence, and some gore. It's nice to see a movie for theatrical release that is so enthusiastic about it, but that doesn't really make up for all its shortcomings.<br/><br/>The surprise is that this movie wasn't as terrible as it could have been given that the director/writers are foreigners with barely any experience making movies. You can tell they are fans of horror, but you need a bit more than just that to make a stand out horror movie, especially one that carries the mighty name ""Evil Dead."" IMDb shows that Diablo Cody was involved in the writing of the movie, but the movie itself doesn't credit her. And that is exactly what this movie needed, additional writers to make the story more than just a bunch of bloody gags, and to inject some personality and humor, because to a large extent, that made the original so unforgettable. This new version is somewhat generic, efficient, bloody, but soulless as most of these reboots/re-envisions are. It's a good horror movie but not a good ""Evil Dead"" movie."

","Wow! What a relief this was to see that horror still exists and directors are beginning to understand the genre. Loved, loved, loved this move from start to finish. Excellent character development, I felt the love between brother and sister which was absolutely great! I went into this movie with an open mind, having never seen the original and had no idea what I was up against. The gore, the story, the plot, rising resolutions all held the attention of the audience and even caused me to shake a little. I trembled as the movie reached its climax and found myself completely horrified from all the gore and the deaths which had taken place. <br/><br/>I am not here to spoil this adventure for anyone and encourage individuals who are looking to see horror revived to take time and watch this movie. Great way to start the spring and a great way to say ""no more BS horror flicks"". Thank you Evil Dead for setting the bar of what horror is supposed to look like....."

","Firstly I'd like to say...THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THE ORIGINAL! No 'Dark Comedy', 'Catchy One-Liners' and defiantly no Ash as one of the main roles! When I watched this movie, I had two things in mind.<br/><br/>1. This better be as good as the trailers presented it to be.<br/><br/>2. Is this a Remake, Prequel, Sequel...etc. To the originals.<br/><br/>Now, for one thing i did defiantly enjoy this movie. I have read a lot of other user reviews, fair enough there have been fair points made for and against this movie. Some I have already stated. This movie for one thing is defiantly a close to perfection Sam Raimi movie clone, but not an 'Evil Dead' title. It is a dark horror movie, but from what I saw from a poster saying 'The Most Terrifying Experience..' NO! IT IS NOT! There was one scene in particular that did make me jump, but I will not spoil it for you. Defiantly contained Horror elements, but not a terrifying experience. The Trailers had extra scenes that were not included in the final cut, such as the main protagonist 'David' Hacking up something with the chainsaw. But besides that part being cut out, the movie still kept me entertained all the way through with the character progression, the blood, the gore and defiantly the deadites. This movie deserves more credit and a few better reviews. I am a major fan of the old movies, but this movie does not deserve the hate it has been presented. The first Evil Dead movie contained no comedy, and this one didn't either. So why does this one deserve lower ratings than the original? yes, its modern, different, but still very interesting for a modern re-do for an old time classic. Please give it a chance, it deserves better."

"drm2642","9","4","17","18 May 2013"," Great Remake!
","I do not get all the hate that I see people throwing up for this movie. It was an excellent remake of the original. It stuck to the basic premise of the original, but then made the story it's own. Some people where complaining that Mia is a drug addict. Really? Is this something worth bitching about? Is the lead character a junkie? Sure, drugs are a problem these days, especially heroin so why not make the character more realistic? Furthermore what is so wrong with having a group of people going out to their cabin in the woods to help their friend with a detox? The entire idea of the one getting the detox being possessed is great as well, it makes it so the characters can go, ""Oh she's not really possessed she is just going through with drawl."" And then BAMM! Once they realize what is really going on it is too late! I thought that the way the Necronomicon made it into the house was clever. Another family had a possessed girl in the woods and some gypsy witch craft peeps had to burn the demon out. So what did they do they broke into a random cabin and did it there. Was it a bad idea to leave the book there? Sure, but this is a horror movie people! Bad ideas are what make these things awesome! The fact is this movie progressed through just about every scene or theme from the original, but did it in its own way. The bridge got washed out. A girl was raped by a demonic tree, which lead to her possession. And every time a character, specifically a female character, would wander off by herself she would get possessed. I was a little disappointed that no one said ""Groovy"" at any point, but I can forgive that. Another great thing about this movie was the way the demons talked! The sound of their voices was perfect! It reminded me of a more serious take on the cheese of the original. Also the filthy things that these creatures said was spot on! Once again in the original trilogy these monsters are spewing out filth! The last praise I want to give this movie goes to the lead, Jane Levy. Some of the looks that she had on her face, especially when she was being chased by the Abomination was so Campbell esc that I wondered if somehow the man had be de-aged and then changed into a small hot female. Serously, she had the Bruces' terrified look down to a T."

","I don't know what movie the other reviewers saw, but I loved it. I won't lie, there were some spots I thought were a little hack kneed, but on the whole, I was impressed. I am a very big Bruce Campbell/Sam Raimi fan. I knew which movie they were remaking. The first Evil Dead was supposed to be scary. It wasn't, so they made Evil Dead II which is hilarious. Like you all, I can't wait for them to make the next Army of Darkness movie with Bruce. But I'm not going to be mad I didn't get to see him in this. I mean, I love him, but 1981 was a long time ago. I don't think Bruce would have fit the demographic. The story line was weak, but I don't think the story line has much to do with whether a movie is scary or not. I would've liked to see a little stronger character development, but I thought it was proper scary. Scary is why you go see horror movies in the theater. If you want academy award winning film, that's drama. You can wait for that to come out on DVD. If you're a real Sam Raimi fan, check out Zombie Roadkill on You Tube. It's as funny as chipmunks huffing helium. You can also check out my website http://auntiemimshorrormoviereview.weebly.com/ If like me, you think the haters of this movie were wrong."

","OK, so first off, I haven't seen the original! So I wasn't going in with preconceptions of what the film should be. I think that's where all these 1 star reviews come from, because there is always going to be a massive amount of added pressure to please the first generation of fans when remaking a 'classic'. No, this film isn't original, the back story all happens very quickly, but this is done to get you to the catharsis asap! this ain't no drama! What happens to the characters from then on is gripping and intense, you won't get a moments rest. It is hard to take the film completely seriously, because of the situations the characters find themselves in, but its all part of the fun, and what comes with dealing with gory demonic possession. Although there were plenty of moments where I was able to suspend my disbelief and experience the intensity of what the teenagers were experiencing. So know what to expect when going to see this, You wont find interesting plot, clever dialogue or Oscar nominations. But you will get an entertaining, fun, gory ride to hell and back!"
"TheSquiss","7","4","17","3 May 2013"," Hold on to your intestines; something very bad is about to happen.
","It's been a while since I saw a genuine horror film (I'm glossing over American Mary, which was horrific for all the wrong reasons), the previous one being last year's superb Sinister, a film that really got under the skin and made my drive home through the dark country lanes a great deal more unnerving then usual. The arrival of Evil Dead, a re-imagining of Sam Rami's 1981 classic, ensured I could put off the first fright of the year no longer. Shattered from a day of chopping wood, I wondered if it would engage or terrify sufficiently to prevent me from dropping off in the Cineworld darkness.<br/><br/>No worries there! <br/><br/>There's more reason to the plot of Fede Alvarez' update, with David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) arriving at a woodland cabin to offer moral support to his sister, Mia (Jane Levy), as she goes cold turkey under the supervision of her friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). They discover evidence of some very dark dealings in the basement and, while Mia is busy fighting her own demons, Eric discovers a book secured with barbed wire and bound in human skin, and unwittingly unleashes something very, very demonic indeed.<br/><br/>Evil Dead isn't a film you watch in the hope of mind-blowing performances but, bar the occasional wooden moment, all five principals romp along perfectly convincingly and it doesn't seem right to single out one above the others. Compare the performances here with those in last year's teen blood-flick, Piranha 3DD, and you'll forgive the odd slip from this quintet. When the odd wince moment arrives (David doesn't know where his heart is, for instance), the splatter and gore more than make up for it.<br/><br/>Alvarez, making a spectacular leap into Hollywood as both writer and director in his feature debut AND his first film foray in English, knows how to make bodily fluids spray horrifically. By the time the final credit rolls, we've seen just about every leakage the human body can produce and most at terrific velocity. Put it this way, it's gonna take one heck of a cleaner to sort this mess out! <br/><br/>I'm ashamed to admit that I only got around to watching Raimi's original The Evil Dead a couple of months ago. The friend I watched it with informed me it was the first film to give him nightmares. Thirty-two years later and instead of frights it causes mild hysteria with the prosthetics and effects as rubbery as Bruce Campbell's acting. Alvarez, however, while keeping an eye on the original, has ramped up the horror and gore all the way to 11 and there are more occasions than I care to remember when I found myself pushing back in my seat to escape or half covering my face involuntarily.<br/><br/>People talk flippantly about hairs standing up on the back of the neck, but Evil Dead manages to do just that. It isn't pant-wettingly terrifying but is far more than just 'scary'. Alvarez avoids the cheap shots of building the music and knocking over a vase only for it to be a cute kitten wandering innocently into the house. Here, when the tension builds, hold on to your intestines because something very bad is about to happen. Every time! <br/><br/>The prosthetics and make-up are stunning and matched only by the physical effects. It's a tragedy in the making because, come March 2014, the Oscar for best makeup will probably be won by another 'serious' drama (Les Misérables in 2013, The Iron Lady in 2012 etc.) instead of by Patrick Baxter and his team for Evil Dead. Regardless, I don't think we'll see better amputations and disfigurements on the big screen this year.<br/><br/>The biggest issue with Evil Dead is that it has too many endings and, until we reach the grand finale when the fat lady stops singing and disembowels herself instead, we know that each one is a false conclusion. It's an annoyance but it doesn't detract too much from the overall impact. Two warnings, though: Don't use this as a first date and empty yourself at both ends before you sit down to watch it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best summary of Evil Dead comes from my companion for the evening, Ben Mears (author of the Tyler May novels) who invented a new word for the occasion: ""What the hell did you make me sit through that for? It was s***ifying!"" <br/><br/>I don't know about you, but I'm going to sleep with my axe tonight! <br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","I watched the original Evil Dead about 1 year ago, as I'm 18 years old, I don't think I was alive when the original released to truly appreciate it. Although when I heard a remake/reboot was in the making I was really excited! The posters began promoting this as a truly 'terrifying experience' and I was not disappointed with this 2013 Evil Dead!<br/><br/>I'm not here to review the synopsis but I will mention minor spoilers which made this experience great! <br/><br/>Firstly, I felt that the character of Mia played by Jane Levy was brilliant whilst I was not too convinced by her on-screen brother (Shiloh Fernandez). The other two female characters were pretty useless as well. But Jane Levy's performance stood out! <br/><br/>As you may have heard a lot of the film scares come from gore, and you're correct but it truly does contain genuine jumpy moments! When I watched this movie I was jumping out of my seat and my jaw was on the ground as I looked in pure shock! I have never seen this much gore before but I was genuinely terrified as it contains thrills! <br/><br/>As a fan of the original I needed a reboot because of the old-school effects of the previous edition. But one flaw of this movie was that there was no similarity to the original in terms of the tape of the incantations and I would have loved a bit more back-story, (reboots tend to do that a lot). I love going to see horror films and I was really excited for this movie! If you don't like gore I don't recommend you see it! (My friends were crying in terror) but I you're the type of person who loves to go watch adrenaline pumping horror which is the perfect running time, go and watch this. Don't listen to bad reviews because the review is completely up to you! But go have fun and you won't regret the experience! Highly recommended and probably one of the best horror reboots in a long time! <br/><br/>If you're from the UK, I do not recommend staying after the credits because it was a waste of time when you see a tiny clip of 'Bruce Campbell' saying 'Groovy' which killed the scary moment! Haha! Enjoy!"

","I'd say 7.5 out of ten - and rate this film for viewing.<br/><br/>Initially; fans of the pure cult 1981 low budget classic will notice that the story has changed, a little. The fragmented and often annoying play at gluing the original narrative of the earlier cult flicks is thrown out. We have stability.<br/><br/>Mia (Jane Levy) and David (Shiloh Fernandez) are retreating to a remote Cabin with three of her - and David's old friends. To pull Mia out of addiction and force her to cold turkey her way to a Sober life. However; when things start to get eerie and Mia is thought to be hallucinating - the Demons are granted growth and time to manoeuvre their way one by one through the gang (as we predict).<br/><br/>The 'book of the dead' - again, becomes a great tool and narrative aid in forwarding and handing the audience some insight into whats coming next - and often bracing us for the pure gore that follows. Something which i greatly appreciated - reading some reviews that boar negativity and blight the realism; they should have watched. The gore and range of tools used to dismember and maim our unlucky friends is imaginative; beautifully real and offers something most of Hollywood flicks can't grasp - actual fear and no CGI!<br/><br/>Fantastic - legendary 'tree scene' - chainsaw, pliers, machete, electric meat slicer, broken glass, a nail gun, shotgun, boiling water, broken porcelain! Imagination we have - gore we have, narrative we have, decent acting we have - direction we have - Alvarez we Have!<br/><br/>References and minor lines used within the picture take us back to our original love - but as we are torn through the story and ultimate countdown; i loved my predictions being wrong. No time is wasted or unpacked with action - no kitchen utensil unused.<br/><br/>As for the negative feedback; i do understand - no person with an I.Q over ten would have stayed more than three minutes in that cabin (but then where would the fun be in that?) Our characters grow and true colours shine, and not without some very well-done dismemberment and tactful scheming. <br/><br/>What id say, do your research on this one - i was pleasantly surprised and hesitant going in; but i loved it. Well worth the ticket fare and maybe something to look out for on Blu Ray - i'd heart to see some extras. <br/><br/>A seventy day and night shoot is extremely impressive; no CGI and realism is superb - Alvarez deploys some very vintage wizardry tricks and camera work to make the audience cringe for more! He is a born tactician. If your not all too squeamish - and want to see a 'real' horror that wasn't scripted and shot in less than three days i'd say give it a go.<br/><br/>Left satisfied, bloody - surprised and wanting more - bravo! It took ten seconds of the picture for me to turn to my friend saying - 'well it's already better than insidious' - 7.5/10 - a big thumbs up from me.<br/><br/>If your unsure upon feedback given for this picture, swings and roundabouts leave you feeling attacked with folly - or any movie - go and see it yourself - this time; it pays off! Smiles against many recent releases with poor script + narrative substance; too much money and CGI! Brilliant. <br/><br/>2013 has seen its first taste of a solid horror thriller - and particularly a Solid rounded feature over-all. <br/><br/>Any comments please feel free - thank you - karl-meister."
"asda-man","8","4","17","21 April 2013"," Evil and deadly. A solid remake!
","Now, let's start off by addressing the elephant in the room. Evil Dead is not as good as the original, The Evil Dead. The original is a true classic in my opinion, although I am biased being a big horror fan. The idea of a remake intrigued me because something truly exciting could come out of the same set-up with a bigger budget and Evil Dead is that! I was hugely excited from the moment I saw the intense red band trailer which promised one hell of a horror film! Unfortunately, hopes started to deflate when Luke-warm reviews came out amidst a horde of rave reviews, so I scaled my hopes down and I'm glad I did because it isn't as great as the trailer. It is however one of the most hardcore horror films to come out in mainstream cinema in years, so it's no surprise that it's been a huge box office hit in America!<br/><br/>What's great about this film is that it isn't a complete carbon copy of the original. It has new characters, new set-pieces and a whole horde of differences. This is how a remake should be approached in my opinion, as I see no point in doing something shot-for-shot such as the Psycho remake, because it's already been done! Of course Evil Dead does feature some of the iconic scenes such as the infamous tree rape, but it's largely approached refreshingly differently. One thing I loved was that it wasn't about a bunch of dumb kids going to an old cabin to party at the weekend, rather about friends trying to help someone go cold turkey. This also allows for different interpretations, as it isn't clear how much of it is in the main girl's head.<br/><br/>Evil Dead thrives on its break-neck pace. The film gets into the action extremely quickly, even more quickly than the original I'd say, which is a huge plus for me. There really is not one dull moment and once the demon chaos starts, it really does not stop. It's a non-stop thrill ride with some really exciting and memorable moments, making it a film to be watched more than once. Like the original, the film feels like an ordeal, with some extremely tense moments. Also, like the original, it isn't afraid to shy away from the gore. It really isn't afraid to shy away at all! It's one of the bloodiest films I've seen in recent years, which makes it great fun and much more intense to watch. There's loads of cringey moments with a finale to die for. In fact, the finale features one of the best kills I've seen in any horror film, almost reaching the heights of THAT kill in Frontier(s).<br/><br/>My only real grip with Evil Dead is that the characters weren't particularly likable or that memorable, aside from main girl Mia. One of the great things about the original is that you could like all of the characters, but here it's difficult to feel sorry for them when they die (which sounds like a really awful thing to say). I would've liked to have seen more character building during the action, to really make the film strong, however as it remains it's still a very much above average horror film. The demons were also less memorable and far less frightening than the original, aside from the creepy Exorcist-styled demon of Mia. I also think the film would have benefited from some dark humour, as there were one or two moments of very dark humour which fitted the film well and would've added to its entertainment factor.<br/><br/>However, Evil Dead is still a pretty amazing remake, although probably not as good as Mother's Day or Last House on the Left, you can rest assure that it's better than the likes of The Hitcher and such. It's refreshing to see a real horror throw-back with outstanding practical effects, instead of cheap and lazy CGI (I say cheap, it's probably really expensive, but it looks cheap!). The amount of blood and gore is unholy, and makes for a very memorable horror film. I heavily enjoyed it, but non-horror fans will probably find it hard to like. It should certainly knock some sense into inexperienced kids who get freaked out by Paranormal 26 and the likes! I look forward to seeing it again, and it's definitely a film every horror fan should have proudly in their collection!"

"weareone1111","10","1","2","31 March 2019"," 10/10 for the Biased Reviews
","Great sequel to ""The Evil Dead"" from Sam Raimi in 1981. For those that say this is missing the slapstick humor of Bruce Campbell, this isn't a remake nor is it a sequel to Evil Dead 2 and AoD. This is a sequel to the original, which means it carries the spirit for what it was then (Serious and Disturbing). Unfortunately, this was not known to many so a lot of the 'negative' reviews are of people who see this as an inferior remake or as not a true successor to the trilogy as a whole. Remember Halloween from 2018? This is exactly the same approach. If you don't take my word for it, rewatch the film and keep an eye out for a rusted 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88. If that's not obvious enough, read the director's comment on this being a sequel to the original (the director is known as Fede Alvarez, hand selected by Sam Raimi himself); you're welcome.<br/><br/>P.S. If you have seen the theatrical cut of this film and liked it even in the slightest, I recommend watching the Director's Cut that was released a few months ago on Blu-Ray in preparation of the sequel Fede announced last year. I hope Bruce considers pushing two more out; Army of Darkness 2 (Mad Ash in Post-Apocalyptic Earth) & Evil Dead III (Ash-Mia Crossover), in which Ash attempts to return back to the present but ends up in a parallel reality where he died at dawn, giving Fede's Evil Dead Sequel a faithful direction with Ash's car remaining on the property."

","I went into this movie expecting very few of it because well... its a remake. But when you learn that Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi produced the film and were very involved, you start believing that this movie might be good.<br/><br/>Surprise, the movie is good. I believe that this is the movie Sam Raimi intended to do back in the first one, but had a limited budget (I am not saying this one is better than the first one).<br/><br/>The movie delivers on the gore and the scares as effectively as the old film. Every time someone gets cut or hurt, you feel it, just like in the first one.<br/><br/>I must say that the lead actors (although very good) do not stand near Bruce Campbell and his performance which really improved the first film. There are some issues with tone as well, the first and second act are more scary (like the first evil dead movie), and the third act just goes f*cking crazy and hilarious (like the second evil dead movie). Another problem is that if you thought the secondary characters of the first movie were not that good, these can be even more forgettable.<br/><br/>Some plot-holes of the first movie are answered in this one, which is very good. The movie also does some interesting twists with the story that turned out pretty good.

"kwq_e_500","5","1","2","3 January 2015"," Not Campbell's Evil Dead, but not that's not automatically bad
","OK, this is going to be a short review, as like 700 other viewers have hashed and rehashed just about every second of the film so .... To those who were disappointed that it ""wasn't like Ash's Evil Dead"" have to realize something - the original Evil Dead was by no means a horror movie. Yeah, it had demons, plenty of slash and gore, but come on - tiny Ash's tying giant ash down after they leap from shattered shards of a mirror and cavorting like drunk leprechauns isn't exactly horror is it? The genius of the original movie was from Campbell's over the top acting, like his deadpan description of the shotgun he's wielding as though he's back at his store demonstrating it for a customer was a hoot - the original was basically a comedic horror movie (is that actually a genre?) When they made this version, they had 2 choices. One, stay true to the spirit of the 1st, a silly, campy, pseudo horror film, or try to make it into an actual true horror movie. They chose the 2nd, and while it has it's moments, it lacks any true scares because they so obviously telegraphed their punches. There wasn't one suspenseful, jump out of your chair scare scene in the entire movie. Even if you hadn't seen the original, you could pretty much tell where this one was going, and what was going to happen next, just by following the book flipping itself to the next horrific violent scene ... I guess you could, if you were feeling generous, call it foreshadowing,but in reality, it was not just foreshadowing, where you're imagination leads you to what might happen next through subtle clues, it plain old told you, in explicit detail what was going to happen next - sort of a ""Dummies guide to being killed off by evil and demons while trapped in a cabin in the woods"" - true horror lets our brains let loose our own inner demons, what scares you the most might not be what is scary to someone else, but the mind sort of directs our worst fears to manifest - this was more like connect the dots and not a ""let your psyche unleash your inner, deepest fears"" - our minds can make the unknown more horrible and scary than having a director and producer decide we don't have that capacity to think for ourselves, but actually tell you pretty explicitly what's going to happen next. Campbell's genius was his madcap portrayal of a ""every man"" rising up to these fears in a way that was incredibly funny, campy, and get, scary at the same time - Now it seems like they have lost so much faith in viewers having the capacity to unleash their inner fears - this one gave us an illustrated road map of what was to come, and the actors (Mia, in my opinion, gave the best performance - yeah, she's going through the hell of drug withdrawal, but the other characters kind of give you the feeling that it's natural for a drug addict in withdrawal to speak in 3 voices simultaneously, vomit (projectile, no less!) a gallon of blood, and be OK. Why a 5? Well, mostly because of Mia, and the rest for the creepy cabin - they did that right - who, in their right mind, would spend another minute, not the weekend, in that cabin after they find what happened in the basement? Mixed feelings - nostalgia for the original, one good performance by Mia, but on the other hand, being spoon fed plot because they think we're too too dumb to scare ourselves ... sort of turned into a wash - It's worth renting - I would have never paid to see it in a theater though. This is my 1st review, so I apologize if it's not so polished as others who post here. Bottom line? If you loved the Campbel version, see it just to appreciate Bruce Campbells genius again, anew. You'll appreciate his version so much more, after seeing how the same movie makes his version seem worthy of an Oscar. Rent it, don't go to a theater."

","At the first scenes, one would think the movie courts the audience with all of its good-looking actors and actresses. But why would people want to make a movie with a lame-to-useless story just to show how gory and cruel a movie can be? The movie's background was so rushed that I cannot understand why the the group even visited the cabin. In addition, the lead actor is good-looking but his acting style is so bad. His persona and decisions are so dumb that it can be annoying. The flow is fast-paced and there is no element of suspense. At the middle of the film, you already get to know the outcome. The scenes are virtually the same; gory scenes, loud screams and survival. There is so much blood and violence in the movie that one can only imagine how twisted the writers and director were to portray the worst imaginable kind of physical feeling; but that's all about the movie. For people who really enjoy gory and cruel stuff, however bad the story is, then this is for them."
"dramafreak42","5","1","2","2 October 2014"," It Doesn't Get Much More Brutal Than This
","Horror remakes have been big business for over a decade now. From mainstream horror classics to cult favorites it seems like every recognizable horror title has gotten the remake/reboot treatment. So the remake of Sam Raimi's beloved ""Evil Dead"" doesn't come as all that much of a shock. What is a pleasant surprise is that Raimi himself helped produce the remake, and how faithful to the original material it manages to be while still feeling like a distinctly different film.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" tells the story of five youths who go to an isolated cabin in the woods to help their friend Mia detox from a drug overdose and hopefully kick the stuff for good. Joining Mia is her brother, who has a history of not being around when things get rough, and her friends who have seen her try to give up drugs before and fail. With tension already high the group discovers the remnants of a witch burning in the basement, along with an ominous book. When one of them reads from the book it releases an evil force that begins to possess the various members of the group and drive them to do horrific things to themselves and others, all with the goal of unleashing an unspeakable evil onto the world.<br/><br/>The remake of ""Evil Dead"" has a number of things working in its favor. Director Fede Alvarez was intelligent enough to not try and reinvent the wheel, rather he's just trying to cause a much more spectacular mess with the wheel fans already know and love. The general plot is almost to the letter the same as the original film, and rather than trying to introduce some sort of new twist the film sets out to deliver the same story in the most brutal fashion possible. What the characters in this film suffer through is nothing short of apocalyptic. The physical suffering and the way it is shown leaves little to the imagination, but it's delivered with such swift efficiency that it doesn't feel like the drawn out pain of something like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel."" Of course all of this is very much in keeping with the original, which was quite gory and brutal for its time.<br/><br/>The performances are also surprisingly strong for a film of this type. The acting in the original tended towards the ""so bad it's funny"" end of things (something embraced more fully by the sequels.) Here there really is no room for laughs, unintentional or otherwise, but the acting isn't so dour as to put a damper on the fun of it all. The characters are fairly thinly sketched out on paper but each actor brings something to their part that makes it feel like there's more to these people than what we're seeing. This gives the characters some dimension, perhaps not a full three dimensions but certainly more than most of the victims in these sorts of films.<br/><br/>While for the most part, not trying to reinvent the wheel was to the film's advantage it also means that it falls into a few of the classic stumbling points of the genre as well. For example the film, despite having more women than men in the cast, comes across as rather misogynistic. This is mainly owing to the fact that the most brutal violence is committed against the female characters. There are also some smaller things that add up as well, such as the possessed character cursing almost constantly. This is prevalent in possession stories thanks to ""The Exorcist,"" but all the films since then fail to realize that the reason that it worked in that movie was because of how young Linda Blair was. Having an adult swearing like a sailor just doesn't do the same thing, or much of anything really.<br/><br/>There's also the ending stretch of the film, which is where the whole thing runs out of steam. On the one hand the possessions are actually for something, and it's all building to a larger purpose. This is a welcome change from the original where the possessing entities seemed to just be tormenting the victims for the heck of it. However when the built up moment happens it's a tad underwhelming, mainly because it fails to distinguish itself from everything that had already been going on up to that point.<br/><br/>Different horror films operate on different principles. Remaking ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" wasn't a great idea because it was a cerebral horror story, and there wasn't much that could be done with that story or idea that would improve or distinguish it from the original. ""Evil Dead"" on the other hand is a visceral horror film where the ""story"" is just the excuse to tear apart the victims. This is the sort of film it makes sense to remake since so much has advanced in the realm of gore effects (practical and virtual) since 1980. While the new ""Evil Dead"" doesn't really improve on the original it does capture the essence of what made the first film memorable, and in doing so the film justifies its own existence even though it fails to transcend its origins."

","Things have moved on in the film making process since the original was made. This was certainly more polished, the effects were impressive and at times there were moments that were intense.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I felt nothing for the characters, even though this movie is about a group of friends carrying out an intervention, it was just bleak.<br/><br/>The original had a power of shock that I felt this one was missing, the movies in the Saw and Hostel series have taken the gore factor up but this didn't give you anything new, also no black humour running through it.<br/><br/>They tried, it is worth watching once, but stick with the original. If Mr Raimi feels ready to come back to his baby, the fans will be there in droves. Just don't follow this one up, please. Bring back Ash."
"kgprophet","6","1","2","12 March 2014"," Big Budget Not Remake of Original
","Other than taking cues for creativity in depicting possessed people and the way they commit acts of gore, this film more than stands on it's own for thickly layered evil. Roughly the exact opposite of the Paranormal movies, where scares are derived from long periods of nothing, this films tries to up the shock value more like the torture porn ""Saw"" movies. What also pushes the envelope is the incredible punishment all our victims can endure. Which makes the film just that more creepy and bloody. I was amazed to read that the budget for this heavy effects film is just 17 million. There are enough practical scenes of gore to make three low budget horror films. But there are also well shot scenes of swamp and creepy forest chases that did not look easy to film.<br/><br/>We barely get to know our group of cabin dwellers before the evil takes over. Each scene was well thought out in terms of pushing the ick factor, making each possession as superhuman as they are supernatural. Yet the director is wise enough to keep this film from feeling conventional. Again, seemingly a great deal of time was put into creating a creepy atmosphere (foggy woods, dark and lonely cabin rooms, point of view attack scenes), and trying it's best not reveal how much was created in a studio.<br/><br/>Some of the gore reminded me of the classic 80s version of ""The Thing"", which also took pride in coming up with creative gore effects. The recent remake of ""The Thing"" was an example of how hard it is to try and best the original or at least give the title some dignity. In this Evil Dead update, other than a few obvious CGI effects, most of the gore is only touched up slightly with digital manipulation. When things get crazy as time goes on, the film still finds ways to up the ante, and make it not so predictable as to who will survive and who won't.<br/><br/>To compare this to the original Evil Dead is not appropriate, because other than the basic premise, this film finds it's own sense of style and execution. It certainly invites a sequel, but I have no great enthusiasm for an obligatory 13 sequel franchise to milk the concept beyond it's rate of return. So with a real budget I would guess near 25 million, there are thrills aplenty in this graphic and creepy franchise maker."

","In order to officially be from Michigan (other than legal residency) you are required to do a few specifics things. You need to pledge allegiance to the Red Wings, the Pistons and either Michigan State or U of M football. You need to own an American car and you need to have watched Robocop (1987) and The Evil Dead series (1981-1992). Indeed since the early eighties Sam Raimi's schlockfest trilogy has become as much a Michigan staple as road kill and deer hunting season. So it only makes sense that with such a legion of adoring fans that a remake is in order. And that's exactly what happened this past year with the arrival of Evil Dead (2013) a pale imitator of the original.<br/><br/>First the good news: if you're uninhibited by memories of the original and a fan of the horror genre you'll likely find a lot to enjoy. There is a lot of gross-out moments that are done well (though they are inspired from the original). The setup is also a little more convincing than the original with one of the members of dead-teenagers anonymous (Jane Levy) looking to get cleaned up from a drug habit. Heck if this remake wasn't so beholden to the original and created tension by making the one with the drug history ""see things,"" this could have been a horror staple a la Halloween (1978) But the original was not a tension builder, it was a bleeder and so is its remake which brings me to the bad news. The movie losses all tension the moment Jane Levy possessed teen levitates in midair and demonically explains ""you're all going to die tonight."" Welp, I guess that's it folks. In the words of Bill Paxton's character in Aliens (1986) ""Game over man, game over!"" Each character we care little about becomes possessed by an evil entity and causes limb cutting, power tool wielding, blood puking mayhem. Whoever arrives on the scene in the days to come should wear a hazmat suit lest they get Hepatitis. Rule of thumb kids, if you see what looks like a witchcraft sight in the basement of the cabin you've rented complete with dead animal carcasses, a demonic book that won't burn and the smell of burning hair, cut your losses and leave.<br/><br/>It's a shame that a setup more promising than the original can lead to some really bad character decisions none of which are played for laughs. Which brings me to the biggest problem I have with the new Evil Dead; it's not funny. The slapstick craziness of Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi's kinetic direction made for some inspiringly silly moments in the original trilogy. The original was as much a parody of itself and its ilk as a horror movie on its own terms. This new movie on the other hand is largely humorless with Jane Levy being the only actress with a sense of comedy on screen. Unfortunately the ascorbic wit that she expounds in Subugatory (2011-present) is largely absent here replacing it with the talented young starlet hissing and convulsing.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell executive produced this new film and were likely happy with it. I don't blame them; it did make its estimated budget back on opening weekend. I also commend rookie director Fede Alvarez on his fine job imitating Sam Raimi's style. But if we could guys, when Evil Dead 2 inevitably rears its ugly head, we remember to lighten up? For your home State's sake.<br/><br/>http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com"
"sohansurag","5","1","2","24 December 2013"," Over-rated & Okayish!
","My memories of watching Evil Dead wasn't so good. I saw it when I was a lil kid, tucked under a table and was petrified beyond limits. The horrific images from Sam Raimi's original crept crawling back to my head haunting me till I reached puberty. I thought to give it a second chance and watched it again recently only to be laughing out loud at the twisted humor and appreciating the wonderful effects and imagery that made it a classic. So when I heard they were remaking Evil Dead, my 28 year old self was twice as excited coz by now I was a hardened horror movie enthusiast. Being in India I had the privilege of waiting for more than 3 months since its worldwide release. I realized they were pushing the release date further and further until it was no more in the 'Coming Soon' section. I suspect the ball-less censor board and theatre owners behind this. I couldn't wait for more and albeit the pain of not getting to watch it on the big screen, I ended up watching it on the small screen.<br/><br/>2013′s Evil Dead directed by Fede Alvarez and produced by Bruce Campbell kinda falls in between a reboot and a remake. The new Evil Dead is more dark and more on the serious side and kinda avoids the humor that the original had. It feels like its trying hard to scare the crap outta you but myself having watched most of the best horror movies of this gen, it hardly scared me. Think HOSTEL with demons doing most of the torture than humans. Evil Dead is saturated with shocking and gory sequences that'd make most of the people squeamish and run for the nearest restrooms. Just like the original Evil Dead, this one too is filled with bucket loads of gore, gibs and whatever bodily fluids you could imagine though in an excessively exaggerated way. Believe me you won't be scared seeing this, instead it instills dread and disgust. But what it does best is to pay homage to the original and it does it well. It does takes you back to the great horror movies of 80s. Add more makeup effects and less CG, it does bring those nostalgic memories from the yesteryears.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is very serious, devoid of the campy humor the original had. The original was very campy which at the time would have been good and I am thankful that this iteration wasn't so. What I liked about the this one is that it had a wee bit backstory. These guys didn't come randomly to the cabin ready to served hot for the demons. The main character Mia was a junkie and she, along with her supportive friends and brother came to the cabin for the sole purpose of detoxing her. As far as the actors were concerned they were just cannon fodder when all hell breaks loose. Seeing enough horror flicks gives you that uncanny ability to let you foresee who's gonna be the first to go and the moment I was introduced to the 5 characters in Evil Dead, I'd known they were all bait for whatever came from the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis. Jane Levy as Mia was the only character who served for some intrigue. Rest was just, as I said, CANNON FODDER.<br/><br/>Evil Dead has its advantages being made this-gen. It has some brilliant sound and visuals which screams to be seen on the big screen. I bet the grotesque makeup effects, the creepy forest and all the blood and goo along with the eerie music and ambiance would look and sound ten times better on the big screen. Visually it maintained that essence when I watched it on the small screen as well. Kudos for the cinematography. I felt the chill when I was watching scenes with the forest as the backdrop. It could also be so, coz I was very excited for this one and reading all the rave reviews I was doubly 'turned on' (yea I'm twisted enough that horror entices me :P). But I was extremely disappointed when I'd done watching the movie. If you've seen Cabin in The Woods, you'll know why Evil Dead comes off as tad bit boring. I mean how many Cabin movies have you seen? I watched Evil Dead to scare me as demonly as possible but I wasn't even remotely scared. As mentioned above Evil Dead does one thing best: throw you into constant nostalgia. It reminds you of the good times and not-so-good-times you had watching all those horror flicks when you were young.<br/><br/>PS: The post credit sequence wasn't that good either, leaving more unanswered questions."

","Shallow overblown remake of a low budget classic fails by its very nature as yet another 21st century ""all style no substance"" remake. My biggest gripe with the movie (and others like it) is that it takes an inventive, creative, unique film with atmosphere and tension and turns it into yet another glossy uninspired ""pretty"" movie that we get way too much of already. The movie tag line reads: the most terrifying film you will ever experience. What a joke. It's impossible to be frightened by these music video horror movies that remove you so far from reality with their overproduced visuals that you never feel a sense of dread or uneasiness. How is it scary watching a bunch of young models act poorly and mimic stuff we've seen in dozens of movies over the decades? <br/><br/>In a comparison with the original film it fails completely. Judging it on its own (mostly borrowed) merits, it's as entertaining as your average generic slasher horror flick -- no scares but a sort of ""zone out and enjoy it"" entertainment value. It borrows liberally from better films and offers nothing new of its own. The stuff it changes from the original Evil Dead movies is stuff that's ripped off from other sources, like The Exorcist. Look, it is what it is. A lot of dumb kids and those easily pleased will wet themselves with enjoyment over it. But that doesn't make it great. It's all very familiar and stale but...it's better than the Texas Chainsaw remake. I guess there's that!"

Not to mention, this is great for all of you fellow geeks out there who wanted more detail on The Necronomicon in film form (rather than traversing the Evil Dead Wiki).

","When I read all the 1's and 2's on the IMDb I was hesitant to go see this movie. After all, I am a huge fan of the original Evil Dead directed by my hero, Sam Raime (who is nothing short of a genius). This movie delivered the goods and in a big way at that! Sure, was gore but the scene where a tree raped Mia was not too over the top as Jake said it was said to be. Instead, it was scary and grotesque in the tradition of a horror movie. This movie had all the elements of a good horror flick. First, the movie has to have some realism to it which it does!! Secondly, mystery builds suspense. A lot of horror movies make the mistake of giving the movie watcher too much background information. Not in the Evil Dead! Third, strong characters make the best victims. The character of Mia in Evil Dead was strong and crazy when she became possessed. Fourth, don't give me a chance to take a breath. Horror movies without action are dull pieces of crap. But the Evil Dead doesn't let up. Of course the nod to Bruce Campbell was amazing when she shoved the chainsaw on her stump. There were other good nods to such as the 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 in the beginning of the movie. The only thing I didn't like was when that girl threw up on the other girls face with blood coming out of her mouth at fire-hose pressure. Then she stabbed that one guy in the eyeball about 100 times but his glasses protected him. I would have had the glasses shatter. One of the best parts was at the beginning when they burned that lady ALIVE! She was screaming and you could tell she was in a lot of pain and probably not even acting. If you want to see the best horror movie of 2013 so far, go see this movie - and I will personally guarantee that you will leave the theater feeling like you just saw a really good movie."

It's simply because we are dealing with a remake of one of the biggest cult movies in cinematic history. <br/><br/>I must confess, I didn't want a remake of this movie to happen either. Until I actually watched the remake. Now, no one will ever -- or could ever -- outmatch Sam Raimi with his low budget masterpiece. There is a magic entwined within that picture that will always make the original Evil Dead what it is. As far as this remake, I must, in my opinion, say that it is the best retelling of any horror motion picture that has been stamped with legendary status.<br/><br/>Director Fede Alvarez had big shoes to fill and I'm sure he did -- and still does -- fill that pressure. In a way, he was screwed right off the bat. I mean, who in their right mind would actually tackle a remake of a movie of such caliber as The Evil Dead? <br/><br/>Fede Alvarez, that's who. And he did a damn fine job. Especially being a new comer with feature films altogether. Can you imagine your very first feature length production being none other than the remake of The Evil Dead? Talk about sweaty palms and a thudding heart! <br/><br/>But, Fede held his own and stood his ground. He did it. And he cropped out one hell of a horror picture. He pays homage to the first two original films in tiny, bite sized portions that are easy to swallow. <br/><br/>The horror is delivered with a straight, in your face, balls to the wall, full throttle impact. <br/><br/>No, there is nothing wrong with this movie.

There are lots of ugly scenes, with blood coming from all over and people dying and being tortured for no reason whatsoever. All the cast has to be congratulated for such profession acting, specially Jane Levy, who did her job amazingly. Directing, background sound, make-up department and special effects are what make this movie so agonizing, scary and painful to see. I went with two female friends to catch this on screen, and there was a moment in the movie that they kept screaming and telling me they felt like puking, which is an example of how disturbing this movie may be. I felt it strange there were many old guys in the cinema by themselves, showing no fear or any discomfort while watching this. I am not a fan of this kind of movies anymore-- they look all pretty much the same to me. In my opinion, it is a mix between ""The Exorcism of Emily Rose"" and ""Cabin Fever"", with no originality or innovation to the genre. However, I'm reasonable enough to admit it is a great movie for fans of the genre, and they probably won't be disappointed after seeing this."
"s_campanale","7","4","18","19 April 2013"," Evil Dead Serious - No laughs or Irony but plenty of blood and guts
","The trend for making pointless remakes of beloved cult classics of yesteryear has by now become a running joke yet a modestly successful one for cash strapped studios. One might accuse the remakes of just being cheap crap to make money, forgetting that's exactly what most of the originals were in the first place! The difference of course is that the originals were lovingly well made crap, which is why they survived as pulp icons decades after their natural shelf life should have expired.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" is quite special in this horror pantheon. Notorious upon release for its then unheard of amount of blood, gore and vomit inducing effects – becoming a cause celebre ""Video Nasty"" in the UK during the anti-horror moral purge – it was only later acclaimed for the brilliant cinematic work it was. Not only was it made on a shoestring by a near amateur cast and crew, but it mixed its horror with a zany comedy element inspired by ""The 3 stooges"" and WB cartoons to create something that had us screaming, hurling, and laughing at the same time. It was film that did not ask to be taken seriously, that knew it was a comedy, yet when the laughs turned to nastiness, they did so twice as hard. The film's creator Sam Raimi has since become an A-list name director who recently gave us Disney's latest blockbuster, while its star Bruce Campbell has become a cult despite a very patchy filmography. Both men, along with co-creator Robert Tapert are the producers of this remake. <br/><br/>Directed by Paraguayan newcomer Fede Alvarez, it walks a strange line between a standard remake and homage. Realising that a straight redo was out of the question (especially recasting Campbell's iconic Ash) and furthermore would eliminate all tension if we knew who died when and who would survive, they created a new set of characters, but magnified one – First victim Mia (Jane Levy) Sister of the resident hunk in the 1981 version, she was then simply ""a strange sensitive girl"", an artist who felt the evil before everyone else did, and whose hysterical warnings were ignored until she became Demon possessed in the infamous ""tree rape"" (a version of which still happens here) and turning into an increasingly scabby monster with a line in cruel playground taunts. Here she becomes a recovering Heroin addict who's just seen her mentally ill mother through her terminal illness and OD twice, who is being ""locked in"" the cabin in the woods by her brother and old college pals to make sure she cold turkeys for good. Her relationship with her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is 'troubled' and complicated, so already you have soap opera underpinnings, an annoying trend for modern horror which thinks this is the way to make you care about the characters (it doesn't) often to the detriment of any real scares or thrills. It also generates another horror remake sin – Trying to be too earnest and serious! The originals had a wink in their eye and tongue firmly in cheek, they knew they were crap and had a good time trying to scare you. Not so the remakes, which seem to aiming for some form of Oscar worthy high art and ending up simply dull and un-engaging. This is especially true of ""Evil Dead"" because of its horror-comedy nature. <br/><br/>Other details are changed. The ""Necromicon"" book of the dead still exists, but it is no longer Sumerian, is filled with comic book illustrations and big red graffiti telling everyone what is going to happen next, and is linked to European Satanic worship and the Devil. The dreaded words of activation – pilfered from ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" – are also different, and are read out by one of the party rather than on the tape recorder. The possessed no longer turn into monsters, and have to resort to idiotic self-mutilation practices (as illustrated in comic book Necromicon) to look suitably nasty. Also a ""deadite"" can be restored to normal life once freed, though it seems logically impossible.<br/><br/>As with all drastic reinterpretations, some little nods are thrown to fans, starting with the classic Oldsmobile appearing as a derelict in the grounds, then the ""Raimi zooms"", especially during the zany construction in the shed scene(a defibrillator rather than weapon here) and a final battle involving a chainsaw that also ends up on the end of lone survivors severed wrist. And of course the film's ground-breaking gore is reproduced, but by now buckets of blood, gore, severed limbs, pulped dogs, nail and knife riven corpses, people sawn in half and slimy gruel are not that shocking. What in the original came off as glorious overkill here just becomes tedious overkill, but at least they tried.<br/><br/>So this is essentially a ""serious"" spin on the same scenario, more homage than remake, never living up to the original but not insulting it either. This is clearly meant to be another story being told, which could even be read as a dream, a psychological manifestation of one character literally beating their demons, highlighted by a fleeting appearance by Ash/Campbell at the end of the credits with his ""Groovy!"" catchphrase. The original series is safe, and could even be returned to if the makers so wish. <br/><br/>As far as unnecessary remakes go, this could have been worse, even though it has no real reason to exist. Faint praise indeed, but considering the field, still praise."
"Dangii5","8","4","18","17 April 2013"," A Strong Attempt
","I feel the people that review this without knowledge of the original are polluting its rating because they're viewing it as just a horror film without a previous history.<br/><br/>Clearly, it lacks the dark humor that was so great about the original movie. The original was scary and really funny and the make-up was incredible for the 80s. The original also had a distinct indie feel with shots that you'd see in some college kid's art film. Some of the shots in the original were incredible and that scene with Bruce Campbell and the mirror was so cool.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is it's not as good as the original but it nowhere near a horrible attempt. Why I feel it's not getting rave reviews is because it's not original anymore, so people seeing it for the first time without knowledge that there's an original will just see it as another generic horror film.<br/><br/>The best part was of course the make-up and prosthetics. It ditched the all CGI look in favor of trying to replicate it in real life which made it much better. The deaths were gruesome and at some points disturbing but as other reviewers might point out, it didn't have that gratuitous gore like the original. The biggest letdown for me was the scene when the nurse was in the shower and the long haired teacher goes to check up on her. The buildup was incredible and people were squirming in their seats just anticipating what could happen but all we were given was some weak cut on her cheek. Really dropped the ball there as that could have been one of the most gruesome parts of the movie.<br/><br/>The setting was like the original, it was creepy and the basement scenes were disturbing but I don't know, as I write this I don't really recall paying much attention to the setting but it provided the adequate atmosphere and didn't do anything but enhance the film. I didn't steal the film like some movies in which the setting plays a huge role such as the claustrophobic environment of The Descent.<br/><br/>The acting was okay, it wasn't horrible but they weren't the best. The best in my opinion was the withdrawing drug addict girl who was possessed. It's your typical horror in which there's a lot of screaming and yelling but who watches horror films for the acting? The hippie teacher provided some laughs with some of his lines and actions, he was like the bad ass of the film since he took such a beating. Overall, it's your typical horror film actors but better than most which is good.<br/><br/>What I loved about this was that everything now had a reason. They had a reason, albeit a weaker one, to be there. They had a reason not to take her to a hospital since the nurse character was able to provide the same care they would though where she got the medications is left to our imagination. They have a reason not to believe her when she talks about being attacked in the forest because she's suffering withdrawals. Forgive me for this as I still love the original, but it feels like many things were just for the sake of furthering the film because so many decisions were without any logic or reason. The new one tries to give motive for all of the actions taken by the character and I feel they did a great job.<br/><br/>They also did a great job with morality and mind games. In the original, Campbell's internal conflict with his possessed girlfriend was incredibly powerful. In this new one, there are many scenes like this such as the end and with the main character's girlfriend. The ending resurrection was kind of hokey but it was needed for the great ending so it wasn't so bad. It did provide the inner conflict described above but it was nowhere near as powerful since from the way he ""prepared"" her for burial we knew she would be back. The scene in which the demon leaves his girlfriend's body after all the harm she went through was actually sad. This one actually provided a more powerful sense of inner conflict, really what would you do in that situation?? Sitting next to my girlfriend while watching really intensifies the sadness and conflict he must have felt so in my opinion it was effectively used to convey the emotion of that situation.<br/><br/>tl;dr:<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>-Great use of prosthetics and make-up. Sufficiently creepy setting. Acting wasn't bad enough to detract from the film in my opinion. Motives and reasoning behind actions are clearly defined <br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>-Not as funny as I'd like. Not super scary but then again, neither was the original. Missing the gore!!!<br/><br/>Overall:<br/><br/>It was a faithful reproduction of a great film that I'm sure fans of the original will enjoy but newcomers might have a hard time appreciating it. It benefited from a bigger budget and cleaner camera work but that kills its originality since the shots used were so typical. The original contained cool shots all done by hand since they didn't have a huge budget. In the end, it's better than most reproductions of older movies. It's nothing like the abominations that are the Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Jason remakes that only care about sex and hot girls. This one was taken seriously and with care as to not butcher it. If you can put up with immature people laughing at serious parts and making dumb ass comments to try and get a laugh out of everyone then go see it in theaters. Though if you want to have a serious viewing audience with some friends who loved the original then avoid the theaters and wait for a rent."
"zombieeducation","7","4","18","16 April 2013"," An awesome thrill-ride
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and went in as a fan of the original. When I first heard that the next film Raimi was going to have a hand in was not going to be Evil Dead 4 but a remake of the original, I was doubtful at first-- having seen the scores of remakes that had none of the charm of the original (I'm looking at you Friday the 13th...)<br/><br/>But a good percentage of the charm of the original was lumped into three categories: atmosphere, gore effects, and creature effects. In fact, I would argue that's pretty much the three reasons anyone likes the original. The formula for the remake is a bit different-- I thought that the highlights included an interesting character development, gore- effects, and a huge amp-up in pacing from the original.<br/><br/>In other words... it's not a clone. Much of the atmosphere of the original was hit or miss-- Raimi's lingering camera sometimes caught things that were creepy, like the basement or the dimly lit forest, but it often just sort of sat there staring, essentially breaking the pacing completely. This film decided to do the opposite-- but while not rushing through and skipping fair introductions to characters that are much more human (although not hugely deep) than in the original.<br/><br/>This film is not for everyone: if you can't handle a film that hit a list called the ""video nasty"" list, then the original film and this remake are not for you. If the idea of watching something that you aren't SUPPOSED to see, if that idea sounds delightfully dangerous to you, then I highly recommend this film. <br/><br/>For those that found the original to be putrescent and vile-- and loved every minute of it-- you will find a lot to love here. The characters are introduced as essentially a group of young adults staging an intervention, and this immediately allows you to be more sympathetic than the original's characters (who were.... spring breakers.... I... think-- it was never fully explained). As far as symbolism goes, it is as sophisticated as a film called ""Evil Dead"" can be expected to be, but a little bit moreso. The inclusion of drug use puts narrative perspective into question, as does a history of mental illness that gets revealed a bit later on into the story, adding depth to the depravity. Was it all a drug-induced hallucination? Was it a delusion? <br/><br/>I LOVE films that have this double-edged sword of unreliable narrator, especially when used in horror films, like this or Lovely Molly. It allows you to connect with the characters, but it also allows you to have fun with the supernatural elements, as they can be as crazy or wild as you need in order to be thrilled, but ultimately the believability is flexible because, well... how serious are you going to take the world through a junkie's eyes?<br/><br/>All in all, a bit of a popcorn film-- you won't find the meaning of life here or any sort of deep Beckett-style experimentation with absurdity, but you WILL find a wild romp that is just devilish fun for those who truly understand what makes horror great!"
"agrising","7","4","18","16 April 2013"," A Lot of Things to Mention Here
","First things first, if you're looking for a fresh, interesting, bloody, entertaining and different kind of horror film, go see the Evil Dead remake. If you are looking for a low-budget, campy, lacking 1980's film, well..that's the original.<br/><br/>This Evil Dead remake is by far more like a reinvision rather than a remake, and that's an excellent thing. I do not understand people's hold on the original. Yes, I've seen it. No, I do not think it is better than this remake. Why? I'll get to that later, now to the film review.<br/><br/>If you're looking for plot synopsis, you can find that anywhere. I want to talk about the film. I personally enjoyed, like truly enjoyed, this new version of the Evil Dead because it tried to improve on the original and in many ways it did. It had a great atmosphere, a more coherent story, more three dimensional characters (well they tried), some scenes will haunt you in terms of scare and WTF did that just happen? If you want a fun, but flawed, horror film, go see it. If you're looking for award winning performances and an amazing script...well, why are you watching horror in the first place?<br/><br/>Now, to the original. Besides our hero Ash, who were all the other characters? Oh yeah, that's right. Flat, two dimensional characters that don't get developed and who we could care less about since any line they said could have been said by anyone else around. This film improves, while these aren't amazing characters, they are more memorable (besides a filler blonde girl...who, well...yeah). The special effects are amazing in this version, which is why it had a much bigger budget and was advertised more. The original was a cult hit, this is meant to be a money making hit because a lot more money was put into this film. Why the hell do people get mad over this? I don't know. Either way, the budget difference showed, and I personally liked it. The storyline is a lot more coherent and makes more sense in this version. Vast improvement in terms of how everything played out the way it did. People also mention how the ""humor"" was gone...umm, if you're a true fan of the Evil Dead series, you should know that the first film had anything but humor. It wasn't funny, it was meant to scare you. This film does the same. Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness are the ones bathed in dark humor, if you want to complain about that, wait for the sequel. So much for fans, right?<br/><br/>Was this movie scary? Meh, but then again, was the original really that bad? Was this movie gory? Yes, and enough to make you cringe as the movie goes on. Was it necessary? Nope, but I enjoyed it. Should you watch it? If you praise the original blindy and hold on to it like dear life, look elsewhere. However, if you have an open mind and want to see a fun reinvision of a praised classic, go right ahead. You won't regret it. A very solid 7/10, and thats saying a lot for a modern horror film."

He has a knack for creepy, disturbing visuals, which, in my opinion, trump cheap scare tactics shown in pretty much every horror movie now days. What's awesome is that I hyped myself up for this film, and I wasn't let down! That's rare. Go see this film. The haters obviously either hated the movie before they watched it...or were just too cool to admit they were freaked out. Enjoy!"
"theburrus1","8","4","19","3 July 2013"," A hell of a horror movie!!!
","Setting aside any comparisons of this film versus Sam Raimi's originals, I proceed with my review. <br/><br/>This is a kick ass horror movie, a fresh feast in such a watered-down genre. Straight to the point, here is why it's so great. The premise of the characters being at a cabin in the woods is believable, and original despite that setting alone being cliché on its own. All of the characters make excellent performances at all times throughout the film. Gore? Plenty of it-but very well done and refreshing all the same for each scenario its in. In fact, it is done so well and keeps pace with the speed of the film and story, etc. that I laughed in amazement of its brilliancy. Scary? Perhaps, at some points, for some people. Whoever wants to be scared will probably. Others might expect things that happen as they do if you know the horror genre well enough. And even up until the very end, this movie never gives up, never falls flat. All I can say its an enjoyable, well-done film. Taking all this into account, I suggest for a REAL new and refreshing take for a horror movie amongst others coming out these days, it's a must see. I would even be in favor of a sequel, but ONLY if the director or writers can top or at minimum match the level of this film throughout. Have fun and go see it!"
"edwardscissorhands123","9","4","19","17 April 2013"," Great Gory Fun
","As a huge fan of the original, I was extremely satisfied with how Evil Dead turned out. Everything about it paid great homage to the cult classic. I was nervous that it would shy away from the camp and cheese that made the original so unique, but the film wasn't afraid to pile on the over the top gore along with surprisingly scary elements that, to me, were not present in the original. The only problem is that the end comes about a little too abrupt and tries to seem a little to bigger than it really is. And although the action is some of the most fun I've had in a movie theater all year, it comes in a little to late in the film. There is too much build up behind characters I didn't necessarily care about. But as soon as they start to be teared apart, you remember what the original was all about, and what its like to have fun in a horror movie again. GRADE: A-"
"shirah-daniel","8","4","19","13 April 2013"," Could have passed as its own film.
","This is actually not a bad film, but everyone is upset about how different it is from Raimi's original ""Evil Dead"". But isn't that the point? A remake of a film should be the what the person ""remaking"" the film would have liked it to be, not simply a modernized version. Although people forget this, it's how it's supposed to be. I saw this movie, not expecting an exact replica of the original, and it met my expectations. People shouldn't judge a film by what it's supposed to be, they should judge it by what it is. If this film was given a different title, it probably would have a much higher rating. So it's a good film, but it doesn't meet ""The Evil Dead's"" standards. I recommend seeing it in a theater, it's action packed all the way through, and never slows down. Eight stars."
"diabolicala123","8","4","19","13 April 2013"," Evil Dead remake was wicked!
","The new Evil Dead is a remake of the old campy classic with our beloved Ash. When I first heard about it I wasn't very happy. The reason being I think a lot of producers of remakes try to fix something that isn't broken. In fact, I've seen this so much. Anyone who is a horror fan can probably name off a lot of these new cheesy Hollywood knock offs. <br/><br/>The new Evil Dead however, was a great surprise. The trailer does not divulge very much which was also great. The movie is based in a remote cabin in the woods where a few friends are trying to help one of them detox from heroin. I was impressed that they spared us the whole college kid cornball bare breasted bit that almost all new horror movies subject us to. There was really none of that. This is where I say thank you Raimi and ""Ash."" This in itself is a triumph as far as I'm concerned. (Seriously, thank you and amen!)<br/><br/>I thought this movie was stellar and I saw it twice in the theaters. This is definitely one you will want to see in the theatre if you are a horror fan. If you are expecting the classic, then you might want to bust out the classic on VHS or DVD. I think too many people want it to be the exact thing which is not what you are going to get. <br/><br/>With that being said, this is worth a look. There is not a boring moment in the new remake. Not only that, but it truly delivers a lot of scream worthy parts. Lets forget the fleeting seconds of thrills most horror movies lead you up to. This film is over the top and the effects are stellar. It is a roller coaster ride from the first few minutes . What more can a horror lover want? I've also read a few reviews stating it's washed up and not scary? This confuses me! There are parts of this movie that are simply wicked . Just by coincidence I happened to be staying with a friend out in the country at an old farmhouse while seeing this. All I can say is that night the fact we had both seen the movie was not lost to us! This is an 8 out of 10 for me and definitely worth it. Applause applause! A wicked remake- enjoy!"

","I watched last night because of the tag-line ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"" and was rather upset with its genre. A comedy would be apt. Not one scene scared me. Sure the movie is filled with ultra-violence and lot of blood flows, which I believe is not that necessary. The story is as old as the sky and the original one by Rami is a classic horror. Don't know if I'm the only one who felt laughing to most scenes (esp. in the scene where a man slips on a severed tongue and falls head-down upon a WC). The bottom line is that this movie is one of the most hilariously funny film I've ever seen till today.

I was informed by my wife that this was an old movie and it was recently remade so I was even more interested in watching this flick.<br/><br/>After getting into it, I found that there was an extreme amount of gore in it. We had the lights down low and the surround sound cranked up. Probably not the best thing to do if you have an uneasy stomach or suffer from bad dreams.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8 out of 10 because there were some spots in the flick that became predictable. Then there were scenes that just blew me away, hence the 8 and not a 5 or 6."
"koen_smit","8","2","7","5 August 2013"," Like it or not, it is very good in it's genre.
","Yes this is a horror movie and yes this is a gory horror movie. But no, it is not the bad B or even C movie that you might think it is.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is just as expected, girl chased, girl caught while hiding, girl turns out to be a demon and gets burned by her daddy and a bunch of weird looking locals to free her soul. So far, so good. After the titles we seem to dive into a typical youngsters-in-an-abandoned- cabin movie. Well, wasn't The Evil Dead one of the first in this particular genre? But surprisingly enough, this time the kids are not there to have sex and drink bear and doing all sorts of crazy stuff. No, one of them wants to stop using drugs and chose the cabin of her family to go cold turkey. Brother wants to help but is kind of a stranger to his sister and friends nowadays for which they blame him. So no fun here. <br/><br/>The pace of the movie is fast and they managed to keep it up until the very end. But there is still room for some character development (that fits this genre) and some friendship and sibling drama. The fact that the first possession is actually the person going cold turkey makes it believable that they force her to stay there to get through it. But we know it's not the drugs and that's what makes it very tense. I do remember most of the original The Evil Dead (1981), and it is for the biggest part a remake (apart from the differences in the story in the second half) but this feels like a totally different movie. <br/><br/>When the demon manifests and spreads, it gets really nasty, be ready for some big scares and gore from here. It's hard to say what is the scariest or most brutal, but unlike most horror movies where you halfway through get used to the blood and gore this one kept me shocked and jumping until the end. It is a brutal film with a lot of gore but still they managed to put the drama in it. Although you will always know this movie cannot end well and going cold turkey from possession is a whole other ballgame then from drugs.<br/><br/>I am a horror fan and have seen a lot of this kind of movies and this one stands out from a lot of rubbish that comes in cinemas and on DVD these days. If you like this genre, you will love this movie. Don't watch it if you are not into horror and gore because it is MEANT to be disgusting."
"Minus_The_Beer","8","2","7","4 August 2013"," A Surprisingly Enjoyable Return To The Original Cabin In The Woods
","It had to happen eventually. A remake of the beloved cult-classic ""Evil Dead"" has always been around the corner and on the tips of everyone's tongue. Almost as if Hollywood reached into the dark, dank recesses of its basement and uncovered its own Necronomicon, the ""Evil Dead"" remake has always been lying in wait, dormant and ready to surface at any given moment. Just as nearly every iconic '70s and '80s splatter flick got madeover during the mid-'00s remake boom, we all knew this one was going to be let out of the basement, for better or for worse. Thankfully, it's (mostly) for the better.<br/><br/>Whereas remakes of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" have suffered being interpreted by folks who had nothing to do with the source material, this updated ""Evil Dead"" benefits from having the involvement of original director/writer Sam Raimi, producer Robert Tapert and, of course, the indispensable and iconic Bruce Campbell, who parlayed the original's success into a long and (mostly) fulfilling b-film career. Director Fede Alvarez makes his feature-film debut, working with a fresh-faced young cast that includes ""Suburgatory"" star Jane Levy as the film's inevitable ""Scream Queen,"" cast in sharp juxtaposition to Campbell's hapless and hopeless hero in Raimi's original. There's a genuine care and craft that went into this film and it shows in both its simple yet engaging plot, it's buffet of bloody goodness and its unassuming yet unrelenting style. If any recent remake deserves to hang its coat next to its original, it is certainly this one.<br/><br/>While the basic premise of the film remains pretty much true to the original, there are a few creative liberties that were taken that actually work in the film's favor. Rather than being a care-free group of college friends looking for a good time, the crew that populates this cabin in the woods are doing so in an effort to help their friend (Levy) kick a nasty drug-habit. A musty and unpleasant odor leads to an investigation into the basement where the Necronomicon lays wrapped in a trash bag and barbed-wire, proving too tempting for one of the guests to refuse. Faster than you can say ""We'll swallow your soul!"" the Book of the Dead turns a would-be detox into an all-out bloodbath. Achieved with mostly practical effects, this ""Evil Dead"" is a symphony of dismemberment and decay, true to the spirit of Raimi's original. Hardcore horror fans will appreciate, if nothing else, the film's giddiness in regards to its goriness. Just when you think the film has gone too far, it goes even further.<br/><br/>While the film delivers all of the goods one would expect from a true splatter flick, it comes up a bit empty on the character front. While the original didn't so much to expand its characters, it also didn't ask us to invest in their personal problems like this version does. Aside from a few lines sputtered here and there about, there is very little in the way of character development. In its brief 80 +/- minute span, one can't help but feel that the film could have taken a little more time out of the schedule to flesh out the demon fodder a bit. This little nitpick aside, the film is still entertaining from front to back and pays more than its fair share of fan service (stay tuned beyond the credits for a groovy cameo). Even as a stand-alone film, it delivers the goods meaning that those who enjoyed the original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy in their youth can enjoy just as much as the teens who are only just now discovering the genre. As far as modern remakes, you could do much, much worse."
"siderite","7","2","7","29 July 2013"," Not as campy as the first, but mostly the same plot. No humour, though.
","Some of us remember The Evil Dead fondly because of Bruce Campbell's shenanigans and especially the funny persona that was created for parts two and three. The first part, the original, was only a campy horror, with lots of fake blood and mustard thrown around and some obnoxious acting. As such, this film is a pretty straightforward remake, with a slightly different plot, death order and survivor. It lacks any hint of campiness or humour, though, or that manic craziness that Campbell portrayed, which might upset people.<br/><br/>For me, though, The Evil Dead was the first horror I've watched, aged 6, and I had nightmares over it for a few days afterwards. I was way too young to understand it and at the time it was a pretty horror experience. The feeling for the 2013 remake was completely different. Not only did I know what was going to happen, but films like this have been done since... well... at least 1981; to death, pardon the pun.<br/><br/>Also I have to say that The Cabin in the Woods spoiled any chance of me ""feeling it"". I kept waiting for Richard Jenkins to appear, LOL. And all the characters are really unlikeable, and some over the top scenes really broke any spell that might have gripped me.<br/><br/>Bottom line: It's a really direct demon possession in the woods film. It is as horror as movies like these get. It is also similar to the story of the film they were remaking, which is good for any remake. However I really don't see a funny Evil Dead sequel coming up; it would have nothing to build on."

","""Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons..."" Yeah we've heard it all before, but does this movie bring anything new to the table? Evil Dead is a re-make of the 1981 horror classic 'The Evil Dead' Directed by Sam Raimi. The original had shocks, screams, blood and most importantly humour. This new version has done away with the comedy and charm of the original and gone for the darker and the bleaker, as most re-makes tend to do. This poses a few problems regarding the films tone, the original had scary dark segments but balanced them with splatter comedy and hokey effects. This made the movie varied in tone and kept the audience engaged, this movie though only 90 minutes long felt like it was lasting an eternity. This was due to the relentless gore, which I don't have a problem with, especially for a movie like this, however it seemed to be the only card the film had up it's sleeve and it just became tedious after a while. The film was trying so hard to be gross and shocking that it forgot to be scary, I get frightened very easily by horror films, in fact I go out of my way to avoid them and this film failed to scare me, trust me that's saying something. Having said that, the film-makers deserve a lot of credit for the technical aspects of the film; almost every effect is done practically which is fantastic to see in a main stream horror movie again. I hope that this movie will encourage other Directors to take more risks with their horror films, the genre has just about run its course due to complacency in the industry; though this film had some crazy ""old school"" horror elements to it....its still just another re-make. Give us something new Hollywood!<br/><br/>The film is extremely violent, but not scary, in other words its more ""Yuck"" than ""Yikes"" so I recommend you see it with your friends and just have fun with the gore."

","I don't even mind telling you how wonderful and believable this story has turn by being 'antagonized' by Jany Levy, whom in my reliable opinion gave credibility to an beyond belief entity. I wasn't aware of how talented this girl of the Suburbs could be...<br/><br/>I won't let that the exceptional performance of hers dispel the work of Aaron Morton (photography), who through interesting and well worked shots, made the film even more overwhelming.<br/><br/>But the camera handling wouldn't be so noticeable without the special effects quality that the tape provides. When it comes to a horror movie, the realism is its best ally, and in this case I can assure you that they have had a great relationship.<br/><br/>Of course this all brings us to the mind behind the project: Fede Alvarez. As a director he put everything together with perfection as his random measure. The storyline involved and mixed horror with the enough graduation of drama for you to get absorbed by a not quite pleasant situation...<br/><br/>To sum up, I'm already looking forward to the next creation of this well fitted urugayan director."
"thebakersfieldboys","9","4","20","20 July 2013"," A wonderful addition to the franchise.
","First thing is first, this movie was great. Many people don't understand several things about this movie. Such as it's not a remake. It exists on the same time line as the other movies. Which means it is it's own story. Which is why it can go off in its own direction with the planned sequels. It also means Sam Raimi's movies can crossover and intertwine with these movies. Now on to the film itself. The thing that makes it the best in my opinion is the practical effects. To this day CGI cannot put a finger on well executed effects. This bloody gore-fest is probably the best made since the originals. While I still prefer the originals, this has certainly made one of my favorite movies of all time."

","Well! How to put this! At first I didn't know what to think specially since I saw the trailer and knew that there won't be any Ash... I was like ""Damn, no Ash... it's not gonna be good"". But well, let's say that this 2nd remake of Evil Dead 1 is: A). The best if you judge by the ""horror"" kind. B). Normal remake if you searched for a good laughing session.<br/><br/>I always loved Evil Dead... the hole package! And I always loved it because it was fun. Ash cutting his own hand or the laugh scene! Genius stuff! But in this remake we are in a more ""horror"" and not funny movie although there are some funny dialogs! The story is told real good and it is fun to compare the old and the new with different scenes! Even though I wasn't scared by watching the movie, my girlfriend who is really not used to Horror movies had goosebumps on several scenes.<br/><br/>I particularly loved the winks towards Ash (The Hand, the chainsaw,etc) but I guess that if they kept Ash in the movie, they were just forced to do a funny movie and this was not the objective! And if with Ash it wasn't funny, we were all gonna be frustrated! So excellent job!"
"david_nvf","9","3","14","22 July 2013"," One of the best remakes in recent history.
","I don't know why people complain so much about a movie that's part of a franchise that never follows its own rules. There are plot-holes in the movie, sure, but Evil Dead isn't about the best acting (may I remind you of Bruce Campbell and company's acting in the original Evil Dead?), nor is it about the most original or coherent story (some people think Evil Dead 2 is a remake), but it's about having fun watching people getting killed. I believe the biggest flaw this movie has is on its marketing. ""The Most Terrifying Fill you will Ever Experience""? Not really. The movie may be scary for the common audience, but hardcore horror fans will be disappointed. However, there are some truly gruesome moments in this film, and considering that this film is 99% CGI free, the film is strongest as a visual experience. The acting, while there is room for improvement, is much better than what the original Evil Dead had to offer. Jane Levy, the star of the film, does a great job at being a terrified young drug- addict, a blood-thirsty demon, and a bad-ass hero, all in the same movie. There is plenty of eye-and-ear candy for hardcore Evil Dead fans, as well. From audio cues to the appearance of the Delta 88 Classic.<br/><br/>In a world where horror is constantly falling back into clichés and into the PG-13 rating, much like action, it's refreshing seeing a movie that achieves a R-rating without nudity. A film that reminds us of the good-old days of horror when you could get away with anything. A film that captures the spirit of the original Evil Dead, which is, despite constant confusion and misunderstanding from fans and non-fans alike, a true horror movie that's meant to stick with you, and at the same time provides enough laughs and fun to remind us that it's just a ridiculous movie, which is what Evil Dead is all about.<br/><br/>This movie is a worthy addition to the Evil Dead franchise, and perhaps the best horror remake we've seen since John Carpenter's The Thing. Give it an unprejudiced watch and you'll have a good time."
"bravelybravesirrobin","Null","3","14","28 April 2013"," A remake that amps up the scares of the original but downplays the laughs, not as innovative or weird as the original but a decent effort.
","The problem with being a fan of horror films is more so than any other genre the law of diminishing returns sets in fast. We watch horror films to be scared by them, but the more we watch the more we become used to the tricks of the trade and the harder it is to become scare us. That's why the primary audience for horror films is teenagers; they literally haven't seen enough horror films yet to become jaded.<br/><br/>So when a horror film comes along that is actually scary it really is something special, something to be held up and admired and that you excitedly tell all your other horror loving friends they need to see. The Evil Dead remake, as shocked as I am to say it, is just such a film. Don't get me wrong, The Evil Dead is not a wholly original film by any stretch of the imagination. Plenty of this is familiar territory. A bunch of young adults in an isolated cabin? Jump scares? Discordant music? We've seen all this before right? I mean this is a remake, we've literally seen all this before. Ah but director Fede Alavarez masterfully plays upon the fact that this is a remake for some of the scares. The old Hitchcock nugget about what is tension goes roughly as follows. Two people sit at a table, a bomb goes off, it's boring. Two people sit at a table, the camera pans down to show a bomb, then goes back to them sitting at a table. The audience knows what's going to happen and it's the waiting for that to happen that builds the tension. Fede Alvarez uses this trick repeatedly explicitly showing what will happen to a character in a page in the necronomicon and then making us slowly, gradually, agonisingly wait for the reveal to happen. But he's at his most clever when he uses the audience's prior knowledge of the earlier films to pull off the same trick. When one character gets an infected hand fans of the original films know exactly what's going to happen but he makes us wait for what seems an unbearably tense eternity for the inevitable to occur.<br/><br/>He also doesn't flinch away from his reveals. This is a gory and explicit film. Gore doesn't usually bother me since it's normally so flat and lifeless but Evil Dead had me peeking from between my hands on more than one occasion. It also helps that almost all of the effects in this film are practical. You'd be amazed how much that helps sell the horror. Or maybe you wouldn't, I know most horror fans despise cgi blood so they'll be pleased to hear there's plenty of dyed corn flour in this flick and nary a computer in sight.<br/><br/>But, whilst I think it being a remake is actually a really crucial aspect of the success of the film what a lot of fans want to know is, is it better than the original?<br/><br/>Well cards on the table guys. Evil Dead 2 is in my top ten favourite films of all time and the first Evil Dead is a brilliant, imaginative, innovative, insane film. The remake doesn't even come close to the twisted genius of the original. Partly that's because this film makes no attempt to be funny whereas the first Evil Dead film is one of the few films to ever successfully tread the line between scary and funny. If you go into this wanting it to be Evil Dead all over again then I'm sorry but you'll be disappointed. <br/><br/>Some have said this film would have been better received if it just dropped the Evil Dead name all together, but as I hope I've made clear much of the pleasure is in remixing those familiar Evil Dead elements in new ways. Think of it like a cover version. Take a song like somewhere over the rainbow and do it in a punk style, or a heavy metal style, or a jazz style. The covers aren't trying to improve on the original; they're trying to do the original in a different way. So we have with the 2013 Evil Dead. It's Evil Dead but played straight. I didn't think I would ever want such a thing but the film genuinely surprised me with how enjoyable a straight forward horror version of Evil Dead can be. And really what was Evil Dead 2 but a cover version of Evil Dead with the comedy dials turned up and the horror toned down? Why not do another version with the horror amped up instead?<br/><br/>It's not perfect by any means though. The biggest problem by far is the script which is clunky and contains some of the worst chunks of obvious expository dialogue you're likely to encounter. The acting is workmanlike at best with no real standouts and certainly nobody to rival Bruce Campbell's magnificently charismatic Ash. In fact the characters are another weak point. Nobody is annoying but they're all fairly flat and we don't have a stand out star. Although it's not like the non-Ash characters were well developed in the original. It also has very problematic sexual politics even for the relaxed standards of horror films. And the less said about the ending, the better.<br/><br/>So, not perfect, nor as good as the original but a worthy addition to the series and an increasingly rare example of a genuinely scary horror film.<br/><br/>For more film reviews check out www.wordpress.mummy.com or find out more about at http://about.me/AdamHalls"

","This 2013 horror remake to Sam Raimi's 1981 low-budget classic stars Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore. This tells the story of teen girl, Mia (Levy) and her brother, David (Fernandez) who go to an old cabin in the woods with their friends, Eric (Pucci), Olivia (Lucas) and Natalie (Blackmore) to help Mia overcome her recent drug addiction. It becomes a losing battle when a demonic spirit is unleashed after they find an ancient book that tries to take over their souls. I think this is a pretty good remake that not only has a lot of gory & creepy moments, but nice little nods to the original and it's sequels plus it's produced by Raimi, The original's producer, Rob Tapert and star, Bruce Campbell. I recommend this."
"drownnnsoda","7","9","65","5 April 2013"," Closer to the original material than people are willing to admit
","I'm a moderate fan of the original film, and went into this with fairly elevated expectations due to the stellar trailers and advertisements. While it didn't quite live up to my expectations, I can't exactly complain about it either. This 2013 re-telling has Mia (Jane Levy) going up to the family cabin with her brother (Shiloh Fernandez), his girlfriend (Elizabeth Blackmore), and friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), in an attempt to detox and rid herself of her life-threatening heroin addiction. After coming across the remnants of some sort of ritual in the basement, they discover a skin-bound book full of illustrations and incantations. Eric, an English teacher, makes a wrong move by decoding them, and unleashing a terrible evil in the woods.<br/><br/>Fans of the original film are predisposed to hating this simply because it's a slick high- budget remake to Raimi's original punk filmmaking classic, but director Fede Alverez re- interprets the framework of the original film and ties things together in an unexpected bloodbath.<br/><br/>While there is an apparent lack of suspense, it's worth noting that the original film didn't particularly care for that tenet either. In many ways, this remake is closer to the original film that people would like to think, at least in terms of characters and logistics— as I mentioned, suspense takes backseat; the characters in this film aren't terribly realized (and they weren't in Raimi's film either, I don't care what you say); not much is explicated as to what the ""book of the dead"" really is; and, as with the original, it turns into little more than an absolute gorefest about halfway through. The main differences in this remake involve some character tweaking and variation of events when the group begins to be taken over by the demons. We still get admirable re-imaginings of classic scenes, which is always welcome.<br/><br/>I'd also like to applaud the actors in the film; all of them turn in solid performances, but Jane Levy and Lou Taylor Pucci really shine here. Levy, relatively a newcomer, has some surprising turns when going from ill drug addict to demonic monster, and Lou Taylor Pucci is believable and likable as the smart guy who takes a significant beating. I was particularly surprised by both of their performances.<br/><br/>I also have to give huge props to the special effects in the film, which were reportedly entirely done without CGI; assuming this was true, they pulled off quite a feat. The violence in this film looks shockingly real, and what is shown on screen is completely unrestrained. People who like gross-out horror will get plenty here.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a fun cinema experience for me. People will endlessly discuss the film's shortcomings in relation to Raimi's original film, but I really think the truth is that this remake has more in common with the original than hardcore fans are willing to admit. 1981's ""Evil Dead"" was not a bloodless suspense film, nor was it a character study or a measured thriller— it was an obnoxious, gory, devilish romp, and this remake is a 21st century rendition of that exact formula. 7/10."
"djkbee","6","4","22","19 July 2013"," It was never going to touch the original was it?!
","It was obvious that this remake of Evil Dead was never going to touch the sides of the original Sam Riami cult trilogy classic. Of course you can't replace ASH famously played by Bruce Campbell. Instead this is more blood, gore and serious. No funny moments like the original. At the moment in todays film world we are seeing tons of remakes... some do it better then others. I always try and watch a movie like this baring in mind there will be tons of people who have not even seen the original. Bare in mind the original Evil Dead would not get appreciated by modern day younger horror fans in my opinion. This is certainly a decent remake for modern day horror films and full of blood gore and jump out moments to keep a horror fans curiosity entertained so for that reason i give it a 6. Compared to the original though.... if you are a fan of the original Evil Dead then you will not enjoy this movie if you go in trying to compare it looking for a new ASH... hence the bad reviews on here."

","I have nothing but great things to say about this film. The casting was superb, the acting was great and believable, the effects were top-notch, the twists and turns kept me on the edge of my seat. The last half of the movie is the greatest. In my personal opinion, BEST ENDING to any horror film in a long time. Not necessarily a scary movie that will leave you with nightmares, but definitely a thrill ride that keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. <br/><br/>A little disappointed that some of the clips from the red band trailer were not in the movie, but that gives all the more reason to look forward to the release of the unrated version.<br/><br/>This is one of the very rare horror films that I'd enjoy viewing more than once."
"rlanda198900","9","2","8","31 July 2013"," Awesome and I'll tell you why!
","Before I state the reasons this film is truly an epic horror film, I'd like to worn readers that the most recent reviews(below) on this film are garbage. These users complain about plot, tension, writing and improvement. Take it from me, a person currently in school for film making, a person who likes to listen to director commentaries for the truth behind the camera, a person who despises others that look for mistakes in a film on the first viewing rather than enjoy the experience.<br/><br/>When you plan on watching a horror movie, plan on not having a lot of story to it, plan on not being to impressed with the writing or acting, and definitely plan on paying attention to small details without noticing. There's a reason why the greatest directors of all time(Tarantino, Spielberg, Kubrick etc.) don't make horror films. Horror movies are not meant to receive academy awards, they are meant to scare the crap out of you.<br/><br/>This movie is not a remake. This movie is a true version of what Evil Dead stands for. Other users have stated that the original is a masterpiece, a work of horror genius and so on and so forth. I admit, the original Evil Dead was a ""cult classic"". But it's not a horror film. My first viewing of the original Evil Dead was, for lack of a better term, a ""laughfest"". Yet, I still respected its art and style. I wasn't even born yet when the original movie released. However, I've seen it enough times to know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>The most horrifying movies around are based on things you cannot control. That is what makes it terrifying. The reason ""The Exorcist"" was the greatest horror movie ever made is because you have no control over a supernatural entity. If you cringe over situations like ""being held hostage"" or ""being lost in the woods"" than your not ready to judge horror for what it really is. You have control over those situations. Keep calm, do what your hostage taker says and utilize your surroundings. There is nothing scarier than being confronted by Satan himself.<br/><br/>Now, why is this movie the best horror film to date? First of all, consider the simple plot. Satan just got summoned to Earth by some less than intelligent people and he is... well lets just say very angry, enough said. Next, the tension in this movie is top notch. Don't believe me? Watch ""High Tension"" directed by Alexendre Aja and listen to the director commentary to learn what builds tension in film. There is a reason why they chose this director to remake ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Back to Evil Dead, this movie uses the most blood in any movie ever made and uses it well. There are plenty more reasons why this movie is quite simply the most horrifying experience you will have. But according to IMDb's guidelines, I cannot find room for them in this review.<br/><br/>Anyone looking to view this film should throw out any expectations of good story, good writing or good acting. If you want an academy award winning horror film, I challenge you to convince Steven Spielberg to make one. I guarantee he won't. Although his first film was a horror movie entitled ""Duel"", once viewed you will realize why he won't make another. Any questions?"
"nebk","7","2","8","29 July 2013"," Entertaining
","Evil Dead got some pretty horrendous reviews, and having watched it recently I thought I would offer my opinion. It's not even close to being as bad as other people have made it out to be. A lot of people seem to love giving movies a 1/10 but that just makes me suspicious because for a movie to be rated that low its either absolutely horrible or the reviewers have not really taken the time and considered the various aspects of the movie. I think that in this case the latter is true.<br/><br/>Sure, it might not be as good as the original (although that's up for debate) but then again remakes usually are not (one just needs to think of the completely pointless remake of Psycho, or the watered down remakes of The Hitcher and The Stepfather). Is it a gore-fest? Absolutely. But then if you have a problem with bloody horror movies, then you probably shouldn't watch a movie called Evil Dead. Some people are saying that there are scenes which are too gory but at least they look much more realistic than they do in the original. Having also watched the original recently I have to say that the effects look cartoonish, fake, and, very dated in the original. That's not the case with the new Evil Dead. And if you prefer less gory horror movies which have more of a back story, a slower paced script, and more recognizable actors then you should watch something like Mama or The Woman in Black. If you liked movies like Cabin Fever and The Cabin in the Woods, then you will probably like this too.<br/><br/>The plot more or less follows the original although some changes have been made. A group of twenty something's are in a secluded cabin in the woods trying to help one of the group members give up her drug habit. They stumble upon an evil looking book, make a mistake and read from it, releasing demons into the world. The demons start taking them over and bloody mayhem ensues as does their battle for survival. There is a lot of gore, fighting and dismemberment. The acting is decent all around although as the movie progresses you start getting a general idea of what will happen next. <br/><br/>So even though there are plot holes in the movie, it is still an entertaining gore fest. The effects in this version are much better than in the original or its sequels even though this version does not have Sam Raimi's shaky camera close up shots. The acting was not at all bad, and the movie does not drag on. People have commented on the fact that this ,version lacks humor but I disagree. I think the dialogue between the actors is humorous at times, especially when they try to rationalize what is happening to them. Whether this was intentional or not is a whole different matter. Overall, I would give this movie a 6,5-7 out of 10. A lot of people will not agree with this rating given how highly rated the original version and its sequels were, but if anything maybe this version will make you go out and watch the original."
"TigersWood","7","2","8","23 July 2013"," A Fun Movie, Yet Something's Missing
","In the months leading up to the release of his Evil Dead remake, rookie feature director Fede Alvarez made some promises to the die-hard fans of Sam Raimi's cult trilogy. This would be a gory film with an unprecedented quantity of blood and several nods to original Evil Dead series, with no attempt to recreate scenes or characters from those films. On these promises, he and the producers of Evil Dead have delivered completely.<br/><br/>The film plods along carefully without overtly stepping on the toes of those fans who have a special place in their hearts for such things as The Necronomicon, boomsticks, deadites, Bruce Campbell and soul-swallowing demons. While several distinct tributes are made using props and set pieces (cabin, Oldsmobile Delta, chainsaw, shotgun, cellar) and the camera work, this film has it's own direction and a completely different tone.<br/><br/>This might be where Evil Dead begins to falter somewhat, as the previously employed fun and comical approach to the subject matter is discarded in favour of a more serious tone. Alvarez deliberately chose this strategy, maybe without realizing that a concept as goofy as the Evil Dead probably should not be taken seriously. There's something hilarious about a mischievous zombie giggling and scheming, but it's certainly not genuinely frightening, and this film's attempts to scare the audience are more often just silly.<br/><br/>The faltering continued with characters in the film. The lovable hero Ash is replaced by a group of unlikeable nameless twenty-somethings with very few redeeming qualities. While the actors portray these forgettable characters well enough, there really isn't anyone to cheer for in Evil Dead - there's no villain, and no hero.<br/><br/>That being said, it was a very gory film with some fun parts. So if you are looking for a bloody disgusting yet unintentionally goofy cheese-fest, you might like this flick. Or you could just go watch the far superior Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (1987)."
"ryansurette","10","7","49","6 April 2013"," An amazing Re-boot
","One thing people should realize when entering this film (if you're a long time Evil Dead fan such as my self) is this is more of a re-boot more than a re-make. This film stands on its own, it does not try to be the original in anyway what so ever, which is why there is no Ash character. They wanted this to be a whole new experience, with a new set of characters. Fede and Bruce said this right off, that this film is it's own movie, and does an awesome job at re imagining the series. It manages to stay true to the series roots, and accomplishes something new and intense experience. Fede (being a new director in his field) knew that the series had a very loyal fans, and had to pull this off right to try to please new Evil Dead comers, along with its old. That's a lot of pressure for a new director, but he still managed to pull through with an excellent entry to the series. Now with all that out of the way lets dig into why this is a great film.<br/><br/>Starting with the cons to get those out of the way<br/><br/>CONS 1. The beginning of the film, when Mia is first possessed had me a little confused for a moment. It seemed as if she was seeing the evil version of herself, while still being her normal self or seeing another demon entirely? This had me confused along with a few others. What made me believe she was seeing a possessed version of herself, was when it cuts to her beating a dog to death with a hammer, along with this demon looking very similar to her. I was not sure what was happening here but maybe with another watch of the film I would understand it better.<br/><br/>2. NOT ENOUGH WAMMY CAMS For those who do not understand what that is, it is from the perspective of the ""evil fog"" (as I call it) chasing the person, usually through the woods or through out the cabin.<br/><br/>3. The Music was okay but some of it just felt out of place, but it does have some of the tracks from the original!<br/><br/>4. And this biggest con of mine, The Deadites eyes. Plain white death eyes would have been a better choice, the ones they used just reminded me of a cat. The soulless death stare of the white eyes always sent more shivers down my spine.<br/><br/>PROS 1. The gore! No CG here folks! Nothing beats practical effects. Am afraid that some day that may become a lost art.<br/><br/>2.The film had excellent build up and tension. Multiple parts had my heart pumping and constantly wondering what was going to happen next.<br/><br/>3. Stuck to its roots while doing something new of its own! Had nice throwbacks to the original which I had fun picking out<br/><br/>4.The climax! I am not going to give away anything here, but it held lots of tension along with being exceptionally exhilarating.<br/><br/>5. The acting was good in my opinion, the actors pulled off each situation very well. You have to give them respect after all the hell they were put through on set!.<br/><br/>6. The Book Of the Dead played a bigger part in this one, I do not want to give away how, but the way they implemented was well done and I could not wait to see what the next page had in-store!<br/><br/>7. The film had some of Raimi's trademark camera angles which was one of my favourite things about the original. Fede accomplishes this well giving equally interesting shots. <br/><br/>You have to go into this film knowing this is a new experience. If you go in and constantly compare this to the originals, you probably will not enjoy yourself. This movie does an exceptional job at being it's own film while still paying homage to the originals. Fede accomplished something I am not sure many other people would have, and that is doing one of the best re-makes/re-boots I have seen. It has got me excited to see that he has given life again to the Evil Dead series and cannot wait to see what comes next for Fede and the Evil Dead series."
"The_Dead_See","8","3","15","21 July 2013"," Wow. Good horror is alive and well.
","They say it's a good thing to know thyself, and if I'm brutally honest with myself, I can admit I'm a jaded, pessimistic, old man when it comes to horror. I've watched it for four decades and seen the best and the worst. I've read it since a child - first the Witching Hour comics and then every novel I could find. For the past decade I've written it and published it. Horror has woven its way through my entire life and it's hard to put something in front of me that makes me sit up and take notice. It's even more difficult when that thing is a ""reboot"" of one my childhood favorites.<br/><br/>So when I heard of the remake of Evil Dead I face-palmed and went on a ten minute rant about how awful it would be, how disrespectful to the source material, how mainstream, how dumbed-down, and so on and so forth. When I saw the trailer a few months later I was equally cynical - it just looked like a gorefest, a well done one perhaps, but just a gorefest nonetheless.<br/><br/>Well, I eat my words.<br/><br/>What I just saw was, I think, possibly as good a movie as a reboot could possibly be. Evil Dead managed to create its own original tone and atmosphere while still paying respectful nods to the original. The tree rape is still there, and so is the Raimi-esque montage directing style that made The Evil Dead and Evil Dead II so much fun. There's a smart and particularly gruesome homage to the chainsaw arm. The soundtrack is old-school enough to evoke nostalgia but the sound effects are contemporary and brilliantly done (even the slightly ripped off siren sound from Silent Hill is well used). Best of all the sweeping camera movements through the woods are retained, along with the original sound effect (or a very worthy duplicate) and I think most horror fans would agree that iconic image of the camera roaring through the forest was one of the things that made the early films special.<br/><br/>So in terms of paying homage to the original, I'd say this won on every level. Any more homage and it would have been an unnecessary remake, any less and there wouldn't have been a reason to call it ""Evil Dead"" at all. It hit an optimum balance in my opinion.<br/><br/>But how about as an original film in its own right? <br/><br/>Well, yes it's strong there too - very strong in fact. <br/><br/>Over the years I had a sort of working theory that gore and fear were mutually exclusive. It seemed that the more grue you splashed onto the screen, the further any atmosphere, tension or scare factor receded. This is why many of the films that have terrified me most through the years (The Exorcist, Session 9, The Changeling, Lake Mungo etc.) have all been practically bloodless. But Evil Dead 2013 broke new ground for me. The gore level was off the scale, and tremendously realistic, yet director Fede Alvarez managed, somehow, to maintain a level of creepiness and dread throughout. The film is actually scary. Not off-the-charts scary perhaps, but scary enough to get under your skin a little, and considering the amount of blood in this movie (literally buckets of it) that was a big surprise to me and a humbling reminder to not try to make generalizing theories about movies.<br/><br/>Horror aside, the underlying story impressed me too. It was shallow, as is to be expected from a movie that is principally about demons slaughtering young people in the woods, but there was enough common sense and humanity there to elevate it above the usual drivel. These teens have a valid and serious reason for isolating themselves in the woods - an attempt to get one of them off drugs for good - which lent a much more interesting perspective than the usual ""yo let's go to our aunts cabin and get drunk and have sex y'all"" cliché. The brother and sister relationship between David and Mia is believable and in places quite poignant. Even the throwaway friends were given enough personality and backstory to legitimately feel like they belonged in the peer group. In short, it was well thought out enough that I didn't have to spend the buildup of the movie rolling my eyes at the ill-fitting jock/slut/nerd/token minority/junkie/quiet girl mixture that most movies of this ilk seem to phone in. <br/><br/>This review is getting much longer than my usual quick takes, which I suppose says something about how much the film impressed me. There's one more thing I want to mention before I sign off and it's the most surprising thing of all: somehow - amidst all the doom and gloom and blood and guts and dead-pan playing - the movie turned out to be FUN. I don't quite know how Alvarez pulled that off but I'm sure gonna be on the lookout for his future work. <br/><br/>Evil Dead is a respectful, gruesome, scary and fun reboot. Easily one of the best horrors of recent times and as soon as I get $20 spare, it will be right there on my DVD shelf alongside the originals."

","There different kind of horror films- one that scares you literally , one that thrills you with sudden twist in the end and then there are films which are meant to astonish you with gore violence and blood on the floor. Evil dead falls into the later category which has little substance but has more of slashing , spilling of blood like fountain.<br/><br/>A group of friends visit a cabin in woods where they discover Book of Dead which unleashes evil when re-opened. <br/><br/>A remake of Evil Dead with same name directed by Sam Raimi ( Spiderman series) , the new one falls flat on the surface. The movie begins with a witchcraft magic to kill the evil which is well crafted. However , there was not a genuine reason shown why people came down to the deep jungle as if was meant to take place. The movie is dedicated to all the slasher flicks with no actual stories and rely more on violence and blood. It is spooky at some point but has been elongated by few scenes. The good part is that it is gripping and you will not feel bore at any cost. Direction is decent. Screenplay is inefficient. Dialogues are good. Performance are nice by the lead star cast. <br/><br/>Overall , bad attempt to remake a classic. If you are expecting lot of blood , merciless killings and violence , you will not be disappointed.

","Visceral Gore, stark lighting, ultra creepy woods, and minimal to almost non existent CGI, make the Evil Dead reboot an enjoyable and worthwhile ride out to the cabin in the woods. This is a great film, probably one of the better horror films in the last five years and easily my favorite horror remake so far. My only criticism would be the fact that we get to see what the evil force looks like when it's chasing after you. Didn't really dig that or some of the stilted exposition, but the execution of the scares and gore made up for it, along with the perfect balance of humor and taking itself just serious enough. Went to it three times in the theatre if that's any indication of how much I enjoyed Evil Dead 2013."

","In a nutshell its 'Good' and worth a watch, but do not watch it expecting more than the original.<br/><br/>I often cringe when they make a remake of an excellent film as more so than not they are a flop.<br/><br/>I did walk in with some level of expectations as i am a real fan of the original and i could not help but keep comparing it to the 80's version expecting similar scenes.<br/><br/>Evil dead remake is not a complete replica of the original, in fact its a different story with similar key plot elements. This is a good thing and gives a fresh take on the story of Evil Dead.<br/><br/>It's down falls ...<br/><br/>Where the movie lacks is in the story, i saw many mistakes and goofs as some have pointed out and the characters were not believable enough. I will say they sure can take punishment from the dead thou. I also thought that that the movie lacked in the sound effects department and also there is no sound track to the movie. Evil dead lacks in building a scary environment, the original was good at this and if you have watched it the last 15 minutes is fantastic.<br/><br/>It's high points ...<br/><br/>Gore, gore, gore it goes without saying that if your looking for gore you have come to the right place, some scenes will make your butt cheeks clench and it is clear why it was given an R18+ rating.<br/><br/>The special effects are great, the gore scenes are believable and it achieves to make the viewer react as they should if they were put into that situation.<br/><br/>Conclusion ...<br/><br/>Evil dead is worth watching, although you should watch it with less expectations to the original film. The gore and special effects is what makes up for the lack of storyline, half assed acting, mistakes and is why i have given it a 7/10"
"pixrox1","7","3","15","22 April 2013"," But where was He Who Must Not Be Named?
","Back in 1981, when the original EVIL DEAD was unearthed in a Tennessee cabin, there was no Tom Riddle, let alone Voldemort. But now that we live in a post-V world, it seemingly is incumbent upon any film director who undertakes a remaking of a horror classic about evil spirits to do so in the contemporary context. Nobody in their right mind would do a shot-for-shot remake of a beloved scream fest such as, say, PSYCHO, without extensive updating to reflect how the world has evolved on the scary front in the decades since the original first saw the light of the silver screen (which often is perforated with holes even nowadays, because the sound had to come THROUGH the screen from two giant loudspeakers mounted directly BEHIND the white space in the late 1920s). Just think what a thrill it could have been if one of the characters in the EVIL DEAD remake was interrupted halfway through the act of cutting her own tongue in half by Voldemort knocking on her door, and she couldn't even call out ""Come in!"" because of her tongue trauma."
"untimelydmise","8","7","50","6 April 2013"," 1 out of 10??? Really?
","Since all of these ""1 out of 10"" reviewers decided that ""not getting SCARED by a HORROR movie"" warranted abysmal reviews, I figured I'd go to Wikipedia to find the definition of the genre.<br/><br/>""Horror is a film genre seeking to elicit a negative emotional reaction from viewers by playing on the audience's primal fears. Horror films often feature scenes that startle the viewer; the macabre and the supernatural are frequent themes. Thus they may overlap with the fantasy, supernatural, and thriller genres."" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horror_film<br/><br/>So instead of whining about spending your hard earned money to go see a ""non-scary"" horror movie, maybe go into it a little more educated. I was extremely excited to see the Evil Dead universe get a small reboot, and even more excited to hear that Bruce Campbell had more of a behind the scenes role in the whole thing. I loved The Evil Dead and Army of Darkness, but to think that a complete ""copy and paste"" version of the original with today's obviously fickle viewing audience is complete insanity. The original was great because of it's use of practical, not CG effects; and because of it's balance between goofy and shocking. It was great for it's time, but certainly not for now. Ask yourself this: if they had taken a whole new cast, just put them in the script and overall execution of the original, and called it ""Evil Dead""...wouldn't you be MORE upset? At least they changed it up a little.<br/><br/>I told myself I would keep this relatively short, so I'll say this of the reboot. Was I scared? No. Did I need to be? Not at all. Being among all these CLEARLY professional (lmao) horror movie critics, I can't help but think of how jaded they must be after 20...30...40 years of all the genre has to offer. All of us were freaked out by Jason, Freddy, Pinhead, Chucky, Leatherface, Damian, Reagan, etc...when they got around to doing what they do best. So after seeing all the different ways a person can get f***ed up, what's gonna sell? What will people want to see? *spoiler* Maybe a chick splitting her tongue in half with a utility knife. Or how about that same ""chick"" getting raped by a tree? (I can't help but laugh as I read that) If you were on YouTube looking at videos, and saw one entitled ""guy with chainsaw arm"" and one entitled ""tongue splitting tree rape"", I'm betting your curiosity takes you straight to the latter...just to see what it's about.<br/><br/>As I wrap up, the moral is: Try to appreciate what these movies do WELL, and don't dwell so much on where it falls a little flat. If you DO want to enjoy your horror movie experiences, go into it actually TRYING to enjoy it. Because I could think of very few movies that deserve anything close to a 1/10. Here's hoping I helped someone enjoy the movie. Tip: Don't expect too little, don't expect too much. Just take it for what it is."
"rivertam26","8","10","81","4 April 2013"," Old School
","Remake. Reimagining. Reboot. Sequel. You can use many terms to describe this film but this addition to the Evil Dead franchise manages to create a niche all it's own composed of some appreciated unpredictability, recycled ideas from other films and a plethora of gore soaked goodies. Set in present day the film centers on a group of friends gathered to help a young woman beat her heroin addiction. Mia played by Jane Levy in an uneven but decent performance is that young woman who is the first to fall victim to the notorious necronomicon which of course leads to a night of sadistic horror, the likes of which you've come to expect from these films. Solid and sexy Shiloh Fernandez turns up as her abandoning brother with a slightly melodramatic past, handsome Lou Taylor Pucci as his too curious friend Eric, the talented and gorgeous Jessica Lucas as the most believable of the bunch Olivia and Elizabeth Blackmore as Natalie, David's girlfriend and the not so great actress of the group. The direction from Fede Alvarez is solid I think if a little generic although I am impressed by the enormity of this guy's balls. The cinematography is absolutely gorgeous from it's heightened suspenseful camera angles and the ones that capture the scenery in just the right way to the beautiful composition of light through out the film, it's really very commendable. Speaking of commendable the old school nod to practical effects is much appreciated and way more effective than the CGI crap that crowds multiplexes nowadays. But all in all the film feels feels a little recycled with not much an identity of it's own. it borrows freely from the Evil Dead films and other similar films like it and in truth feels more like a sequel than an actual remake and in that sense it never really feels like it can stand on it's own. Don't get me wrong the film has a barrage of wonderfully gory set pieces but when you look up Evil Dead 30 years from now on the net I'm pretty sure this won't be what comes up. The screenplay however does have some nice touches the reasoning behind them staying is well though out even if the opening is a little hammy and confusing and the constant merry go round effect of who is the films real main character is wonderfully deceptive. That being said, my expectations were set very high I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead films and I had recently watched them and the buzz on this film has been incredible and I bought into a little against my better judgement. When it first started out I didn't feel much of anything and than as it went on it was decent enough but the disappointment started to creep in. I can't say that the feeling ever truly went away completely but the film culminates too such a grand, horrific, entertaining, completely over the top, ickfest finale I couldn't help it when the slight blues fell away replaced with a childish grin that helped me to remember why I have been such a big horror fan since I was a kid. And for that reason alone it's more than worth the price of admission a few times. 4/5"
"eytand94","10","7","51","7 April 2013"," What A Horror Remake Should Be and More
","I am a sucker for horror remakes. Don't get me wrong, some of them are downright bad (ahem, ""Psycho""). Others, like ""The Fly"" and ""Let Me In,"" prove worthy companions to the original and a little bit more. Hearing the news that Sam Raimi's 1981 classic ""The Evil Dead,"" one of my all-time favorite horror movies, was getting a redux brought on some skepticism. Why touch ""Evil Dead?"" It's a movie not built on plot or acting, but on the sheer passion of the director and crew behind it. Certainly, the need for a remake was unnecessary, but I am very welcoming when they come out, and I was more than impressed. 2013's ""Evil Dead"" is the best horror remake since ""Let Me In."" <br/><br/>The story of Raimi's flick was never very complicated, and it's pretty basic here: Four friends journey out to a cabin in the woods to help their friend Mia battle withdrawal after she quits heroine. There's her estranged brother, David, Natalie, his girlfriend, Olivia, a nurse, and Eric, a teacher. Of course, the cabin is equipped with a cellar filled with eerie things, one of them being a book wrapped in barbed wire, made out of human skin and inked in blood. Eric, of course, takes an interest to the book and recites an incantation. Bad move. The incantation brings out a vicious supernatural force that takes over Mia and proceeds to the others one by one. Cue the flying limbs! <br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" is exactly the type of horror remake that works and then some. Uruguayan newcomer Fede Alvarez and his partner Rodo Sayagues have crafted a story that not only shows the deepest appreciation for the original, but also stands on its own two feet without depending too much on it. Alvarez and Sayagues are fans of the original themselves, and they know exactly what the audiences want to see. Their ""Evil Dead"" pays tribute to the original and even works for those who never even knew there was an ""Evil Dead"" in 1981.<br/><br/>Every character is likable, if not a little underdeveloped. But none of the characters in the original film were three-dimensional either, and that's okay. Everyone here is lining up for a body count, but they still gain your sympathy before the Kondarian demons take them over. Shiloh Fernandez is good as David and Jessica Lucas is the same as Olivia. Elizabeth Blackmore's Natalie is the most underdeveloped character, but I still liked her. The movie's two standout performances are that of Jane Levy (TV's ""Suburgatory"") as Mia and Lou Taylor Pucci as Eric. Both are put through serious hell as a demon and as a human being. Being buried alive and being stabbed in the eyes with hypodermic needles was certainly not on their bucket list. Levy and Pucci are real troopers, and their terrific work comes off in spades. But when it comes down to it all, the best performer is Levy. She is believable as a druggie and frightening enough as a Deadite. And boy, can she scream.<br/><br/>Something's missing from this ""Evil Dead"" and that's the gallows humor of the sequels. Personally, I prefer it that way. I was never a fan of ""Evil Dead 2."" It's overrated and abandons the scare factor of Raimi's predecessor. Dedicated fans tend to forget that Raimi wasn't making a horror comedy in 1981. He played the original straight, and the camp set in on its own. Still, it was a creepy and shocking film labeled as ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror."" Alvarez's movie is played with minimal laughs, and truly wants to get under your skin. When it's scary, it's very scary, with perfectly orchestrated jump scares. And when it is funny, it's not too funny. It's a perfect balance.<br/><br/>But let's be real here. ""Evil Dead"" was always best known for its graphic violence, and now, the violence is more graphic than ever. I've sat through the likes of some very gory movies, and the amount of goo this flick gets away with is shocking. It walks a truly thin line between an R-rating and the original film's NC-17 rating. ""Evil Dead"" is swimming in blood, bathing in it like it was a giant pool in someone's backyard. There isn't a single moment that won't make you cringe, mostly because there's no CGI here. The effects of Roger Murray are all-natural practical effects, so when someone is stabbed or cut in half, you feel it. I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the redband trailer, but Levy's character pulls some squirm-inducing action with a box cutter.<br/><br/>In the end, Alvarez had a lot of pressure on his shoulders. This could have been a standard, by-the-numbers R-rated horror movie. But that doesn't fly here. It's not even discussed. Either be true to the original or don't make the movie at all. 2013's ""Evil Dead"" is true to the original respectfully while being its own movie. Deadites will enjoy the winks at Raimi's film (tree rape, anyone?), and they will absolutely geek out over the gore. Plus, the finale is an utter blast. Those who have never seen the original will love it equally. When Sam Raimi, Robert Tapert, and Bruce Campbell, the original's writer-director, producer, and star, give a remake their blessing, the filmmakers must be doing something right. Add to it the applause I heard at the end of the movie, then you know you have something special. ""Evil Dead"" is a hit, not a miss!"
"logantoxic","7","8","62","5 April 2013"," You all are going to die... op op op, Evil Dead style
","The remake/sequel era continues. Will it ever end? Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street, the Hills Have Eyes, are any horror franchises safe? With the latest remake opening today, is this the new normal and are we ever going to see original horror films again? The Evil Dead remake has a lot going against it. For one, it is a remake, and two, the original has such a strong cult following they are sure to cry foul no matter how good the film is. I loved the original, loved it, loved it, loved it and I was unsure about this release. This film actually was very entertaining and I took it for what it was - a horror remake. And based off of that criteria, it was an enjoyable, blood soaking movie that is better than the average horror flare. This movie has its flaws, which are many, but overall it was a good little horror film and will be in the top 5 for best horror in 2013.<br/><br/>Some of the problems I had with it were that this time around, instead of having carefree kids go to a cabin for fun, we have a heroin addict trying to go cold turkey and under no circumstances will they leave the cabin. There is no reason why we need such character development in this type of film. All of the sudden, we know the back story of all of the characters whereas in the original you barely knew their names let alone their occupation, status, whether or not they where a drug addict or if they have abandonment issues. This type of character driven movie slowly takes away from what really is important, the deadites obviously.<br/><br/>There are, however, cool self mutilation scenes, very cool kill scenes and a somewhat satisfying ending to the film, so it is not a totally drag. There is some CGI but not as much compared to others in the genre, which is a good thing because we can only take so much fake blood. CGI just looks cheap in other horror movies and really lessens the impact of the violent scene we are watching. And speaking about those violent scenes, they are really violent and it's nice to see the fake blood splash into the actors' faces rather than to digitalize the blood where it would look just like a cartoon.<br/><br/>We have the burden of living in the Remake/Sequel Era of film and it sucks because instead of getting original material that could be mind blowing and would add a fresh new take of the genre we are left with these glossy, sharp looking remakes that just adds staleness to the genre. Why would they even remake Evil Dead anyway? It wasn't even that popular of a film, even its sequels were considered minor successes. The whole reason why Evil Dead struck such a cord with its audience is because it was so over the top. The axe chopping, the claymation foolery, the deadite eating off its own hand, these are the things that made the original awesome. While there are some scenes in the remake that do remind you of the original, the overall craziness factor seems to be missing. In the original trilogy, you couldn't guess what was going to happen next whereas in this remake, you didn't only guess, you knew what was going to happen. However there was a nice of enough twist at the end to remind us that there is some originality in this film to make it stand alone, standing alone 10 steps behind the original of course, but alone nonetheless. This movie was entertaining and it had a few jumps here and there but it is a remake and a remake has rarely ever been better then the original. But behind all of the glossy feel there is some fun to be had here. I recommend this film, especially for the people who haven't seen the original because their expectations wont be so high.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit my Youtube channel Logan Toxic and visit my blog logantoxic.blogspot"

","Evil dead is quite simply one of the best horror movies in years. It's scary, gory and fast-paced. You won't be bored. As a remake, it only borrows some factors from the original movie, as it stands on it's own as Evil Dead. The reason why these people are in a remote cabin, and why they stay in it after weird stuff stars to happen is much better in this movie than in the original. This movie reminds of the 80's horror movies with its atmosphere, the visual scares and the gore. The visual effects are top notch and although the acting isn't great, they deliver, considering it's a horror movie.

","Firstly, it was always going to be very different to the originals, movies have changed so much since the days of props & make up etc... But they do a good job of trying to take us back there, while keeping the film modern. The story is based on the original but not a copy, it's got different characters in the film, & different things happen to them, however, there is a few parts in the film that pay homage to the originals.<br/><br/>There's more than a few clichés in this film, WHY GO DOWN THERE!! moments! But overall the story is very well thought out, you believe why they stay in the woods etc.<br/><br/>Even compared to the original this is one hell of a nasty demon lol ohhh my, seriously... You see a lot of horror films these days that have a demon or nasty spirit in them, things get moved around, creepy noises, blood dripping down the walls etc and so on... Compared to this demon they might as well be Santa Claws! Seriously this is one messed up film in terms of horror! The acting in this film is amazing, honestly, every painful moment can be felt & seen in the actors face! Everything looks pretty real & you never feel you're taken out of the film by a cheesy moment (Except the why go down there type of moments) This film does make me look forwards to what's to come in the future of this franchise, I can't wait for a sequel.. It as a lot of potential & there really isn't any films out there that are doing these things in this way. Possibly you could compare this to Saw etc, for the amount of blood and hardcore violence, but I don't compare it to saw because it's completely different (I don't personally like the saw films) this looks a lot better (Less CGI) this as a better reason for the murders (A very horrible demon) Seriously, if you like the originals or not try this film anyway... But don't expect it to be like the originals, don't expect that comedy, don't expect the camp stuff.<br/><br/>just sit back & enjoy a very evil demon do things you haven't seen in a movie for a long time Daz"
"philippwollmann","6","3","16","16 May 2013"," Decent!!!
","When I went to see it in a prescreening, I didn't expect much. Because for me the original is the best horrorpic so far.<br/><br/>And it started off really badly, the dialog when they arrived at the cabin was so poor, even a soap opera would be ashamed of. The girl didn't look at all like a heroin addict and it was not believable, that they would stay in the cabin, coz a single nurse cant give the same medical treatment within a rotten cabin, as a whole hospital can.<br/><br/>But from then on it was really quite a joyride. Even though I don't like splatter at all, and I had to cover my eyes a lot of times, it was one of the greatest horrorpics in years, right after ""Drag me to hell"", ""The skeleton key"" and ""The descent""."
"fayesbridegroom","8","3","16","23 April 2013"," a second hand movie lacking a middle finger. But still really good.
","I am a fairly big fan of the originals. As a teenager i would dream of how I would create a sequel to Evil dead 2, and then the army of darkness. I found Evil Dead, this one to really funny in places. It was gory in a zombie type of way, but always entertaining. It presents the concept of the deadites being the different phases of cold turkey. and does it this is a fairly intellectual way. The camera work captures the juxtapositions of the open woods and blood stain close ups of faces.<br/><br/>The Rape scene in this film is less misogynistic. Not traumatic/hysterical like the original movies. But the shower scene afterwards give the premise of rape a more mature display than the original films. I.e someone cowering in the shower in desolation. Not one of the funnier parts.<br/><br/>Overall I would recommend this film, it is violent, but all very good fun. Not too creepy."

","This movie was great. Everything you could ask for. It was serious, gory, intense, and ACTUALLY HAD A STORY. You don't see that often. Of course, the original is a cult classic. The remake really isn't too much like the original, but in a good way. The original introduced the characters then picked up with the horror. Most people think it was intentionally funny, but they don't know jack ****. The movie was supposed to be gritty and intense. Though the budget didn't allow it to do so. It turned out really cheesy,which made people believe it was done purposely. It wasn't intentionally funny, that's why Sam did Evil Dead 2, so he could retell the original with a higher budget, and make it a comedy. This movie had a story, which was about a girl trying to get off heroine, and her friend accidentally releases the demons. It also added that if it took five souls, it could come to Earth, causing it to rain blood. Most people give this movie crap, saying it wasn't funny like the original, so it was crap. Well **** them, this movie wasn't supposed to be funny, and I'm glad it wasn't. It had good acting (except for the blonde, I don't know her name, but I think that's why she barely had any lines), and an amazing story (for it's genera). I also loved the fact it didn't rely on CGI for gore, just good old fashioned special effects. The demon make up was creepy, and not as over-the-top as the original. It was a great movie, and one of the few good remakes. These include (Dawn of the Dead 2004, Rob Zombies Halloween (not Halloween 2), The Hills Have Eyes 2006, Friday the 13th 2009). There are others, but I can't think of any from the top of my head. <br/><br/>A must see movie for all horror fans!"

This is a remake, and the remake itself uses a horror story done to death in Hollywood. Call it a remake of a remake.<br/><br/>The story picks up in a remote cabin in the woods, implied to be somewhere in Michigan. Five young adults dwell there for their annual vacation, and the characters are randomly assigned first names with no surnames. They are Mia, David, Eric, Olivia and Natalie. Flip through your high school yearbook and you can probably find each of them.<br/><br/>Mia and David are siblings, and Mia is a recovering dope addict. Last year things didn't go too well, according to Olivia, the group's self-appointed nurse. Hoping to overcome addiction, the friends try rehabilitating Mia again, this time with her estranged brother David on watch, but something tells me he came just to mingle and mesh with his girlfriend, Natalie.<br/><br/>A third of the way in, I couldn't identify if the irony was on purpose. The movie sets up one-dimensional people in a dark, ominous place with all odds against survival but the character's reiterate they'll be fine. The audience should be chuckling along, or they're as nearsighted as the characters.<br/><br/>Mia smells a foreign odor beneath the cabin. The friends discover a basement through a bloodstained trapdoor and find a cellar decorated in hanging cats which look drier than beef jerky. There is also a book, heavily bound and laced in barbed wire which indicates it mustn't be touched but one character, Eric, opens it anyways. Doing so awakens an old evil. Mia is the first to be possessed and the rest is a survival of the fittest with a horror twist.<br/><br/>There is an audience for this film and they will be pleased by the superfluity of old-fashioned, practical effects substituting for CGI. Someone might be inspired to open a Halloween store. But the gory visuals do not explain the shortcomings of a poor story. If anything they distract.<br/><br/>For instance, in the mood-setting prologue, a father lights his own possessed daughter on fire to salvage her soul. This all allegedly happens in the cabin's basement. But when was this? How recent? When the friends occupy the cabin in the spring, does another family rent it in the winter? Mia and David bring a dog along for company. It's a wonder the pooch never sniffed out the dead cats.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" is a great movie for teenagers on a Friday night who crave an adrenaline high. Beyond that, I can't grasp its potential. For fans of the Raimi movies, they'll use their knowledge of those films as a commentary against this one. For average folks, like me, the movie offers nothing new."
"Casslouise-660-364452","7","3","16","15 April 2013"," The bad reviews are due people who clearly do not understand horror unfortunately.
","I gave a fairly high rating because this film did a great job in mass advertising and had legitimate scary scenes. I will admit that they blew some of the scenes on the previews they've been showing for weeks prior to release which was a bummer to find out.<br/><br/>If you're not an avid horror watcher then you will probably be disappointed with this film. It seems like people were expecting this to be the next coming of Exorcist proportions. Whether you liked that film or not it caused a huge sensor hip stir in many other countries, and scared audiences senseless. <br/><br/>What the audience for Evil Dead 2013 is failing to understand is that is movie is very clearly an homage to the 81' Evil Dead. Hence the horribly cheesy semi offensive lines, super red corn syrupy blood and rather unbelievable plot. Jane Levys' acting as (Mia) is undeniably evil and scary. I think this movie set out to achieve what it intended which was to create a huge hype for an entertaining horror flick."
"Red_Identity","Null","3","16","14 April 2013"," Very worthy
","I've been anticipating this film for a very, very long time. I read the script a month before its release date, not being able to help it. I'm a huge fan of the original trilogy, and the trailers for this were absolutely amazing. Then when it came out and many seemed to have almost passionless responses to it (including may critics) my expectations lowered a bit. The film basically hit my lower expectations, if maybe not quite hitting them.<br/><br/>Some of the dialogue here is clunky, especially the first time we meet the core five. It feels like necessary on-the-nose exposition. But still, I got over it. I want to say that I definitely did like this, but there's just something creatively missing in all of its execution. Truth be told, I expected some truly amazing horror pieces when I read the script, but if anything Alvarez never really goes all the way. I don't want to say much of it feels half-baked because I liked it a lot more than simply giving it that description, but I think much of it holds back. And maybe it's because of the pre-release talk of it being outrageously gory and brutal, but while there's definitely a lot of it to be found, it just never really has a truly effective impact. <br/><br/>Again, always being disappointed with hugely anticipated films makes me come off a lot more critical, but I definitely did like this. It's completely entertaining, and while it's true that the brutality doesn't make as much of an impact as I wish, it's still pretty great to experience. The make-up here is amazing and the effort pays off, and the cinematography is quite brilliant, especially notable for a mainstream horror like this. The acting is hit-or-miss. Fernandez has a huge task and while he's never outright bad, he also doesn't have much screen presence and comes off bored. Blackmore as his girlfriend is easily the weakest of the cast and I think it's good that her character is very under-developed and has limited screen time before her craziness starts. Jessica Lucas is quite good in her small screen time, but the two who really make an impact are (unsurprisingly, since that's what consensus says) Pucci and Levy. The former is quite a hoot and he does his character more than enough justice, making up in charisma what Fernandez lacks. Levy is the star here and she delivers a truly chilling performance, completely believable in all aspects. She hits all of her notes with ease and while this is the first time I've seen her in anything, I'm already a fan.<br/><br/>There's definite craziness and horror goodness here to satisfy many people. While it's true that my expectations were too high and it just hurts the film when it doesn't reach them, this is definitely still better than what horror remakes tend to be and it stands on its own as not just a mere remake. I also want to note that I was pleasantly surprised by the film's humor. It definitely doesn't really take itself too seriously and there's a sense of goofiness that comes with it (which is pretty much why the original managed to be funny and as the decades have passed has been lumped into being a horror/comedy when it actually never was)."
"bmurray153","8","5","34","7 April 2013"," A Good Time Nonetheless
","How do you stand out in an age where Hollywood uses Sequels, Prequels, Remakes, and Re-imaginings as a reliable crutch? More importantly, how do you pay homage to the original without alienating new moviegoers? ""Evil Dead,"" the remake of the 1981 cult-classic, succeeds...more or less.<br/><br/>The opening is a departure from the main story-line and the original ""Evil Dead,"" creating a great atmosphere and introducing a little but of the grizzly gore that Sam Raimi revolutionized. And I was hooked! But from there it goes down hill, then up again, then down and up the rest of the way.<br/><br/>The people coming to this movie don't care about the story because they go to this for the experience. To feel they should not be watching what is on screen before them. To feel uncomfortable. But director and writer Fede Alvarez adds some none the less. Sure, it helps to flesh out a few characters more, adding a little bit of depth. But once hell starts to break loose, it really doesn't matter all that much. That was one thing that really worked better in the original. Sam Raimi did not spend nearly as much time developing a story this time because it was not necessary. You are here to be grossed out, so why bother starting a story that is never meant to be finished? Yet in this extended storytelling, Alvarez develops the mythology behind the bloody events to come. While not nearly as creepy as the voice recording from the original, it adds to the film. This is where the development really works.<br/><br/>Once that half-hour-ish chunk is out of the way, blood starts pouring. Choosing a practical approach to these effects help this film a lot, creating a more believable and brutal character to the violence. But when all was said and done, I felt empty. The marketing campaign is both the triumph and fall of this film. I remember cringing as I watched each red-band trailer, getting me more and more excited to watch the rare good installment in the horror genre that comes by only so often. But as the film progresses, I realized that they spoiled much of the what should have been disgusting surprises of the film. Believe me, there are some pretty disgusting moments in this film that were great, but I had already seen them several times from the trailers. I kept wanting something new to appear, but nothing really did. I strongly recommend staying away from watching the red band trailers if you want to save your reaction for the full cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have criticized this remake for a lack of humor that defined the original. I would disagree and say that there is plenty of humor here, it is just not as campy as the original. I had myself nearly spitting at some of the profanities the Deadites utter. That's not to say that they are shocking, but are loads of fun. <br/><br/>But that being said, I still wanted more from this film. Personally, I did not find the gore to be as cringe-worthy as others have described. Of course, that may be due to my multiple viewings of the red-band trailers, but I still could have seen it going farther. There were far too many jump scares for my taste, and I found myself not to be nearly creeped out as I could have been. I will say though that the end was by far the strongest part of the film, playing up the right elements of gore, suspense, and plain-old ass-kicking. I was happy to leave the theater with with that moment, saying to myself, ""That was pretty bad- ass.""<br/><br/>So is it worth the price of admission? I have come to the conclusion that the answer is yes. Admittedly I was disappointed in this film, but only because my expectations and exposure to the material was extremely high. Of course it is not as good as the original, which was funnier and creepier at the same time. Despite its faults, it still is a great time at the movies, especially in this spring slump. You will be cringing at what you see, asking yourself ""should I be seeing this?"" Yes, yes you should."

","Dear Person I Don't Know Who is Taking the Time to Read My Opinion,<br/><br/>I don't understand why there is so much hate for this movie. I have been a fan of the original series since as long as I can remember. I was raised on them far too early in life, lol. When I heard that this was coming out, I was immediately disappointed. Most people will understand why. Horror remakes/reboots/sequels/prequels/etc..., for the most part, fail miserably at capturing the original faithfully or make something truly new, original, and exciting out of it. As I said, I WAS disappointed. Then the redband trailer came out.<br/><br/>My opinion of the film, long before seeing it, changed instantaneously. I was so anxious to see the film that I read the script twice beforehand and was pleased to find out, upon watching the film, that it retained at least eighty five percent of the original script, something that is fairly rare in the world of rewrite after rewrite that slowly turn something good into the same cliché drivel that Hollywood pumps out five times a month. Once I finally got the chance to see the film, several times at that, I was more than happy to accept it as the best real horror film I've seen in quite some time.<br/><br/>Film goers, on the whole, have been dumbed down over the years by unwittingly watching the same thing over and over again only with different actors. This goes for every film genre, but horror really seems to do this the most. Evil Dead was exactly what it set out to be, what it was meant to be: A true horror film.<br/><br/>People complained about the gore, which in all honesty is no worse than most R rated films, though the use of practical effects blended seamlessly with minimal cgi made it more realistic in appearance. The other biggest complaints seem to be with the acting and with this series getting a reboot. The acting far surpasses the acting we see in most horror films put out these days, and for once we don't have the typecast generic horror characters.<br/><br/>The people who love to rain hate down on this film the most, however, are those I mentioned moments ago. These are the people who are so closed minded that they will refuse to watch a film and even go so far as to try to boycott it because they believe that their opinion, that of which being the series should not be touched in any way, is the only opinion and they somehow know more than we do about everything.<br/><br/>I won't ramble on any further, leaving you with what I have.<br/><br/>Nothing more, nothing less."

"tk-to-dj","Null","3","17","19 July 2013"," This film was Aweosme! ""Realistic Review""
","This breath taking film opens my eyes to a new better generation of horror (Evil Dead 7.3/10). <br/><br/>This film was absolutely blasting and really well done. The plot is solid and it's what you expect from a horror film. This film is disgusting and brutal! I thought the movie Saw was brutalizing, but this is some blood thirsty film. Good horror references example ""The Exorcist"" when Olivia peed herself. Evil Dead is the best horror film in 2013 so far.<br/><br/>There are three important parts of horror genre ""Intense feeling of fear, shock and disgust"" Evil Dead 2013 has all of them 3/3! A horror film does not mean it has to be scary. Example, ""World War Z"" is classified as a horror but it is intentionally not scary. <br/><br/>After reading all these stupid ridiculous reviews I had to write my own review to it. The fact they rated the film 1/10 sickens me. How most people rate horror films are how scary it is, I rate it in a different way. Most of horror comes from box office and theatre hits, so the jump scares goes off the roof! <br/><br/>Every month for the past year, my friends and I have a horror night. We watch a range of horror films so I know and what film to recommend or not. What my friends like are scary films that scar you for life (I guess that's what most people like in horror films).<br/><br/>If you're a horror where it has the thrill to make you scared, this might not be your film. This has a mixture of jump scares and frights but it is not scary enough to make you sleep with your lights on.<br/><br/>Plot holes: The reason why I didn't give it 10/10) <br/><br/>1.The film would have been better if Olivia wasn't a nurse. She is the most idiotic nurse ever! What a terrible nurse. Mia is close to suicide and Olivia decides not to do anything. <br/><br/>2.The cats in the basement. I did not understand this, why cats? What's so special about cats? Apparently it just gives the voodoo, which works out in the film but still pointless.<br/><br/>3.THE MOST IMPORTANT ""The Soul Count"" This was very unclear. My friends and I are still confused about the soul count, we have different theories but I want to find the right solution. ""The Soul Count"" is the demon known as ""Taker of Souls"" takes five souls to unleash the abomination from hell (said in the book).To know the demon has collected five souls it will rain blood which was a pretty awesome scene. I think is ""Taker of Souls"" took 1. The dog's soul, 2.Oilvia when she peed herself, 3. Natalie when they had a very disgusting kissing scene 4. Eric when died in the basement and 5. David sacrificing himself to save Mia. This was VERY unclear and I will never know the answer. <br/><br/>I realise the group is spelled Demon:<br/><br/>David Eric Mia Olivia Natalie <br/><br/>I love Evil Dead's intensity and creativity in the horror genre. Get out and see it as soon as you're able. This film is groovy! (7.3/10)"

","The horror film we needed. Despite the naysayers, Evil Dead delivers bloody gore and then some. Get one thing straight: this type of horror movie will absolutely NOT be for everyone. If you like roller coasters, fun houses, and haunted hayrides, this film is for you. If you're looking for thought provoking, art-house horror or ghostly creepiness, look elsewhere. I'm tired of the current horror fare. You can keep your Sinister and Paranormal Activity. Rob Zombie's poor attempt at imitating Argento? Give me a break.<br/><br/>The headlong jump into a bloody rabbit hole that is Evil Dead is exactly what fans of old school gore have been waiting for. This is the most fun I've had in a theater since The Cabin In The Woods. <br/><br/>I'm a huge fan of the original material and have no idea how anyone who loves them as much as I, given the current state of American horror cinema, would use this opportunity to stroke their own egos by trashing it. Are you kidding me? I should note that I'm a fan of Hatchet, Cabin Fever, Maximum Overdrive, Demons, and Jason m#@!f*%king Voorhees, but also of The Beyond, Susperia, and Let Sleeping Corpses Lie.<br/><br/>You can't go wrong with Evil Dead if you're in it for a good time.

"raduz123","8","3","17","19 April 2013"," A fantastic and gory retelling
","I grew up with the Evil Dead films and have watched them numerous times and so it was with some trepidation that I went to watch this and you know what, I was throughly impressed.<br/><br/>The scenario and the sentiment from the original remains but what impressed me most was the fact that despite the countless horror and slasher flicks with similar themes the characters are believable, there is a real context for them being in the woods. None of them fall too heavily within genre stereotypes, there isn't really a dumb blonde, a jock etc they are average, smart young people.<br/><br/>I personally loved how the film paid homage to the previous Evil Dead films, the most impressive being the way the former protagonist 'Ash' and his experiences are divided between the cast. There are also some great telling shots that are a clear reference to the former films.<br/><br/>In my opinion It's genuinely a very good horror, Evil Dead manages to be scary and despite being a remake very original in it's retelling. In true Evil Dead style there is also a great dose of gore-porn in there too and the special effects were not too CGI laden.<br/><br/>For people who feel the film isn't scary I would argue that if they know about or are fans of the original Evil Dead, few films probably scare them."

","Okay, i thought in the beginning of seeing the trailer was insane! Making a remake of the original ""Evil Dead"" and having Bruce as the director was great as well. But when i found out they weren't going to use an official CG I to assist the EXTREME violence, was great ass well. When i walked in the theater, i was in for quite a treat, i mean a super blood & gore cookie. I mean the amount of fake blood or gore they used for this movie must have been to funny. A lot of the movie i cheered insanely and laughed as well, but they took it more seriously from the original, the original looked cheesy and clay mated, but knowing that was made back in '81 it must have been great to see the original in theaters as a teen! I enjoyed the remake as much as the original, i know a lot of the IMDb users did not like the movie and gave it cruddy ratings, but knowing a gore loving person such as myself, it was great. Especially at the end, Mr. Campbell had to have his own entrance. *SPOILER ALERT* At the end of the credits, he has a tiny little spotlight on him and he says his famous line ""groovy"" and looks at the camera. After that i was just going bananas! Seeing the movie twice is a better experience then seeing it once, cause i know a lot of the people who went to see it covered their eyes must have during the whole movie! But you get to see anything cause you know whats coming next. I cant wait 'till this movie comes out on blue-ray in July of 2013, because its gonna be great DIRECTORS CUT BLU-RAY. So the only problem i had was the cover title, ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience"", huh....more of a GORE-FEST!"

I found the 1st 3 paranormal activity films scary but i dint find the same things with this.<br/><br/>There is a fair bit of gore init for no real reason then for shock value but if you've seen the saw films nothing new here.<br/><br/>The characters are abit and get on your nerves abit especially when they do something stupid as they always do in films like these but the acting isn't bad overall.<br/><br/>Im not concerned about a movie being art or the greatest actors in the world as long as they are better then the actors in silent hill revelations I'm happy. I don't go to the movies to watch stuff high rated stuff like the artist or the hunger games an well you get idea all these award winning films and critical acclaim i normally find abit crap except for say the LOTR films and some others. <br/><br/>If like me you like to go to the movies for some entertainment and just wanna see a good horror movies with a few scares init go see this its not the greatest film ever made but its still well worth a watch and ill definitely get it on blu-ray.<br/><br/>So yeah go watch it.<br/><br/>Now."
"rebecca61189","8","3","17","18 April 2013"," Amazing Remake
","After reading so many bashing reviews on this movie, I feel like as if it's my duty to write on positive review. Here it goes.<br/><br/>I saw the original after watching the red band trailer for the remake last year. I was extremely excited especially after watching the original (which I didn't think was that great, but it was fun and I would recommend it to the right friends). Here's the deal, they originally released a red band trailer and that just gives you the fraction amount of gore they give you in the original. IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT THROUGH THE TRAILER, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>Good Points 1) I love the new story line. A bunch of friends get together to try and detox one of the main characters and during their time there, they find ""the book"". 2) The gore. It was so over the top as intentioned by the crew who made this movie that I enjoyed it completely. It was gross, the cutting off limbs, the nail gun, the vomit, etc was insane. I am a 24 year old woman so this is not the rambling of 15 year old boy who's obsessed with blood. 3) They lightened up on the manic laughing that I found so irritating in the original. 4) The movie did not take itself seriously. I think that if the producers were trying to make this seriously, than the outcome of this film would have been different. 5) I felt they actually just made the movie without the constant drawing out on who's actually dead and who isn't. <br/><br/>The Bad 1) Yes, this movie has plot holes and whoever sees it will know immediately what I am talking about. That being said, there are so many classic horror films that have plot holes that it wasn't really an issue for me. It is what it is. 2) The movie is not actually scary. Half of my friends thought it was scary, and the other half didn't. I personally didn't think it was frightening, but I did jump a few times. 3) Although I listed the gore as a positive, I understand were people would hate this movie because of it. There are certain parts you watch and you know that the director probably shouted something like, ""We need gallons blood! There isn't enough! MORE MORE MORE!!!!"" while someone in the background is holding a fire hose spraying a ton of red water/paint. 4) The acting was mediocre. I notice that with a lot of remakes lately the acting has been more blah than anything. I thought the girl who played Mia did a very good job but the others? I'm pretty sure they could have some better people to play their parts.<br/><br/>Well, that's my review! I just felt that something good should be said about this movie. It didn't debut at number 1 for no reason! I think that if you just watched the trailer (red band one)you will get an overall idea to base your decision on whether or not you want to see this movie."
"roxass1992","9","3","17","16 April 2013"," Better than most modern horror films
","Firstly, when going in the theater, I didn't expect Evil Dead to have amazing acting, or a top of the line script, what I DID expect was a gruesome, brutal, homage to earlier horror films with a modern twist. From the very first shot this movie had me hooked, the tone that is set is the kind that automatically makes you feel on edge, and for the remainder of the film, that tone is sustained. Compared to previous horror movies, that I have wasted my time and money on, Evil Dead is definitely worth while. Sure, it has it's flaws in some ""eh"" dialogue and some questionable decisions made by the characters, but isn't that the point? The original Evil Dead (of which I am a big fan) was chuck full of cheesy dialogue and foolish, stereotypical characters and was a masterpiece, so why this film is getting so much hate for elements like that seems to be a bit contradictory to why we watch horror films in the first place, which is to be scared. Not blown away by great acting, or immense story depth, just to be scared and entertained and on the field Evil Dead definitely delivers. If you are the type who tends to not think out side the box when watching films, or tends to look for exact matches of the original for remakes, then I would not recommend this film for you. But, if you are the type who can just enjoy a bloody, intense, thrilling, fun horror movie without taking it too seriously, then I would say GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! 9/10"
"zathina_mage-661-774063","9","3","17","16 April 2013"," I'm Happy With it.
","I've been a fan of the series for a long time, my original introduction when I was not even a teenager, and having not only owned the movies but generally showing everyone I befriend the entire trilogy has become a near constant activity for me. <br/><br/>When I saw the trailers for this, I was excited. But having been excited about movies before and having been failed, I realized it'd be best to set my expectations realistically. There was three ways this could go. They where either going to botch it, do better then the original (but never recognized as such due to blind fandoms), or not even match what the original content was at all.<br/><br/>I found upon hitting the movie, that I was utterly wrong. It certainly was not botched. It certainly not better. But most of all, and most important. It was very much striking the original content, if not expanding on it without loosing the idea. This movie, was in fact Evil Dead. <br/><br/>Yeah there will be people who will complain about the gore. Honestly it was less gory then the original, but without loosing the right amount of gore feel that the original had. There was in fact, fear, for the first time in forever in me when watching this. Even if it was for a moment, having watched mostly horror movies as a child when other kids watched Disney. Though likely what deeper aspects of this movie, the parts that make it scary but require one to analyze or simply think about the ramifications upon a human's psyche, will be lost to the common viewer. <br/><br/>The way the characters reactions matched, maybe not to how the original was as much as the original trilogy gives it a big feel for being truly evil dead and I feel somewhat there was a nod to the comics with some of the lore. <br/><br/>What makes this great for those who are hardcore fans, is that the lore that gets explained are things that really are the why did this work and what was that things of the last trilogy, and they did so without it being ridiculous, as well as pseudo explaining how things like the book making it from one to two and still being intact. <br/><br/>The movie didn't disappoint, which is a lot more then most new movies, and remakes have done in the last five years. In my opinion this is one of the better horror films of the last decade. But most, will be too critical to actually notice the little things about it. So for those who still haven't seen it, just go in with a perceptive eye and a willingness to take it in, rather then a readiness to jump."
"DisturbedPixie","8","3","17","15 April 2013"," a Gorier and more disturbing, yet thoughtful, take on a tale told 4 times
","I think it's a little sad when a poor publicity run with misleading critics quotes ruins a film for people. I never go in thinking this is going to scare the hell out of me. Out of every ten horror movies I watch... maybe 1 scares me, if that.<br/><br/>Most horror movies are more disturbing than scary, and this succeeded at being heavily disturbing. I think it was a great metaphor for addiction and withdrawal, and I saw that metaphor about rape killing you inside and leaving you a shell, that can be filled with anything. The original couldn't throw those metaphors into the mix and relied far more on being disturbing and gory and quirky. I think this was far more gory and disturbing than it was before, Plus it actually had a message, and had great acting and cinematography. You could pull 100 stills from this film and have amazing images. Blood pouring. Arm hanging. Face licking. Images you may never forget.<br/><br/>Sure, it lost some of the humor, but I frankly never found the first Evil Dead as very funny. I found this 2013 rendition's setting extremely dark and hopeless, and that's what addiction really feels like. Since this is the 3rd time Within The Woods was re told... I think it finally came to a point where it's more than a horror movie. It's something that deserves dissection and thoughtful discussion. Unfortunately, far too many horror fans just want the tits, blood, and violence or the nostalgia of something other people aren't cool enough to enjoy. I personally can enjoy the 52nd adaption of Alice in Wonderland, as well as the 8th, or the 20th, and I don't have a problem with admitting it.

"juice2305-966-675788","10","3","17","14 April 2013"," I loved it!!!
","OK, I have seen the new Evil Dead remake twice already and I thoroughly enjoyed it both times. I also saw the original Evil Dead and it's two sequels. I enjoyed the first film as well as the Evil Dead 2. But I thought Army of Darkness sucked royally and I won't even mention that crap anymore. I thought the first two were scary, though very cheesy looking. BUT that was 32 years ago. NOW as for the updated remake, I LOVED IT!! and the only reason I gave it 9 stars instead of 10 is because I was disappointed when it ended. I wanted so much more. I loved the characters, except for one who was just too stupid. Granted there are a lot of characters in horror movies who are several cans short of a six pack. But this one was a cut above the rest in stupidity. I mean if something is Barb wired shut, shouldn't that mean DON'T OPEN IT? But with the exception of his dumb a--, I really cared about the other four. And I thought the story as to why they were out there to begin with was excellent. And as for the gore, come on! if you're a fan of this genre, how could you not love this? (And I may as well be honest, I also thought the lead character was so cute, there were times I wish I could have jumped into the movie and helped her myself. I will be looking for her in future films.) OK, I had to get that out and now back to the movie. As I said, if you're a fan of this genre I just don't see how you could not like this movie. As for me, I have come out of horror movies over the last few years and wanted my money back, because they were hyped up so much, and I was expecting so much and got nothing. Insidious, V/H/S, Prometheus and so many more which I can't think of right now, but they all SUCKED!!! This film was entertaining from start to finish and it definitely was not boring at all, as a few reviews have stated. It was predictable however, but what Horror movie isn't these days? So I give it 9 stars because I was totally entertained and did not leave the theater wanting my money back. Instead I left the theater wanting more. And I look forward to Evil Dead remake part 2. Only this time bring ten people to the cabin so it can last a little longer. lol"
"loewleon","7","1","3","17 December 2018"," A good remake with a few benefits
","First of all this is a good Remake/Reboot/Sequel.<br/><br/>It starts as an average Teen-Horror Movie and goes onto some fantastic effects and Splatter par excellence.<br/><br/>The story is settled after Army of Darkness and works as a Reboot/Sequel, although the movie takes some scenes from the original, it creates its own story with new characters.<br/><br/>Splatter fans will have their fun, as well as Evil Dead fans. Just give it a chance... it comes along with other great Horror- Remakes like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003).<br/><br/>Sit down, enjoy the show and maybe you'll even find some Easter Eggs.<br/><br/>7/10"

"afreakingwizard","7","1","3","24 May 2018"," A cliche, yet fun modern look at Evil Dead.
","2013's Evil Dead gets a lot of hate, but is it really all that deserved? Well, I would say it's more of a yes and no thing that only one or the other.<br/><br/>I wasn't that big of a fan of the original Evil Dead, but I can't deny the profound effect it had on the genre. Fans of the original are going to notice a lot of similarities, but Evil Dead 2013 still has enough differences that I would say it's worth watching at least to see the changes that were made.<br/><br/>I think the biggest thing Evil Dead 2013 has going for it is how much fan-service there is with all the references to the older Evil Dead movies and the absolutely ridiculous amounts of gore. I can see why that would turn a lot of people off, but the effects do look really good, and the self aware over-the-top presentation makes it redundant to criticize since just as many people will love it for the same reason so many people will hate it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Evil Dead 2013 is the abundance of horror movie cliches, and twists that can be seen coming from a mile away. Part of this is because this is an Evil Dead film, but most movie squeals (especially horror) will inevitably fall into that cycle.<br/><br/>I think the trailer really does sum up what the movie is like, and even if you haven't seen the original Evil Dead, if you like the trailer then you'll probably like the movie."

It was very scary and extremely gory but not in a way that made me want to barf. The acting in my opinion was very good and Mia made me just want to hide behind my pillow because her character was terrifying in my opinion.

"TheMovieDiorama","7","1","3","2 March 2018"," Evil Dead is probably one of the goriest films I've ever seen.
","I can only assume that the film makers supplied several swimming pools filled with fake blood...because there is so much of it. Blood on the floor, blood on clothes, blood on faces, raining blood, blood on...wait a minute, raining blood!? Yes, it goes to that extreme. So Evil Dead is a remake of the original of the same name, we follow a group of teens in a cabin in a remote location who try to help their friend to stop taking drugs. They find the book of the dead and what ensues is a heck load of blood and gore! Oh, and all of the following: tree rape, slicing tongue and snogging someone, car crushing a girl's hand and her pulling it out...and my favourite, absolutely decimating someone with a chainsaw. I'm talking ripped to shreds! Total annihilation! Ohhhh so satisfying to watch...in a sick weird way. As you can probably tell, I enjoyed the hell out of this and have done for several viewings. It knows exactly what it is, a fun gory flick that does not take itself too seriously. Yes the characters are bland and expendable and yes the acting is mediocre, except Jane Levy who was actually really good. But you didn't watch this for an Oscar nominated performance. No no no you wanted to see a girl slice her mouth open with a shard of glass! I mean the enhanced use of makeup, prosthetics, costumes etc. just made the experience all the more enjoyable and authentic. I appreciated the dark comedic undertone, particularly from the possessed Mia, that definitely harked back to the original. Director Fede Alvarez did a good job, lots of creepy camerawork and I adored the opening bird's eye view shot where the teenagers are driving along the road. His usage of visual exposition, such as flashbacks to the opening scene, were pointless and unfortunately spoon fed us everything. You'll guess the whole plot in the first 10 minutes, which is its downfall. However, I wanted to see gore and it delivered...massively. My advice: don't read a book made of skin and wrapped in barbed wire. Just don't."
"Bored_Dragon","8","1","3","1 March 2018"," This time remake is better than original
","Although I'm usually against remakes, in this case I fully agree with the project. Movie tells essentially the same story as the original, but with more serious approach. While ""The Evil Dead"" (1981) was shallow, stupid, cheap and over-the-top to ridiculousness, ""Evil Dead"" (2013) is serious horror movie. The story is better developed, with more convincing details, and has a much better dramatization and characterization than the original (not to say that there's none in the original flick). It begins as a drama, introduces us to characters, builds suspense and eerie atmosphere, and only after twenty minutes slowly moves with the introduction of horror elements in the story. Actors are completely unknown to me, which, if they are good, is a great addition for watching horror movie. The acting and directing are good, music is atmospheric, and the effects are, although they copy original and do not use CGI, much more credible and effective. Maybe I'm a sissy, but I had to pause few times to relax. The film retains many of the original scenes, but the roles are scrambled. Good example is cult scene in which Ash cuts off his hand with chainsaw. In remake, demon takes over hand of one of the girls and she also removes it, but unlike the original story, here the cutting does not help and soon the demon takes over and she dies. This change in the story is quite fine, but one thing I can not forgive - they replaced Ash's chainsaw with small kitchen electric cutter... wtf, really?! The end is completely changed, but it's great. All in all, a top horror, a recommendation to all fans of the genre.<br/><br/>8/10"

The most relentless display of twisted, sick violence, gross out moments, and haunting, possessed faces to hit screens, in my opinion, since The Exorcist. Yikes. The first one is creepy in its own right. Add an extra 70,000 gallons of blood and an inflated budget and you've got yourself a new level of WTF."

"garodardavis-08913","6","1","3","17 August 2017"," Not 'spectacular' but definitely worth watching.
","I admit, I must've been one of the few people who watched the remake first and then seen the original. The difference is huge. The original is better nonetheless, but this movie also managed to entertain me.<br/><br/>I see this remake as an attempt to create a true and horrific Evil Dead experience seen through the eyes of some new characters and protagonists. It worked, but the movie also had its flaws.<br/><br/>Short summary:<br/><br/>Mia (who is an ex junkie) came with her brother David and their friends at a remote cabin in the woods to have a little bit of fun away from the cities and to help... well, Mia. Not later, they find a cursed book (Necronomicon) in the basement and one of the characters, Eric reads out loud from the book and summons evil demonic presences lurking in the woods that will kill them 'one by one'. <br/><br/>Some of the pros about the remake:<br/><br/>Now, what I really liked about this movie is the real horror, the gore and fear created by the antagonist to give you one of the most chilling experiences ever. Most of what you see in the movies is practical effects, rather than CGI and it looks very, very good. <br/><br/>The book also looks a lot more scary and better compared to the original movie.<br/><br/>The demons are probably THE scariest, most sadistic and truly the most evil antagonists you'll ever see.<br/><br/>Some of the cons about the remake:<br/><br/>The overall pacing is not well made. Everything happens way too fast and it somewhat doesn't give you the needed level of tension by constantly killing off characters.<br/><br/>The writing could have been better. And yes, I know this is a remake of the original, but I don't think it should've been so similar when it comes to the writing. I've seen a lot of remakes, but this is the first time I feel like showing something all over again, only more terrifying doesn't work.<br/><br/>The acting was poorly done by many characters. There are few characters whose performance I really, really liked in this movie. The main and the best actor in this movie is Lou Taylor Pucci (Eric). Jane Levy (Mia) did an excellent job as ""The Demon"" and pretty good as herself. Rest of the characters didn't show much, let alone Elizabeth Blackmore (Natalie) who was probably the worst actor in this movie.<br/><br/>There was no character development. We only saw a bit of ""connecting"" between David and Mia in the beginning, but rest of the movie, characters are pretty much non developed and uninteresting hence why their deaths didn't make me feel sad for them (except Eric).<br/><br/>Overall, I can say that this movie is decent at least. It's scary, its gory, it has a somewhat decent antagonist and less decent, but 'ok' writing. The movie is definitely worth watching, but if you're expecting a 'Spectacle' remake, then I suggest you don't bother with it."

Having so many different levels of attraction that people are drawn toward being scared there'll always be scattered reviews depending on what causes them fear.

"beybeykestrel","8","1","3","11 July 2016"," Faces at different times
","The Evil Dead (1981) tells of a story that a crowd of young people come to a cabin and accidentally evoke the demons in the wood through 'Book of the Dead'. Actually to say, I love its tempo! The tight plot moves the tempo of this film forward so quickly, as if there are so many monstrous scenes bumping into my sight form every corner. Even every step the film characters take brings me the feeling that something evil is always watching every breath and every second. However, the tempo of the re-make Evil Dead (2013) is apparently slower than the original. But I think it is a great re-make version! Because the atmosphere of terror in the re-make is better than the original through the delicate camera movements and exquisite film set. In the plot, the clichÃ© is not as simple as the original one. It has the new idea of some gore-spreading and slaughtering scenes. It is very creative. Only one thing I have to say is the impression of the faces in the film at different times. It seems that the makeup techniques and computer-generated images in 1981 are old-fashioned, but I think the possessed faces in the original is more horrible than the faces in the re-make. These faces in the original and the symptoms of the possessed people make me think of The Exorcist (1973). Maybe the horror films about the possessed at that time all do that alike makeup technique so that the faces are similar."
"auslucas","10","1","3","24 June 2016"," Absolutely worth it
","It looks like people mostly focus on one thing, it's a remake, and forget the other part : it's certainly one of the BEST horror movie ever made. There is everything here to bring you down straight to hell, and it does ! Though it doesn't bring you back... Yes, it's a remake of the first Evil Dead movie ( not the second one so do NOT expect a comedy-horror movie but a gore horror movie ) where you will not find the amateur and talented Sam Raimi behind the camera. Of course it's not the same, and if we try to compare this remake to the Evil Dead movies it fails especially for one reason : Bruce Campbell isn't here (wait until the credits are over though) Now, let's focus on the HORROR MOVIE part. I'm a big fan of horror movies (I've got a good level of expectations) I saw the worst and the best and I'm not easily scared even if I always try to be a good audience. That's for the presentation. This Evil Dead is the movie that horrified me the most. I thought I was ready with my background, I wasn't. All the bad points I got in mind are linked to the fact that it's a remake, cast that apart, and you've got here THE horror movie you've been looking for. Don't wait no more Deadites are on their way, come get some !"
"MattBirk","6","1","3","17 March 2016"," A Solid Horror Remake that is V.I.O.L.E.N.T.
","Though Evil Dead has plenty of faults (the sounds the demons make are super lame), it is still one of the better remake/reboots out there (not sure if it's a reboot, considering that means it's becoming a series or spawning more sequels). The practical effects are fantastic and very brutal, they save the film from being another dismissive horror, gore- porn. But the movie doesn't feature any strong characters (like Ash from the original), it does its best to try and make Mia a formidable heroine (still doesn't work, however). That might be a problem with the movie right there, all the characters are quite bland.<br/><br/>But perhaps its biggest downfall is that the movie goes for a more strictly horror approach instead of balancing the tone of the film between horror and comedy. The approach was clearly meant to be a more serious tone, but even that serious tone felt of quilter, maybe the movie would have benefited from a joke or two? So if you are looking for a horror movie with gore and lots of blood, this will definitely do, but if you want a horror movie with an actual storyline and atmosphere.....steer clear of this. Evil Dead is another unnecessary Hollywood remake of a beloved cult classic which only tarnishes the original's reputation!"
"bryank-04844","8","1","3","2 September 2015"," 'Evil Dead' is scary as hell.
","Much like the rest of you, I followed along and reported the up-to-news as I got it in on everything having to do with this remake, and I have to say, that I was apprehensive to a lot of it. Having newcomer director Fede Alvarez fill the might shoes of Raimi, and not having Bruce Campbell reprise his role of Ash, or even having an Ash character had me scared and annoyed that this glorious remake that I have wanted for so long was going down the tubes. And the fact that Campbell, Raimi, and Tapert were only producing the flick had me even more worried as they might not be on set every day to make sure things were running smoothly. Luckily, after a little production time had passed, we reported that the trio was very hands on in every aspect of production. Then came that infamous scary trailer and after viewing, my mind was at ease as all my worries disappeared and I knew we were going to get the 'Evil Dead' we deserved, even if it didn't have Bruce Campbell as Ash.<br/><br/>'Evil Dead' is scary as hell.<br/><br/>Alvarez with the help of Raimi conjured up a spectacular remake that would make the original proud. There are tons of homages and throwbacks to the original two movies and enough of the same story line to know what is to happen next, however, this remake has a few curve balls that it will throw in your direction, along with enough blood and guts to make Peter Jackson squirm.<br/><br/>As in the original film, we focus on a group of 20 somethings who journey off to a remote cabin in the woods. However this time, it's not for a fun vacation. Instead, the group of friends are here for a girl named Mia (Jane Levy) who has a serious drug habit who they are planning a detox and intervention. Her group of friends have even enlisted the help of her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), who has been off for the past few years doing his own thing and not once thought to call his sister or his friends. Something doesn't smell right though, and soon enough someone finds the book of the dead and even though the book is wrapped in plastic with barbed wire, and in the pages it says DO NOT READ, the passages are read and all hell breaks loose and there is sure to be some swallowed souls.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez will be a household name soon. He packed enough confidence in taking the reins of this iconic fan favorite and made it his own. In return, we get a no-holds barred gore fest that has great acting, plenty of genuine scares, and a treasure trove of scenes that will have you covering your eyes in horror. Alvarez keeps the tone close to the first film in that it is serious with no silly gags that will make you laugh. If you indeed do laugh during this remake, it will only be the nervous kind of laughter, not because something was funny.<br/><br/>There is no CG blood in this remake. Raimi, Tapert, and Campbell made sure to secure a generous budget and decent shooting schedule to create the perfect atmosphere for real effects using gallons upon gallons of real-fake blood. The result is very satisfying as us as an audience can always tell the CG blood from the real blood, and somehow I always feel slighted and taken away from the film because of this. As if it didn't happen and the actors didn't get dirty or hurt in any way. That's not the case here. There are plenty of flesh cutting scenes that involve tongues, eyes, and other various limbs that will make you scream out in the theater for it to stop.<br/><br/>The acting was surprisingly very good this time around. Yes, I know, Bruce 'man- god' Campbell is the greatest thing in the world, but he wasn't the best actor back in the 80s. Here, we have relatively new actors who all turn in very solid performances and are very believable as each one of them meets a gruesome and violent death. The cream of the crop here is Jane Levy, who seriously terrified me to no end. She plays a cool enough girl who has some problems, but is always very charming. However, when things take a turn for the worst for her and she turns into a deadite, her voice and body language will haunt my nightmares for quite some time.<br/><br/>From cutting off your own hand, to a nail gun, to it literally raining blood from the sky, 'Evil Dead' is a very satisfying and fun experience at the theater. An experience you don't want to be alone at, but rather view the film with friends. I'm sure you will all pick up on all the 'head nods' to the original film throughout the entire film. And when you're not on the edge of your seat and covering your eyes from the pure and unadulterated horror that is on the screen, you will find yourself clapping at moments when someone sees a chainsaw or reloads a boomstick.<br/><br/>'Evil Dead' is some of the most fun I have had at the theater in a long time and I can't wait to see it again. And don't forget to stay in your seat till after the final credits roll, as you will be treated to something very special."
"jtindahouse","9","1","3","13 January 2014"," Actually really chilling stuff
","Let me start by saying I haven't seen the original film this was based on 'The Evil Dead', but if it's even half as good as this one I'll have to check it out. 'Evil Dead' (2013) blew me away.<br/><br/>Importantly, we aren't treated to a bunch of horny, unrealistic teenagers who we are sick of after 10 minutes and thus don't really care as to whether they die or not. The characters are real and down to earth and this added a lot to the quality of the film.<br/><br/>The scares are genuine. There's a little bit of 'The Exorcist' channeled throughout. It takes about 20-30 minutes to get things kicked off, but once they do it never relents for a moment. There's really no humour at any point and this works well. It pulls no punches and delivers frights even when they're expected - and yet they are still completely effective. Horror movies spend too much time these days trying to lure you into a false sense of security with fake build-ups time after time after time. 'Evil Dead' doesn't mess around with that kind of nonsense.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly impressed with this one. The acting is good, the direction is excellent and the overall quality of the movie is nothing short of superb. You will be left feeling very uncomfortable throughout. If this is going to be the quality level of all remakes I've got no problem with them being made at all."

","I enjoy a good horror film, but unfortunately this wasn't one. I saw a lot of good reviews for this, and on cable TV it was a 3 of 4 stars, so I thought Evil Dead would be a good film to DVR. I was very disappointed! I saw the original when it first came out, so to be honest I hardly remember it, and was not comparing the two at all. I personally, just found this movie to have a bunch of useless gory, scare-seeking, and poorly scripted scenes. Seriously, I watch almost any movie to the end, even if it's not so good, but I turned this off and erased it from my DVR about half way through. It was just stupid. Lots of stuff being projectiled from the mouth, evil eyes, characters walking off on their own and not using their brains to think or make reasonable decisions...all that typical 'B' horror stuff. To me it was just ""teen horror"", with no intelligence...not campy enough to be fun and not clever enough to be good.

"mungosmungo8694","2","1","3","20 November 2013"," I am NOT vindicated
","OK I see that ppl are confusing lots of things here. 1. The original was not meant to be a comedy it was strait horror...some things just ended up being goofy in the final cut.and over time 2. The original is uneasy to watch to some that do not watch horror films. The movie is a little un-nerving. 3. Evil Dead 2 IS NOT A REMAKE of Evil Dead one. An above poster clearly states the reasons why. Get over it you are wrong. 4. This movie ED13 as an above poster calls it. Was terrible. it had the gore (well more like buckets of blood.not much chunky stuff) of the first one and the needle in the eye scene was pretty good. But the rest of the movie just falls flat. Why? IT HAS NO TENSION. NO SUSPENSE. That is what made the first one work...that is what made all horror films from that era that are ""good"" work. The original? It's not scary. It has tension in a way that the remake could not grasp. Once they started dyeing....it was pretty simplistic after that...no build up at all. NONE. 5. the acting was indeed terrible. 6. One Major problem this movie has that not many (that I have seen post) are aware of, is that if the locals in the begging of the movie are aware of the book, which they are, and what the book can do...why don't they protect the book...destroy the book....or I don't know hide it at their place, so no one would tamper with it. NOOOO instead they wrap it in barbwire and try to scratch out some of the pages...sorry that doesn't work for me. 7. the score was forgettable.....like i already have 8. other than MIA I remember none of the cast. 9. I am glad this was NOT A SHOT BY SHOT REMAKE. But I am NOT glad at the product that was delivered. 10. Bruce's cameo at the end credits was sweet...in fact, the only thing I truly remember liking. 11. They tried to hard with Mia's hand....Its a jeep. In the blood soaked mud that has give. It was a FIBERGLASS hard top. IT WOULD NOT HAVE RIPPED OFF HER HAND. Broken it? Yes I'll go that far...but not ripped off. 12. They pulled a NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 2 on us. Ignored and changed the rules....and just made new spit up. 13. I was hesitant about the drug withdrawals at first...in fact I didn't like it. After I thought about the possibilities it would give us...I was optimistic. The only thing that it achieved was a good answer for them to NOT LEAVE THE CABIN, which works a little better than the motivation in the original. The final execution of the Drug addiction in the end falls flat for me. I was hoping that it would work and add a nice layer of TENSION to this movie...which is sorely needed. Yeah the movie made a return....doesn't mean it was good. Look at AVATAR....Barph I wanted to be proved wrong with this movie. I wanted to be proved wrong in the way that Real Steel proved me wrong. I wanted to hate the Remake of TCMbut it works. I enjoy the remake of Dawn of the DEAD. Hell I believe that if they changed it from a mall to something else and changed the title it, it could have been its own movie. They were just riding off of the name. This movie.I was right, and I do not feel vindicated for it. I was right about the remake of Nightmare On Elm StreetI was happy I was rightI was vindicated.this just hurts <br/><br/>I'm the ROCKABILLY MONGOOSE!"

These young 20 year olds go out to a cabin because one of them has a drug problem. The others have decided to keep the druggie, Mia, at the cabin as she goes through withdrawals. But as in the original they find a book and the smart one unleashes a demon.<br/><br/>Now if you want lots of blood and gore, then the last 45 minutes are for you. People lose limbs, get jaws cut out, nailed by a nail gun. But the last survivor doesn't go all crazy with the chainsaw. I'm pretty sure the chain saw played more of a roll in the original.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK, for the gore fan, but the original stands alone. There was no need for a remake."
"GC_MaxProductions","4","1","3","15 November 2013"," Souless
","This remake on a standalone basis (in a universe where the original did not exist) would be classified as a gore fest with minimal acting. No real suspense or fear, just blood and guts.<br/><br/>There was a very minimal introduction to the characters and the best actor didn't even get a shout which was a shame. I know it is indeed very difficult, if not impossible to make a completely original film these days, especially one that has as much impact as the original Evil Dead.<br/><br/>For me the real problem was there was no extreme at all, the movie started off on a sour, depressing note and descended into depravity. The real shocker only comes when everything is perfect, blue skies, sun, mild air, the birds tweeting, relaxing and watching a vista then a twig snaps and BAM! darkness falls, monsters emerge from a mist, a pit of fire opens up beneath you and you die screaming all the way to hell!!<br/><br/>Please, spare us the remakes and bring us something with character development, suspense and true shock value."
"LloydBayer","6","1","3","26 October 2013"," Dead on Arrival
","If a movie tagline is anything to go by, then EVIL DEAD the remake should be ""The most terrifying film you will experience""; or so the makers would have you believe. But depending on what makes your skin crawl, this tagline is either true to the word or entirely misleading.<br/><br/>Void of time and place, an unceremonious prologue tells us that evil exists in and around a desolate cabin in some Godforsaken part of the woods. The cabin is almost rundown but serves as the perfect spot for Mia (Jane Levy) to go cold turkey on her heroin addiction. Aiding Mia's detox is her brother (Shiloh Fernandez), and their friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). Mia and David have a strained relationship that is never fully explained, but an unseen bond between the siblings becomes apparent as the story progresses. This of course is merely a distracting subplot because Eric, meanwhile, has discovered a book known as the Necronomicon, or 'Book of the dead'. And before they realize what the book holds within, all hell breaks loose. Quite literally. <br/><br/>For a horror movie remade more than thirty years after the original, visual effects are impressive but rarely do these effects induce the fear or terror that is promised. To begin with, the atmosphere is never chilling or ominous even as demonic possessions start to become the mainstay in the plot. In comparing to the 1981 original, debutant feature director Fede Alvarez has made a competent horror flick that is just a few notches above the schlock-o-meter. The premise and the fight for survival remains faithfully true to Sam Raimi's original, with multiple throwbacks to THE EVIL DEAD franchise. As a homage, this remake could sit fairly well with horror fans relentless with an appetite for blood and gore. On that note, violence is of an extreme nature and Alvarez's camera-work is very unforgiving during the many slicing and dicing, and slashing and stabbing scenes. Even if you choose to close your eyes, you cannot the escape the sound of tearing flesh or many of the other forms of bodily mutilation and dismemberment. In keeping with the exploitation theme of 70s and 80s low-budget horror flicks, Alvarez stays on course and then goes all out for the blood soaked finale. This final showdown benefits from some originality, particularly when good and evil switches positions. But up until this point the suspense and fright factor is pretty much an assembly line production consistent with standard Hollywood pop culture. <br/><br/>Ultimately, the new EVIL DEAD relies heavily on multiple references to the original without so much as exploring creative individuality. That being said, Alvarez and the screenwriters have opted for maximum gore fest instead of working towards really terrorizing the audience. Characters are unremarkable and you don't really bother who lives and who dies. Fernandez's David is particularly annoying as an idiotically gullible protagonist. Levy's Mia has one or two good scenes before becoming possessed but remaining cast members have little or nothing to work with except gallons of cinema grade corn syrup. Potentially, this film had all the wicked ingredients of a perfect remake. If only the makers (including Sam Raimi as the producer) had focused on personifying evil with some sort of tangibility, this film would have easily rubbed decaying shoulders with the likes of THE EXORCIST or THE SHINING. Eventually, what you get is evil dead on arrival. And by this I am also referring to the fact that I slept like a baby."

"sixxdog","7","1","3","29 September 2013"," A quite shiny turd
","Remakes are per definition turds no one should watch really. No point in making a movie again that was good to begin with. What's the point? I do however support ""remakes"" if the director intents to use the basic story into a different film altogether. I had NO hopes for ""Evil Dead"", and my expectations were lower than low. I actually tend to boycott remakes, and I never pay to watch them. <br/><br/>But you see, what Fede Alvarez did here, was to take the basic plot and make the horror horrifying and chose to leave out the comedy and charm of the original. I must say, it works VERY well indeed. The first half of the movie is truly terrifying and creepy, and although it does work all the way through, the last half tends to lean to the pacing of mainstream Hollywood horror. But it never falls flat and it never gets boring. Alvarez even succeeds in using what made the original a trailblazer - the energetic cinematic brilliance, the panoramic shots and the ooze of dark terror and panic in the ambient atmosphere, all of which makes you think of the Sam Raimis and Peter Jacksons of yesteryear. <br/><br/>It's just about impossible to make the same impact on horror audience here some 30 years later, but Alvarez just about nailed if if you ask me."
"protoman-804-144626","4","1","3","28 September 2013"," Not terrible, but certainly not the Evil Dead. An honest review.
","For starters, it's come to my attention that many of the reviews for  this film are clearly 'Plants', people working for the film studio that  produced the film posting fake positive reviews. You'll noticed that  after this review there are about 40 or 50 consecutive reviews of 10  stars by people who apparently had their lives changed by how good this  film was, but a quick check of their profiles reveals that most of them  have only ever reviewed or rated this one film. To get to the genuine  reviews, you'll want to skip about five pages ahead of this point.   Now, I am a big fan of the Evil Dead franchise and much of Raimi and  Campbells other projects, so I approached this film with cautious  optimism. However, what I got is basically what I anticipated, a decent  film with good camera work etc, but without any of the inspiration,  creativity, or charm of the original. The remake of Evil Dead relies  heavily on gore and 'jump scares' to substitute real horror, and unlike  it's predecessor it takes itself very seriously. Don't expect to smile  or have fun with this film, it isn't a 'fun' horror. The cast includes  two major protagonists, a recovering drug addict named 'Mia' and her  brother 'David', and their friends, a fairly interchangeable ensemble  of attractive 20 somethings who could be from nearly any horror film  ever made.  While the gore-effects were well done and the filming is good, I found  that the deadites were very disappointing for being too 'minimalist' in  their appearance. They're mostly just Regan McNeil from The Exorcist,  with pale make up and yellow contact lenses used to make them look  'demonic' while they chatter about how the protagonists various dead  relatives are doing this or that in hell. The final confrontation with  The Abomination was a big let down too. The whole film was basically  about the deadites trying to raise 'The Abomination', so you're  expecting a pretty impressive demon, but what you get is the girl from  The Ring. A thin, pale girl, with long lank hair, her arms dangling  limp at her sides, and a penchant for crawling on all fours.   In the end it's a watchable movie, but nothing that anyone will be  talking about in a years time, and certainly it isn't an Evil Dead  film. It suffers from what many films suffer from at the moment, a fear  of being seen as 'campy' or 'cheesy' of not being gritty and real  enough, a fear that gets in the way of having fun and making something  larger than life, and which in the end results in yet another grim,  dull, overly serious, and forgettable movie. Not a bad movie, but I'm  still waiting for a sequel to the real Evil Dead. One with a big  chinned, spit-curl hero with a chainsaw for a hand and a hot dame in  the other."

"Duveteux","7","1","3","13 August 2013"," Heather and Alessa?
","I liked the film. I'm a deadite and I love the original, the original is still far scarier (if the original is 10 out of 10 then this is a 7) and I was waiting for bits like the cellar scene to be far creepier. I expected some insane giggling and a character called Linda who just won't die! I was genuinely waiting when all the girls introduced themselves for one to say Linda. But I liked this as a separate movie... and it has some nods in the direction of original fans. <br/><br/>The thing I had a problem with that I can't escape is that it is Silent Hill in parts. Even the siren sound has been stolen in the end battle. Sure it's a lot better than the Silent Hill film featuring the Heather and Alessa battle, good God Silent Hill movie is absolute rubbish in every way, so this is done better! In essence it's been nicked. It had the uncomfortable reminder of Silent Hill right from the moment ""the abomination"" first appears to our protagonist in the woods.<br/><br/>I understand most horror movies steal things from others, but it was the siren that made me think ""nah you can't take that as well"" and unfortunately I can't forgive it. <br/><br/>I think the lines should have just stayed the same instead of changing ever so slightly, they could have just used the originals, like the song mummy used to sing them to sleep with... on a sidenote why was ""not another peep, time to go to sleep"" cut from the movie, cause it's in the advert? And why is it ""I'll feast on your soul"" when I was dying for ""I'll swallow your soul"" or ""dead by dawn"" or ""we want what is yours, life!"", anything! No levitation! Naaaay! I did miss Raimi bits. <br/><br/>They did make it more about ""a demon"" than I cared for and I don't like the new necronomicon with it's silly scrawlings of foul language to stop you reading it... I'm also a little sad that daylight doesn't rid you of possession! But this is all irrelevant because in itself it's a good horror movie. Just try not to think of anything you loved about the original and try to ignore the Silent Hill undertone. Good, good... <br/><br/>P.S. my favourite bit in the new one is the blonde girl's possession, from the hand to her death. To me her name was Linda."
"Jerghal","6","1","3","9 August 2013"," Humorless
","Same story, but much more bloody and humorless. That's not to say it's a bad film, but despite it's name it's not an Evil Dead film either. Some scenes mimic Japanese horror flicks like The Ring and the excessive gore and violence is copied from the SAW legacy. But if you're gonna make a bleak and serious horror movie you have to go all the way -which the French have done very well the last couple of years- but there it falls short. The young actors are just uncharismatic zombie fodder (you won't care if they live) who can't replace the memory of Bruce Campell (who got a nice cheque as the producer on this film sellout). The closest thing I've seen to Evil Dead is from Mr. Raimi himself: Drag Me to Hell. Better watch that if haven't seen it yet instead of this film."
"vetsera","4","1","3","5 August 2013"," A life-changing experience in the history of jokes...
","I feel a little uneasy giving this movie a bad review as I must admit I had a great time watching it. I had fun, I laughed a lot and all in all was genuinely amused. The only problem is that I was supposed to be in terror.<br/><br/>The showing of blood or dead bodies on film usually don't startle me, I am the kind of person that finds thriller-type horrors building on psychological manipulation much more scary and interesting. This one though had a respectively good rating (considering the common ratings of the horror genre) so I thought it was worth giving a try. I was wrong. It is probably my fault considering the above-mentioned reasons but I still cannot withhold my opinion. This piece of... well, movie is a dull, trying-to-be-scary, plot less one and a half hours of boredom. I don't really care if the original 'Evil Dead' was the first of it's genre, I don't care if the new one is similar to/nothing like the old one. I only care about the fact that I was deprived of a valuable one and a half hours of my life. The plot is below average, I daresay it only slightly exists. Mia's (if that is her name) resurrection at the end is purely ridiculous in itself but the conclusion with the Abomination (or what the heck?) crawling in the mud with blood raining on it's head is a life-changing experience in the history of jokes.<br/><br/>Subsequently I must warn you all dear readers to beware of the blood rain as the rattling of the Abomination will haunt you forever on occasions it is essential not to laugh out loud (viz. exams, job interviews). If you crave for a night of laughter, already finished school and have a job you don't wish to replace soon, this is the movie for you. If not, stay away from it! The poster said: ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience."" I agree though I would definitely mention ""terrifying"" in a different context. But now that I think about it, ""the most terrifying movie of all times"" post has already been filled in by The Cloth. (Watch only if you wish to end up brain-dead.)"
"Jcup825","6","1","3","31 July 2013"," A missed opportunity
","As a fan of the original Evil Dead trilogy I got really excited when I saw the trailer for this film. The weekend it came out there was a huge buzz that got me even more excited. My question is did they see the same movie? The people that gave this perfect reviews must not have been fans of the original. This film makes no sense to me, the plot is loose and thin and if you think too hard about it you can find numerous holes and questions. My main complaint is the deadites. In the original when the Evil came and turned people it turned them into ruthless crazy people that taunted and played with the people's minds. In this film when someone turns (with the exception of Mia) they just turn into mindless zombies that can use weapons. They make rules with the book but none of them seem to matter in the long run. The (evil one) at the end is just another mindless deadite that is too easily killed. The visuals and gore in this film are great (the main reason I scored it as high as I did). All in all it just doesn't feel like an Evil Dead movie even though many of the pieces are in place."
"politehere","7","1","3","31 July 2013"," Do Not Judge This Movie Based on the Original and You Might Have a Good Time
","I don't understand what all the negative reviews are for. They're all whining about why this was not the original. I'm curious to know what all the whiners would've thought of this movie if the original movie didn't exist and this was a movie in its own right. Let's just forget the past and judge this movie in its own right, shall we?<br/><br/>Before I begin my review, I would like to point out the fact that if you get scared or expect to get scared by watching a horror movie these days, you are not even a horror movie fan, because if you were one, you would've seen so many horror movies that you'd know that there are no more original ideas left for the horror genre. You would've seen it all before and wouldn't even have such unrealistic expectations.<br/><br/>True horror movie fans would not be scared of horror movies because they've seen it all before. I can count all the scare tactics and even the camera angles used in this movie and tell you which horror movies it has borrowed them from. Not surprisingly, it shared a lot of those techniques with ""Drag Me to Hell"", which is by far the best horror movie I've seen. <br/><br/>I have no idea what you've been watching, but what I saw was a very well-made atmospheric and highly professional horror movie , which not surprisingly, failed to scare me, like all the horror movies made these days. Like I said, as a true horror movie fan it's not something I can complain about. The shots were beautifully taken and some I would even describe as artistic, like the shots you get during the time they're traveling to the decrepit cottage. <br/><br/>The acting was not Oscar-worthy, but then again a mediocre acting is what you get in most horror movies. I'm going to subtract one point because of that. As for the back story, you don't need to know everything about every single character to enjoy a horror movie. The least you would expect is to know why the characters are in that situation (here, in the cottage). The movie gives you just as much information as you need. After all, this is not a romance novel. This movie employed every scare tactic in the book. There is no single scene depicting unnecessary profanity here, which is sadly being employed a lot in horror movies these days, so I have a difficult time understanding why some reviewers are calling this a ""torture porn"" movie. Perhaps, they need to look into the dictionary and check the meaning of the word ""porn"".<br/><br/>As for the dialogs, this movie was weak, but there was not much the characters could talk about other than the obvious. A good dialog would've requires a rich back story, which like I said is not really necessary in a horror movie. One point taken because of that. I wouldn't really describe the final fight scenes as having a good combination of colors. An all red scenes (the raining of blood) is not exactly what I find appealing. It's irritating and redundant.<br/><br/>I'm going to give this movie a 7, and I believe it is worth watching. There are too many stupid low-budget horror movies out there. I can tell you with absolute confidence that this is not one of them. Do not judge this movie based on the original and you might have a good time"
"LoneWolfAndCub","6","1","3","30 July 2013"," Good, but a major disappointment
","When I heard they were remaking (or rebooting, which seems to be the term these days) Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981) I first thought: why? Even with the approval of Raimi, producer Rob Tapert and actor Bruce Campbell why even bother? In my view, The Evil Dead is perfect and needs no modern update, even then, I would have thought the rabid fan base would be enough to scare someone off touching this. Well, it doesn't really matter what I think because here I am reviewing Evil Dead, directed by newcomer Fede Alvarez and boasting the very bold tagline ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience.""<br/><br/>Well, this is most definitely not the most terrifying film I have ever experienced. In fact, it is probably one of the most disappointing films I have ever experienced. Is it bad? No, not at all. Is it as good as it could have been? Definitely not.<br/><br/>It's a fairly fun ride for the most part, with a strong opening and plenty of neat gross-out gags (with minimal CGI, which is a big bonus). The actors are serviceable, as is the music and direction. But to me it feels lifeless, almost like it tries too hard to be gross and disturbing. The story also leaves a lot to be desired in some parts.<br/><br/>I will not break the plot down, it is basically the same as the original with minor changes I will not spoil here. My big issue is that no character is really likable or interesting. Now, the original didn't boast deep or complex characters, but they all seemed more human, more easy to relate to in some strange way. There is no hero like Ash which I found really strange, as that was a huge part of the original. There are also plot holes and contrivances which I can't go through otherwise I will spoil the movie, needless to say they are fairly obvious and disappointing.<br/><br/>As I mentioned previously, the acting is serviceable, Jane Levy is the stand out as Mia and Lou Taylor Pucci does a great job as the unlucky Eric. The other three are okay, but nothing to write home about. I think for a debut film Alvarez does a great job behind the camera, the direction feels assured, he definitely knows what he wants, which in this case is blood, lots of it. Once the carnage starts it doesn't let up, there are plenty of gags that the special effects team get to show off. No body part is safe, no sharp object unused. These scenes are nasty and in your face, with a darkly humorous edge to them. By the end of the movie they do feel a little forced, but overall the level of gore in the film is not disappointing and any hardcore horror film will appreciate what is on show here.<br/><br/>Overall the film is enjoyable and easy to watch. I can't say it was ever boring, and I am impressed that this is a debut feature film. For this reason I am giving it a more positive rating; however I think the excessive praise that Evil Dead is 'near perfect' and 'astonishing' is mostly hype. I enjoyed it enough to buy the Blu-Ray to add to Evil Dead trilogy Blu-Ray collection, it is something I can watch if I want some cheap thrills or to gross out a friend, but when compared to the original it just doesn't make the cut. Sam Raimi's film was scary, funny and insanely gory yet very simple. This tries too hard to be all of the above, and only just succeeds.<br/><br/>3/5"
"StevePulaski","8","6","46","6 April 2013"," Harmless, but not necessary
","Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead is likely the best film that could be made in current times bearing the title as Sam Raimi's cult classic. Nonetheless, it's a film that is always aware of its goal - to be as gory and as excessive as possible - and creates an easygoing vibe that will likely appeal to those who hold its original so dear to their hearts.<br/><br/>This sort of depends on your response to the exclusion of the original film's main character, Ash, who was played by Bruce Campbell, who serves as an executive producer on this remake. His absence wasn't a big deal for a non-fan like myself, but I can sense something of an upset being that the film doesn't include its own main character. However, it's not like Friday the 13th without a Jason, or a visit to Elm Street without Freddy, so there isn't a huge hole in the film's interior.<br/><br/>We focus on five kids that venture out to a remote cabin, only this time, they're going there for a slightly different reason; they're trying to get their friend Mia (Jane Levy) sober from drug abuse and get her back on the road to mental stability. The group winds up stumbling upon a book of the dead, which to add to ominousness, is inked in blood and bound by human flesh. It unleashes a demon into Mia, who in return, attempts to mutilate and butcher her friends, which will turn them into demons as well.<br/><br/>If you want gore, you'll get enough gore for an entire horror franchise. With the original driving force behind The Evil Dead, Sam Raimi, still having a reasonable say in what goes on, the feel of the classic film is present alone in its abundance of bloodshed. Tongues are ripped in two, blood is vomited, flesh is frequently punctuated by knives, spears, glass, and whatnot, and violence and brutality is commonplace. I was astonished by how it is handled; not in the vein of another Hostel sequel, that would generate melancholic attitudes because of the constant brutality, but in the way where it is more of a novelty rather than a sickness. That's what, I believe, makes the film so fun and entertaining; it isn't so keen on being sick and nasty as it is on being a grotesque piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Gone besides Ash, however, is that feeling of raw, unnerving naturalism that was present heavily in the original film. Raimi's low budget endeavor seemed to be a surreal document of a trip went wrong, using original camera angles and woodsy videography to generate effective atmosphere and tone. This remake employs these tactics nicely, but with more of a well-refined, studio touch. Consider the POV-shots Alvarez attempts at, in order to effectively mimic (or perhaps pay tribute) similar sequences in the original film. They still work because we are unsure of what exactly it what the POV is from. However, they feel more polished and less amateur, which leaves us with more of a seldom appreciation than what we saw the first time around.<br/><br/>This is the kind of horror film that effectively works, even though it has its own limitations. It still favors weirdness and gross-out instances over character (even though this one tries a bit harder to evoke personality with some of its cast), and character stupidity is rather prominent here. And yet, there is enjoyment to be had simply because the events are fun and lax and the buckets of gore (all natural, by the way - no CGI) are a shockingly pleasant addition. This doesn't have the unexpected setups, plot twists, and constant entertainment of recent efforts like The Cabin in the Woods and Final Destination 5, but it does have a heart and a sense of fun and terror.<br/><br/>NOTE: My video review of Evil Dead, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YXN13tiA8I Starring: Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, and Elizabeth Blackmore.

I'm not saying this new Evil Dead is as good as the first film, but it's a pretty solid remake. It had likable characters that I didn't want to see get killed, and so when they were in danger, I was legitimately afraid. It is a GORY film though, perhaps even more so than the original, so don't eat a lot of popcorn when you see it. But do see it, and as long as you don't take it too seriously and don't get hung up on the plot holes, you will enjoy it. The two leads are very good, especially the girl who plays Mia.

","The day Sam Raimi fans have been either anticipating or dreading for 30 years is upon us. The remake of ""Evil Dead"" has taken over theaters. Most enthusiasts of the original horror trilogy wanted another sequel. That's definitely not what we get in this gore fest.<br/><br/>Don't expect dancing decapitated corpses, funny one-liners, and other slapstick elements found in ""Army of Darkness."" You'll be gravely disappointed. What we get here is full-on blood and guts with a dash of more blood and guts.<br/><br/>There are no college kids heading up to the woods to party for the weekend this time around. Setting a serious tone from the very beginning of the film, a group of old friends come together to help one of their own kick a drug habit. The plan is to keep her locked up and restrained in the family cabin until the girl is fully detoxed. She's relapsed once and they're going to make sure it doesn't happen again.<br/><br/>While cleaning up the old place, the bunch stumble on what appears to be an old book bound in a plastic bag by barb wires. One of them opens it and begins reading the words inside. By reciting the ancient sayings, they release a long dormant evil that takes possession of them one by one. As the friends begin dying, they frantically search for a way to bring an end to the demonic force.<br/><br/>I am very impressed with the depth of the story here. It would be so easy to go down the stale ""kids going to a cabin to party"" route again. Although the acting is wooden at times, the characters are a bit more noble and sympathetic than the usual dumb college types we get in these types of movies.<br/><br/>There's no end to the visual gore in ""Evil Dead."" From the very beginning, the viewer knows what they're getting into. They're going to see it all in full color. This isn't the usual PG-13 jump-scare fiesta we've come to expect from today's horror movies. Brace yourselves to see arms and legs get hacked off and gallons of blood dripping in puddles everywhere. I cringed and gritted my teeth just thinking about the pain during most scenes.<br/><br/>If there's a message to ""Evil Dead,"" it's really quite simple. Don't screw with demonic forces or read magic incantations or passages out of an evil book. All you're doing is asking for trouble with a capital ""T."" Whether you think it's silly or not, I'm a firm believer in this advice.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the dual finale of the film. It had a happy ending while leaving the audience with a warning that evil never really goes away. It's just left waiting for some other poor soul stupid enough to give it a means to be reborn.<br/><br/>If you've been waiting for a movie to come along and satisfy your taste for graphic violence and gore, ""Evil Dead"" will quench your thirst for blood. Those looking for pure ""Hitchcockian"" suspense with a ""less-is- more"" attitude when it comes to horror movies need not purchase a ticket for this one. Stay after the credits to see a ""groovy"" surprise!"

","Ever wanted to see someone cut their tongue right down the middle and then make-out with another person? You have? Great! Go see the new and improved Evil Dead remake. I can't give this movie enough praise. I have to admit right off the bat that I was really not a big fan of the original. I know, I know, a lot of you probably want to shoot me, but hear me out. As much as I did not enjoy the original, I do suggest to anyone who has not seen it that they see it before seeing the remake. It does give you a chance to compare them, and also see how they changed some things from film to film. This remake has truly done what I considered to be impossible, and that is to make a remake to a ""classic"" movie that far exceeds the original. In my honest opinion every single aspect of this new movie improves upon the original.<br/><br/>Let me start with the obvious, the visual effects in this movie were nothing short of astonishing. If what I read is correct then they used little to no CGI in this movie, and that is damn impressive for what you see here. Every blood drenched shot was so realistic and visceral. This was truly one of the bloodiest goriest movies I have ever seen, but in its defense they never used more blood than they should have for what was happening on screen. If you go into it viewing it this way, I don't think the gore will bother you as much as you may think. To put it simply though, the effects were fantastic, and one of my favorite parts of the film.<br/><br/>The acting was so much better in this one than in the original, and yes I do realize that the first was made that way on purpose, but it still doesn't change my point. There wasn't any point in the movie where I felt like the emotion on the screen wasn't genuine. I have to give great praise to Jane Levy the most. She was by far the best actress in the movie. If anyone is familiar with her other work then you know she is mostly a comedic actress, and to make this switch was something great to see. Everybody in the movie did a great job, but she definitely stood out the most.<br/><br/>The plot was very simple yet it kept you interested the entire time. This is where the movie deviated from the original the most. I won't say where, but there were a good bit of differences there, and that really made it its own film.<br/><br/>I realize up until now that I have given this movie nothing but praise, but I must admit that there was one thing that I did not like about it. The tag-line read ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" This was simply not the case at all. I didn't find it to be scary at all. I would say however that it is extremely disturbing, but disturbing and scary are two completely different things. This was a disappointing fact, but I loved the movie nonetheless. <br/><br/>Bottom line this remake was far superior to the original in every way. I highly recommend it to die hard fans of the original, or to someone who isn't familiar with the franchise at all (even though you should see the original first). I can't stress it to you enough that you should go see this as soon as you can, and enjoy it in all its gory glory. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie one of my friends turned to me and said, ""What the hell did I just watch?"" And all I had to say in response was ""Brilliance, pure brilliance!"""
"nicholas_drake","9","6","48","7 April 2013"," A very well done remake
","I feel like this remake holds in the same regards as the Nightmare on Elm Street and Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes which were surprisingly great re-dos. Though many people will tell you these updates weren't as impactful as the originals, let's face it. Those originals were what introduced the grit and gore in such a new fantastic and scary way that people had never seen before. At this day in age it's all pretty well been done, and for horror lovers like us we've pretty well seen it all. So to say it isn't as groundbreaking as the original makes sense but really how much more groundbreaking can it be anymore? This new version of Evil Dead still embodies the same feel as the original without adding all the extra campy comedy. There were some very impressive and intensive scenes. Special effects in the gore department left me cringing in pain at parts and the whole raining blood scene left me seeing red for awhile. You don't see many scenes like that in horror movies. Also, this movie still provided those cheap jumps when things fall or pop up out of no where. Overall I was very enveloped in the story. That said I do wish some of the characters where a bit more developed instead of being there one minute and dead the next, but too much back story would have taken away from the point of the movie, demonic goodness. Also, anyone saying or acting like this movie was an insult to Sam Raimi and the original better take a look at the producers list. Both Raimi and Bruce Campbell produced and even hand picked the director for this new version. So if you are one of those people saying that, you've basically said you hate a Sam Raimi movie/envisioning and can't entirely be a true Raimi fan. So all in all, while not a groundbreaking movie that will start a new age in horror, it still achieved at bringing old school scares in with today's better special effects. The story was clever, with a very new and surprising twist at the end. I hope they do not make a sequel to this however, unless they can pull it off as well as this."
"kroork","10","6","48","6 April 2013"," Ignore the hate. It's a wickedly fun, gory, hell ride !
","well, after months of waiting, countless status updates, and even more photo reminders, the day finally came. The much anticipated remake/rebirth EVIL DEAD was released upon the world. I went into the movie with high, high expectations. Did i expect it to be the most terrifying movie i would ever experience? god no, there is always a little hope but i generally know i wont get scared by a movie, but i was expecting to see a cool awesome hardcore horror. what i experienced last night, fell short of hardcore, but hit the mark in every other way.<br/><br/>the story follows a group 4 friends who bring their drug other drug addicted friend to her families old cabin in the woods. Hoping the the secluded location is the perfect thing poor Mia needs to finally kick her drug habit. The 5 friends hunker down and prepare themselves for a crazy few days of detox. as you can tell from the trailers, all Hell breaks loose fast and because of Mia's detox, no one believes her when she has realized, something is seriously wrong.<br/><br/>in general i loved everything i saw. the story moved along quickly, and the gore was amazing! the decision to use practical effects was definitely the best decision when thinking about remaking an 80's gore classic. there were plenty of moments that reminded me of watching 80's horror as a child. and it spread a big smile across my face. of course they used cgi to touch up some scenes or remove wires but that is just common Practice nowadays, and they just make the practical effects pop even more. the acting wasn't fantastic, but it wasn't awful either. Jane levy definitely stands out to me, and her performance is fantastic. she really raises the bar for the other characters. unfortunately they never reach her level. but i have for sure, seen way worse. as i said before, the story moves along relatively quickly. which i love. once things happen, its pretty much a roller-coaster ride from hell till the end.<br/><br/>if you look closely there r are few nods to the original two movies, which i really enjoyed. you can tell the director really has a heart for the source material. From the awesome POV shots, to the classic Oldsmobile Delta Royal 88, i truly felt like i was watching an evil dead movie. now were there negatives? of course, no movie is perfect. i wont go into details but i will say my biggest negative has to do with marketing. there are numerous scenes in the trailers that are not actually in the theatrical release. this seems to be common now a days and the reason they say is because sometimes a trailer is cut before the final movie has been finalized. i would believe that, except evil dead released a million new trailers way after the first showing of the movie. so they were fully aware some scenes were not in the movie, but they kept advertising them anyways. now i have heard we could be getting a uncut /or extended cut on DVD but only time will tell.<br/><br/>so in my closing i will say, was this ""the most terrifying movie you will ever experience""? no. did i think it was hardcore ? not really, i always felt they could have taken it that extra step further, but it was one of the best movies i have seen in awhile. and other then a few exceptions, i feels like it was tailor made for me :) it was an awesomely cool ride through hell. and i cant wait to see it again, and I can't wait for the sequel !!!!"
"michielpieterhoogeveen","6","3","18","20 July 2013"," A promising horror remake which starts well, but eventually becomes mediocre
","Evil Dead is another remake of a cult horror movie classic from the 1970's or 1980's. With the exception of a few, most of these remakes have not lived up to the high standards of the fans of the originals. Evil Dead however starts promising. While its story vastly differs from the original, it certainly offers an interesting setting with suspense thanks to the exiting prologue and the grim setting of Mia (Jane Levy) going cold turkey in a remote cabin. Since she failed in her previous attempt to quit drugs, her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) is now present as well to support his sister and their friends. When David and his friends find the sealed Book of the Dead in the basement, they accidentally summon a demon which seems to possess them one by one until none of them will remain. As stated, this setting offers great potential. However, the quality of the film quickly starts to decline. There are plenty of scares and shocks throughout the movie, but they all feel too familiar and cliché. Evil Dead is nothing like its original counterpart. While that is not necessarily a bad thing, the remake quickly becomes a mediocre slasher movie. This is particularly disappointing since the original gained such popularity due to its original writing and excellent filming. Without spoiling too much: the ending is very disappointing and leaves you with a familiar disappointed feeling as with most of the recent horror movies from Hollywood. Nevertheless the film will keep you entertained if you are a fan of the genre."
"markbeckford","9","6","49","7 April 2013"," Best horror re-make since Dawn of the Dead in 2004.
","The new Evil Dead movie could be a litmus test for true fans of the horror genre. As Entertainment Weekly's review stated so well: the new Evil Dead is ""the bloodiest, goriest, slapstickiest horror movie since, well, The Evil Dead.""<br/><br/>Horror fans would grin or laugh gleefully at most of the goriest scenes because a) most are truly unique and different than what we've scene before, and b) we've seen EVERYTHING before. Anybody else would shut their eyes, grimace, flee the theater, or just wouldn't go. <br/><br/>And it's not that horror fans are gore junkies. Blood, gore and violence are irrelevant and tedious if it's not weaved into a captivating story with decent acting, great directing, and creative plotting. <br/><br/>And that's exactly what the new Evil Dead delivers. Most die-hard horror aficionados know the original Evil Dead by heart. To re-do the first and deliver a new and different version while staying within the bounds of the original is no easy task. But Fede Alvarez in his directorial debut knocks it out of the park. It strikes that fine balance between reverence to the original (with both overt and subtle references) and newness/uniqueness to keep us captivated and excited (and excitement is key as most of us are definitely looking for a cerebral adrenaline rush). <br/><br/>Just modernizing a classic with a bigger budget takes no creativity and falls into the tedium and redundancy which most horror fan's hate. Gus Van Sant's Psycho re-make, where nearly every scene is ""copied exactly,"" is a perfect example of this. One word: BORING. <br/><br/>The last, great horror re-make was 2004's ""Dawn of the Dead"" which at the time was the best re-make since David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"" in 1986. That's why us horror fans are rejoicing to have a new movie to re-watch 10 times until the next good one."
"cheepothegreat","5","2","10","16 May 2013"," Average
","Having only seen part of the original it might be hard for me to accurately comment on the film. However as a modern horror film it is average. I was keen to see the film as it makes big claims about being truly terrifying. In parts it was jumpy, however very predictable like many other modern horrors. Its also a very gory however highly unrealistic in parts... One of the characters must be superman, I swear!<br/><br/>The acting wasn't bad compared to much of the trashy acting we see all to often in modern horrors maybe one of its only saving graces. However the characters are really, really stupid and the script for me lacked quality and stuck to clichéd lines.<br/><br/>Overall its not as bad as some people make out, however in no way is terrifying or anywhere near a perfect horror!"
"mightyblargh","7","2","11","21 April 2013"," Great remake, prefer the original though...
","I think It was a great remake. Most Hollywood horror flick now tend to show a ""realistic"" point of view in horror movies these days and usually It makes the movie more frightening and for this movie they showed a more intimate version of the characters. For example, the story introduces ""Mia"", a drug addict who is struggling to stop his addiction who had to take care of his mother while the brother David was not there.<br/><br/>The movie has a LOT more gore in it, way more than the original, maybe too much. What I would have love to see is a more psychological approach, horror that keep messing with your mind instead of having all the blood and guts splattered over the screen which don't leave much for the imagination. It was entertaining but not that much scary, only disgusting... I think the original movie had this creepy ""old movie"" feeling that we didn't have in the new version...<br/><br/>But overall i'm giving it a 7, entertaining, good movie, better than a lot of horror movies out there, worth to see if you don't mind gore"

","Being a big fan of the original movie, I was excited to see this new reinvented one. With Raimi,Tapert,and Campbell producing and, backing it, I figured it would be worthy of my time and money. It was. First and foremost tho, It was not very scary. Thats OK. Its hard to scare most horror fans anyway. Creepy, visually brutal, and gruesome is what this movie is all about anyway. Acting was pretty decent for the most part, aside from Jane Levy (Mia) who,I thought was outstanding. This cabin in the woods thing has been done many times now in the horror genre (thanks to sam raimi's original) that you would think it has run its course. Well maybe, but I think this redo will spawn a new generation of fans of the type, and its inevitable sequels. When it literally rains blood from the skies, what more do you want?

"george.schmidt","7","5","45","7 April 2013"," Redux of the original cabin-in-the-woods horror cult classic (which you should see instead)
","EVIL DEAD (2013) **1/2 Jane Levy, Shiloh Fernandez, Lou Taylor Pucci, Jessica Lucas, Elizabeth Blackmore. Bigger-budgeted remake of the the original ""The Evil Dead"" cult-classic by Sam Raimi (who produced with his fellow collaborator Bruce Campbell, the original's star) may have more buckets of blood and bang for your book for the special visual effects and make-up however it fails when you have to have an 'explanation' for why sh*t is happening (the beauty of the original was it JUST did!). Case in point Levy (who is excellent and if she had the muster to could be a new Scream Queen) is a 'cold turkey' candidate in attempting to curb her drug abuse with her older, estranged brother (Fernandez) and their 3 friends who camp out for a weekend in a cabin in the woods (again Raimi mastered this first of the 'sub genre' of horror) and get far more than they bargained for when they come across a mysterious book of the dead that subsequently unleashes a threatening supernatural force that is very angry. While the surprisingly by-the-numbers screenplay by filmmaker Fede Alavarez (and a gloss over by Diablo Cody!) suffers in making the stupid kids even stupider is quickly turned-over in its second half when all hell breaks loose. Again the viscera flowing makes up for the hackneyed plot but the film's source material should be seen again for its patchwork shopworn indie cred and ingenuity (although the 'whooshing' frenetic force camera-work thru the woods is re-introduced). Enter at your own peril but buy a copy of the epic precursors instead if you haven't already."
"RoyRumble84","8","5","46","7 April 2013"," Don't listen to the haters. This was a good remake.
","Just saw this movie yesterday, and I was not disappointed. Being a fan of the Evil Dead movies I knew exactly what I was getting into. What I do not understand are people's reaction to this movie. This was a remake of Evil Dead 1 not 2. It is not supposed to be funny or have dark humor, and it is supposed to be intense and gory. Evil Dead 2 was a lighter and funnier take on the first. Watch The Evil Dead (1981) and see if your pov of this remake changes. If you have seen the original movie you would know that and expect that the remake would be at least the same amount of blood and gore and probably more. As far as the tree rape scene, have you seen the original??? I thought the tree rape scene in the original was more uncomfortable. It also bothers me that people aren't aware that Bruce and Sam were the producers of the movie and had a lot of input. I bet they were the ones pushing Fede for more blood. Why not?! Its f-ing Evil Dead. <br/><br/>The Good: -Lack of cliché (with one exception that i can think of. Olivia and the face in the mirror scene) -The intensity/imagery -The gore -creepy demon that infects Mia -The back story. In fact, I am glad they had some other reason (and practical) to go to the cabin instead of just some kidz who want to party and screw. THAT would be cliché. And don't forget to run into the local crazy at the run down gas station who tries to warn the kids. Im so glad that didn't happen.<br/><br/>The Bad: -The revival of Mia at end. I didn't like how easy it was to cleanse her from the demon by briefly burying her then de-fibrillate her with a home-made device. -The scene with the electric knife to the arm. Really? Can you cut through your arm flesh and bone with that? Although, I did like that scene and how her arm was dangling then fell. but could she have used something else? -fricking hipster character -not complaining, but i don't understand how the demon resurrected at the end when 5 souls were not taken. David sacrifice himself in the fire, and Mia was cleansed. -should the book have had warnings written in English? why the f would you read something like that after seeing the warnings? Could he have some how read the words mistakenly some other way instead? But then we wouldn't have a good movie and it would've been a more normal weekend at the cabin.<br/><br/>One of best parts about this movie experience is the fact that there were four older ladies (in there 50's?) in the audience who were just as excited to see the movie.<br/><br/>For now I give this movie a 8/10.<br/><br/>The Omen was the worst remake (scene for scene)."
"tbmforclasstsar","8","5","46","6 April 2013"," not nearly perfect, but an example of how simplicity can go a long way in horror film
","Horror film has been something of a disappointment for me over the last few years. With favorite horror films generally being the ones that play on the conventions of the genre such as Drag Me to Hell or Cabin in the Woods, or the horror/comedies like Shaun of the Dead, I can't remember the last time I saw a real good horror film. Which is why I was so excited to see Evil Dead.<br/><br/>A remake of the 1981 cult classic that was directed by Sam Raimi, Evil Dead was given the tagline ""The most terrifying film you will ever experience"" by its marketing department. Unfortunately, Evil Dead is not quite that good, but it does give us plenty of thrills, chills, and buckets of blood to make any horror fan happy.<br/><br/>The story is a very simple one: five young adults travel to a secluded cabin in the middle of the woods where evil and terrible things start to happen. Changing up the original 1981 story a bit, Evil Dead justifies the group being there because one of the girls, Mia (Jane Levy), is trying to give up a drug addiction cold turkey. The secluded cabin will provide a place for the group to keep Mia away from any outside influence and keep her clean. But everything changes when the group discovers that some sort of ritual had been performed in the basement of the cabin and a strange book, which is covered in a black bag and held closed with barbed wire, is found. And whenever you have the nerdy dude included in your horror story, which we do with one of our characters named Eric, you know he can't help himself but read anything he finds. Nerd.<br/><br/>So Eric the Nerd opens up the demonic looking book to discover demonic pictures and demonic writing. Written in blood are warnings about not messing with the book, but Eric reads on. Even when the book says not to read, say, or think the passage that is written, Eric grabs a paper and pencil to scribble out the words that have been crossed out and reads what is written. Let this be a lesson to you kids: reading is bad for you.<br/><br/>By reading the passage, Eric has released an evil into the forest that surrounds the cabin. And the evil attaches itself to the most vulnerable target: Detox Mia. And now that the evil is out, all hell breaks lose (there is really not a better way to put that). You better get ready to cringe and watch Evil Dead through your fingers. This film is not afraid to show disgusting and gruesome images. It. Is. Brutal.<br/><br/>Where the movie succeeds so well is in these horrific moments. A horror film that provides just that: horror. The film isn't dressed up with being overly sexualized or beating around the violence. When the evil hits, it hits hard, and it doesn't let up until the credits are rolling. There is blood, vomit, more blood, amputations, blood, every sharp thing in the cabin being used as a weapon, and then another hundred gallons of blood. When the amount of blood being slashed around almost meets laughable levels, you know you got something special.<br/><br/>To read the rest of the review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/evil- dead/"

","I read some of the reviews before I watched this movie, so I became more aware about the details of the movie.<br/><br/>Some people said that this movie has degraded the original one, so I looked the trailer of first evil dead and I couldn't stop laughing. I'm sorry, I don't mean to disregard Raimi and his fans, The movie might looked awesome and original 13 years ago, but now, with the rapid growth of film industry, it's almost impossible to have ""original"" scene/story line .<br/><br/>I have to admitted that this movie weak on script and imperfect on special effect for some scenes like the blood spilled when they cut their hand (too much cutting hand scene by the way) or the scene where the the girl on fire turned to look like game animation, and the last but not the least downer was the last scene where the 'evil' came out from the ground, looked like her but without feet, I mean, what's up with that. But still, giving score bellow 5 is too harsh.<br/><br/>And these are the reason why, the cinematography is quite good, I loved the natural light on scene and make up was so real, specially when Olivia ripped her mouth with glasses. Plus, I didn't have a chance to be bored like other people said, because the action kept my heart pumping.<br/><br/>The acting was also good, consider none of them are top list actor for horror/thriller movie like Vera Farmiga and the fact that Jane Levy (comedian actor-suburgatory) can pulled off the main character of this movie, deserve some credit.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie. it may not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I reckon this movie worth to watch"
"Rob_Taylor","7","2","12","2 July 2013"," Not good, or bad. Just leaves you feeling that you've seen it all before...
","...which of course, you have.<br/><br/>Now, I generally have decided to put up with remakes because, in some instances, better technology and effects can improve upon an old classic. Likewise, I've gotten used to ""re-imaginings"" of old movies for the same reason. In fact, as far as I'm concerned, if a remake has a lot of differences from the original, then I'm more happy, because it is more likely that I'll end up appreciating it. Slavish adherence to the original (True Grit, I'm looking at you!) is, as far as I'm concerned, a waste of time.<br/><br/>With Evil Dead, we have a franchise that started with a low-budget horror (Evil Dead), was remade into something cheesy (Evil Dead 2)and then spawned a sequel to that cheese (Army of Darkness). I'll admit, I like the Bruce Campbell camp movies the best of all.<br/><br/>With this new Evil Dead, there is no comedy. It is an out-and-out horror movie. If there is any humour to be derived from it, it is from watching how Fede Alvarez has dealt with some of the iconic scenes from the original(s). However, that is also where the problem lies.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is too close to the original for comfort. It isn't True Grit style cloning, but it leaves you (on first watching) with the feeling that you've seen it before. That ruins any real tension there is in the film. Not only does it allow you to figure out who will survive, but it allows you to correctly anticipate many of the scenes in the movie. All of which, naturally, lessens the enjoyment.<br/><br/>Iconic scenes, such as the cutting off of the hand, the chainsaw, the Necronomicon, the tree-rape and so on, are all present in this version and all utterly predictable if you've seen the originals.<br/><br/>I guess, if you have not seen those movies, then this comes across as a pretty decent film. But, if you have seen them, then this is just more of the same.<br/><br/>I'm not sure we really needed another Evil Dead movie about a cabin in the woods. It's decent, but I have to ask... why? Why not continue the franchise that already existed, even if you had to bring in new characters for that? Why redo the original films again? The worst sin, of course, is making it so like the originals that it doesn't stand out on its own. I think that is what irritates me most about this film. It didn't have the conviction to head off on its own. Even just a little bit of variance would have been nice. But no. Just more of the same.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: A decent horror flick but it will leave fans of the originals feeling a little disappointed, I feel."

","The Evil Dead, of course, needs no introduction. It was a infamous horror movie that sparked much controversy for its outlandish violence and gore. And not forgetting the famous tree rape scene which gained much attention.<br/><br/>The movie gained cult status during the Video Revolution, even receiving the honour of becoming a ""Video-Nasty"" in the UK. <br/><br/>Its low budget style, charming simplistic story, absurd gore, camp tone, not to mention publicity helped make it a horror classic that spawned two equally excellent sequels <br/><br/>It also featured a young, then-unknown Bruce Campbell who would later go down in history as one of the best B-Movie actors of all time.<br/><br/>So, it's no wonder why Fans were in such outrage and panic when they heard the terrifying news of a remake.<br/><br/>Good news, The Evil Dead fans should fear not for as remakes of classic horror movies go, Evil Dead is actually very good. <br/><br/>It's a refreshing, unique re-imagining of the groovy little gem.<br/><br/>A more serious, darker toned film, that still keeps the over the top, ludicrous gore from the original. <br/><br/>The serious tone helps create a more intense atmosphere. No fun goofy Evil Dead II goodness or the camp tone of the original here.<br/><br/>The style of the film is very moody and very grim, creating a uneasy tension before the nightmare has even begun. <br/><br/>The characters have a decent amount of depth, that little extra more than the original, but in movies like this, character is the last thing on many of the viewers minds.<br/><br/>A genius move was the new characters, a perfect way to explore the new story without being bound to the original and no fear of annoying fans if there's a certain difference to their personality or a change in their fate<br/><br/>I'm sure fans would have been outraged if the iconic Ash was portrayed in a different light and met a different fate<br/><br/>Not to mention fans would always compare the new actors performance to the legendary Bruce Campbell<br/><br/>So it's a good thing they created new protagonists, no need to walk in its predecessors shadow in that light.<br/><br/>That said, the movie tends to be held back at times, unable to reach brave new territory by the fact that it's a remake. It could have explored more back story of the Book of the Dead, explained its new origin, the new lore. Keep the basic premise but break away more from the traditions, did new, exciting things. Have more grotesque, imaginative scenes with the Deadites, push the boundaries of horror. It's 2013, they could have shown the most sickening, spine tingling, frightening things these monsters are capable of. The grisly end of the creatures could have spun heads. <br/><br/>However, there are some very disturbing scenes that made me and many others in the audience cringe but they were no different from the dismemberment you'd see in the every day average torture porn movie or slasher.<br/><br/>One thing that made the original so refreshing was it's bizarre gore sequences, that back then seemed so revolutionary. <br/><br/>There weren't many horror movies where you witnesses a brutal slaying by an axe, or hand mutilation, or even impalement that resulted in Alien- Esq milk spurting.<br/><br/>The remakes gore could have raised the bar for the generation of today like the first did for the generation of yesterday.<br/><br/>A concept I found rather interesting was the main character Mia who is trying hard to go cold turkey in a desperate attempt to kick her drug addiction. A fresh take on the cliché: lets go to the deserted house or cabin in the woods, have a few beers, get laid and get killed by the madman, monster scenario that has been done to death, a cliché that was spoofed perfectly in 2011's The Cabin in the Woods.<br/><br/>It added a new layer of depth for the characters, a drama that sadly never reaches its full potential, but what is shown is enough for this kind of movie.<br/><br/>A daring and interesting direction the director should have went with was a psychological one, have a film that played on the idea of her withdrawal symptoms, made a story that toyed with the audience, made you wonder if the things she was seeing was really happening or all a delusion in her head.<br/><br/>Have her fight her own personal demons, make the Deadites a representation of her struggles.<br/><br/>Even be so daring to have had a twist where it all as a dream in the end, or to play it a little more safe, in a triumphant spiritual conclusion, shown that it was all real and that by conquering the Deadites, Mia had conquered her addiction.<br/><br/>All interesting possibilities that are unfortunately never utilised. Once the madness of The Evil Dead begins, it enters demon slaying territory and stays firmly dug in there until the very end.<br/><br/>The psychological aspects from the original is lacking here in the remake in favour for ultra violence and while that is a disappointment, lovers of gore SFX and buckets of fake blood will have a field day at the sinister delights that await them. <br/><br/>The prosthetic effects are a nice change from the lazy, unconvincing CGI blood and gore that dominates practically all modern day movies.<br/><br/>At the end, I found it leaving me feeling like they could have done a little more. <br/><br/>All in all, it's a dark, trashy, over the top, ultra violent horror movie that is certainly not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>It's definitely worth checking out. For Evil Dead fans and gore hounds alike."

","GROOVY To be honest I wasn't expecting much when I hooked up to go and see what is essentially EVIL DEAD 4. But as a die-hard fan of the 1981 original I felt duty bound. Having recently yawned through Sam Raimi's appalling OZ project didn't help my enthusiasm. Neither did a few reviews I'd read.<br/><br/>The precredit sequence got me thinking 'yeah yeah yeah... you were right.' But I put it behind me and told myself to give it at least a chance. Glad I did.<br/><br/>Having seen so many of the recent remakes of classics poo pooing on films that not only scared but also inspired I was actually glad to be watching something that, though it is wholly unoriginal managed to be entertaining, creepy, squirm inducing and at a few moments scary. Although the tension never hits the top notes of the original it still got me stressed.<br/><br/>As for all the ballyhoo about the lack of humour... WHAT! It's funny as f***. The crazy over the top violence, gore, dismemberment, use of tools and dumb dialogue is straight out of the Raimi school of horror. OK the ending is a bit of a let down... rather have the originals 'no escape!' shock or something like it. But all in all EVIL DEAD is far better than most of the crap being touted as horror nowadays. OK it's not really a remake. But it is another chapter. I'm sure Sam, Bruce and Robert will be happy too. Thank you Fede Alverez.<br/><br/>Maybe I just liked it because I'm British and we always like the original more than the Americans... The French like it even more."

I do not like horror movies is not a secret but I made the Evil Dead movies and so I was very curious how they might look today, with today's facts, today's technology, today's make-up etc
but unfortunately the movie does exactly the wrong thing that makes many horror movies today it takes too seriously, wide parts of the movie are completely dark so you can hardly see anything and the brutal scenes are once again cut as ugly as in a hip hop video so that you can not enjoy the full impact and impact of the injury at all, or suffer the pain.<br/><br/>What a lot of people will not understand I think it's too good a lot too nice a lot to it yes it's too much with that and the cold drug withdrawal is way too serious that just does not fit into this kind of movie.
I want the beginning scene with the father who has to expel the evil from his daughter and because he does not succeed then then shoot.
but nothing else absolutely nothing I could not find anything about this movie, nothing in this movie was anything exciting, nothing was funny, nothing was scary and he was not even bored so he would be a good fall asleep just boring in terms of that he has moved and I wondered all the time when this garbage is finally over.<br/><br/>I know the movie has its fans but I definitely do not have it I just thought it was disgusting and I'm glad to be left alone with this version of ""Evil Dead""."
"byStevenRamirez","8","1","4","20 February 2017"," Ninety Minutes of Nonstop Grand Guignol
","(September 2013.) Okay, let me start off by saying that I am a huge Sam Raimi fan. I enjoyed the original 'Evil Dead' trilogy back in the eighties and early nineties, and I still watch them occasionally. If you'll recall, the first two were super-low budget, and the third was supposed to take place in England, but was shot in Southern California. Hey, I didn't know they had tumbleweeds in England!<br/><br/>Nevertheless, they were gory and loads of fun.<br/><br/>So you don't think I'm about to trash the 'Evil Dead' remake, I liked it, okay? It was intense, gruesome and unrelenting in its depiction of twentysomethings trying to survive against an invisible evil that is unleashed when one of those geniuses reads aloud from the BOOK OF THE DEAD. And, come on, to date it's grossed over $97M worldwide on a budget of around $17M. What's not to like?<br/><br/>But in all the horribly graphic maiming, clubbing and loss-of-limb splatter gore, something was missing for me. Here's a hint: ""Gimme some sugar, baby.""<br/><br/>Yep, the humor.<br/><br/>The new film is ninety minutes of nonstop Grand Guignol that every lover of horror likes to revel in. But if you'll recall, with some exceptions, the best horror movies are those which are not only violent but funny.<br/><br/>Look, it's like this. If you're going to subject yourself to a root canal without anesthesia, don't you at least want the oral surgeon to crack a few lame jokes during the blood spray? You know who gets it? Rob Zombie. Check out 'House of 1000 Corpses' sometime. Captain Spaulding, anyone? Yeah, humor.<br/><br/>You know who else gets it? Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. Which is strange, because those guys show up as producers on this show.<br/><br/>Should you see it? Of course. But if I were you, I'd put on a comedy afterward. I was actually a little queasy during the end credits. But it's tight, well written and well acted. As I said, it's unrelenting. Enjoy the ride, then go back and see the originals. Nobody wields a chainsaw like Bruce Campbell."
"exup","8","1","4","3 February 2017"," At last a remake that works
","Evil Dead (2013) I was a huge fan of the original version of this film and felt Sam Rami changed the face of horror with his vision. Many of his, (then new) techniques have been replicated with great effect in horror for the 30 years that followed. Mr Rami explained in an interview that his reasons for remaking this classic was that he always wondered what the film would have been like if he had the budget available then, that was available today, as the original was made on a shoe string budget. This was an exciting and unique approach to remakes. Now let's get real before we start. The 1981 version was groundbreaking at the time, but is a very different watch today. The enjoyment now being maintained by the nostalgic element of remembering how good it was at the time. In saying that Bruce Campbell's portrayal of the lead character 'Ash' is still an excellent performance to watch today by any standard. That leads me to my first point within the remake. They cleverly have re-cast the male lead to a female lead to minimise any comparisons, which let's face it no one could live up to. Exit Bruce Campbell and enter Jane Levy. This Actress has a very quirky look which is utilized to perfection for this role with a very twisted, dark, animated and committed performance. She genuinely leaves you feeling uneasy watching her journey through this horror fest. With equally impressive supporting cast members putting in some very strong scenes, there's nothing to criticise here either. It was nice to see Sam Rami writing this film and both Sam Rami and Bruce Campbell deciding to take the producers chair. They definitely give this film a dark, chilling and expensive look. I'm glad to see they don't change the format too much or change the premise of the story too much either. It remains satisfyingly familiar in a chilling new way. Extra Kudos go to the cinematographer Aaron Morton as the use of lights and darks is truly haunting and has created some very memorable moments in this film. This coupled with top notch Make up effects (something very much lacking from the original) and an evident boost in budget make for a very scary and uneasy watch. The task in remaking this film is telling a story that's no longer original, in a way that's been done a million times since. He totally finds a way of making this work. I was so excited to see everything in this film work. Atmosphere, soundtrack, lighting, and performances, I could go on. Any fan of the original should appreciate what's been achieved in this film and 30 years on this story is still able to engage and terrorise the audience. Sam Rami shows us that he certainly doesn't need to rely on nostalgia or just a dedicated fan base to deliver a gem. He gives us a truly horrific and disturbing look at his tale of possession."
"lizmolloy","10","1","4","1 February 2017"," Am I the only one who spotted Ash ...
","In the opening sequence, with the young girl in the forest, at the 1:33 minute mark you can clearly see Ash's silhouette in the background, complete with chainsaw hand. I have just re-watched it to confirm this, as this appearance does not appear to be documented anywhere else on this page. <br/><br/>Anyway. I am 47, LOVE all the original films and was aghast to learn of a reimagining. But, I sought out the trailer, and was sufficiently impressed to buy the DVD upon release. I have to say, this film is excellent. The fact that all three original creators were attached gave me the confidence to watch it. Those who say it ""isn't scary"" need to qualify that with specific examples, because it scared the pee out of me! <br/><br/>The homages within the film to the originals are subtly inserted. If you've never seen any of the others, it doesn't matter at all. BTW, to call the original Evil Dead ""old and campy"" shows astounding short-sightedness. If you regard everything made before you were born as 'past it' then you really need to reassess your attitude. Some works are regarded as 'Classics' for a reason."

","I love this movie! I've already seen it a couple of times and I like it even more with each viewing. The cast is great, the story is original and the gore is unbelievable. I wouldn't even call it a remake of the original 'Evil Dead' as nothing more but the basic premise of friends staying at a secluded cabin in the woods and being haunted by a demonic entity was kept. Yes, there are a couple of scenes that are reminiscent of Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' movies but they only reference them rather than directly copy from them. Jane Levy probably is the best actress they could have gotten who could pull a demanding role like this off. Her performance here is unbelievable. Kudos to charming Jane for acting the hell out of her role!<br/><br/>In addition to that, the look of the movie is absolutely amazing! It already looked insanely good on Blu-ray. Probably the best looking Blu-ray I've ever seen! That's why I picked it as the first movie to watch in 4K (it's on Amazon) as I very much expected it to look astonishing. I was not let down! Other than the majority of current 4K releases that are usually upscaled from 2K masters, 'Evil Dead' was filmed and mastered completely in 4K and it looks superb. Have I mentioned that It love this movie? Groovy!"

"kannibalcorpsegrinder","10","1","4","26 October 2015"," One of the best in the genre
","Gathering at a cabin-in-the-woods, a group of friends attempting to rehab a friend learn the area was used to cure demonic possession and accidentally free a trapped demon that possesses them one-by-one and forcing the survivors to get away alive.<br/><br/>Frankly this one was one of the best remakes and an even better stand- alone effort. One of the film's best parts here is in how much action this packs into here, as there's a lot of scenes here featuring either the possessed charging after them or being attacked by them. The chilling opening, from the woodland abduction and chaining up in the basement before the actual manner of driving out the infected occurs makes for a fine intro to this one, as does the initial escape attempt from the house where the driving rain forces the car out into the pond and shows the demon rising and stalking afterward into the twisting, disorienting woods for another confrontations that's especially chilling. As well, the gradual build-up of her possession instead of the relapse following this encounter is not only genuinely frightening but build the action really well. Starting with the running water in the shower and the revelation of what happened to the others around her, this sets up a solid base here for one of the film's highlight sequences in their first encounter with the possessed as the attack with the shotgun, the vomiting ungodly amounts of viscera onto the friend before being locked in the basement and then battling the now-possessed and deformed friend in the bathroom gives this on an incredibly strong and chilling scene filled with some solid jumps and brutal action. Likewise, the attack here by the bitten friend is even more brutal from the action in the locked basement where she becomes possessed and forced to dismember herself from the counter and now begins chasing the ones left throughout the cabin in some really brutal, vicious battles really adds nicely to this one. Even more impressive here is the finale, which here is the film's best part with the initial cleansing attempt and subsequent revival, the encounter back in the house leading to the demons resurrection in the area where a thrilling, brutal and quite exciting sequence plays out here with the demon leading her throughout the leftover areas and into the woods into a thrilling, utterly bloodbath-soaked carnage that really lets the blood flow here quite nicely from the wounds but also raining blood on the entire sequence. Along with some truly outstanding demon-make-up that gives them a truly inhuman look and attitude that fits perfectly with their mangled features, these here are the film's positives against the few small flaws here. The film's biggest problem here is the fact that it resorts to such cliché and predictable manners of tormenting here for the possessed who resort to the old standby of demonic cursing to tease and torment the survivors here that the taunts aren't even creative enough to mean anything and don't even fit the tone of the movie at all being so lazy. This also could've done a little more here to set-up the contents of the cabin which just comes out of nowhere and doesn't feel all too logical. Beyond these, this one was an absolutely amazing entry.<br/><br/>Rated R: Extreme Graphic Violence, Extreme Graphic Language and violence-against-animals."
"mitchomayhem","7","1","4","1 October 2015"," One of the best remakes in recent years.
","This film is definitely one of the best remakes in recent years. The female characters aren't just there for sex appeal, the characters aren't complete idiots, and we finally get a horror without teenagers being obnoxious and trying to get laid! However, that's not to say that this film has characters we can root for and relate to. The film doesn't really try to give us likable characters, they're just there to die, really. Therefore, upon retrospect of watching this movie, you realize that the characters don't really do anything before they die! So you might as well have obnoxious teens because no one in this movie has any character traits other than scared! The lead female (I can't remember her name) has the trait of being an ex heroin addict, but that's dropped instantly! At first it seems Eric may be our lead this time, but then he dies and that other guy takes over and I could barely tell he was there before he had to kill the demon in the end!<br/><br/>As a result of these poor characters, this movie doesn't really seem like a movie - just a series of events! The characters turn up, they die, the end. There's no progression or evolution of the plot, it's just there to set up a few cool moments and that's really all you can take away from the movie - it's pretty freaking cool!<br/><br/>The deaths and action will either make you cringe and look away from the screen, or make you whoop in excitement as you watch the badass chaos ensue! I'm personally the latter. This of course means the effects, both practical and CGI are spot on and there's not a single moment that'll make you think ""they really could've cleaned that up a bit.<br/><br/>In the end, really, the only thing going for this movie is the cool action and effects, the story and character writing feels lazy but it is one hell of a fun time!"
"Bezenby","8","1","4","27 January 2015"," Evil Dead - without the cheese
","Don't get me wrong, with Bruce Campbell, stop motion animation, and Sam Raimi's hyperactive camera style, the original Evil Dead is one of my favourites from the golden age of horror. This remake at first suckers you into thinking your going to get some tame re-hash (like the Crazies remake) before rubbing your face in a vomit inducing pile of gore.<br/><br/>Just like the first one, five folks head out to a cabin in the woods, only this time it's to help junky Mia get off the skag. Mia thinks something's up in the cabin, but no one believes her as she's going through withdrawal. Really though, the fault lies in the geeky guy who rather naively opens a book bound by barbed wire, ignores the 'don't read this' warning, and opens some gateway that lets a demon through that starts possessing the youngsters (starting with Mia).<br/><br/>This is when the film really takes off, and tries to up the original in the gore stakes. People cut their own faces off, get stabbed repeatedly in the face with syringes, cut their own limbs off and use all the last toilet paper without replacing it with a new roll. There's gallons of blood here and like the original, people do stupid things for stupid reasons, and there's aspects of the film you'll be scratching your head at.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you can't go wrong with a horror film that goes all out in the horror stakes. Gave me the dry bowk, as they say in Glasgow."
"dee.reid","7","1","4","25 October 2014"," ""Evil Dead"" (2013)
","For this horror film fan, the original 1982 Sam Raimi-directed ""The Evil Dead"" remains one of the most purely terrifying motion pictures experiences of my lifetime. Its superior 1987 sequel/remake ""Evil Dead II"" (also directed by Raimi) was the series high point - and my personal favorite of the original ""Evil Dead"" trilogy - and was also a perfect marriage of horror and slapstick comedy. 1992's ""Army of Darkness"" was more fantasy than horror, but it was nonetheless a worthy closer to the original series.<br/><br/>Now it's 2013, and it appears that reboots/remakes of classic horror films are everywhere. It was inevitable that ""The Evil Dead"" would get the remake/reboot treatment at some point. I was firmly against the idea of a remake/reboot of ""The Evil Dead"" since the beginning. I could not imagine Sam Raimi - who ascended to the ranks of Hollywood blockbuster-dom with his work on the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy from 2002-2007 - wanting to hop on the Hollywood bandwagon to remake his first hit movie.<br/><br/>Alas, 2013's ""Evil Dead,"" which marks the debut of Uruguayan director Fede Alvarez, was not the disaster it could have so easily been. Raimi, Rob Tapert, and the almighty Bruce Campbell himself all return as producers on this latest outing Into The Woods. And believe you me, it's not that bad. While the movie starts and stops early on and has an irritating tendency in the earliest proceedings to sometimes elicit unintended snickers out of the audience, ""Evil Dead"" almost always plays it straight - much like the 1982 original, even though there may be one or two moments of gallows humor to liven the otherwise relentlessly grim mood.<br/><br/>Things begin with an adventure to an isolated cabin in the woods: Mia (Jane Levy) is a recovering junkie who has been hauled out here by her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), and their mutual friends Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and David's girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) as part of her treatment after all other attempts to get clean & sober have failed - so now Mia has to go the detox route cold turkey. While exploring the cabin, they somehow or another wind up in the cellar, where someone slaughtered a bunch of poor felines as part of some kind of abandoned ritualistic sacrifice, and discover the so-called ""Book of the Dead."" Eric unwisely reads aloud the incantations within it, thus awakening the malevolent supernatural forces that had been lying dormant in the woods outside the cabin. One by one, the friends are slowly possessed by these demonic forces, leaving only one lone survivor to fend them off until morning.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" does not play around. Much of what made ""The Evil Dead"" so purely horrifying has remained intact here: gore, self-mutilation, power tools, demonic possession, bodily dismemberment, and more gore. In fact, there's so much going on here in terms of gory special effects that at one point it's literally raining down blood. (Where's Slayer when you need them to provide some background noise for the slaughter?) Believe me, once the terror starts, ""Evil Dead"" becomes an almost relentless shock- and gore-fest - though obviously because we've seen it all before it lacks the intensity of Raimi's original classic.<br/><br/>Alvarez and his co-scriptwriter Rodo Sayagues pay plenty of homage to ""The Evil Dead"" (it should be noted that this reboot combines elements of both ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead II"" - which was done, I would guess, to please die-hard fans of the original film series). Alvarez is also good in keeping up the tension throughout the picture, again in remaining in touch with the spirit of the original film and its sequels (even though it ultimately lacks the ferocious intensity of those films).<br/><br/>It should again be noted that ""Evil Dead"" is drenched in blood. This is perhaps the most relentlessly blood-soaked ""R""-rated horror picture to be released by a major American film studio (TriStar Pictures) so far this millennium - unless you maybe count Neil Marshall's ""The Descent"" (2005), despite the fact that film was originally a British production released by Lionsgate Films here in the United States. How this movie managed to secure an ""R"" rating with so much blood is beyond me.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead"" - It'll swallow your soul, maybe, if you let it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>P.S.: Watch after the credits - ""Groovy."""
"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","25 September 2014"," Effective remake
","Why make a remake of Evil Dead? Beside the point that such a thing has already been done - it's called Evil Dead 2 - the original movie is such a cult classic and so perfect in its own flawed way that I don't really see any way to improve upon it.<br/><br/>And truth be told, the only area where this remake fares better than the original, is in the special effects department. Yet, unlike so many other needless remakes, this one comes amazingly close to the original in both atmosphere and quality. It feels like Evil Dead, or what it would have been like had the original been done today for the first time.<br/><br/>What do I mean by that? It simply plays the tropes just as well and just as straight as the original. Sure, at times it feels a little bit like paint-by-numbers, and there isn't a lot of originality here, but it's still different enough, yet similar enough, that fans of the original can love its vision and passion for the source material.<br/><br/>And as an standalone horror movie, it's heads above its peers, which doesn't say much nowadays, but there you have it. It's absolutely, delightfully gory, it doesn't shy away from the no-no's or taboos, the characters work in their satirically stereotypical way and as a whole you feel the chills.<br/><br/>Though I must admit that the final fight/boss/horror/aberration was a bit of a disappointment after all the buildup.<br/><br/>If you liked the original trilogy, I urge you to give this one a watch. It's not as good, but it's a close thing. It's Evil Dead for the new century."
"krenwregget","7","1","4","29 August 2014"," not a bad horror film
","So I just finished watching this film and I quite enjoyed it, more than I figured I would. I'm not a die-hard ED fan but I liked the originals and I'd heard mixed reviews on this one but as a horror fan thought I'd give it a fair shake.<br/><br/>The film looks great. It has a kind of hyper-saturated, rich, retro tone to it that adds to the eeriness of the setting. The camera angles and some of the framing also contribute to it's look and the sets/environments were well designed. There is a bit of shaky-cam during some of the action as well as some jump edits, but overall it wasn't too distracting.<br/><br/>The story is, well.... we're talking about a horror film with demons and stuff so what logic is there to found in such things? It's passable enough to move things along, though there are plenty of horror clichés and people acting foolishly for no reason; perhaps you can blame their youth.<br/><br/>Gore hounds should be pleased with this film as it surpasses the original in that regard; I found myself saying ""oh man!"" more than once. There are a few scares and some tension but horror veterans will see it coming.<br/><br/>What's missing is a likable protagonist. The film centres around Mia who is a drug addict, at the cabin with her friends in order to detox via the 'cold turkey' method. She is also the first to fall victim to the evil presence lurking in the woods (I guess they have nothing better to do?) so the lead role shifts around a bit and never really settles on anyone in particular. You think her brother might end up being the ""Ash"" character, but he is a bit of a jackass and personally I was hoping he would die in some horrible way.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a fun ride and one that I will take again, along with the original. In a market flooded with bad horror films, this one is a decent watch if you can separate it from the Sam Raimi classic."

What they do not know is that at that cabin there was a demonically ritual that had happen and as Erin, one of the friends reads a spell part out of the 'book' he then resummons the demon thus causing chaos.<br/><br/>The editing was fairly inappropriate to people who do not normally watch horror movies, it was far too bloody for people to see. However, it was appropriate in a sense they made it realistic. The film was mostly shot at eye level and had multiple close-ups to show key factors that contributed to the film. The film did not have editing techniques such as: dissolve, wipe, or fade. Since they did a lot of zooming in and out it led to close-ups and long shots.<br/><br/>The sound was effective because it matched the scenes that were going on. For example, when David and Mia reunite at last, the sound of the background music was touching and heart-felling. In addition, there were scenes of suspense and the background music contributed by helping the audience get a sense or foreshadow that something was going to happen. A good scene that shows that the sound was effective was when there were creeks inside the cabin showing how old the cabin really is.<br/><br/>The movie demonstrated a majority of cinematography skills. For instance in the scene when they discovered the 'book,' the camera was tracking Mia's movements around everyone and the table but the main focus being the book. That scene shared a majority of close-ups and had all the camera angles and showed suspense and mystery to the scene. To make the scene feel that way, they had played background music that helped set the scene and mood to be that way.<br/><br/>The social context of the film was well written because as Mia's heroin started to wear off, she started to overreact about everything as a normal drug addict would be without their drug. To add on, when that was going on, their friend Erin, started to read the book and unleashing a demon out into Mia's body. She starts to change slowly in a negative way acting crazy and since everyone thinks she's reacting that way because she has been clean off her drugs for a certain amount of time, they do not know what's going on with her. The fact that she is becoming possessed and people do not realize because they think it is because she is off heroine goes hand in hand.<br/><br/>The meaning of this film ..<br/><br/>Some personal influence's or bias that I have that would have affected the film is that I have seen so many scary movies that this one does not compare to them.<br/><br/>I would have to agree the film was enjoyable because it had its moments of heartfelt and gruesome at the same time.<br/><br/>I do recommend this movie to people who enjoy gruesome and bloody horrors. However, I would not to people who does not enjoy a good scare."

","Well it's been a long time since we've had a new addition to this series but I believe it was worth the wait in most respects. They're certainly are those that will cling to the classic and swear up and down that this film doesn't measure up but I found this movie much more entertaining then the likes of the new ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"" or the dreaded ""Nightmare on Elm street"" remakes. Now I do admit that being the shiniest turd in the cat box doesn't make something ""good"" but I think this movie is superior in almost every way to those stinkers and many of the modern horror movies we see today. Evil Dead (2013) sticks to the original for the most part which is important and gives us a modern touch that the younger generation, who may not have seen the original (yet) can relate to and get them interested in the series. Overall this movie is well directed, the acting is not Oscar worthy but it's pretty well done and the overall feel is one of a creepy, demented, spine tingling place that you certainly wouldn't want to spend your vacation at with the wife and kids. My advice if your a fan of the original is to just give this film a chance and try not to ridicule it every time you see a difference in the two. After all they did make a new one for a reason and sometimes change can be a good thing. Happy Haunting."
"agedabeatjunkie","9","1","4","4 March 2014"," Great remake of a B horror classic into a serious horror film
","I was excited about the new evil dead, being a fan of the original trilogy. I could not believe all the low ratings on IMDb, if you read through it seems like most low ratings are due to the fact that this contained little to no comedy or dark humor, and it was too disgusting or too bloody. I feel like a lot of them are mad that they cannot relive their glory days in the 80's when they could pop in a VHS, drink some beers with a group of people, have some laughs and get laid after. This is not that type of movie, as it seems to have deeper gut wrenching dialogue that makes you feel a little uneasy as if walking into a serious conversation. <br/><br/>I personally like the take on evil dead, the subtle differences in story made it exciting and with a decent sound system and HD I thought it was moderately scary. I am not just an evil dead fan but a fan of movies that are directed well. I thought the actors were convincing, not amazing but still good enough. The amount of gore in this reminds me of most grindhouse films but yes, it does lack comedy. I think this is easily underrated due to fan boys and those who cannot handle gore. A review here said that only sociopaths and people who like violent videogames and torture animals would like this... well, this is not a movie for your god fearing mother. If you believe violent movies and video games cause sociopaths, not only would you lack any substantial evidence linking that, but you would lack credibility as well. maybe you should start writing for fox news. I think you missed the whole point of the horror genre. I save lives for a living at a hospital, I care for many small animals, reptiles, and invertebrates and I volunteer at the local wildlife center. Yeah, I fail to see a correlation between liking horror films and being a sociopath."

","This movie surpassed my expectations. I was expecting an overwhelming amount of crappy acting with a surplus of over played death scenes and just a hint of unbelievable gore. It may have had gore, but nothing too Finial Destinationie. The death scenes were really the only thing that got to me they lasted at least 10 minutes each, which admittedly did make the movie very fast passed and interesting, but still I didn't need to see a girl get shot with a nail gun what seemed like fifteen times. I understand that she was possessed but come on! Seeing someone die dramatically just doesn't appeal to me as much as it does to some. The acting was fantastic and I really believed that Mia was possessed. Eric (don't even know his real name) was the only character that I wasn't very found of acting wise. Evil Dead earns 5/10 stars for making me cover my eyes, and scream ""KILL HER, KILL HER, KILL HER"" several times. However if it wanted to earn more than that I shouldn't of been laughing at lines such as ""I can smell your dirty soul"" and ""come down here pretty boy and let me suck your cock"". Horror movies aren't supposed to make you laugh but this one did. 5/10 would recommend to watch once maybe twice."

","I don't understand all the negative reviews.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of the original Evil Dead trilogy, and I loved Ash as a character. Although Ash wasn't in this movie, I wasn't disappointed. I did not go to this movie expecting to see an EXACT remake of the original Evil Dead. <br/><br/>It's a very gory and bloody movie; if blood and guts aren't your thing, steer clear of this movie. There were many subtle details that paid tribute to the original movie, and it stayed true to the main plot of the original. There is quite a bit of dark humor within the movie, and I found myself chuckling at many moments. Most of the characters were likable, and the actors/actresses did well. The movie kept me interested, and there were moments of suspense. The ending scene is fantastic.<br/><br/>This movie wasn't revolutionary, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.

If you can't handle gore DO NOT WATCH, the sky rains blood(seriously, it does) in a scene in the movie and the scenes are vicious and sadly i ate it up. If you want a proper chilling movie that doesn't have to be a guilty pleasure that you are embarrassed to admit you liked, i'd say you should see rosemary's baby, the original halloween, the original omen, the original carrie or the shining."
"andreas-hein1993","7","1","4","1 October 2013"," Thoroughly good movie, but very disappointing ending. 7/10
","This remake of the old classic ""Evil Dead"" is definitely one of the better horror movies I have seen. The setting is generally very fitting for this gory, dark and twisted horror movie.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez definitely deserves credit for creating a so tense atmosphere in this movie that constantly reminds you of the isolation these people are trapped within. The movie goes to great length to show that there is no actual escape, and as the events escalate, the only option left is to fight.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a somewhat short movie, running for about 80 minutes. This fits the movie just fine though, as it is a pretty fast-paced film that will not let you be bored for a second. However the ending gets dragged out way to far, as the movie had several opportunities to end in a very decent manner but instead chooses to drag out into some far too confusing and unimpressive scenes. I do not know whether they chose to add these extra scenes because the movie was simply to short without it, or if they really found the plot ending better in that matter. Either way the last 10 minutes of the movie is pretty much the worst, and are generally unnecessary for the movie to come to an end.<br/><br/>Evil Dead really scores its point in the ""villain"" of the film. This supernatural demonic creature, is incredibly well done. While not exactly being super scary, it just completely suits ones expectations of a demonic creature engulfing in a human body. It is very different from ""The exorcist"" style of possession, and honestly. I prefer it this way. The whole set definitely deserves props for this amazing hostile entity.<br/><br/>As for the characters of the movie, they are unfortunately pretty matching for what you would expect of a newer horror movie. They are overly skeptical, illogical egoistic, cowardly and sometimes just plain dumb. There are a few cases where the characters breaks these horrible bonds of indecency and show some actual courage/some sign of intelligence, but generally they are very disappointing and predictable <br/><br/>Why should you watch this movie? Evil Dead does not hold back on anything. It refuses to cut off anything and shows you the raw (fictional) reality of dealing with a greater evil. It is a very gory movie, but does for the most parts not exaggerate the bloodiness, so it really makes you wish you had not started watching this movie, but without making you feel like you should throw up. While Evil dead is definitely not the goriest horror out there, it is not for the weak-hearted. So if you have trouble with blood, needless or small isolated rooms, then this movie is not for you.<br/><br/>Helix' Horrible Reviews"
"con_au","7","1","4","1 October 2013"," It is what it says on the box
","I've ticked the 'spoiler alert' box, but it would be hard to 'spoil' this film, which is an assemblage of horror film staples. I admit I'm not a huge watcher of horror films so I'm not going to pretend to be an expert, but even for me, it seems like Evil Dead (2013) ticks boxes, without inventing any.<br/><br/>Evil Dead has a pretty well trod path, plot-wise: Group of pretty OK looking youngsters assemble at a creepy venue, do something to seriously irritate a spirit/ghost/demon/entity and proceed to get picked off in gruesome and uncomfortable ways. Throw in a well-loved pet as additional victim as required. Last teen standing performs heroic/extraordinary/self-destructive act to triumph over evil.....or do they?<br/><br/>This rendition of Evil Dead invites five post-adolescent hotties (and a dog) to the most god-awful location (apparently they ""used to love it"" when they were kids - why?) to support Mia as she withdraws from her drug of choice. Mia's brother, who comes with a fraught relationship with his siblings and others, a bossy nurse, a nerdy dude and a cheerleader-type round out the clichés.<br/><br/>The yucky smell turns out not to be the disgusting swamp the cabin is build on, nor the gross mildew and mouldering refuse that's built up inside it, but a cellar full of decomposing cats. At the heart of the pet cemetery is a book, thoughtfully wrapped in barbed wire, enticing future readers to open it up.<br/><br/>Nerd boy does that, and it turns out to be a real page-turner. After reading aloud that he shouldn't read it aloud, he reads it aloud some more and invokes a demon spirit along to the party.<br/><br/>Demon spirit occupies Mia first, and not in a gentlemanly way at all. It then proceeds to infect the rest of the group. Until a lengthy and see-sawing showdown finally exhausts the blood and gore budget. <br/><br/>There are plenty of jump moments, nothing that you can't see coming, but which work pretty well. The special effects seem OK to me, for what appears to be a moderately budgeted film. If there's any deficit in quality, they certainly make up for it with quantity. The whole contents of a hardware store, various cooking implements and even the kitchen (well, bathroom) sink are deployed to get the gruesome jobs done. For me, it only just manages to balance on the edge between horror and slasher film.<br/><br/>Even in my limited experience, this movie accounts pretty well for itself in a genre where there is lots of really, really bad. There's nothing exceptional, and certainly nothing original, to speak of, but so long as you're prepared to live with the generic challenges (why would cheerleader go back - alone - into a small cabin occupied only by a raging, murderous demon?) I think Evil Dead does exactly what is asked of it."
"Shadwellarmy","7","1","4","17 August 2013"," Not very scary but still enjoyed it
","I am a huge fan of the original films as i watched them as a kid and think Bruce Campbell is an absolute legend! I watched this 'remake' with an open mind and not expecting it to replace the original films. I have to say I enjoyed it, however it is not very scary. Very gory but all credit to the makers that they didn't use CGI everywhere and went for traditional effects. I think they could have done more to introduce suspense instead of going for the full on gore fest, but at the same time the characters are in a cabin being attacked by evil demons. I don't think they are popping round for tea and sandwiches and to ask nicely if they can have your soul! Im surprised at all of the bad reviews talking about the level of gore as when i have watched other films like Hostel and Saw I have found those to be totally over the top. I laughed a few times at this films level of violence and gore just as i did at the Evil Dead 2 so for me I think the makers of the film knew exactly what they were doing. I would be up for a sequel but maybe next time go more for the suspense and pull back a little on the violence..."
"uokeap","Null","1","4","8 August 2013"," It wasn't that bad, it was quite good actually.
","I watched this movie with very low expectations since most people gave it horrible reviews. I have never seen the original title so I'm not going to compare the two films. The movie escalated pretty quickly which annoyed me at first but it sort of fast forwarded the cliché scenes that you see in every horror title these days so that turned out to be a good thing actually. The first half of the movie is average at best but the second half is the game changer it keeps throwing plot twists at you even though they're predictable yet just when you think that this is going to be the end, you're faced with another twist,I really wished they did not include the final scene/twist though. I wished that they told us more about the characters only interesting character was David , i really did not care at all about the others, would've helped the story a lot if they told us more about him but what they tell you about him is enough. A lot of people are complaining about having ""Too much blood"" in this movie, people it's a SLASHER of course it's going to have a lot of blood in it, although i must agree some scenes were disgusting and i don't mean that in a good way. the rest of the movie is pretty good actually it's not going to be a classic but it delivers good stuff. See this movie and ignore all the haters, you will not be disappointed."
"tvmovienews","7","1","4","5 August 2013"," Evil Dead
","If you don't like horror films, then stay clear! Evil Dead is a horror film which serves as both a reboot and a loose continuation of Sam Raimi's series 'Evil Dead' franchise. Raimi decided not to direct this film however, and instead delegated the duties to Fede Alvarez. Raimi still signed on as a producer along with Bruce Campbell and Robert G. Tapert, the lead actor and producer of the original trilogy respectively. For those of you who haven't seen the original, the film follows a group of five friends who drive out to a remote cabin in the woods, and discover the 'Book of the Dead'. Upon reading some of the passages aloud, they unwittingly summon up demons which take possession of their bodies one by one. <br/><br/>From what I have read, this has divided its fan base. On one side you could argue that it misses the mark when compared to the intentions set out by the original. All of the characters have been renamed and the cult hero Ash no longer exists. His humour is really missed, including the catchy 'one-liners' that were utilized in the famous video game 'Duke Nukem'. Instead the character which closely resembles Ash, is overly serious, boring and continuously makes terrible decisions which drive you crazy. On the other side, if you look at it as a standalone horror film, I think it is great. It is full of suspense, creepy scenes, gore, violence and a reported 70,000 gallons of fake blood.. awesome! They really did nail the 'horror' element of it, which is why it's all the more frustrating they didn't bring back Ash, as it had so much potential. That missing humour was the ingredient which made the original so unique to most standard horror films and that is exactly what this is, an above average 'standard horror film'. <br/><br/>So in summary I really enjoyed this film and genuinely found it to be quite creepy in parts, but as a remake it missed the point.<br/><br/>My Rating: 6.5/10<br/><br/>For more Movie and TV News, Reviews and Rumours go to: www.facebook.com/tvmovienews"
"Hey_Sweden","6","1","4","3 August 2013"," ""This time, the only @#$%ing way is the hard way!""
","Over 30 years after the original ""The Evil Dead"" first started to earn its place in horror cinema, co-writer / director Fede Alvarez and company brought this reimagining to the big screen. While it's safe to say that their hearts were in the right place, this 21st century version just does not have the impact of the original.<br/><br/>The story is somewhat similar to the one concocted by Sam Raimi back in the early 1980s. A quintet of none-too-bright young people gather at a remote family cabin deep in the woods. The variation on the story this time around is that four of the kids are concerned about their friend Mia (Jane Levy), a habitual junkie, and are doing everything that they can to help her. But when the characters discover the type of ancient artifacts in horror movies that we know people shouldn't mess with, one of them, Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci) reads through the book, not realizing what he's doing. The demons in the woods are then free to possess these hapless schmucks.<br/><br/>While Raimis' film was played straight (and commendably so) by its cast, it had a decidedly more playful edge to it. It wasn't about wallowing in unpleasantness so much as it was just about having some fun. This version is far more glum, and almost humourless. Some horror fans may appreciate a genre film that lives up to the word ""horror"", but it's simply a little too hard to care much about these characters. When they buy the farm in glorious, savage ways, one cheers basically because they're tired of spending time with these people.<br/><br/>""The Evil Dead"" '13 pays homage to the original in certain ways: the ""Force"" P.o.V., the damned Book of the Dead, the necklace, the vegetation that comes to life, etc. But Alvarez and company don't come up with anything truly interesting of their own that they can add to this formula. But at least horror lovers who measure a films' success depending on the amount of its gore will be VERY happy here; once this flick gets going, it's just a non-stop onslaught of violence and sadism.<br/><br/>The cast isn't as memorable, for sure. Shiloh Fernandez is not too bad an actor, but he just doesn't have the charisma of B movie icon Bruce Campbell. Levy gives it her all as the victimized Mia. Pucci is saddled with the task of providing all the exposition that he can derive from the Book.<br/><br/>For the faithful, and those who are willing to sit through the end credits, will be rewarded with a cameo by a familiar face.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

Chaos ensues and our protagonists find themselves unable to escape. <br/><br/>Standard as it may sound this movies keeps going at an unrelenting pace once the proverbial feces touches the fan.

"goodfortune22","7","2","13","7 July 2013"," honest review from horror fan
","Thank Heavens a traditional rated R horror movie. Currently the horror genre turned into the Suspense genre which relies on Shock & sudden scares from being nervous. I personally hate suspense being that its for 13 yr old. This movie wastes no time in letting the viewer know what is happening and what will happen. There is no mystery or questions everything is straight forward. The action is traditional and leaves you mostly satisfied without questions about loop holes in the plot. The only complaint is that I'm not a big fan on possessions but this movie did a very good job. I hope this movie will be a stepping stone for Horror movies to get away from Suspense & back to what it use to be with Physical Horror not talking & mystery."
"achyutaghosh","7","2","13","2 July 2013"," high on gore, low on scares
","The gold standard for horror fans all over the world till this date is still the troika of The Evil Dead, The Omen and The Exorcist. The Omen remake could not hold a candle to the original, and to be frank, I was not looking forward to the Evil Dead remake because I never thought anyone could do justice to Sam Raimi's brilliance, Bruce Campbell's class act and the seamless manner in which the movie blended horror with black humor. <br/><br/>Having said that, the 2013 Evil Dead remake has its own strengths in relentlessly gratuitous levels of violence and is a worthy homage in itself to a classic- the basic plot remains the same, with 5 youngsters trapped in a cabin with a demon raising book for company. Teenage curiosity is often the staple for the existence of the horror film genre- the demons rise, possessions take place and each of them get to die in imaginative ways. Gore lovers rejoice as there is plentiful to look forward to as director Fede Alvarez shows his creativity where it counts. Dismemberments, burnings, decapitations, bashed in and blown-to- smithereens heads, homicidal nail guns, mountains of vomit- it is all there along with an oversupply of blood. References to the original trilogy in the form of the iconic chainsaw and possessed hand also feature, as does ""that"" iconic scene in the woods. <br/><br/>At 90 minutes the length of the movie is just right- there is never a dull moment, the editing is tight, and the visual effects are extremely believable. This is a horror film for today's generation bred on Saw and Hostel, it has the capability to jolt you from your chair and turn your face away in disgust. However, one thing this remake cannot do is to make you chuckle now and then, like the original did. This is a very serious movie with lots of shock value, but none of the simultaneous feeling of light heartedness, suspense and fear the classic evoked.<br/><br/>To sum up, the 2013 Evil Dead remake is a good horror movie in its own right, which is more of an indictment of the sad state of affairs the genre currently is in. But it is no seminal achievement like the original was. I believe the 70s and 80s produced the best horror, whether it was Italian giallo or standard monster feasts- there was more emotion, fear, a sense of foreboding, less of gore. Now with advances in VFX the gore is more prominent, sometimes all important, while other values get dumped by the wayside. Raimi and Campbell wore producer hats in this, but they could not repeat the ultimate experience in grueling terror once again. The cult classic triumvirate remains intact then. So long, remakes :)"
"mantasmjp","7","2","13","2 July 2013"," Matter of taste
","Thing is,movie style is just like music. Some like country and some like dubstep. Are either of the styles bad? No, there is audience for both. Same goes for this movie. To some it might not be as good as original while to others it might be worth a watch. To some viewers gore is more within realm of reality than a cut off hand running around making noises and showing middle finger. Don't get me wrong i enjoyed Evil Dead 1-2 but i like this one as well.<br/><br/>On to good and bad.<br/><br/>Good: I did like idea about why the group met in the cabin, i think it plays to the audience quite well and character development is quite good. If you have vivid imagination and get invested in movies then you will know what i mean. Effects were pretty good, possessed looked apart and had decent script. Gory parts were realistic to extent. Overall it was quite a ride.<br/><br/>Bad: Quite a few loopholes in the script. Some of the things didn't make much sense. I feel like they could bother some people while others can look past it.<br/><br/>Final thought: Difference in taste of movies and styles within them make this movie 50/50. Some love it some hate it. Either are wrong, it's all about what entertains you. If you enjoy gore and some decent special effects then you will have fun. If you hate gore and like more suspenseful and chilling movie with a smart twist then this is not for you."

","From the start i want to say - I'm obviously an amateur movie critic and only speaking from my experience and impressions.<br/><br/>-And most of the people here differ not much from me ;) So I find it very interesting how many reviews here speak with such an homogeneity and confident terminology .<br/><br/>This movie is a horror movie and to deviate more from the genre - a 21st century splatter / gore - horror movie, with a production strength that surely makes it no indie movie.<br/><br/>And based on this classification,this movie should be judged. Why try and compare it with Alien,Jaws, The Exorcist or the original Evil Dead? It never pretended to be any of these.<br/><br/>Surely it makes use of the original Evil Dead franchise and some references, but it never claims to try to BE the original Evil Dead.<br/><br/>And on the criticism on the acting, storyline, use of cgi and so on. Compared with other movies from the same genre as this one (21st century splatter / gore - horror movie, with a production strength that surely makes it no indie movie, et cetera ;) ) is this movie if you're being honest, pretty solid.<br/><br/>The actors will surely win no Oscars and this was never expected from them, but they fulfill the cause of their casting sufficiently well. Especially Jane Levy, whose acting I really enjoyed. Jessica Lucas and Elizabeth Blackmore are not the deepest characters out there, but considering their playtime, they don't need to be, for their sole fates are to be the first victims of the movie. And based on their cause, playtime and final fate, should you judge the fulfillment of the expectation of depth and acting of the characters - or am I wrong?<br/><br/>The storyline is, what should I say, not the most branching or complex one, but again - it carries it's purpose so that the components of the movie don't fray and fall apart. Which is not difficult with a splatter movie concept that has become very common, originating from the traditional receipt of classics like the original Evil Dead, which this movie is remake/reboot from.<br/><br/>And on the criticism on an overwhelming use of cgi in this movie. Compared with the contemporary use of cgi movies, this movie had a very sparse use of cgi and relied a lot on what people like to call old school splatter movie effects. The cgi that was used, was used strategic and didn't stick out in an annoying manner.<br/><br/>I also liked some parts of the cinematography a lot, it had some very smart shots.<br/><br/>So please be fair to this movie, don't expect more from it than it intends to be and don't jump so easily on the hate train.<br/><br/>If you're out for some new traditional Gothic horror, go watch Guillermo del Toro's "" Mama"" . If you want some psychologically intriguing movie, watch ""Jacob's Ladder"" or "" Into the Void"". For a smart and entertaining story, give ""Seven"" a try. If you're out for crazy experimental stuff check ""Eraserhead"" or ""Tetsuo"". You are more ""old school"" orientated? Watch ""Brain Damage"" or ""Basket Case"" .<br/><br/>What I want to say with this is, there are movies out there for any of your needs and likings, just because a movie doesn't fulfill yours doesn't mean it is bad.<br/><br/>I hope I was helpful and didn't displease anybody with my opinion.<br/><br/>Greetings<br/><br/>Bruce"

Sadly the remake does nothing to differ from that low budget story line which is basically people in a cabin die because someone read an incantation from a book. It is a very forgivable flaw in the original. Not so much for the remake. The only added thing was the gore, really the movie was all about liquid. Water, blood, vomit, and pee was the theme so if you like liquid gore and limb dismemberment than you might like this movie, especially if you don't like plots. Everyone in the film is forgettable to include the demons, this is were the original trumps it, there is no new memorable actor or actress to take the place of Ash and the demons are just like any other evil movie humanoid monster, almost like zombies that are self aware."

","A horror fan's wet dream in term of its graphic violence and excessive gore display, but EVIL DEAD suffers from weak script and mostly forgettable characters.<br/><br/>Okay, if you ask any die-hard horror fans out there, you can bet your answer that the 1983's THE EVIL DEAD was one of the holy grail of all horror genres ever made. So naturally, when the filmmakers first announced the remake was greenlit, (everybody) are skeptical about the result. But before you cried blasphemy, Fede Alvarez's EVIL DEAD remake is surprisingly effective horror movie that will pleased (most) of the original fans as well as newcomers.<br/><br/>First-time feature director Fede Alvarez knows well that a great horror movie doesn't rely on extensive CGI when comes to gore and violence. So what you get here instead is a great deal of practical special and make-up effects that guarantees to make you twitchy or shocked in either ways. Nevertheless all the technical credits are top-notch. As a lead character Mia, Jane Levy delivers an engaging performance worthy of mention here.<br/><br/>Despite its added ""Mia-has-to-overcome-her-heroin habit"" angle, it's a shame that the plot doesn't scratch beyond its surface once the real horror kicks in. Apart from Mia, the rest of the supporting actors are mostly caricatures while Alvarez's choice to play his remake all dead serious rather than the uniquely campy tone set originally by Sam Raimi, is sometimes too depressing for its own good.<br/><br/>The new EVIL DEAD may not have lived up to Sam Raimi's iconic original as well as his 1987 sequel, but at least this is one of the rare horror remakes that doesn't feel like an overrated, cheap knockoff.<br/><br/>http://caseymoviemania.blogspot.com/2013/04/evil-dead-2013.html"

","""The Evil Dead"" was a movie that shocked and scared millions. It was directed by the brilliant Sam Raimi who also directed one of my favorite horror movies: Drag me to Hell. Now some of the producers of the original came back to do a remake.<br/><br/>The Acting: For the most part the acting was pretty good. Jane Levy did a very good job at portraying her drug-riddled character looking for redemption. Shiloh Fernandez really made us believe that he was the BROTHER of Mia. My favorite character by far was Eric played by Lou Taylor Pucci. He had some great one-liners and was a great character until the ""end"".<br/><br/>The Plot: The main plot was about Mia. She has had a drug addiction for a while now, so her friends and brother take her on a ""cleansing"" trip to their cabin. There, they discover the book of the dead which unleashes EVIL.<br/><br/>Did it Scare: To put it simply, NO. It did not scare. The trailer was probably one of the most well made trailers that I've ever seen. The movie however did not live up to it. There were plenty of ""jump-scares"" as well as extremely gory scenes that were just made for people to cringe.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Evil Dead certainly was not as good as the original. However, the acting was decent with a great performance from Jane Levy, an interesting plot twist towards the end,and very impressive CGI. I give it a 6/10."

","Although some comparisons with the original Evil Dead is inevitable, this is not ""the same"" movie. Let's see the main differences: the original was funny this one isn't. Raimi's Dead had charm and has been intentionally made to be unreal in every aspect. This one brings gore to a new level, trying to convince you that it's real (and ""oh, my God, painful). After watching The Cabin in The Woods (which is funny and a masterpiece in it's own category - Joss Whedon movie) I thought there is nothing more to be done in the genre. But, there is. Campbell and Raimi are also involved in this ""remake"" (intentionally in quotation marks to point out that this mainly isn't a remake :) and it shows occasionally with just a slight touch. Mr. Alvarez did not fall into a classic same- movie-larger-budget-lots-of-CGI trap. This is rather his interpretation of a classic (see Whedon) scheme but a good one (although not as good as Mr. Whedon's or Mr. Raimi's. Cast is good, camera just as it should be to avoid repeating Raimi's original approach and still remain rather suggestive. Music also. Directing and editing just right. This movie has everything for a horror lover to enjoy. So, please do :)"
"fxdx4","8","2","14","3 July 2013"," Having not seen the original...
","This movie is a re-make of the '81 Evil Dead, and falls into the classic re-make trap. It uses the original name to get people to watch, then disappoints them all by not being the original. The 2nd inevitable problem is the director has to do SOMETHING different to bring something new to the film, which almost always fails. This almost always leaves the audience asking what the point of it all was.<br/><br/>With that said, if you take this movie on its own, it is pretty solid. Jane Levy (Suburgatory) is charismatic, even given her very limited screen time as an unpossessed human. The premise is about as unoriginal as you can get (remembering the original is almost a spoof that makes sense), but satisfying. The gore is prolific. The 'ohh my God that is so dumb"", parts are present, but mostly ignorable.<br/><br/>Without ever seeing the movie you could tell me the plot, possessed daemons, mutilations, attempts at survival, chase scenes. Like in most horror movies, the first 1/2 is way better than the second 1/2. It falls into the 'monster chasing people around for 40 minutes' trap near the end, which makes it a lot less scary.<br/><br/>If you are reading this review, you are not looking for Oscar caliber movies, you want gore, cheap thrills and a satisfying conclusion. This movie gives you that. Ignore the title of the movie, call it, ""Cabin in the Woods""; wait... err, call it ""Daemon Cabin"". Forget the original and enjoy the carnage."

","This movie was as good as I was hoping. From the start it paid homage to the original with the way it was shot, the cabin was almost the same in the way it was set as the original, and having the old car from the first film was a great addition too. Now I know a lot of ""traditionalists"" won't like it because its a reboot, but as some of you may know, I like a good remake/reboot, and this film for me was right up there with 'Maniac' and 'Dawn of the Dead'. I did like the characters, even though there was no Ash, but according to those in the know, this film is meant to be a sequel more than a reboot (and now people will be arguing that fact), so it makes sense that there was no character called Ash. As for the violence and gore, I LOVED it! There was plenty of it, and some of the scenes had me cringing. Loved that. The only part that annoyed me about this movie was the >> SPOILER ALERT << part where the book reads, ""DO NOT READ"", yet the guy does it any way. Why do people do the opposite all the bloody time?! Anyway, the film was very good in my opinion and for that reason I give it a solid 8.5 out of 10."

On the one hand has this formula not been used in a major horror-flick for a while and I find it more entertaining than the all the torture porn we have been getting for the last years. But the movie is not much more than a standard 70's horror-flick.<br/><br/>However this is the best looking and best shot 70's horror-flick I have ever seen and it also doesn't heard that the gore-factor is put to the max.

The simple storyline is full of shock effects and ultra violent gore scenes that give you the creeps and make you want to look away.

","Well, I suppose it was worth the money to see it. Very good visual movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>There were multiple problems though throughout.<br/><br/>Scary? Not at all. I went into the movie fully expecting to jump at least a good two times. The tagline is ""The most terrifying movie you will ever experience"". So why wasn't it scary? Creepy is another thing. Every demon in the movie looked downright freaky and creepy. But that doesn't matter when they don't do anything to build quality suspense or cause a jump scare. This wasn't necessarily one of those movies where I'd be all like ""and the (enter ghost, demon, monster, etc.) is gonna pop up in 3, 2, 1... It wasn't THAT predictable, but it was somewhat, and that annoys me.<br/><br/>I suppose the acting was okay, nothing really great though, but nothing really bad. That's kind of typical in horror movies though I guess.<br/><br/>One thing that REALLY bothered me throughout the movie though, is that I didn't give one single crap about any of the characters, except maybe the guy with the long hair (the one who opened the book), and that was only because he kept living when he should have died early. The main character, Mia, was a possessed demon for a majority of the movie. The thing is: I didn't care. I couldn't have cared any less if she just died in the movie, I mean seriously. The characters were not at all built up in a way that any could be loved or cherished.<br/><br/>Now onto some more things I did like.<br/><br/>The gore. While I thought a little too much was put into the film, all of it was well done. It looked real, some of it even put an uncomfortable look on my face due to it's realism.<br/><br/>Music was good too. Not much to say.<br/><br/>Things that need to be revised.<br/><br/>Length. This movie just felt ridiculously short. 91 minutes? It felt like an hour. I've watched movies twice as long. Ever see Titanic?<br/><br/>The very ending. It must not have been good because I can't even remember what happened right before the credits. I literally can't even remember.<br/><br/>While I've never seen the original ""The Evil Dead"" directed by Sam Raimi, I'm sure it has a good chance of being better than this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, average movie, yet better than Woman in Black or Mama or other dumb horror movies."
"ajhuenink","6","2","14","11 April 2013"," Mediocre Horror Film with a Legendary Title
","Evil Dead was a mediocre horror film sporting a legendary title. Legions of fan-boys demanded, hallucinated, or expected a remake of The Evil Dead. I, admittedly, have a hint of the The Evil Dead fanboyism in my veins; I admired the low-budget efforts of the original, reveled in dark horror / comedy of the second, and was amused by Army of Darkness.<br/><br/>I was immediately disheartened with the character development of the film. Character development in horror movies shouldn't extend much beyond examining a characters reactions to horrific events. Learning about childhood memories, lost lovers, dead parents simply warns us that someone is going to die. The original Evil Dead developed a slow yet ever constant feeling of unease; you felt as if someone was about to snap at any moment. The remake conveniently uses the excuse of drug withdrawal to force the kids to remain at the cabin despite strange things happening. Then, suddenly, bam! Possession! People are hacking each other to bits.<br/><br/>The attention to gore and brutal scenes were a hallmark of the original, but it was well-prefaced with foreboding and unease. I found myself having little compassion for the characters and was unfazed by the sudden emergence of self-mutilation and violent possessions.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the movie lost me after Mia was buried. Her return and defeat of the risen one found me out of believability. Obviously, this movie isn't realistic, but a dual syringe cattle-prod defibrillator revive-o-matic with car battery? When she rose I hoped she was still possessed. Also, the hippy-stoner who wasn't high and had an odd interest in the occult was just a little off-putting.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the setting in the woods. I enjoyed the painful, brutal scenes for their reminders of the original. I didn't enjoy the new characters, the plot hook, nor the pacing of the movie. Bruce Campbell's 'Groovy' was my favorite part of the movie. 6.0 of 10.0."

","Being quite a fan of the first three ""Evil Dead"" films, it easily became apparent to me how frustratingly different this version was. But let's stray from that path of depression 'cause the truth is, if this was a horror film without having a cult classic descendant, it is arguably a good film. It has the goodness that makes a conventional horror film work: it's dark, gory, creepy and at times compelling.<br/><br/>Just like ""The Evil Dead,"" this version is heavy on brutality, blood and gore, which was all-the-way efficient. It also has the irony of it when there's a scene in the film where it actually rains with blood. It easily reminds of how much of an explosive bloodbath this franchise has been especially the first and original film. Where tons of blood gets splashed all over someone's face not to mention the extreme violence which consists of dismemberment, decapitation, hacking, smashing and all of its gory variations. It's so over-the- top that you're more likely love it than hate it and might even get you laughing hard at one point.<br/><br/>The film has a strikingly sharp and stylish look. It automatically builds a dark and creepy atmosphere. Unlike the original, the film takes place during a wet rainy season in what seem like a dead swamp with a connection road filled with water and completely dysfunctional when the tide peaks. The old, dusty cabin has a look that is entirely creepy and that visual feeling that something reeks in it. The woods are entirely covered with fog and filled with dead trees and mud. All that elements perfectly create a threatening and unsettling atmosphere that fits well in the film. It makes the exterior shots look remarkable and just appropriate to build a dark creeping terror. The make-up and special effects of the film were just excellent. The make-up effects combined with CGI for touch-ups to impress an improved look that on the possessed characters leave an edge of authenticity. Its special effects also, in every form of its gruesome employment, have weight and texture that its look on- screen is effectively translated.<br/><br/>""Evil Dead,"" in my opinion delivers the goods but not in the same category its previous films were known for. The previous ""Evil Dead films"" are geniuses in giving utter satisfaction, those rare horror films that managed to harmoniously blend humor, gore and scares into one package. There are flaws and it's kinda amateurish and cheap to look at but that's all part of the charm. The new version, however took a different path, being darker and more ingeniously violent and graphic with an odd mood of sadness. Well, what's done's been done and my final say is that this film is good just how conventional horror films could be. It's not exactly the type that would follow a cult sensation like its predecessors but it's an honorable tribute rather. It's a stylish and striking exposition of gore, violence, creep and atmosphere."

I thought the actors were all good, and the movie had better cast than Army of Darkness. I think they did very good jobs when they played possessed characters. Of course, it can't be better than the original or Evil Dead II, but I liked it better than Army of Darkness.

"masonmorgan-92917","7","1","5","18 December 2016"," A decent horror flick, but not a true Evil Dead movie
","Fede Alvarez's Evil Dead ""remake"" is a decent horror flick in it's own merit, but really lacked the qualities that made the previous Evil Dead entries such classics. After hearing that Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell themselves are producers, I had high hopes that this ""remake"" was going to be a ton of fun, just like the last entries in the series. Sadly, I was surprisingly disappointed as Evil Dead (2013) wasn't nearly as fun as it should've been. This entry in the franchise made the fatal mistake that all entries before it have managed to avoid. It made the mistake of taking itself seriously. <br/><br/>This may seem like an odd complaint, but if you are a fan of the original Evil Dead films like I am, you must understand what I mean. The original films weren't full-on horror movies, but arguably the best horror-comedy films ever made. They perfectly blended wacky humor with low-budget, yet extremely graphic, special effects gore. This created one of the most unique horror experiences in history as it's cult status remains solidified to this day. Evil Dead (2013), however, decided to take an entirely different route and go with full-on horror with virtually no wacky humor. There was still plenty of awesome practical effects violence, but the lack of humor and lighthearted fun made this a disappointing, and frankly unnecessary, entry to the beloved series.<br/><br/>Now it should be said that Evil Dead (2013) is certainly not for the faint of heart. It is by far the most brutally violent film I have ever seen. 90% of the violence in this film is practical effects, even further adding to the grueling and gut-churning ultra-violence. Despite it being incredibly sickening at times, it is truly impressive. The violence had a constant feeling of realism as all of the practical effects utilized are absolutely phenomenal. While it was, at times, shockingly graphic, I had a hard time looking away as the special effects work was so beautifully executed. Even the most bold and bombastic scenes of violence looked immensely realistic. I was very happy to see that Raimi and Campbell were sticking to the roots of their classic Evil Dead entries and fully realizing their potential for practical effects.<br/><br/>While Evil Dead (2013) is incredibly violent, it doesn't maintain the originality that the earlier franchise entries set before it. Even with the impressive special effects, we only really have an average horror movie. Without the humor and goofy fun of the originals, there wasn't a lot interesting or unique about this remake. However, the final act of Evil Dead (2013) feels like a love-letter to all the fans as we are treated to one of the greatest sequences of the entire franchise, the rise of the Abomination. <br/><br/>The Abomination itself sadly isn't too impressive as it mostly just looks like a slightly different standard Deadite. Despite the somewhat disappointing Abomination, this final set piece and grueling battle is such gleeful fun that it is reminiscent of the originals. Here we see what true Evil Dead is as the sky begins to rain buckets of blood and the Abomination rises from Hell. With mind-blowing amounts of blood drenching the landscape and the old cabin burning in the background, this final sequence is among my favorites of the entire series, all topped off with a goose-bump inducing visual of female Ash sending the Abomination back to Hell. It was hard not to smile when we finally got to see Raimi's and Campbell's full influence on the film.<br/><br/>Overall, Evil Dead (2013) is a decent horror flick but it never earned the right to become a true Evil Dead movie. It lacked all the qualities that separates Evil Dead from every other horror film out there, making this ""remake"" pretty unnecessary. The practical effects where undoubtedly incredible, but it always took itself way too seriously, which is something a true Evil Dead film would never do. And sorry Ash, but that after-credits sequence didn't make me like this film any more, but rather made me want to watch the other ones instead, which is ultimately what I would recommend anyways."

Classics are ""unreviewable"". When a movie falls into that cult territory, you can't review it anymore: it's a classic. Same situation would be to review Mr. Romero's ""of the Dead"" series. They are all classics, with their faults, but they are classics. At least, they are watchable at its finest.<br/><br/>I first was introduced to this movie as it being a remake from the original Evil Dead (1981 - ""ED-81"", for short); and I watched it expecting that. Oh, boy...<br/><br/>When it ended, I was like: ""what the... did I just watch!?"". It's a mess! Iconical character Ash was absent, though David is the modern impersonation of Ash; the plot is similar to the original ED-81 with some modifications; remarkable scenes from ED-81 was absent as well. Basically, I'd go on saying that they remade the ED-81 focusing only on the gore and graphical part and, at the end, they put some dark humor onto it and thought it was OK. I was in shock!<br/><br/>Then I did some digging. I found out that this is, indeed, a ""remake"" of the ED-81, but it's also a new entry to the Evil Dead series! It's as if they used the same plot with some slight modifications from the ED-81, but the events happens canonical to the Evil Dead series, meaning that, though the things happening to the characters from this movie are pretty much the same that happened to the ones in ED-81, this is a whole new event that's happening, adding to the series storyline. Whoah..!<br/><br/>Funny, right? Why not make a whole new movie instead!? Money is the answer. They knew people who are familiar to the series would go crazy to watch this.<br/><br/>Overall, I think the movie was OK. It's kinda confusing to figure what they were thinking: they entered a serious road, focusing on the horror aspect, but then, at the end, they went down the dark comedy section, similar to the ED-81 take -- but you can't forget this isn't just a remake, it's like this is Evil Dead 3 (Army of Darkness is a different approach). Messy... messy...<br/><br/>Newcomers will get entertained, I think. It's the same old horror stuff. Veterans might get kinda mad, I don't know. I think they could've done a whole brand new entry to the series, not a ""remake"" of the ED-81 but also adding to the series storyline. That's convoluted.<br/><br/>Watch it at your own risk."

","The Evil Dead is about 5 twenty-somethings who take a trip to a cabin in the woods where two siblings - Mia and David - used to spend their time growing up. Not long after arriving, the group discover an old witch-craft book called the Book of the Dead, but one of the group members unknowingly brings an evil demon to life after reading from the book, so it's not long before all hell starts to break loose.<br/><br/>Now, I know that the film industry has come a long way since 1981 (when the original was made), but let's be honest - the original is a camp, low-budget flick with just a few scares which is cheesier than a cheddar factory. Whether that was intentional or not, I don't know, but when you read what a movie's about and has the title Evil Dead then this new version is what I'd be expecting...not the Edam one. I've never understood why the original gets such rave reviews as it's just a bad-acted, mediocre film.<br/><br/>Anyway, enough about the crappy original and onto this much better version. This one is extremely dark and is most definitely not for the squeamish. There are a few scenes that will definitely make you flinch & feel uneasy and for one of these scenes all I'll say is ""tongue"" and ""knife"". It's obvious the makers of this version wanted to go with unsettling, gory and relentless instead of laughable, badly-acted and boring and credit to them for doing that.<br/><br/>The make-up was fantastic, as were the visual effects. It may be sometimes obvious or predictable on what is going to happen at times, but the vast majority of these of horrors are, and if you're let down by some predictability in a horror movie like this then you're pretty naive.<br/><br/>I actually really enjoyed this version. We know it was never going to be a Hollywood Oscar-winner or an all-time ""classic"", but just watch it for what it is...a very gory, squeamish - and sometimes unsettling - horror film. Ignore the original and go with this one instead as it's much better."

The films revolve around the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, an ancient Sumerian text which wreaks havoc upon a group of cabin inhabitants in a wooded area in Tennessee. The protagonist, Ashley J. ""Ash"" Williams (Bruce Campbell) is the only character to appear in every installment of the original trilogy (Linda, Ash's girlfriend makes an appearance in all 3 films, but her only appearance in Army of Darkness is during the prologue). The original trilogy includes The Evil Dead (1981), Evil Dead II (1987), and Army of Darkness (1992), all written and directed by Raimi, produced by Robert G. Tapert, and starring Campbell. The franchise has since expanded into other formats such as video games and comic books, and a musical opened in Toronto in 2003 containing material from all three films."
"phoenixyk1","7","1","5","5 September 2014"," A good reboot...
","When I first heard they were going to do a remake... I was worried...<br/><br/>I need not have been - While the film loses much of the Classic and misses much of what made the original Sam Raimi Classic such a hit, it also does a great job of paying homage to the great man!<br/><br/>The film has lost its dark humor, and tries to be a very serious film... Some aspects work great - At least there is a plausible reason for them to be at the cabin for instance.<br/><br/>Other parts do not work so well... The film focuses of trying to squeeze in as much action as possible, so lacks some character development - Then again, the original lacked character development while focusing more on the story...<br/><br/>While it will never beat the original - It stands well as a great film!"
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","5","28 July 2014"," Pretty good for a remake
","I have to say, starting out, that Sam Raimi's original EVIL DEAD trilogy has been a favourite of mine ever since I saw it as a teenager. While EVIL DEAD 2 was the best of the three films, for me, a pitch-perfect comedy/horror, and ARMY OF DARKNESS was a funny, cheesy comedy, the first film was a gruelling terror flick made on a teensy budget...and it worked. Everything about it gelled, and it remains effective to this day, despite the cheesiness of the low-budget effects work.<br/><br/>This remake thankfully changes things around a bit story-wise, so that even the many fans of the original movie will find themselves guessing as to what's about to happen next. It's a film made very much in the spirit of the first film, and that makes it pretty good for a remake. The same suspense is there, the pulse-pounding question of who's going to be affected next by the curse, while at the same time it's given some Hollywood slickness to offset the original's grubby, zero-budget charm.<br/><br/>And, perhaps most surprisingly of all, the gore quota has been ramped up considerably. This is one of the most extremely vicious and nasty films I've seen in a long time, in which the various set-pieces of gore are difficult to watch; let's just say that the chainsaw stuff hinted at back in the 1980s is shown in full force here. Production values are more than adequate and the cast are pretty good, too. Is this as good as the original? No, it lacks the genuine fright-factor even if the ickiness is there...but at the same time it won't disappoint modern horror fans with its blend of demonic possession and outrageous violence."

","This Evil Dead movie was my first R-rated horror experience I ever had in theaters, and it was a great one. It had tons of gore, a couple of good scares, and more gore. Let's start with the movie's pluses.<br/><br/>First of all, I was quite impressed at the intelligence of the characters. They had a good reason not believe in Mia's assertion of a demon because she is a recovering heroin addict and had tried to leave rehab by hurting herself and going home. Although I think the characters may have not picked up quick enough the fact that it might have not been withdrawal that was making her eyes turn yellow and speak in a demonic voice. It was also a pretty well-acted film with only five characters carrying the majority of the film. They weren't great great, but they were above average, which is saying a lot considering it's a horror remake (or more of a re-imagining, due to it not being the same characters). That takes me to my next praise, the certain nods to the original. For example, the character Natalie's arm gets infected from a bite by a possessed Mia. To stop the infection from spreading any further, she slices her arm off with an electric knife, just like how Ash cuts his possessed hand off with a chainsaw in Evil Dead II. Another treat is near the end where Mia, now no longer possessed and the sole survivor of the group, loses her left hand and replaces it with a chainsaw to kill the abomination that has risen from the ground. One more treat is after the credits, but it's so short that I dare not spoil it. The scares that weren't from massive gore were mostly standard ones but some of them were actually pretty creative. There were some scenes that actually made me cringe like Eric, that guy with the glasses, pulling a needle from his eye and Mia getting her knee slowly slit by a machete. Now on to the bad parts of the film. <br/><br/>This movie was nowhere near perfect, but my complaints could be considered mere nitpicks. The characters find the necronomicon in the basement of the cabin they are staying in wrapped in barbed wire. If the previous people didn't want it opened, why didn't they bury it? Or doing anything other than leaving it in the open. The necronomicon lists the number of events that occur after a demon has possessed a soul and Eric realizes this. So why didn't they, or at least he, look at the later parts of the book to anticipate and hopefully prevent the later things from happening? The rest I list are inconsistencies, like how a when possessed Natalie (yeah, I guess slicing her arm off didn't help stop the infection) gets her other arm blown off she becomes unpossessed and questions why her nail covered face hurts, and dies. Showing how becoming unpossessed doesn't heal any injuries, when a possessed Mia creepily licks a box cutter and slices her tongue in half, how in the hell can she talk? Also, when Mia first becomes possessed Olivia claims that she gave her enough sedatives to put a horse to sleep, yet she is still awake. But near the climax of the film David is able to put the possessed Mia to sleep with just one dose of the sedative. On a side note, did none of them have cellphones? <br/><br/>Either way, I think that thisfilm was a great watch especially with friends."
"hells_angel_gurly_gurl","9","1","5","10 January 2014"," Wow, people should really know what they're talking about before the post a review!
","First of all, I have to say that I really liked this movie. Even after watching it multiple times, I still find myself needing 2 stare @ the screen when it's on. I also have to say that I'm a huge fan of Bruce Campbell & the Evil Dead movies. I own all three (Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2, & Army of Darkness... Which the latter has been 1 of my fave movies since I was little). Anyway, I'm VERY picky with movies & this is not even close to being a bad movie!<br/><br/>For all the people saying that it's not Evil Dead for a number of reasons, know what you're b!+ching about! I've seen so many claim to be fans of the franchise but then they are rambling about how this remake has no humor. I say to you, go back and watch the original. It didn't have blatant humor in it... Parts may have been funny cuz Bruce's overacting or cuz of cheesy effects, but it was meant to be serious. That's what this new 1 was trying to recreate... The humor didn't come into Evil Dead until the 2nd movie.<br/><br/>For the people who say its nothing like the original cuz they don't like the plot, what do u want? For them to remake it word for word and action for action... What would be the point of that?! I know some say there is no plot, but I don't get that... Every movie has a plot! Just cuz u don't understand it or see it, doesn't mean it's not there or that it isn't good. There may be some holes and some stupid, unrealistic decisions made... But isn't that what makes a horror movie a horror movie? If they didn't do the stupid things the movie would only be 5 minutes long! Oh, look... There's a girl being chased by a murderer and she's running out the door instead of up the stairs and she gets away to the police and he gets arrested... The end! Sound good? I don't think so...<br/><br/>And the people complaining about no Ash... Get over it! Jane Levy did an awesome job in her role of Mia and is a great new 'Ash'. Besides you never know what the ending leads up to... Maybe there will be another where while Mia is trying to leave the cabin, she gets sucked into another place like the end of Evil Dead 2? Maybe she'll meet up with the real Ash and they'll kick demon ass together! And as far as the other characters, the only 1 I didn't like was Olivia, but that doesn't mean her acting was bad. I think some people just don't like certain characters in movies and just decide its cuz of bad acting.<br/><br/>This movie does have tons of blood, gore, and violence, but I will agree it's not scary. No movie ever actually scares me and I can tell that this movie wasn't intended to be that scary. It's suspenseful, grotesque, exciting, and made me cringe. That's what I like in a horror movie and I think that's what they wanted it to be cuz that how the original was.<br/><br/>What makes people think that they know everything about movies and how they should be. You try making what u think is a good horror flick and see what people say about it. People will always have negative things to say about everything... But to post to millions of people that the director, Bruce, and Sam Raimi are stupid cuz of this movie that you clearly don't get is rude, obnoxious, disrespectful, and just plain idiotic!<br/><br/>Again, know what you're talking about before you run your mouth on the World Wide Web... Cuz when you don't, you just look stupid!<br/><br/>This movie is great, if you can handle possession, gore, tons of blood, and truly like the original Evil Dead... This should be a good choice if you keep your mind open to how it's interpreted to fit the 21st century. The only reason it got a 9 instead of 10 is cuz it could have been a tiny bit better. Maybe finding the tapes from the original (which do play during the credits) or if the necrocomicon had been more like the original it would have got a 10. But I don't really see it as a remake... More of a distant sequel where it's the same cabin from the original and it's years later with different people."
"andrewbarry6336","9","1","5","25 November 2013"," Great Movie, Better than the Original
","I like the original Evil Dead and its sequel. I didn't watch Army of Darkness though so I can not comment on that one. Honestly I prefer the second one because the original wasn't very interesting to me. This remake is a great movie and if it had any other title it would have gotten more love. This is a serious take on Evil Dead and I love the result.<br/><br/>This time around our group of friends go to a remote cabin to help their friend Mia kick a heroin addiction. It makes for a nice set up. Soon they find a door leading to a basement and a weird book. After one of the friends gets curious and chants a prayer all hell breaks loose literally. While their are nods to the original, this is its own movie which means if you loved the original you might not like this one. Just stay with an open mind.<br/><br/>When it comes to remakes or reboots I tend to not compare it to its predecessors because usually there is a difference in the times and everything else. I am not saying I don't compare the movies but I tend to judge it based off its own merits. This movie created a separate universe based around the same book. It is gory and fun and never lets up. I give it 4 outta 5. Loved it and wont stop loving it. Waiting on the sequel!"
"AGood","5","1","5","15 September 2013"," Average, or better put boring and tedious
","I very rarely review movies. I think I have only reviewed two. And I just felt a need to give my point of view on this movie. It was poor. I am a major Evil Dead fan. Of the first two (given that two is also just a remake of one) I much prefer the scares and seriousness of the original over the equally great but in a very different way camp fun-fest of the sequel. Like everyone I was looking forward immensely to Evil Dead's remake. I was planning on seeing it at the cinema until the reviews on here started popping up. So I never. I also never wanted to see it on Blu-Ray as the reviews were so bad. But someone at work said ignore the reviews and it is great old school horror and the people who disliked it on here would be the people loving the funfest of the sequel and Ash whereas this one is serious like the first one. So I rented it out from Blockbusters.<br/><br/>And I have to say I did not enjoy it at all. I found it boring, slow and tedious. Even when the action started it was still slow and tedious. The pluses are it starts off with a good opening in the first 10 mins. The who I thought would be lead girl Mia is truly gorgeous, and her story and plight of getting over her drug addiction seemed interesting so I said to myself at the start of the movie I hope she is not one of the one who gets killed off or turns into a demon. But she turns out to be the first one leaving a bunch of dead-weights left.<br/><br/>Now the problems it is so tedious. After she gets possessed it takes something that felt like 20 mins for her to show it. In the original it was one of the biggest scares where they are playing guess the card and she suddenly knew them all and then suddenly 'demoned out'. In this it is a slow drawn out process of slow decay. It literally made me say 'oh just get on with it' And when she finally turned out possessed I was not shocked, or scared I was saying, ""finally"". The thing also is there is also a continuity thing, as the second girl in comparison to the first seems to get possessed and demons out in minutes.<br/><br/>Another problem none of the characters, bar Mia, were at all interesting and like I say she was out of action from half way in.<br/><br/>The demon murders were unsatisfying. The entire film was demons attacking them, everyone refusing to fight back. Then them saying they will fight back and the demons every time reverted back to human form and each and every time they just gave up to get the same, we are not human scare come back.<br/><br/>For a good portion of the movie I had it on fast forward just so I can say I have watched it. This is something I never ever do.<br/><br/>Its a very poor movie and would recommend everyone gives it a miss. For closing I will say last night I watched No One Lives which is another movie getting mixed reviews and this film blew me away. That is how to make a good siege based horror movie. That film was epic. Rent that instead of this, trust me."
"Eurico_Lopes","5","1","5","8 September 2013"," Evil Dead (1981) vs Evil Dead (2013)
","The most positive thing about the movie is that they did not attempt to replace or create a character like Ash (Bruce Campbell), and basically tried to introduce Evil Dead to new generations. i.e. its not a remake!<br/><br/>It's just a different take on the Evil Dead franchise, personally, I prefer the the Campbell franchise. Although entertaining enough, it wont be a classic like the others...<br/><br/>With a bit work, think it could get much better...so I would not mind seeing another attempt on the franchise in coming years.<br/><br/>-<br/><br/>There is no such thing as bad movies. Some are just more forgetful than others...nonetheless, they fit their purpose: they entertain!"
"billcr12","5","1","5","6 July 2013"," Average Horror Movie
","I saw the original Evil Dead over thirty years ago and I don't remember much about it. Sam Raimi went on to much bigger things afterwards, so my review is based on the remake. It all begins with a girl being abducted and then burned like Joan of Arc to somehow save the world from evil spirits. Flash ahead and three college age girls and two boys arrive at a cabin in the woods for very dubious reasons, other than a brother and sister are there for the girl to rehab from a bad drug overdose. Of course bad things happen to the former junkie, including possession looking something like Linda Blair's in the Exorcist. We get a human skin bound book of the dead which will bring forth the bad spirits, and the usual severed body limbs, with a nail gun and chain saw put to interesting use. I have seen better and I have seen worse horror movies, and Evil Dead is a very average 5/10."
"bfrosty515","9","4","45","6 April 2013"," Nothing can touch your nostalgia
","I must first say I was entertained, and isn't that really all that matters in the end? It certainly isn't perfect. I don't understand why people think a remake can ever top the original. It happens from time to time, but that's rare. Nothing can touch your nostalgia. So you got to just take these for what they are. <br/><br/>I think any issues I have with this movie (missing scenes!) can be easily solved with an extended unrated cut. So I will reserve my final judgment on the film until I see more.<br/><br/>I would certainly go see this movie again, but would save money on a matinée."
"theordinaryreview","9","2","16","10 July 2013"," A relentless demonic assault and a bloody good remake.
","I was absolutely excited to see this movie! Evil Dead (1981) and Evil Dead (1987) are some of the absolute best horror movies and of course some of my favorites. I tend to be really cautious about remakes because, honestly, most of them are just trying to make money on old cult classics. Somehow, this one seemed to stir up very good criticism and every though I shy away from spoilers, I read a few reviews and got excited. Another reason I was excited was because it features Lou Taylor Pucci who was amazing in pretty much everything I saw with him, like the adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' The Informers (2008).<br/><br/>In this film, five friends decide to spend the holidays at a cabin that belongs to the siblings Mia and David. Mia went through a difficult period and her friends are trying to have her quit her drug usage. David has been distant from her through her drug issues will try his best to make up for it. As Mia's cold turkey's regime starts, she smells dead meat but her friends dismiss it as withdrawal symptoms. Soon enough however, they discover a trap under the cabin. The exploration of it will prove gruesome as they find a burnt place with tons of dead cats strung in barbwire hanging from the ceiling. They also retrieve a well sealed book, which curiosity will have Eric open. He reads it out loud and releases the demon out of the book of the dead, the Necronomicon.<br/><br/>Bloody fantastic! That was my reaction when the film was over. Groovy! Could have been an alternative. As I said, I am always wary of remakes but this is easily the best modern horror remake I've seen. It started off very well with some clear references to the old movies: the cabin looks exactly the same, Mia sits on the same car that they had in the first movie, the trees are menacing, the chainsaw, the trap... Those references always give bonus points to a remake in my book.<br/><br/>The Necronomicon is really well made. The demons are pure evil and their trash talking is joy: I missed the ""I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul, I'll swallow your soul.... - Swallow this"" quote but the clear references made it all good.<br/><br/>Sadly, none of the actors or actresses have the charisma of Ash (Bruce Campbell). I was also annoyed at the way they used withdrawal symptoms to discredit the first signs of demonic possession as well as the nurse who thinks she's got everything under control. This was however a lesser evil, literally, as the movie unfolded in a scream fest of blood and mutilated members. You know you'll get what's coming when you see them use a nail gun or an electric meat cutter.<br/><br/>The graphics and gore were pretty good and the relatively low use of CGI was very welcomed. As is common in horror movies, the sounds and music played a great part in building up the scare effect and Roque Baños (of The Machinist (2004) fame) does a fantastic job again.<br/><br/>However, I think this is the kind of movie that you shouldn't show to minors but that's a good thing for us and them. Despite suffering from a few flaws common to the modern horror genre, it pleased me to the utmost.<br/><br/>I liked: Evil. Bloody. Gore. Knows what was good in the film it's based upon.<br/><br/>I disliked: The know-it-all nurse, the hopeless junkie and the blonde. The female characters and acting suffered the comparison to their male counterparts.<br/><br/>90/100 It's evil but it won't stay dead. A relentless demonic assault and a bloody good remake.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.theordinaryreview.blogspot.com"

However it is missing the grit, fun, dedication and pure knowing camp that turned the first Evil Dead into such a beloved cult hit.<br/><br/>Most of today's horror films ""fail"" because they have become too self aware and condescending. This movie does not go in that direction, while it is a ""serious"" film, it is not overtly so. These are just people trying to help their friend. It is a weirdly wholesome movie as it is missing a lot of the horror trappings like sex, nudity, drinking, etc. At the end of the day, at least Mia's clean.."

"stickbob123","8","1","7","9 December 2014"," As Impressive as it is Disgusting
","The plot very simply centers around a group of friends who isolate themselves in a cabin in the woods in order to help one of them quite heroin cold turkey. When one of them finds an ancient book of evil and reads a few passages, though, things turn ugly. Real ugly. Demon ugly. They start getting possessed and turning on one another. General horror ensues.<br/><br/>Formulaic, yes, but wow--what a movie. This reboot takes what was slightly amusing about the original and makes it downright terrifying. It's semi-predictable and the guy who plays one of the main characters, David, is freaking terrible, but it's a fast, intense ride from start to finish that's debatabely one of the best horrors of the decade. <br/><br/>I'm tempted to call this movie a ""guilty pleasure,"" but no--I stand by this movie and feel no guilt for endorsing it. Yes, the gore is absolutely appalling and stomach-churning, and yes it was admittedly predictable, but this movie holds SO much merit.<br/><br/>Let's start with Jane Levy playing Mia. She delivers the best performance in a horror movie like this in recent memory, coming close to Marilyn Burns in ""Texas Chain Saw Massacre."" She absolutely nails it. And she came out of freaking nowhere. This is her third movie and she's just incredible. Now this isn't an impressive monologue sort of acting job or a wide range of emotions kind of thing--a horror movie like this is almost purely physical acting. She sprints, dives, crawls, and stabs her way across the screen and she does it with appropriately unrepressed terror. And that terror is infectious, transferring right through the screen into the audience. <br/><br/>Next, the effects. Most of the time these days, a movie monster ends up being a CGI blob whirring across the screen (i.e. ""Mama""). I thought the days of practical effects were over, especially in the horror genre, but then I saw this. It only uses CGI to touch up scenes and remove cables and such and it totally pays off. I don't usually like buckets of blood in horror movies, and while I still stand by psychological horror more than slashers, this level of shock deserves some kind of attention. It is so in-your-face disgusting because, like fight scenes in ""The Raid,"" it is filmed with the utmost clarity and the actors know how to respond to it because it's actually in front of them instead of being added in post. If you can manage to keep your eyes on the screen while a girl cuts her tongue in half with a box-cutter, you'll see what I mean. Yeah, it's freaking disgusting and borderline sadistic, but this is old school, passionate horror. <br/><br/>Next, Mia's storyline is way more complex than it needed to be and that's totally OK with me. You could legitimately view this entire movie as an alle(gore)ical tale for battling drug addiction. This whole layer of the movie is totally unnecessary, but, if you're into that kind of thing, much appreciated.<br/><br/>Lastly--I can not fathom the amount of fans of the original who disliked this movie. A lot of the complaints I'm seeing is that the acting is bad, the violence is sadistic, and Ash isn't in it anymore. First off, the acting in the original is absolutely awful--and I understand that it's supposed to be a joke for the most part, but trashing the new one for that is hypocritical. Now the violence--the only reason the original wasn't more violent is because they didn't have the budget to make it so. The original contains a possessed woman being hacked into like seven pieces and then flopping around and the only reason it happens off screen, is because the effects would have been too complicated for them to show on screen. If anything, the reboot is equally as sadistic, but more fully realized. And Ash. He was a man of his times, he really was. If they tried to put a character like him into a modern movie, it never would have worked. A man's man, funny 70s action hero thrust into a horror movie. Yes, it was funny, but why try to recreate it? He had his time and trying to rehash that would have only resulted in more fan-boys whining that they didn't get it right."

","The first time i watched this, i was heavily comparing it to the original. I was looking out for similarities, expecting certain things to happen,etc. Even then, i thought it was 7/10. I thought the acting was quite good, certainly not ""abysmal"" as some have stated. There is just enough character development for this type of movie. We don't need too much info, just a bit of background for the characters to work with. This is supposed to be ""The ultimate experience in Grueling Terror"" and it delivers on that promise. I'm surprised this movie managed an ""R"" rating. While there are some torture aspects, it is mainly gore and much of it is so over the top those with a sense of humor will get a few laughs out it - for instance, touching dialog from a character dripping blood from missing appendages.<br/><br/>Upon the second viewing, I really was able to kick back and enjoy this movie for what it is - An over the top horror and gore fest with very well done effects. The final scene is somewhat unexpected and is the cherry on top, pushing the movie up to a 9 for me. Remember, this is horror, not ""Forest Gump"". The film succeeds in what it sets out to be - ""the ultimate experience in grueling terror"". Can't think of any recent movies that matched this on that level."

","The triumphant return to real modern horror.<br/><br/>Technically it may be wrong to consider a ""remake"" modern horror considering it is generally just retelling an old story but for me ""Evil Dead"" 2013 is as original a horror story for this generation as the ""Evil Dead"" 1981 film was for my generation. The characters were new, the story was new-ish, actually the only things that were the same were the cabin, the evil dead and the chainsaw. Aside from that this remake is pretty much it's own little beast. I am not going to compare the 2013 remake with the original because hands down the original will win out! Because it was the original! Hell I have movies from the 80's that the minute I realized it was a remake of a 50's film or a 30's classic I immediately clung to the original as a better pick. I have never seen a remake that was better than the original. So with that said Here is what I thought of ""Evil Dead"" 2013.<br/><br/>The story focused on the guerilla style intervention of Mia, who is taken to an old, practically forgotten family cabin in the woods to get clean and sober. A cool premise that strikes at the ongoing epidemic that young people face today ( when to say no- I will not go on a weekend getaway, especially off in the wilderness with ghosts from my past! The jig is up and this isn't A&E!). Addiction management is better handled in clinic with professionals. Sorry I tend to ramble nonsensically. The well-do friends all agree to stay at the cabin, and force Mia to go through the DT's with no chance of leaving before she is clean and anew-guess they are re-thinking that little tidbit in their own private Necro-Hell. <br/><br/>For me personally I did enjoy this film as a dark horror far more than I do when watching the original-no! I said I wasn't going to compare- damn-it! The 2013 film was a more serious film with a darker atmosphere and near anesthetic nature. The characters were sullen and practically introverted which made the relationship between one another a bit more tense than the happy-go-lucky weekend getaway style. For me that set a tone that was a bit more edgier and made a statement that this wasn't a surreal or reflective horror story-it was a straight up, raw, gory massacre event in the bowels of hell. The film wasn't as scary as I would like for it have been. I didn't jump or feel creeped out on any of the scenes, but the shear gory nature of the moments that unfolded, and the full throttle battle for the soul through almost the entire film was pretty intense-and thrilling. <br/><br/>The effects in this film are tops-they should be for the budget this pic had- the soundtrack that rippled through the film was chilling. The death and ultimate possession scenes were gruesome enough to the point of making me giddy about seeing them. I was a little disappointed by the woodsy rape scene with Mia-for some reason I was expecting it to be more graphic and offensive, I found it a bit tame. The overall story was well written, the film's cinematography was great and I thought Fede Alvarez done a great job re-visioning the Evil Dead concept. ""Evil Dead"" 2013 is actually one of the few ""remakes"" that I haven't been disappointed in. Yeah at times the story seems to rush the build-up, atmospheric spookiness and go straight for the kill switch but the fact that it started out dark and moody and just hit overdrive into Hellish horrors and all out nightmare wonderland right up until the end created a great viewing experience in my opinion. I really enjoyed this film and will definitely adding it to the list of films to watch over and over- especially during the Holiday seasons!"
"embjell","9","2","22","17 July 2013"," Probably one of the best horror movies of the 21st century
","My childhood was the Evil dead classics, and i did not expect anything near as good or as special as those movies. But this is truly a masterpiece in the horror genre. My opinion is that horror movies now a days has way to much cgi, and i miss that good old make-up and costumes/props. and when i first saw the trailer of this film, i was so excited! finally a horror movie that looks horrific. and it was! both disgusting and scary. I have never turned my head away or closed my eyes because of a movie. but this... this is something else. Fede Alvarez is truly a brilliant director. and the acting is really good. the only thing i miss is Bruce, but this is not like the old evil dead, but it is still evil dead... a must watch. <br/><br/>a truly masterpiece in the horror genre. gory and scary... top notch horror flick!"
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","6","3","41","6 April 2013"," Gruesome, gore-drenched remake
","Gruesome, gore-drenched remake of the 1981 film, again has a group of five youths stranded at a remote cabin. After ignorantly reading from a book of the dead, bound in human flesh, which does not burn in fire, evil forces are raised, which possess and kill as many of them as it can. Hot little Mia (Jane Levy) realises something is amiss early on and tries to warn them, but is not believed, the rest think it is just the effects of her withdrawal. <br/><br/>Our protagonists all seem immune to multiple attacks, gunshot wounds, nail gun attacks, limbs being hacked and ripped and sliced off, tongues sliced in half, even syringes almost piercing their eyes, and tree branches crawling into Mia's vag- they seem pretty much indefatigable themselves. This blood-raining flick has plenty of gore to spare, and some effectively cringe-inducing shocks, but not enough humour to balance out the shocks, which weighs the film down, and seems to make it drag a bit. <br/><br/>The road being washed out confusingly seems to turn the film (or at least that particular segment of it) it a nature-runs-amok movie, instead of horror. Are we to be concerned with the demonic forces raised, or with the weather? When, at the film's climax, a torrential downpour of blood begins, it appears as though the filmmakers were not exactly sure. <br/><br/>It is a good film, a decent enough remake, overall, but nothing spectacular, and hardly ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience."""
"austintaylor17","9","2","23","16 July 2013"," Cerebral Horror!
","First of all, allow me to start off by saying that 99% of people who don't like this movie are fanatics of the original and leave no opportunity for this movie to work. Now- allow me to add that this movie was overseen by Raimi and Campbell, with both of them saying ""This is the movie we wanted to make originally"", but I believe it was the budget for why the original was so much different. There is **no** Ash. This is **not** a remake. Okay, let's get to a few of my points.<br/><br/>1. This movie doesn't make sense at times. First of all, the concept is basically ""5 souls are needed to raise the abomination."" You can't count the girl at the beginning, or else Eric would not have re-released the evil in the woods, it would have already been there. Now- Claiming that burying Mia alive would stop the evil, David did just that. She arises, seemingly healed. David walks back in the cabin to get the Jeep keys, where he is stabbed in the neck by Deadite Eric. IF he had stopped the Evil with Mia, Eric would not be a deadite. So that's not right?....<br/><br/>2. There are rumors afloat online that there was a recording alternate ending where Mia walks away, stops a 18-wheeler and it is revealed she is still a deadite. (I'm assuming this ending didn't include the fight between the abomination, seeing as how David would have been the 5th soul, and Mia being a deadite would have killed the abomination anyways? Doesn't make sense). Another rumor is that this story takes place in an alternate time, though similar events take place. Once again---There is NO Ash. This is NOT a remake.<br/><br/>**Conclusion**: My review is a 9 out of 10, because unless you are brain dead, this movie is amazing. I had not been so entertained by a horror movie in the last 10+ years. **Forget** the original, and imagine this movie is something different. Even the SAW movies couldn't touch the gore of this film. Ignore the fact that fans of the original cult classic hate it because it didn't live up to their expectations, didn't make sense at times- but let's not be ignorant and add ""real life"" laws into a movie that is 'obviously' not supposed to be real. A book containing incantations releasing evil that possesses a soul to consume it, to release a demon. Yes, let's add real world bias to your opinion. People do stupid things when in panic, and some people are reluctant to believe the worst, especially when you are faced with the task of *killing* your *Sister*. Some of us wouldn't jump at that opportunity- I for one would take every chance to save her. You will continue to guess what happens, and just like every horror movie (yes, somethings gonna happen when they turn around, or look in the mirror)- you'll be right. However, you will not guess what happens as a whole. Sit back and enjoy the ride. I definitely did."
"d-ender85","5","1","8","24 July 2013"," wow is OK to watch if you are horror maniac
","when i watch this movie was around 0100 am yes is sort of midnight movie for me watching this show. Before i bought this movie, i heard rumors someone willing booking for blue-ray high definition disc for this show. So, I kind wanted to watch very long time. After watching this movie finish, this is my opinion. It is nice to watch but don't use too much graphic on demon. The demon is not enough creepy due to fact too much computer animated and faking it lose it entire creepy and horror excitement. Another major problem is the plot story, yes good story but put other title than using this Evil dead. The movie ruin the original story that no link to the 1st movie. I love the 1st movie. I still remember the movie was quite demonic. The story should be telling surviving this hunted house but not talking about the girl drug problem. I like the show but don't like the ending part sound very funny. Guess what, i want watch again. For me this show is unpredictable. That all i have to say."
"ramirez13-2","10","2","26","13 July 2013"," If you have seen this READ THIS - It will make more sense
","Like most of you when I first watched the film I thought ""They messed up the remake"" THEN I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. **SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>Try to follow me here and it may make sense and change your overall view of the film. <br/><br/>THE MOVIE IS NOT A REMAKE. SORT OF. IT ANSWERS A QUESTION. <br/><br/>This movie, being modern time makes sense, and the whole thing centers around the fact that Ash's 1973 Delta 88 is the car Mia is sitting own at the beginning. If you recall the first 3 films, Ash leaves in the car, sort of. HE is pulled back in time, Oldsmobile and all at the end of 2 and hence Army of Darkness<br/><br/>Keep in mind that Raimi's next project is Army of Darkness 2<br/><br/>So let me side track a bit. On the DVD of the original EVIL DEAD you will notice in commentary they state ""EVERYBODY DIES"" but yet you have Evil Dead 2 which as awesome as it is, is this weird hodgepodge remake/not of Evil Dead. So taking those details so far into account it becomes clear to me, ASH's story is rewritten, in actuality he DIED at the end of Evil Dead, they never really tell you otherwise, even the end music is a indicator when looking back on it. <br/><br/>If he died, and you are in a world where there is a Hell, then there is a afterlife. If this is the case then Evil Dead 2 is Ash's purgatory and he relives the events of the first film and then some. That explains the end of the 2nd movie and the redemption. So therefor, as far as I think, the movie is a vehicle to explain the past 3 films and helps setup for Army of Darkness 2, and by that is not a 5 star as I first thought but instead a brilliant 10 star with its place in the cannon. What do you think?"

","As a horror movie fan for years and years to come, I have gotten a really great sense of what a horror movie should be like to really scare people and keep them interested throughout the entire film. This remake from the 1981 horror film, Evil Dead, has really took a turn for the re- creations of horror movie films throughout the country. <br/><br/>This movie especially really caught my eye as I watched the trailer for it, containing the violent bloody gore that relates to the ""Saw"" series, to the pop out scares that other movies like ""Insidious"". <br/><br/>As I stepped inside the theater to see this new horror film I was as excited as a little boy at his birthday party. Since the first opening scene I was ready to be on the edge of my seat ready for more. That's exactly what I got. Looking at this remake it seemed as if it would be a challenge to remake one of the best horror films released in 1981, but somehow, they pulled it off. This movie had everything and it is a complete must see."
"rparham","6","1","9","28 July 2013"," Remake that doesn't quite make the cut
","There are two things for certain regarding the 2013 remake of 1981's The Evil Dead. First, the film's advertising tagline ""The Most Terrifying Film You Will Ever Experience."" is, not surprisingly, a lie. Second, if you have no tolerance for blood, gore and accompanying viscera, then you would do well to avoid Evil Dead. That being said, Evil Dead is not a horror film to be trifled with, that's for sure, although while it has it's moments of unease and shock, the underlying sense of terror and suspense is largely missing. Evil Dead is designed as an endurance test, can you make it past the next major set piece without turning it off, and on that front Evil Dead certainly makes an impression.<br/><br/>Five friends, Mia (Jane Levy), her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), Eric (Lou Pucci) and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) are at David's family cabin in the woods to engage in an intervention for Mia who is a recovering heroin addict. In the basement of the cabin, the group discovers a book that is full of satanic imagery and Eric reads a passage from the book, resulting in demon spirits being unleashed. The spirits possess Mia and one by one the possession begins to spread to the others who then engage in attempts to dispatch the still human survivors in rather violent, gruesome ways. Trapped by a washed out bridge, the group must try to find a way to stop the onslaught from the possessed souls, even as their number dwindles.<br/><br/>The original Evil Dead has earned a place in the popular zeitgeist, partially for introducing the character of Ash, portrayed by Bruce Campbell, to the general American audience, and for spawning a number of increasingly comedy oriented sequels. But, it's easy to forget that the first Evil Dead was largely a straightforward horror film, and a fairly scary one, in my opinion. There is certainly no trace of goofiness in the remake. It is a solid, no holds barred serious horror film, although there is a moment or two that does elicit a chuckle every now and then. Directed by first time filmmaker Fede Alvarez and co-written by Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, Evil Dead pulls no punches in it's attempts to shock. From copious vomiting, people being attacked by nail guns, crow bars, shards of mirror and various electrical power tools, Evil Dead is intent on pushing the envelope of violence, leaving no stone unturned in its search for gory scenes intended to test the audience's willingness to keep watching. <br/><br/>However, the reliance on violence proves one of the film's downfalls. It is so wrapped up in assaulting us with its gore that it doesn't put enough effort into the other elements of what makes a good horror film, such as suspense. Evil Dead isn't without it's moments of making us feel uncomfortable or uncertain of what comes next, but those are fewer and far between than the gore. Evil Dead is trying to make us feel terrified, but it succeeds more often in just making us feel uncomfortable as limbs and other body parts are hacked off.<br/><br/>This remake does not directly rehash characters from the original film and manages to provide a slightly different setup for the story. The character of Mia takes on an unusual position of serving as, at times, both protagonist and antagonist, being both the lead character and the first to be possessed by the demon's of the title. By introducing the plot thread that Mia is a recovering heroin addict going through withdrawal, the screenplay attempts to play with the idea that the things Mia sees at first are all in her head, but that is quickly dropped because you can only explain so much from the concept that she is going through a bad withdrawal, and speaking in demonic voices and causing your housemates to start slicing off their own flesh doesn't really fall into that category. Lead actress Jane Levy provides a good performance as Mia, both as the tortured former addict trying to get herself clean, and then as the chilling demonic version, taunting the others both physically and verbally. Shiloh Fernandez is solid as her brother, trying to make sense of the world that is rapid crashing around him as strange things keep happening. Lou Pucci gives a bit of comic relief and also serves as the film's token ""geek"" who seems to be the only one understanding what is going on and coming up with answers on how to escape. The other two female roles are fairly underdeveloped and the characters fail to register much with us.<br/><br/>Evil Dead missteps in it's last act, with an ending that fails to really provide any significant payoff to what has come before and that also seems to be something of a head scratcher in terms of the film's internal logic. Needless to say, being a remake of a horror film that launched a franchise, there is room left open for a sequel (look, its the Evil Dead, you can more or less count on them being available for another round, right). So, when all is said and done, is this Evil Dead remake successful? Yes and no. The filmmakers were certainly trying their best to take the series back to its horror roots, and if you are looking for a hard core gore fest, you can't do much better than this. Where Evil Dead falls a bit flat is in making the whole experience scary and affecting. It gives it a shot, but doesn't quite grasp the brass ring. You can do worse for remakes, but you can also do better."

"kiandougherty","10","1","10","20 October 2013"," An Excellent Re-Imagining
","Evil Dead is a re-imagining of the 1981 cult classic, 'The Evil Dead'. The film is directed by Fede Alvarez and stars Jane Levy as Mia, a young woman attempting to kick her drug habit through a weekend of rehabilitation at a cabin in the woods with her three friends, Eric, Olivia, Natalie and her brother David. However, when Eric mistakenly summons a demon through reading a 'Book of the Dead' they found, and Mia is possessed, they all must fight for survival until the night is done and they are all dead. As many people have previously mentioned, this film is filled with bucket loads of blood, guts and gore, and is definitely not for the faint hearted. However it is also an extremely entertaining film that is genuinely terrifying in the sense that the film makers have made something that would never happen into something that, through the movie, we start to believe could. The film is filled with moments where you cover your eyes, cover your ears, cover your mouth, scrape your nails across your armrest, and even scream a little. Or in my case, a lot. Through the director's vision, this film (which could've turned into a complete disaster) is an amazing feat of horror filmmaking, and, filmmaking in general. Now, when I say this, I don't mean that it is an amazing film that will win awards, bit in terms practical effects and scares, it has really set the bar for horror films today and, most importantly, ones to come. In fact, I feel sorry for those who have to make horror films after this one, because I for one will always have Evil Dead in my mind and will be thinking; ""Evil Dead did that better"", or, ""they should've added a bit like the scene in Evil Dead"". And, to me, that's a sign of a great film."
"BA_Harrison","5","1","10","22 July 2013"," It'll swallow your soul.
","The original Evil Dead is one of those rare low-budget films that I have long considered to be perfect, so much so that I have always failed to see the benefit of a bigger budgeted remake; even when director Sam Raimi made Evil Dead II (which was essentially a more lavish retelling of the same story), he failed to match his original film's raw intensity and creativity.<br/><br/>I will admit, however, that this slick 21st-century version of the infamous 1981 'video nasty' briefly saw me reconsidering my stance. After introducing his obnoxious characters and establishing a somewhat pointless sub-plot about one of them being a recovering junkie, director Fede Alverez actually began to impress me with his handling of the horror, neatly creating an unsettling atmosphere (with the help of his incredibly creepy woodland setting) and delivering numerous, intense scenes of visceral, no-holds-barred carnage—guaranteed crowd-pleasers like self-dismemberment, nail-gun mutilation, shotgun damage and crushed heads.<br/><br/>The good stuff doesn't last for long though, and in its final act, the film goes into an irretrievable tailspin, bringing one of its least sympathetic characters back to life in a ridiculous plot development that beggars belief: with the aid of two syringes and a car battery, final survivor David (Shiloh Fernandez) is replaced by his presumed dead junkie sister Mia (Jane Levy), who loses a hand but still proceeds to kick deadite ass, chainsawing in half a crappy Grudge-like creature that crawls its way from the bowels of hell during a torrential downpour of blood. It might be a wonderfully gory way to end the film, but it's frustratingly dumb and deserves nothing but scorn and derision.<br/><br/>7/10 for the gore, minus one point for the stupid ending and another for the possessed Mia's unnecessary Exorcist-style expletives."
"terrorballs","6","1","10","11 May 2013"," Not bad but lacked the intrigue of the original.
","Hmmm, where to start, this film isn't really even a remake, not in my book. It has a few references if you know where to look and it tries to have the suspenseful and foreboding atmosphere of the original but lets go of the scares too quickly and plunges straight into a gorefest. I'm not saying it's a bad film, it just doesn't have the imagination of the original. It has the blood and gore down, there are some real nice wince inducing moments, but the real horror isn't in the gore it's in the other elements which make a truly frightening horror film. The psychological fear of the unknown menace, keeping the original characters isolated in the woods is gone. However this is replaced by gore and bodily punishment, of which the characters seem to shrug off with relative ease, lessening the horror and desensitizing the audience to the carnage on screen. All in all a good but not great horror film. It had the shock factor but not enough of the ""originals"" terror. Maybe the director tried a little too hard to out-do instead of re-do and missed a few of the important aspects which made ""The Evil Dead"" a cult classic."

","I liked the start of this film a lot, ratchets up the tension nicely, had inoffensive and bland central characters ,a drug abuse sub plot ,and two estranged sibling trying to bond.As the gore hits the fan and things start to fall apart the movie shifts focus on to the brother and his struggle to keep alive until ten minutes before the end when we write him off and switch back to a suddenly ,and stupidity, cured sister whose spent most of the movie as the evil killer bitch in the cellar.now we're supposed to cheer for her survival as she previously slaughtered most of the cast??Sorry thats not how movies work ,you cant get audiences to invest emotionally in characters like that .FAIL"
"skittyjoe665","6","1","10","29 April 2013"," A movie full of gore rather than thrills
","I am a fun of horror remakes strangely, I enjoyed Halloween and Nightmare on elms street almost to near perfection , the Evil Dead was em was just Okay-ish! It had a good metascore of 7.2 from IMDb so I knew it was worth seeing , which it wasn't frankly. The plot has been done many times over and over since its original so you would have that deja vu cliché feeling hanging around you. The story line in the beginning was not so clear but it made up for it with its superficial gore that kept me tuned whilst it sent some shrills down my spine. The dismemberment of the limbs was a little ""SAW"" in nature but that was just that.<br/><br/>The movie certainly has its flaws which are:<br/><br/>1) There is no build up to the suspense ,everything that happens just happens ( I am not going into detail without giving much spoilers).<br/><br/>2) The movie apart from its gore is not scary (I thought this was a horror movie not a slasher thriller)<br/><br/>3) I expected some twists and surprises which came only at the end and that was poorly done.<br/><br/>4)Too much emphasis on the evil book.<br/><br/>In all I will give this movie a 6/10,its not a good movie but neither a horrendous one , I will say wait till it comes out on Netflix/Lovefilm or DVD."
"alpcentufekci","6","1","10","27 April 2013"," Not as good as expected...
","It has been just a few hours since I watched ""Evil Dead"" at theater and I thought of leaving a review about the film or not as I read many misleading reviews of the users about the films on internet. Thus, I d like to state that my personal thoughts on the film should not change your mind not to see it at theater.<br/><br/>First of all, I can say that I am a fan of horror films and I have a film collection with more than 750 digital video discs, I must confess that my expectation from re-made ""Evil Dead"" was very high, I was looking forward to seeing it very much.<br/><br/>When I watched the ""Evil Dead"" of Sam Raimi (1981), I was a teenager and I liked the film so much, I still think that Sam Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" is one of the best horror cults. However, re-made ""Evil Dead"" of Fede Alvarez, compared with its older version was not that good according to me.<br/><br/>1. When you watch a re-made film, you often remember the original first version and compare with it. When Evil Dead of Sam Raimi was on theaters in early 80's, it looked very different from other horror films with its unusual script and very fantastic make up according to 80's.<br/><br/>2. As you saw the original first version, you almost know the whole story and you can even guess surprises if the re-made one has. This is an other reason that new version doesn't make the same effect that the old one did.<br/><br/>3. Cinematography of ""Evil Dead"" is fine. Fede Alvarez gives good signs that he has a great potential. However, what I don't understand is why producers and film makers think that people will think it is a good horror film when they see more blood and more cut organs in that film. So, does it mean ""the more blood and cut organ, the more horror""? I don't think so. It doesn't fear you, it just makes you disgusted. The blood used in old version is just in the way it should be, but it is exaggerated in new version.<br/><br/>4. There are some points that I don't like about the developing of the story. In new version, there is an opening scene that shows what the book of the dead is and what will happen. I think this opening scene destroys the mystery of the story. Sam Raimi didn't use such opening scene, in old version the guys find a tape and listen to the record of the man who examined the book of the dead and free the evil. This makes us curious about what happened to the man who saved his voice.<br/><br/>5. The idea of developing the story on Mia, the girl addicted to drugs and the reason they don't leave the cabin due to this (they come to the cabin to help Mia give up) is not that creative. The old version didn't need such excuse, the evil, itself doesn't allow them to leave the cabin in old version.<br/><br/>6. In old version, the forest rapes the woman and i think it was an unforgettable scene. This part of the film is not as successful as old version.<br/><br/>7. What made me laugh while watching the film is the brother (David) of Mia still thinks that the reason of the change in her body can be a disease, virus, although he witnessed such paranormal activities. I cant stop saying to myself in that part; ""Man, cant you see her eyes and cant you hear her voice?"" Even though the whole story is not logical and this is a horror film, you want to see some little logic in such stories.<br/><br/>8. Also, at the end of the film, dead Mia comes back to life and gives a last fight against ""the bad"" and it makes the film more banal. The film looks like its end will never come, it will last and last.<br/><br/>9. What happens in the film happens step by step (page by page) according to the book of the dead, this is a difference from the old version. The old version deals with the situation more than the book of the dead after everything starts.<br/><br/>10. As a result, I do respect all the efforts given for re-making of ""Evil Dead"" even I think that the vote over 7 is high. I can say that the performance of the crew, especially Jane Levy (Mia) is good. If you are a horror film fan, you will probably like it. It takes 6/10 from me."
"sam-pearson15","7","1","11","8 July 2013"," Few Flaws but Otherwise Very Entertaining.
","I would like to start by saying I can't understand why this movie has such bad reviews, the acting was horrendous at times but some of the scenes were particularly intense such as the chainsaw scene! I was gripping at my screen wanting her to get out of the situation..<br/><br/>I believe the movie had a very well written backstory. Think how harsh these kids lives would be if you were in their shoes. Mom is in the looney bin so you decide to leave home, then your sister turns into a junkie and you think its all your fault when you find out she's been overdosing. Lets face it we've all heard worse but that is still rough. <br/><br/>Scenes were all well filmed and intense. The actions that the demons would commit were completely unpredictable and shocking at times. Puking ""Blood Omen"" style into the face of a girl?

","""You don't understand. There was something in the woods and I think it's in here with us now."" Looking to finally get their friend Mia (Levy) off of drugs for good a group of friends head out to a remote cabin in the woods for the weekend. A gross smell leads them to a room full of dead animals and a strange book. While investigating the book one of the friends unknowingly unleashes an unspeakable horror on all of them. It has been a long time (around 15 years) since I have seen the original trilogy. From what I remember the first two were OK but the third one, Army Of Darkness, is one of the funniest movies ever. There were a few call back scenes to the original in this and from what I remember this is a little better, but still really nothing but gore and blood. There is a few scary parts in this, but with all the gore and blood it distracts from the overall horror aspect I was going for. To me when you just slice up people that is not horror. Other then that though I do have to say that this is a rare remake that is just about as good as the original. Overall, horror fans will love this, I thought it was just too much gore for it to really be scary. I give it a B-."
"Cinobite17","7","1","11","3 July 2013"," Could have been a good stand alone film
","But Hollywood are far too content with bastardising classic films instead.<br/><br/>Now fully aware that people are getting sick to death with remakes, Hollywood has started a course of ""reimaginations"" - as with Carrie et al. This basically means that they can leech from the franchise and fan base of the original films whilst blaming all the changes and hate on the fact that it's ""supposed to be different"".<br/><br/>Well here's an idea. If you desperately HAVE to make a remake. Make a remake. If you're going to change things, make a new film. <br/><br/>44 seconds in and my surround system was in effect, that was great - for about 5 seconds plus one or two points later in the film. They could have utilised the ever present multichannel audio to a far greater degree.<br/><br/>4 minutes in and we see the ""first death"", more a prequel death really. And with it some of the worst CGI of the film. And this was a big disappointment, because the original was scary. The way the stop frame animated body's moved was surreal and unnatural. Nowadays studios try to make effects so real that they become unbelievable. What's scary is the unknown, the way these things moved and acted was out of character. Now we just get realistic bodies in realistic fire - I'm by no means a serial killer, but it's just common place these days. Whilst at points the cringe factor is near Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), I've seen fire, I've seen a hand with a nail in, there's nothing scary, unknown or unworldly about it.<br/><br/>But as I say, if Evil Dead never existed, this would be quite a good shock horror. But it does exist. So you inevitably draw parallels between the two.<br/><br/>ED 2013 takes itself FAR more seriously. It's not campy like the original, not humorous, no crazy hand or goo. And while there is slightly more character back story than the original, there is, ironically, less soul to the film. If you read up about the original, Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell did the camera work themselves, long nights, cameras in shopping trollys/carts, real blood and sweat - and that comes through in the film. In this remake you know that they are covering up in the dry with a cup of coffee after every take.<br/><br/>I think Jane Levy is lovely :) and at points in the film her acting is spot on and almost strikes a nerve. However...<br/><br/>*spoiler*<br/><br/>What I am getting absolutely sick of is this forced penchant for feminism in films. In Evil Dead 2013 the Bruce Campbell character dies and is replaced by lone survivor, dismembered handed, chainsaw wielding, Jane Levy. And after she defeats the evil, cut to a sunrise as she walks off the amazonian heroine of the film. No doubt on her way to pickup the kids and have morning coffee with Sanaa Lathan of Alien vs Predator and Noomi Rapace of Prometheus.<br/><br/>It's a good watch with good production values and, after the first CGI death, the graphics are pretty good. But the second you think back to the original classic of 1981, your blood will begin to boil and you'll feel nothing short of let down."
"bleecole88","6","1","11","2 July 2013"," Great movie, But a long shot compared to the Original
","I would have to say just like Rob Zombie tried to remake Carpenter's Halloween movies, Alvarez had to compete with The God Raimi's Original Evil Dead (1981). I liked the effort and effects put into this movie to give you that scent and taste it had something to do with Evil Dead. That it was in the same ballpark. The death scenes were epic enough, but I didn't get the Oatmeal and maggots hand made gore I was hoping for. A lot of CGI and special effects with changing camera views. I think they did a really good job when it came to the Gore. I also thought the acting was pretty good for a group of amateur actors. They kept the plot simple, and nailed it on the head when it came to things like the soul taker's point of view camera angels where I could tell the opening scene from the air was similar to the ones in the Original when they were driving in. I felt some comedy when the possessed girls were talking. All in all I think they did a really great job going off the Original, but it's nothing really I expected. More of a modern new age Evil Dead. No cons really I caught myself asking how could you be so dumb? The door blew open and your sisters voice changed and wind slamming the doors open and shut yet you think your sister is sick and needs to go to the hospital. What about the hanging dead cats in the basement and witchcraft, could it possibly be that? 6/10 Good movie."

","My own opinion, I loved the movie - and had been waiting for such a long time for it to finally make it here to Australia. Definitely not a disappointment.<br/><br/>The original Evil Dead was the movie that originally got me into liking ""Horror"" movies & even to this day remains one of my all times favourites.<br/><br/>The ""re-imagining"" was good in that it improved on some of the special effects, changed the story enough so it was not just a straight re-make (and so was fresh to watch), but also left enough references & story from the original to make the movie a fitting tribute to the original.<br/><br/>And although Bruce Campbell did not make an appearance in the film itself - it was great just to see him once again after the closing credit's with Ash's signature ""Groovy"" being spoken. A great to finish it off, and to make you once again go back to re-see how it all began.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour - go see the movie as a simple modern day horror movie and try not to compare it to the original (without Bruce it could never win anyway) but instead compare it to any other Horror Movie released in the last 5 years. This is when you will appreciate it for the quality movie that it is."
"carry-92","7","1","12","3 July 2013"," Don't give up on it if you didn't like the original. It's way better to me.
","When I first heard of the remake I thought it would completely suck. I really don't like the original. I'm not into older films in general but in my opinion it was just weird and rather a sick kind of funny than a shocking Horror. A lack of great visuals really disturbed me there. Next to the rather stupid story. Of course it wasn't going to beat the visuals of the remake as there's simply more possible in film and costumes/make-up nowadays. Also the funniest thing is that you can't get the original here - until today. It's simply not being sold since it got taken from the market back then. A joke to me, there's way more shocking stuff out there. And the remake is out here. Just funny.<br/><br/>Back to the actual film: the first trailer had me. Though the original wasn't for me I thought it seemed quite well done. As a Horror fan that's definitely enough to make me want to see it.<br/><br/>Overall I liked it way more than the original. They created a better storyline around the strange happenings which was kind of missing in the original. Some things like the rain towards the end was a great idea to me. That was really something. Just to mention a few things without giving anything away.<br/><br/>I still can't rate this as a 10 - it was not shocking, rather sick minded and brutal. I know a Horror can be that but you're promised a shocker and it just isn't. Im comparison to other films, a 6-7 would be appropriate to me so I'll make it a 7."
"tequila101","8","1","12","16 May 2013"," A Gruesome Entice into Gore, Guts and Purifying Carnage
","I'd firstly like to state that this remake was neither a well-achieved turnout like other past remakes such as ""The Thing"" and ""Dawn of the Dead"", but it wasn't a muddled mess like past re-trends which consist of ""Black Christmas"" or ""Prom Night"". For me, this remake was a brutal impact which lays its freshly coated blood in the middle of decent remakes. I don't think this one was better than the original by any means, and it ends up missing some of the point. I will talk about the positives and negatives, which I will contrast together: Positives: Overall, I'd say that the film was an enjoyable ride through many of the modern remakes we've already received constantly within a decade. I'd start with the soundtrack score because I found that it was one of the strongest highlights for this film. At times, it was very dark and soothed in with quiet, and very harsh whispers of suspense or booming sounds, and sometimes when emotional scenes were scattered about, it became symbolic and quite sympathetic which I found to be elemental and strange, but yet so intriguing as to why a remake soundtrack score would have both dark but emotional tones.<br/><br/>I found the acting to being decent for the most part. The new cast of characters that they gave us were cool and they really rocked me back and fourth with their decision making (most of the time being quite stupid, oh well that's modernized horror for ya these days). The aspects I really loved about the remake were the practical effects and many of the death scenes we were given. I loved how these original creators adapted the stories' kill sequences, but making them improve so much in all areas. Lastly, I found there to be a few disturbing scenes where we got to know the new cast of characters on a different level to the original film which I thought was a good twist on where the story was going, as well as the parts from the start. The cinematography, whether we were in the cellar or outside in the raining forests also looked dreadfully nice which gave the film some tension.<br/><br/>Some Negatives: Even though I thought this horror remake was sweet on how it took on the story, I still found some minor elements which bothered me, making me sometimes think about the original. This is not to say that the filmmakers didn't attempt a good job here, it's just that in these areas I'm about to focus on, I just didn't think they were strong enough or these aspects were placed here for utterly weird reasons. (WARNING SPOILERS FROM HERE ON!) Firstly, I think Mia's brother David burying her in the pit and then she comes back alive and she's newly fresh and all human again was just stupid. They should have found another way to weave those elements through, but I think that the filmmakers' didn't know how to clear this up. Even though the effects are sick for the most part, I'd say that there was some creativity lacking when it came to making Mia and some of the gang looking evil, possessed and demonized. All they had was just yellow eyes, deeply mixed voices and screeches and slow walk/crawling. They could've made them all look a little different. I also wish they had made the possessed victims fade and die in a more suspenseful and least predictable way like the original.<br/><br/>Lastly, the one problem I had with this remake which I have with most horror remakes is that the film just wasn't scary enough for me. I laughed at some of the dialogue and I did believe that the film's atmosphere was dreadful, despicable and brutal for the majority of the time. However, I just wasn't afraid most of the time when watching it. It's just something that horror re-imaginings have struggled with. I knew it wasn't something completely knew, but by the look of the trailer, I looked frightening and disastrous.<br/><br/>Overall, I do believe that Evil Dead (2013) is a worthy look at. Despite some mix up's and it's thing as a remake for not being as scary, I still think that the film should not be missed in the cinemas and that it was scary enough for even the least avid fan who wouldn't normally go to watch a horror film. I enjoyed it for what it was. 8/10"
"rebecca-ry","8","1","12","26 April 2013"," Not a 'terrifying' experience but still worthwhile
","'Evil Dead' is a remake of 'THE Evil Dead,' it follows five teenagers who unintentionally revive a demon who attempts to possess them so he can rise.<br/><br/>The original Evil Dead never really had a story; it is considered a cult classic because of this, there's a paper-thin story but the excessive amounts of cheap looking gore make up for this (the cheap gore simply added to the overall charm of the film). This new film also has this going for it, okay the gore isn't obviously fake or cheap and looks a lot more realistic, but it was still excessive and over the top. You don't see many wide release gore films today; the past decade is thought to be known for increasing the popularity of 'torture porn' but even those films tend to not contain spectacular amounts of blood and guts. This is certainly the goriest film in the last five years – since Paranormal Activity, most wide release horrors have been supernatural thrillers filled with tedious jump scares. The Evil Dead was part of the 'video nasty' phase in film which is undoubtedly where torture porn stemmed from. The violence in this film is so over the top you cannot help but laugh sometimes and realise how much you have missed this type of horror. <br/><br/>As remakes go, this is one of the better ones. You can tell Fede Alvarez (director) really did admire the original but has taken the brave step of trying to take the film/story in a new direction. I wouldn't say he is completely successful in this however since the story overall is pretty much the same. There were some interesting new touches though; the girl goes to the cabin to quit her drug addiction, the fact that the main protagonist was a woman, the brief story behind previous events in the cabin – these are all interesting additions but none are really explored thoroughly. It would have been nice to see some more references to the girl's drug habit, particularly towards the end. <br/><br/>I did like the new plot point where certain things had to happen before the demon could rise; skin had to be burned with boiling water, faces had to be cut off etc. – it was interesting and it meant that not all of the violence was completely nonsensical. There were undoubtedly some creepy scenes dotted throughout the film and some not-so-subtle references to the original – though if the producers of a remake are the director and star of the original then this is bound to happen. The director did try his best to make us care for the characters but there was no way that was going to happen; character developments were left suspended – I thought there was some angry tension between Olivia and *insert blonde girl here* but nothing ever happened with that – and some characters got next to no dialogue at all.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Evil Dead' is a pretty good film. If you're paying to see gore then it will be money well spent. The characters are basic, the story tries to be not so basic and the overall experience isn't terrifying but it is worthwhile. I don't really see the need for a sequel however, you won't be routing for Mia quite as much as you would for Ash."

Her RN friend Olivia (Jessica Lucas from Cloverfield and She's the Man) warns Mia's brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez from Red Riding Hood) that Mia has done this before; claiming to get clean and in the end, returns to bad habits. Along mutual friend Olivia is David and Mia's other friend Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci from Carriers).<br/><br/>There is of course several minutes before the Book of the Dead is found and someone (Eric) is dumb enough to have taken Latin and say 3 little words aloud.

","The best way to describe this movie is: Blood!!! And lots of it. I thought the blood and gore scenes were a bit excessive. This movie would have worked without all the blood, severed limbs, and shredded faces. There was almost no background story to explain what the origins of demon was except towards the end of the credits where a recording is played telling where the book originated. There was a few holes in the plot. For example who was the last possessed? Who was Mia trying to get away from? Was it herself? It could not have been the girl who cut off her hand or the other girl since they died earlier in the film. The necklace was taken apart in the beginning but magically appears in the end. The acting was surprisingly decent and special effects were excellent. I guess this film targets blood and gore lovers. Its hard to live up to the original but I think it was a job well done."

David is never possessed. And Mia had been, but David had freed her soul. So TECHNICALLY speaking, only three souls were captured. David died with his soul intact, and Mia's soul was freed.

I was open to a new interpretation... at least as long as it was good and had some original ideas.<br/><br/>The remake does have some positive features. The production values are pretty good, for one thing. There isn't a lull or boring moment any time during its 91 minutes.

After a lot of thought, the closest I can come to explaining my lack of enthusiasm may be that the movie unfolds in a way that it seems you've seen all this stuff many times before. The ""surprises"", the shocks, the behavior of the evil forces... to me, it didn't seem different from what I've seen in many other horror movies. Also, the movie may be too slick for its own good; the original low budget movie had a rawness that stuck in your mind and generated creepiness. <br/><br/>While I won't say this is an awful remake, it feels very unnecessary.

It has something for everyone- after all, a movie has got to make money! You do not need to be familiar with the original to enjoy this film. It will definitely cause uneasy nights to the occasional tweens who inadvertently watch this out of curiosity like I once watched the original(I imagine the warnings on Naturom Demonto to hold special significance for them). The horror movie buff will be pleased to make connections with tasteful horror films such as Rec, The Ring, The Crazies, The Exorcist and Martyrs among countless homages made in this film. The resourcefulness, variety and morbid humour is consistent with the original series while this film adds a creative romance sequence that is destined to be iconic.<br/><br/>In contradiction to the tag line: this is NOT the scariest movie you will ever see; neither does it set out to be so. However, it is definitely one of the most entertaining horror films I've seen and well worth the money.

"isioma-okwezime","Null","1","31","6 April 2013"," Evil Dead
","For many, it doesn't get better than ""The Evil Dead."" The 1981 original and its two sequels are the perfect blend of blood-drenched, graphic horror and B-grade camp, giving birth to one of the most abused horror movie clichés of all time: naive college or high school kids, alone in a cabin or other secluded area, making predictably dumb decisions that will only make their situation worse.<br/><br/>This new ""Evil Dead"" remake (which drops the definite article from the title) is produced by original ""The Evil Dead"" director Sam Raimi and his trilogy star, Bruce Campbell. Make no mistake, these two are extremely protective about their property, have a great relationship with the franchise's many fans and, I fully believe, wanted to deliver the best possible ""Evil Dead"" remake they could. In order to do that, they put the franchise in the hands of director Fede Alvarez, which was exactly the right thing to do.<br/><br/>This time around, we find five friends gathered at a remote country cabin to help one of them, Mia (Jane Levy), kick her drug habit. Joining Mia is her brother David (Shiloh Fernandez); his girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore); Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), who's angry at David for leaving town and apparently forgetting about his friends; and Olivia (Jessica Lucas), a nurse who, supposedly, will be able to administer any sort of drug should Mia need it.<br/><br/>Turns out, the cabin sits above a cellar once used to exorcise a demon from a young woman who was burned at the stake while surrounded by dozens of dead cats hanging from the ceiling and cast of characters who looked like they were on a break from the set of ""American Horror Story."" Thanks to the odor emanating from the basement, the friends discover the creepy subterranean dwelling, where they also find the demonic book used to dispatch of the possessed girl. Clearly, Eric hadn't seen many horror movies, because the barbed wire wrapped around the book certainly should've raised a red flag. And if that wasn't a clear enough signal to stay away, the Frankenstein-like stitching of the book cover — suggesting that the book isn't leather-bound but perhaps human skin-bound — should've been another dead giveaway. But NOOOO, Eric just had to know what was in that book, and when he got it open, he just had to read the various Latin phrases inscribed below the demonic pictures covered with messages written in blood.<br/><br/>So far, this sticks close enough to the original movie, when the recorded messages unleashed hell, literally. Soon enough, Mia, in the throes of drug withdrawal, becomes possessed.<br/><br/>Putting Jane Levy (TV's ""Suburgatory"") in the role of Mia may very well be the best bit of horror movie casting since Naomi Watts in ""The Ring."" This is a breakout performance for her. Her energy — whether it's nervous, frenetic, scared — is infectious. Levy pulls you into this disgustingly gory, graphic tale and never lets you go, making you feel as though you're experiencing everything she is. Alvarez certainly deserves credit for utilizing his young star's prodigious talents.<br/><br/>While not as funny as the original ""The Evil Dead,"" and none of the characters are quite as memorable or iconic as Bruce Campbell's wisecracking Ash, there's plenty of humor in this remake, most of which can't be repeated here. Campbell promised fans a blood bath and the team that he and Raimi assembled delivers.<br/><br/>Except it's less a blood bath and more like a blood monsoon. But, if you're paying money to see ""Evil Dead,"" you know what you're getting yourself into, and you're not going to be disappointed. While there's room for improvement, ""Evil Dead"" is still a cathartic, nauseating (in a good way) crowd pleaser you'll want to see more than once.<br/><br/>Three-and-a-half out of five stars."
"MannyCastro","Null","1","45","5 April 2013"," Hail to the Queen! Jane Levy lives up to Evil Dead standards in remake, but the film not so much.
","I am very curious to read and hear reactions from people with no knowledge of the Evil Dead series. The film begins as a remake of the original cult classic, which leaned heavily on horror instead of the camp humor that would dominate the sequels. But once the movie reaches its second-act, it starts to slowly transition into Evil Dead II territory. Co-writer and director Fede Alvarez never comes anywhere near the trademark comedy of that installment but he's definitely tipping his toe in the water. So I can imagine many viewers that are newcomers to the franchise will be thinking, ""what the...?""<br/><br/>This remake, released 30 years after the original became a genre favorite on VHS, tries to correct several flaws made by its counterpart. It is better paced and has a superior screenplay. The plot revolves around Mia, who is played brilliantly by Jane Levy of Suburgatory fame. She's a drug addict trying to go cold turkey after the death of her mother and an overdose soon after. She stays at her family's cabin with support from her closest friends and estranged brother. After one of them discovers the Book of the Dead in the basement, a demon is unleashed and the reign of terror begins. <br/><br/>Evil Dead, like its predecessors, is unrelenting. There aren't many moments for audiences to catch their breath. It's a near endless stream of mayhem. It definitely lives up to its promise of being the most terrifying film experience of all-time. However, it lacks the charm and tongue-n-cheek of the Sam Raimi helmed trilogy. Alvarez recreates Raimi's signature visual style, which is great, but he avoids all the eye-winking except for a few moments. Teenages attacked in the woods is a tired concept in horror films. The Evil Dead movies are supposed to freshen up that sub-genre and provide something different. This remake is mostly run of the mill and only slightly stands-out through entertainment value, strong visuals, and a memorable lead character. It's a great gateway to the original trilogy, but it's not in the same league. Well, at least not on a pedestal like Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness. Regardless, it succeeds as far as remake are concerned, but it breaks no new ground."

I'm more into the over the top blood and guts then i was the first time mainly for ""balls out"" reasons of ""if your going to do it, F it do it with a million gallons of fake blood"". ** Vapid actors, amazingly stocked cabin, and people who seem stronger alive and still able to function and carry weapons with 2 dozen knife wounds/broken limbs/guttings then the ""undead""....until you come back, then all of a sudden those wounds go away....and if your hit in the arm with a crowbar three times which clearly is shown to break it, no worries- in the next 3 seconds that will be fixed too. Overall points for the fx and cinematography and a shame as even though this was so not scary, horrid ""acting"", and torture  it could all have been saved going the Rami/Whedon route and just a call that shit out, ala ""Hey, why the F can we physically pull our own hand off and be perfectly fine with that"" or ""Hey, whats with this cabin thats been raided still have every grip eye hook in the world"" or my favorite ""I'm sorry, why is your girlfriend even in this movie as shes only had 5 lines and is F'in pointless?""

I had no expectations for it, but it was a dark and gritty surprise. It didn't rely on jumpscares and it delivered some of the most gory violence I have ever seen in a mainstream movie. It may have bad character choices, but the logic behind it is admirable. Definitely a movie for gore hounds and horror fans only, but it isn't bad, and I could definitely watch it again."

","Did we really need a remake of Sam Raimi's iconic horror flick The Evil Dead? Probably not. But you won't hear me complaining. To be honest, I kinda like what I saw. The only thing I truly dislike is the the fact that the main characters are teenagers in the woods. Again. I know that the original also followed this trope, but come on, try something new once in a while! How boring is that? And I didn't need so much backstory for the two main characters Mia and Dave. It felt underdeveloped and overly dramatic at the same time. The script was trying way too hard to be deep. Give me a break. This is a silly demon romp after all. All that being said, if you get past the sappy stuff and take The Evil Dead 2013 for what it wants to be, you'll have a lot of fun.<br/><br/>The characters aren't too annoying, pretty likeable actually. There's plenty of gore, some effective jump scares (a bit too many probably) and passable acting. I'm not a big fan of the special effects, they don't always look convincing. Some scenes were downright silly, I wasn't even sure if intentionally or not. By the way, why does every demon look and even sound like Regan from The Exorcist? That threw me off. The ending is a jaw-dropping, epic bloodfest. Very, very cool. Director Fede Alvarez goes crazy with the camera angles in true Raimi style. I felt the whole thing could have been even crazier, but oh well, for a modern ramake this one isn't bad at all. Give it a chance."

It was cool seeing the same story, but in a more scary humorless tone. Very creepy throughout. Likable characters. Tones of outrageous gore. Even more than the original.

","What a glorious remake.<br/><br/>There's primarily one reason to see this film: the violence. When you think it's reached its most sadistic peak, the movie pushes the envelope further until you're completely desensitized to what's happening on screen. The crescendo of the splatter comes in the finale with a chainsaw--you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is an amazing homage to the slasher genre. If you took ""Night of the Demons"" and bred it with ""Cabin Fever,"" you would get this amazing Evil Dead remake that is so fun and enjoyable to watch, you forget you're watching a bunch of sexy idiots get hacked up and chewed on to death.<br/><br/>For gore hounds, Evil Dead (2013) is almost impossible to beat in mainstream cinema except for maybe the I Spit On Your Grave unrated remakes. In terms of sadistic and gratuitous vilence, this version of Evil Dead is like watching a two hour extended version of the last 20 minutes of the original French film ""Martyrs (2008).""<br/><br/>What a delicious experience. 8/10"

","I was unsure about this sequel/remake as soon as I heard of its more serious tone. The reason Evil Dead 2 is one of my favorite 80s movies is bc of its campiness and comedy. But this movie delivered a worthy addition to the franchise. The gore is nasty and completely uncensored, and I can safely say this is one of the most gory movies I've ever seen. This movie also feels very slickly produced. I didn't care about the characters, but I don't think that's really the point. The plot is also surprisingly smart, as a character is a recovering heroine addict and her seeing the Evil is excused as hallucination. Solid remake."

","Well, the moment that Deadites have been waiting for for years is finally here, and everyone's wondering: does the remake (produced by none other than Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, and Rob Tapert) live up to the high standard set by the original two films from over twenty-five years ago? The answer: Hell yes. The plot and setup is nothing new; a small group of young adults visit an abandoned cabin, and unleash an evil presence from a book they find therein. And yet, because this is a reimagining of the film that pretty much started this trend in the first place, the generic-ness of the plot is entirely forgivable. The filmmakers were not trying to reinvent the wheel with this one. However, one thing that people seem to constantly be misunderstanding is that the remake was never trying to copy and paste The Evil Dead (humor and all) into a modern setting. Fans of the original can claim otherwise all they want, but the 1981 film featured undeniably humorous undertones, whether intentional of not. And this masterfully executed remake has been heavily criticized for not doing the same. What is commendable about Fede Alvarez's feature debut is that it takes itself as seriously as it does. There are no geysers of blood erupting from the architecture, no possessed hands smashing dishes into the heads of their former owners. Instead, the film ops to make itself as realistic as its story and subject matter allows. For example, these are not five happy-go-lucky kids going on a ""vacation"" to a remote cabin in a desolate forest. Instead, there are four normal people there to support a fifth, who recently lost her mother and has become a drug addict. The entire cast does a pretty good job, but the breakout member is Jane Levy (who plays Mia, the lead character), expertly infusing desperation into a performance that is truly remarkable. And yet, despite the commendable performances, I hardly think anyone is buying a ticket because of the actors involved. No, Evil Dead fans are the target audience, and one of the things the original was famous for is being one of the goriest movies ever made (for its time, at least), and the new Evil Dead continues that grand tradition. I believe that this film's level of violence is as high as can be without veering into over-the-top territory. Truly horrific things are done to the human body, many of which are guaranteed to make you cringe, and all brought to life by what are easily some of the best makeup and gore effects ever put to film. No CGI here, folks, only good old fashioned practical effects that are utterly, terrifyingly convincing. Just to give you a small taste of what one can expect, there is a scene in which a howling, possessed girl is set on fire by her sobbing father, who tops it off by exploding her head with a shotgun. All this occurs within the first five minutes of the film, perhaps a way to prepare audiences both physically and mentally for the atrocities that lie ahead. Finally, the plot deserves to get a word in edgewise. While there is one major contrivance, it is certainly a plausible event, given what had happened prior to it. Other than that, there is little depth here, though there is certainly more backstory than there was in the original. Ever since the first teaser was released, certain shot have had people questioning its status as a remake, and whether or not it may in fact be a sequel to the 1981 original. I can say this: aside from a tiny handful of visual nods (as well as the very familiar-looking cabin), this is still a debatable question, and one that I am sure will be answered in the already-confirmed sequels. So, the verdict. It's possible that some might wonder why I didn't give this a higher score. Well, I don't really think the film earned it. Deserved it? Possibly. But I am trying to be as objective as possible, so it gets what it gets. I will say that, as a big Evil Dead fan, that this film gave me exactly what I wanted. It neither exceeded nor fell victim to my expectations. It's a rare thing that a film delivers exactly what you want out of it, but Evil Dead did. This is a must see."
"PCT1970","7","0","2","8 May 2019"," Alvarez's Reawakening
","Alvarez helms a reawakening, pun intended, of Raimi's cult classic and delivers a formidable horror film. It is frenzied from start to finish. Excellent direction, screenplay, special effects, cinematography, settings, score and acting. All of the actors involved offer gifted and truly frightening performances. This time around five friends visit a cabin in the woods to detox Mia. Along with Mia are her brother David, Eric, Natalie and Olivia. Soon the ""Book of The Dead"" is discovered in the cabin's cellar. Eric, against everyone's pleas, reads from the book and Mia is immediately possessed by an evil force although the others initially believe she is going through the detox process. It's like no other detox process this viewer has ever witnessed. Having awoken the dead the friends fight off attacks from the force A.K.A. Deadites at every angle. Eric continues to try to reverse his actions and figure out what has happened. He believes killing Mia is the solution. This film is much more gory than the original and lacks the quirky and outlandish vibe, but at times odes to the original are referenced. Nonetheless this film works.The plot is horrific, creepy, disquieting, grisly, brutal, thrilling, bone-chilling, ferocious, gory and has a sublime ending. This film is part of ""The Evil Dead"" franchise and this viewer sees it as a re-imagination for newcomers to enjoy if sleepless nights are your thing. There is also an interpretation presented for a possible sequel, which would be welcomed if it can stand up to this caliber of horror. It is a terrifying experience, memorable and at the very top in it's genre."

","I seriously can't even fathom some people in this generation. I can see why some people wouldn't enjoy this as much as the originals but to give it 1/10 you seriously don't have an open concept for film.<br/><br/>For starters this is in many ways a tribute to the 1st evil dead better special effects, lots of gore and some of the most disturbing scenes in horror cinema. Evil dead in many ways is its own entity but obviously having some influence from the originals. It's more of a serious tone and loses the B rated horror film and ridiculous but hilariously cheesy scenes from the previous trilogy, instead it replaces it with some great practical special effects and a horror soundtrack that adds to the intensity and terror of the film. <br/><br/>Yes there are plot holes and yes some of the lines are cheesy but it's a freaking horror film. It's not an academy award winning film with a stellar script, it's a tribute to Sam raimi's low budget film that eventually was idolized as a cult classic. Also to anyone who thinks this movie is not cannon to the original, films how would you know? The Chevy is in the film,the cabin is more or less identical, ash shows up at the end which means it has to be in the same universe.<br/><br/>Get over yourself hipsters or butt hurt fan boys, that say they are true fans of horror because this movie has it all and more. If you can't find it in you explore hanges in someone else's vision, easy don't watch it or better yet wait until it's on Netflix and give it a whirl. <br/><br/>From an evil dead fan to the next (I watched all the TV seasons and own the first season) please watch with an open mind and give credit where it's due!"

"Screen_Blitz","8","0","3","3 February 2016"," Scary, gruesome, over-the-top reimagining of Sam Raimi's classic horror
","Remakes of classic 70s and 80s horror films tend to fall victim to mediocrity nowadays, mainly due to their failure to stay faithful to their original source material. However, once in a blue moon comes a remake of a horror film that though doesn't live up to the bar of its original, manages to pay respect to the original film. Fede Alvaraz's 'Evil Dead', a remake of Sam Raimi's classic horror thriller happens to one of those films, while paying some noticeable liberties. This film follows twenty-something year old David (played by Shiloh Fernandez), along with his three friends who take his younger sister Mia (played by Jane Levy) up a remote cabin to help her recover from her heroin addiction, as opposed to the original which centered on a vacation. When one of the friends unintentionally releases a demonic entity from the Book of the Dead, Mia becomes possessed and unleashes a horrifying terror on everyone. What results from this horror thriller is a truly terrifying experience filled with spine chilling scares as well as enough blood and gore to push its R-rating to the very limit.<br/><br/>It is no surprise that this horror remake doesn't manage to top the classic, but after all, has any remake managed to do that? What is important is that this movie succeeds on embracing the spirit of what Sam Raimi brought the 1980s classic by not only paying homages to some of the most memorable scenes like the ""tree rape"" scene, but also executing the story in an effective manner. The major difference between this and the original is this takes on a more dark and dramatic tone, unlike Sam Raimi's film which had a more cartoony, tongue-in-cheek approach. This film delivers plenty of scares from start to finish and a sheer amount of suspense to leave at the edge of your seat. If the scares are not enough, many scenes also treat you with an outrageous amount of blood and gore, enough to sensitive viewers sick to their stomach, including the climax which involves raining blood. So this movie stops at just about nothing to shock you to the core and there is rarely a dull moment throughout its runtime. The characters are well drawn out, especially Jane Levy's character who serves as the most prominent character in the story from the moment of her horrifying demonic possession, and the performances earn a solid thumps up. The characters may not stand out like what Bruce Campbell brought in the original Evil Dead trilogy as Ash, but they do whats worth. <br/><br/>While it may top what Sam Raimi brought the original film, this Evil Dead remake is both entertaining and spine-chilling scary. It is a great movie to please horror fans and one of the few horror remakes manages to succeed. Fede Alvaraz does an amazing job on capturing the spirit of the original and bringing it to this modern adaption. However, I only recommend this to those with strong stomach to absurd amounts of blood and gore because as I said, there is plenty of it. Otherwise, enjoy!"
"j-chutlashvili-958-290980","8","0","2","8 January 2016"," Almost great
","I enjoyed this film. It was good horror movie, but there were some mistakes, that's why I'm giving it 8/10.<br/><br/>I'll start with positives first: Effects & makeup were very well done. I also liked the atmosphere in the movie - the cabin in woods, witchcraft stuff in the basement, & despite, that story wasn't original & this movie is a remake, atmosphere was made well. But movie also had some mistakes, so now I start about negatives: There were some unrealistic moments. I know, it's a horror movie & it can't be realistic, but in some degrees it shouldn't exceed it's limits. For example: Woman cuts her arm & she's still with consciousness. First, if you cut your whole arm, you will loose your consciousness because of an extreme pain, second I doubt any human can cut her arm herself without strong painkillers, again because of extreme pain. Another mistake: Voice! When Mia is possessed, she sometimes speaks with a male voice. All right, I understand this. She speaks with male voice, because she is possessed with a demon, but problem is, that it's obvious that another voice actor is acting instead of her, which makes this movie again unrealistic. It would be better if they would let Jane Levy (Mia) use her own vocals. Like take an example from the movie ""The Exorcism Of Emily Rose"" where Jennifer Carpenter (Emily) uses her own vocals for screaming & growling, which makes movie more realistic. So next time my dear movie makers, take an example from that movie & let actresses/actors use their own vocals. But despite those mistakes, it's quite a good horror movie."

At the beginning of the movie it opens with a girl walking through the woods and then of her in a cellar about to be burned by her dad and she cries up until the moment her dad lights the match then looks up at him with completely yellow eyes and says I will eat your soul motherf'er! (I watched this by myself at 2 am with my lights on and TV on watching the movie on my pad, and as soon as she looked up and said that to her father my electricity turned off on my whole street I ran screaming like a 9 year old girl I am not ashamed to say this. It seemed almost too crazy of a time for my power to shut off. And for this sole moment I will give this movie a 9 out of 10 cause I finished watching the movie and it has you on edge the complete movie) I did not give it a 10 because there are clichés, and to me those are what's wrong with horror movies this day and age. But very few in this movie and like I said has you on edge the entire movie. An absolutely crazy movie. It's almost hard to believe this good of a movie was made in 2013 I know it's a remake and all but please do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you are into horror movies just hope your power doesn't go out cause that's F'ED!"

","i cant ask for more from a reboot. <br/><br/>not only is Evil Dead (2013) a lot of nerve-wracking, thigh- clamping, look-away-no-no-no-don't-look-away fun to sit through, it is surprisingly lot more meaningful than the original. this version is the perfect metaphor for sticking a chainsaw into the demons of drug addiction. given the Evil Dead canon, the ending was not at all as i expected, and it does send an important message.<br/><br/>and then there's the relationships between the characters, which are a little bit more developed than that between cartoon Ash and his forgettable soon-to-be-demon friends. this bit raised the story to a level of human drama that showed how being there for someone can ultimately lend them the strength to fight for their life.<br/><br/>as for atmosphere and setting, and blood and gore and gross bodily fluids, and bodily violations by sharp pointy objects and malicious demons: horror movie must-haves, this new version has more than enough of, and what it has is on par with the best in its category<br/><br/>voted best for Friday night sleepovers, horror-movie marathons, and anytime you want more than a plain old jump scare"

","I wasn't never really a fan of The evil dead trilogy , It is a fun to watch dumb comedish horror witch to be honest you need to be 80-90s guy to like. When i noticed that a remake is coming i wasn't too excited about it so i watched it only a year after it came out. I won't lie , I was a little disappointed that the remake has no comedy elements at all , But i can say with all of my heart that this horror title has something special to it , something you wouldn't find in the latest horror flicks . Yes it is extra gory and i wouldn't recommend it to weak stomach audience but the nice part of this movie is that you don't have to be The evil dead fan to watch it , They made it just right."

","This 2013 remake contains far too much graphic gore! I hate it when horror films feel like they must dump buckets of blood all over the movie! This movie needed to tone down the digusting graphic and pervasive gore. There were some parts of the film were good, like the beginning. The beginning might've been the best part, it was so creepy and it really started the movie off with a bang! I also thought that Jane Levy was a great choice for the lead role. I also enjoyed the last 20-30 minutes of the movie, that part was done really well. But the in between was where the digusting blood bath took place! You lose me when you just dump buckets of blood in the middle of the movie! There were a couple of scenes that were especially grotesque and just terribly digusting! Hard to watch even. I mean cutting your own tongue in half with a knife! Just gross! I really didn't care for that. I like the last part where the lead is being chased by the thing that arose from underground, while the blood rain falls from the sky. I also don't like that the leads brother was killed! I wanted both to make it out, but at least the lead made it out alive! I guess I should be thankful that somebody survived, since In some films, no one does, I hate it when that happens!! Would've been tons better without the grotesque and constant gore, I can deal with blood in a movie, but not to this extant, this was just over the top! 6/10"

","To viewers of not knowing or seeing the original The Evil Dead. <br/><br/>With Evil Dead, being a remake I heard of lot of people saying the movie wasn't scary or a horror. The genre is horror, but mostly people just were disgusted by the disturbing scenes. I had a lot of friends hating on it, some got scared, some loved it, and others just thought, WOW! That was a lot of blood. Which I can say it was all true. It was more of an intense, bloody intense movie! You either will like or hate it, the story is bout the same of the original with a few added details that weren't bad. For people who want to be scared, it may not be a horror for a scare. But for someone wanting to watch some gore-fest, perfect fit!!!<br/><br/>To all the Evil Dead fans who haven't seen it!!(If you're an Evil Dead fan, why haven't you seen it?)<br/><br/>I loved this as a remake, most will say the original is better, and I agree, The Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 is by far more hilarious and brilliant. But from the music, being epic, and the trivia and elements from the original they did an amazing job putting it together! I saw this movie with Evil Dead fans and we all laughed, and cheered at the end! A remake made pretty damn good. I just loved how they added bits and pieces of the original. Especially the famous boomstick and chainsaw. Groovy.<br/><br/>So in the end, 10/10. Why? Because I'm an Evil Dead fan, and it was an amazing remake! You'll never want to vacation to a cabin in the woods after seeing this movie. But for me? I loved the movie, and am very glad that it didn't end up being a truly awful remake. Thank you Fede Alvarez(who I had the pleasure of meeting, great guy)! So go check it out! And if you didn't see the originals, why not have a Evil Dead marathon!!! That way they all fit in and make the night a wonderful night of laughs!"
"gegen-daemon","6","0","2","18 August 2014"," 'Simply astounding!', 'Near perfect experience.. ' - It's good but I wouldn't go that far.
","When I first saw a lot of these reviews of the Evil Dead remake, I was very excited.<br/><br/>I've seen both Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2, along with Army of Darkness (with Army of Darkness actually being my favourite) and although they're all fun and I think highly of them, I wasn't going to kick up a fuss about a remake ruining my childhood, like some people are prone to.<br/><br/>But to call this 'a near perfect experience', or 'simply astounding' is a little daft. It's a good, very solid, incredibly gory horror but it does little different from other, similar genre movies and can't exactly be called entirely original.<br/><br/>On the whole, I'd recommend for fans of horror, provided you had a strong stomach but I wouldn't mislead anybody by inferring this is a stone-cold classic and you just have to see it.<br/><br/>There are many better and will be more to come too but if you lower your expectations you won't come away disappointed."

","The idea of horror remakes have been something that have been heavily debated over the past few years with so many of the classics being remade. As a massive horror fan myself, I do like the remakes. Particularly because I wasn't around when the originals were a big thing. Nevertheless I don't miss the originals either. Having said that, Evil Dead was one series that I just could not imagine them remaking. It just didn't make sense to me, because I thought the whole gross and gore era was over and done with in the 80s. <br/><br/>I loved the original Evil Dead and thought it was the best the horror genre could possibly have, because it fits perfectly into what people expect when they go to watch a horror. And Sam Raimi's dark sense of humor is unmatchable. With all this in mind, I decided to give this film a chance. And it is the single greatest thing I did. <br/><br/>Glad I caught it in the last week of its run in the cinema, I can't say I've enjoyed a horror movie as much. It far surpasses the original in so many ways, and not just because of the cool new features the advanced technology allowed it. The characters are so much more likable. The actors, most of whom don't have too many movies to their name, do an excellent job. <br/><br/>Every single element of this remake is relived by not once forgetting the original. It's gory, it has its irk factor, it gives the audience pure evil, and yes they did remake the rape of the woods, and it does not disappoint. It takes the original to a whole new level and the sense of humor is just so much darker. Having said that, they did accept that Ash (Bruce Campbell) could never be replaced, though David (Shiloh Fernandez), in his blue shirt sure tries. <br/><br/>I watched the film once, and after a long shower, decided to watch it again, as I'm sure anyone who loved the original would. I definitely recommend watching this gem, because its an experience you just wouldn't want to miss!"

","First off I hate remakes. Second off, Hollywood would rather do a remake than gamble on an original idea... I could name some great films that bombed like Pacific Rim, Kick Ass, etc...<br/><br/>So remaking classics are inevitable. With that in mind, this generation of horror fans are accustomed to gore... not the gore of the 70's and 80's but the gore of the Hostel's, the Saw's, the Human Centipede's. There has been a remake that I enjoyed and that was the Hills have Eyes, but Alexandre Aja is insanely good. The other thing to add here, we've gone to the point in films where there's nothing original... the comparisons to the Conjuring and Poltergeist are ridiculous (that's another discussion).<br/><br/>Now a classic that shouldn't have been touched. Evil Dead. I watched Evil Dead countless amounts of times, and purchased the DVD's countless amounts of times as well. Initially I was hesitant with watching the Evil Dead remake. My friend convenience me to watch it from a press screening. And then all of the reviews came out and they were mostly positive... so I went.<br/><br/>The remake is different. It's gritty, it's violent, it has a simple plot similar to the original. There's no humour in the movie, but it's fun in the haunted house / gore aspect. There are a lot of references to the original like the car, specific scenes, camera work, etc... They were able to remove the camp from the original (which I believe is mainly due to budget constraints - $10 k vs $10 million).<br/><br/>Overall a great tribute to the original. Compare this to all other horror film remakes and the recent release of horror in the last 10 years, and Evil Dead would be on top or near the top of the list."

","Generally when you hear ""remake"", you shudder. But this time, don't worry. This film take the original ""The Evil Dead"" and gives it a more serious and dark tone to it. They change a few things around, such as the reason for them going to the cabin being an attempt to get their friend off of drugs as opposed to just a weekend at a cabin. What I love is that they kept the practical effects of the original film. This makes for some absolutely amazing gore effects. Some of the best I've seen in a modern movie as of lately. There's no shortage of blood here, that's for damn sure. Fans of the original should enjoy this new take on the film, and should enjoy themselves while watching this terrifically frightening and gore filled film."
"rahmannoodles22","8","0","4","19 December 2013"," Evil Dead Remake - Noodles Review
","That was intense. So, this is the remake to Sam Raimi's '80s Evil Dead, which is considered a horror classic and one of the scariest movies of all time. Evil Dead's got a lot to live up to. Thankfully, this is one of the best horror remakes I've ever seen. Now, the story of Evil Dead is simple. A couple of friends go out to a cabin and one of them finds a mysterious book. Upon reading this book, evil is unleashed and these friends are in for hell. Now this movie is sort of a throwback to the '80s horror movies, using makeup and gore. Evil Dead is a seriously disturbingly violent and gory film; it's really not that scary but it is insanely disturbing. Really, the people in this movie are just experiencing the worst things that could ever happen to somebody in a movie. And though it's crazy, it's entertaining and intriguing to see where else it can go.<br/><br/>Evil Dead is a pretty short movie and it tries to establish its characters early on in the movie quite plainly. And though it's no Pulp Fiction, it doesn't really hinder the likability of the movie at all because we're really just here to watch them all suffer and die. Still, the amount of fear and uneasiness in the characters is, more or less, believable. And when they're scared, they are SCARED. One thing about this movie you really have to praise is how disturbing it is, and I give a lot of credit in this movie to the director. So much was going on and as much as I wanted to look away because of how much it made me cringe, I kept wanting to watch to see how far it could go and what else could possibly go wrong. The movie sort of draws you in like that. It's a short ride but an intense one at that.<br/><br/>I personally often don't like horror movies, but this movie really got into the mood of enjoying it. It was old school, it didn't overdo any special effects, and it was so disturbingly fun. As a horror film, it was great. As a movie, it was still pretty good. I really enjoy and respect a movie that knows what it is. Evil Dead knew what it was. It wasn't trying to be an Oscar-winner or even a deep movie. Its story was simple, yet interesting; and it was full of gore and gore and gore, of which was done in disturbing and awesome ways."

","The woods, cabin and characters could have been a heck of a lot better. We hardly get a feel for the woods or cabin in the movie. We care nothing about the characters because they're so undesirable.<br/><br/>Things that happen in this movie, we've seen many times before in other movies. There's nothing original about this movie.<br/><br/>If they think special effects and loud noises is what makes a movie scary, they're wrong. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie needed better woods, a better cabin, a better cast, a lot more creepy shots of the woods and other things.<br/><br/>I rated this movie a 4. I think a 5 out of 10 would be too much for the movie. It could have been a lot better."

","'Astoundingly refreshing' is a small phrase in praise of this movie. Don't exactly know what people are thinking or want to suggest while writing reviews on IMDb. I had read quite a few reviews before finally watching it on DVD and I am glad that I didn't let go of such a masterpiece in its own after reading some lame reviews. I wanted it to be as good as it actually is and probably better. The quality of gore and thrills surpass any viewer expectations without compromising on story telling and acting. The story build up is also on a better level than the original movie.This is one helluva reboot and one that would be eagerly awaited by horror movie fans worldwide for sure and the quality standard set by this movie will also be hard to match.Finally for the people who didn't like this movie 'F*** yourself.

","First time I watched...... It was astonishing- brilliant- fantastic- Remakes that follow the original scene by scene just get on my nerves because they wasted money to copy the same thing they did 20 so years ago, not this time. But one thing remakes do wrong every time.<br/><br/>this was done brilliantly- the only thing they get wrong again and again with this movie and every horror movie is casting (the girl who played Mia was freaking bad-ass- best part of the movie) but the hippie dude and Dean Winchester looking guy and the others just made the movie annoying, I mean I don't see why they have to apply the same thing to every horror flick- good looking young teenagers- I mean come on. it would have been more interesting if they had a parent staying with them- even if he died at the start it would have been more interesting- maybe the parent could have been casted as Bruce Campbell and get the movie on the fans good side, but no- filmmakers are to scared to be creative anymore. Overall, they did a brilliant job- but they could have made a great movie, instead have just a good one"

"nesfilmreviews","5","0","2","14 October 2013"," Compent homage to a franchise.
","""Evil Dead"" comes across as more of a gruesome homage, alienating itself from fans looking for the franchise's trademark of unrelenting gore and tongue-in-cheek humor. The latter-day version of ""Evil Dead,"" directed by Fede Alvarez, keeps the main focus on the gruesome element alone. Full of old-school effects, without any assistance from CGI, Alvarez's franchise entry has little to none of Raimi's humor, but certainly delivers on the carnage and bloodshed.<br/><br/>The heart of story remains intact: five college-age men and women head off to an isolated cabin in the woods. They are staging an intervention designed to get Mia (Jane Levy), who is no longer able to socially use heroin. Her four supporters are her estranged brother, David (Shiloh Fernandez), and his personality-devoid girlfriend, Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore), registered nurse Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci). In the cabin's dark, damp basement, they discover the Necronomicon, or better known as the book of the dead. Eric, in an act of overt horror movie stupidity, starts reading passages from the Necronomicon -- unknowingly unleashing the demons.<br/><br/>In his first feature film, Uruguayan director and co-scriptwriter Fede Alvarez demonstrates his wild imagination, and displays his talent for delivering the squirm- inducing images of body mutilations and other numerous atrocities. A nail gun, an electric carving knife, and a chainsaw all have their moment in the spotlight as weapons. What this new entry lacks entirely, which is so prevalent in the other movies in the franchise, is the tongue-in-cheek humor that accompanies the over-the-top gore and violence.<br/><br/>In the three decades since Raimi made ""Evil Dead,"" many have copied, adapted, or borrowed from his low-budget playbook. It's extremely challenging to pull off something original, amusing, and truly horrifying all at once. That is exactly what made last year's ""Cabin in the Woods"" (2012) such a clever, entertaining watch, and a terrific addition to the genre. Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell, who directed and co- starred in the original horror classic, have production credits in this component, yet ultimately disappointing remake. Take away the name of ""Evil Dead,"" and you're left with a movie that features your typical brainless characters who exist simply for elimination through horrific methods."
"Coventry","5","0","4","9 October 2013"," If it's gore that you want  then GORE you will get!
","Should I really state the obvious and begin my review with the confirmation that the remake can't hold a candle to the original ""The Evil Dead""? No of course not, but meanwhile I've done so anyways! That being said, even several days after watching this film, I still find it difficult to form a judgment. The unwritten but relentless rule: ""be wary of horror movies that put all sorts of praising quotes on the poster/DVD cover"" once again proves itself to be very accurate and reliable. The poster image for ""Evil Dead"" spawns a whole miscellany of glorifying words, but they are slightly exaggerated to say the least. It might be a decent and enjoyable splatter flick, but it certainly isn't ""astoundingly awesome"", it certainly did not ""blew me away"" and it most definitely isn't a ""near-perfect horror experience"". What is it, then? It's another redundant remake of a true genre milestone that didn't require a remake, but if you choose to watch it anyway, you'll be served an exhilarating and entertaining flick chock-full of blood, vulgarities and nastiness. In case you're solely looking for a gory good time you can hardly go wrong with this modernized version. Then again, Sam Raimi's landmark is over 30 years old and STILL qualifies as one of the goriest movies of all times The set-up is similar but sillier. Instead of sending her to a professional rehabilitation clinic, three idiots drag their friend to a remote cabin in the woods to help her get rid of her drug addiction. While she's going nuts and terrorizes two of her idiot friends (including her estranged brother), the third and biggest idiots stumbles upon the Necronomicon in the cellar and unknowingly awakens ancient demonic forces. The junkie girl is the first one to become possessed, while she attempts to flee from the cabin, but her dumb friend remain convinced her behavior is caused by withdrawal symptoms. Why, of course! All former junkies pour boiling water over their face and cut their tongues in half with a knife, don't they? Furthermore there isn't much coherence or substance in the plot and the protagonist characters are superficial and bland. The one and only aspects to appreciate here are the special effects and make-up. It literally rains blood and the nasty stuff that overcomes the victims is brutal and gruesome. Director Fede Alvarez only managed to create a creepy atmosphere and mysteriousness during the opening sequence (""I will swallow your soul, Daddy!""), but after that he goes straight for goo and guts."

","Friends Mia (Jane Levy), David (Shiloh Fernandez), Eric (Lou Taylor Pucci), Olivia (Jessica Lucas), and Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore) go to an isolated cabin. Mia is an addict trying to quit cold turkey. They find the Book of the Dead and all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>Fede Alvarez wrote/directed this remake of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead (1981). The movie starts off well. I wish he developed the addiction story a lot more. There is some allusion to a bigger commentary on drug rehabilitation. The action is good fun classic horror moments. It's got great classic camera movements. Everything is going well.<br/><br/>About midway, Jane Levy's character is sidelined. Shiloh Fernandez takes more center stage. Sadly, he's just a functional Latino hunk. He can't hold the screen as well as Bruce Campbell. The more interesting character is the nerdy sidekick played by Lou Taylor Pucci. Then the 3rd act gets going, and it devolves more and more into a slasher-porn movie. It's all screams, darkness, blood splashing. Even the return of Jane Levy can't save it. It ends as an exercise to see how much red paint they can splatter. This started with so much promise, but satisfied very little of it. We get none of the humor. We do get the return of the chainsaw. But Bruce Campbell saying ""Groovy"" after the credits really doesn't do it for me."

Ipersonally didn't like it much and only 30 minutes in, my husband said ""I'm bored"". Needless to say, the original was best! We are avid ""Evil Dead"" fans and miss the wit and charm of bruce Campbell. We loved that it didn't take itself too seriously and was an altogether entertaining movie from start to finish.

","All I can remember of the original Evil Dead was that it was hilarious, gory and ridiculous. This version was just gory and ridiculous. As someone who loved the comedy and cheesiness of the original I didn't really see the point in watching a remake of it without those aspects, and I was right. There is no point to this. <br/><br/>However, I feel a film has done a good job if it invokes a strong emotional reaction. Evil Dead certainly did that in terms of disgust. I was cringing throughout most of it so at least it had that going for it. <br/><br/>The acting was a mixture of really good bits and really bad bits, sometimes from the same actors, so I have mixed feelings about that. The Bruce Campbell lookalike was certainly nowhere near as charismatic however.<br/><br/>I enjoyed being grossed out for a couple of hours and it was fun to watch with friends, but I honestly don't think I'd care if I never saw it at all.

","Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of the Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.<br/><br/>The three Evil Dead films is a trilogy of inconsistencies. The opening of Evil Dead 2 rewrites the events of first Evil Dead, and Army of Darkness' opening rewrites the conclusion of Evil Dead 2. The sequencing of events has always connected only inside the audience's minds as a complete storyline. My first-ever experience with the Evil Dead franchise wasn't watching the films but instead going to see Evil Dead Musical, which combined the first two Evil Dead story lines together (which in my opinion was much better). So I didn't know what a remake would mean in context to continuing the story or what kind of expectations to have for an Evil Dead remake. So to get right into it...<br/><br/>The new Evil Dead... is so-so. I did not find the reason that justified this remake.<br/><br/>The major issue with Evil Dead is that there is no X factor. It's neither funny or has a lead performance akin to Bruce Campbell's in the original that raises the piece above the sum of its parts. I'm not asking for either again. The story plays fast and loose with its characters, as a result we never genuinely know who we should be rooting for till it's too late. The typical stupid horror movie mistakes they make are unbelievably stupid. The lack of humor in itself is not a problem but there's no additional layer or emotion contrasting to what's going on. So the audience is left simply moving through the plot points, guessing who's turn it is to die next. That would be okay if we weren't already so familiar with the story. Evil Dead completely relies on its scares to entertain the audience alone, and somehow that falls short.<br/><br/>The practical in-camera effects deserve praise, as they add effective weight to the scares and sufficient texture to the gore. The end result is quite cringe-worthy. Practical effects bring more weight to the spectacle than CGI and I applaud anyone who is not letting practical effects die. I suspect director Fede Alvarez would say the X factor is the gore and the scares. But after the Joss Whedon-produced Cabin in the Woods, I'm expecting more now by default. If only this movie was released first....<br/><br/>It's been reported Sam Raimi is going to make Army of Darkness 2, which will connect to the events of this remake. He's free to do what he wants, but it's not going to improve this Evil Dead remake by any means. For that, viewers who haven't seen The Evil Dead will be probably enjoy this more. Fans of the original like myself would probably like this remake a lot more if it wasn't called Evil Dead.<br/><br/>For more review, please visit and subscribe to my film blog - http://hkauteur.wordpress.com"

","Like many other reviewers, I really can't understand the bad reviews - this is a quality movie for horror fans. It's dark, scary at times, brutal at others, and pays fair homage to the original in my opinion.<br/><br/>I first saw the original Evil Dead when I was 8 years old secretly hiding behind a sofa in my friends house. That moment defined my love of horror for life. When I saw the trailer for this Evil Dead I was SO excited to see it and it did not disappoint. Having seen many many horror movies from Omen to Martyrs and many obscure movies like August Underground, I can honestly say this is a top notch old school style nasty horror movie. I've seen it twice now and will go back to it again. There are some very scary scenes, the gore scenes are excellent, the sound & music creepy and well timed.<br/><br/>Yes the story has holes in it, the acting is a bit weak, the characters are dumb, but it's a HORROR MOVIE and so much of the genre is like this and good for it.

","All these 1/10 ratings are ridiculous. A few things to point out to all the haters. First, anyone who talks about how the film ""lost the humor"" of the original Evil Dead should be immediately dismissed. The ""Original"" Evil Dead was NOT a comedy driven horror flick. It was, however, derived from many B-Horrors of the day. Many find humor in these movies, but it should not be confused with a comedy. With that confusion out of the way for you 1/10ers, please remember that this was a Horror movie, not a Thriller. Big difference between the two. Of course, anyone under the age of 30 has no idea what that difference is, because there hasn't been a real Horror movie promoted for decades. So I'll explain the difference. Horror movie: Blood, Gore, Jump out of your seat scares, more blood. Thriller: Makes you think, Scares your inner child, also a song by Michael Jackson that came out before most of you were born. Evil Dead has all the elements of great Horror flick ten times over. It is not as good as the original, and not the scariest movie you'll ever see, but it's still the best Horror movie in 20+ years to hit the screens. If you didn't like the movie, no problem.

","Just saw this movie last week.Fan of the original but only seen the original once.And don't remember much about it and couldn't really compare that with this remake.Other than the blonde girl's acting I thought everyone's acting was pretty decent.Specially Jane Levy's acting is worth mentioning since she is mainly known for comedy.Playing such an intense and horrific character really proves her ability as an actress.There was definitely enough gore .Less CGI and more real make up made them look scary too.But this movie is definitely more gory than it is scary.However I don't like the storyline much.Its kinda common.Reminded me of the Friday the 13th movie.Though i do like the reason for which they didn't leave the cabin.Camera work was OK but could have been better in some of the scenes.Just wanna say that this movies feeds enough when it comes to gore.It can't be compared to the original and people shouldn't either because no remake can ever surpass any original movie.This movie stands OK on its own but since its a part of the franchise now and people can't help but compare it to the original one.I am giving it a 6/10 ."
"lidtkejosh","6","0","14","16 July 2013"," Evil Dead
","Evil Dead is not ""the most terrifying film you will ever experience."" But, what in lacks in scares, it makes up for in excessive amounts of blood. This train-wreck of a story centers around a group of friends traveling to a small cabin in the woods, to rehabilitate Mia, who is a recovering drug addict as well as a close friend. No more needs to be said, because that is where the solid plot ends; the rest of the movie is a pointless gore fest that loses its momentum after 15 minutes. But, we must see this movie for what it is; it is a horror movie. They really don't need a solid plot; just a hero, a villain, and scares. This movie is perfect for the high school/college horror-lover, and not for anyone else. If you like logic in your movies, this will get on your nerves, and very quickly (If you are one of those people, a movie that I recommend instead is ""The Cabin in the Woods""). In summary, it is a decent movie, with enough graphic content to keep teenagers entertained, and keep you up for a couple nights."

The evil presence possesses them until only one is left to fight for survival.<br/><br/>'Evil Dead' fails to frighten, but repulses nevertheless.

"chaos-rampant","Null","0","17","15 July 2013"," They refurbished the cabin
","The original was great. It was for me one of those sublime rituals of adolescence that involve an empty house, latenight horror and drinking with friends. The film was great because it played so so well to all that: the shared Scooby-do adventure in the dark, the creaky house, the ritual of summoning fears, the gooey splatter. <br/><br/>The amateurishness mattered, it was the same communication I'd find in Black Flag records, something for 'us' to get.<br/><br/>So I cherish that film enough to think that teenagers now deserve the same fun. In fact that sums up Raimi's own involvement with the project, looking that it's done right for another generation of young viewers.<br/><br/>What irks me here is that they diluted the appeal.<br/><br/>First off, the main context behind the trip to the woods is not simple teenage fun, but coping with drug addiction. Right away, this radically changes the air of the viewing experience to serious and glum, we are not there to explore but endure an ordeal. Sticking with the cinematic environment, gone is the unvarnished immediacy of the original. Here, a sense of slick grayness pervades, the same color processed mist that seems to settle on most horror films these days.<br/><br/>So gone is the goofiness and livingness of the original. As itself? The film is nastier and probably as energetic once it picks up, I'm sure it will find many champions over the years especially as this generation grows up and recalls the experience. Anyway, the original will always be there so there's no harm done. As reinterpretation it's fine, more generic for my taste but decent."

","From the perspective of a person that hasn't seen the original movie this is my opinion:<br/><br/>I think the movie wasn't THAT bad, the only thing that makes it bad it's the fact that the poster and the tagline is full of over-the-top phrases of how good this movie is, hence you expect it to be this a super mega horror film, but in fact it's just another popcorn flick.<br/><br/>I saw this movie without actually knowing it was a remake and without knowing what the poster looked like, I'm working as in intern at an University, and since it's vacation time (It's July) the work at the office is slow, so my colleague brought this movie to entertain us while we were there, and I thought it was OK, it made me laugh at times because of the awful special effects and all those fake colors, but it isn't the worst movie I have seen.<br/><br/>The characters were, yeah boring, but you don't need to get attached to them since you know they're gonna die, (it's a horror movie after all) so it's fine with me. <br/><br/>If you find yourself bored one afternoon, and you got nothing to see, it's alright to watch this film."

Not overly frightening but the suspense is great and it is very well acted and produced. <br/><br/>The genius of this movie is that it isn't over done with gore and special effects which ruin the concept. There is just enough grotesqueness involved with the evil presence that leave you thinking that maybe, just maybe, this could happen and make you think how the f*#k would I escape that?!<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the original maybe you shouldn't have high hopes but to the younger generation I would definitely recommend this movie.

","Alright, there are so much hate towards this movie based on how everyone is expecting it to be just as good as the originals. you cant really expect that from a remake. Although there are some things that bothered me there was quite a bit i liked.<br/><br/>GOOD throughout the movie you can see bits and pieces of the original they kept. Ashe's car that Mia was sitting on, the necklace her brother gives her was similar to the one Ashe gives to his girlfriend and a subtle one is the cards that Eric was playing with while sitting on the swing. that to me was a nice bit for the original fans.<br/><br/>BAD Eric is looking over the the book of the dead and sees all the symptoms of someone thats possessed. and only starts saying something after the third symptom. Idiot. ""oh she's just going through withdrawal, just puked a gallon of blood. no big deal""<br/><br/>GOOD love how its not the same story. giving them a way to bring back people from the possessed state. kinda gives that hope. and its crazy how this movie has so many climax points where u think they are done but nope.. keeps going .<br/><br/>BAD I find it stupid how this cabin they are at was one they owned and have been there a year before. but these random people that we don't see again that seem to be locals, deal with the same situation in their cabin right before that .. did they rent it out to that family. where the F did those other weird people come from and why don't we see them again since they look like experts on that stuff. it would of just made more sense to say that they rented the cabin for a cheap price, like the original. instead of saying they owned it. and make up some other stuff about their good childhood memories. It would of been as simple as just a few changes in the dialog. <br/><br/>GOOD what i really enjoyed is how they used the original soundtrack when all hell breaks loose. and Mia's demon speaks for the first time ""we have a awaken from our ancient slumber, one by one blah blah blah"", its really in the background of it all but you can hear it.. so awesome.<br/><br/>BAD it seems they were trying to make the brother one of the main protagonist but failed miserably. the guy had not scene presence and they made his character so weak. what was made to seem like what someone will do for their family just made it look cowardly.<br/><br/>GOOD The gore, oh my god, the gore. it wasn't that it was so bloody. it was the fact that they would really emphasize the cutting. each cut seemed to slow down and you feel it for the character. <br/><br/>GOOD they kept the whole camera flying through the woods to build up the tension, i was seriously hoping for that.<br/><br/>-clarification on the 5 souls. some people say it only possessed 3 or 4 souls.. which isn't the case.. it possessed Mia at the start even though she got freed still counts, her brother's girlfriend obviously. Eric's girlfriend, obviously, Eric for sure, and her brother was being possessed when Eric stabbed him, so thats all five. even though it was slightly unclear. they should of at least showered her brother starting to turn.<br/><br/>conclusion I went in this movie with no expectations. and came out of it thinking it was decent. it was more of a tribute to the great trilogy we've come to know by the great Bruce Campbell."
"GlassSaw10","6","0","10","10 July 2013"," Not much substance, and Not enough camp,
","The movie could have been so great and so scary, but it just comes up short. There is absolutely no time setting up the characters, no chance for character development. We don't get to know these characters, so we cannot really understand the choices that they make. Ex: Why is Eric so interested in the book? <br/><br/>There was a lot of fan service in this movie; you could tell that the directors really liked Evil Dead, they even when as far as to incorporate audio from the original. There was just too much fan service; one example is when Olivia cut off her arm. She cuts it off to stop the possession, but it doesn't work. So why is their a scene of her cutting off her arm if the directors knew it wasn't going to work? Because Ash cuts off his hand in Evil Dead 2. I think that trying to put too much of the original in this was a bad idea. I understand that if they had not done it that the fans would be outraged, but there has to be a subtler ways to do it.<br/><br/>This movie also was not campy enough for what they were trying to do. They wanted this set in the ""real"" world. The gore (which was great) and the setting were all based on what would happen in the real world. When people got injured, their wounds didn't magically heal in the next scene. When they get hit by something you can almost feel the bones breaking underneath. I liked all that stuff, but then they tried to give the characters One Liners. I felt this was a little out of place in this movie. The tone they were going for was very serious, And so when Mia says ""Feast on this"" at the end of the film and jams a Chainsaw thru the Evils head, it seems a little out of place. There is no room for a one liner in a serious movie. If they wanted to incorporate One Liners then they should have made the film a little goofier, they should have injected a little more camp and the One Liners would have fit in perfectly.<br/><br/>I thought that the big bad in this movie was a little lame. After the demon devours 5 souls (I only counted 3, 4 if you count the dog) then blood will rain from the sky(this was cool) and the Evil will emerge from the earth. When the Evil finally does show up it's in the form of a girl, and she is defeated pretty quickly. Mia just literately stands there while The Evil SLOWLY comes into range of her chainsaw. Then its all over, Mia kills it easily. I'm sorry but was I suppose to be scared of this Evil? Where was the giant tree face like in Evil Dead 2? Where were the possessed trees? Where was the ominous fog? Where was anything that was in the original that gave you the sense that The Evil was always around and always ready to get you? The Evil was always felt in the original, you always felt that it was watching, not so much in this one. There was one cool part where the Evil pushed over a car with its bare hands. But that begs the question: Where was this strength the whole time? Why was the Evil having such a hard time crawling out of the hole? Why couldn't it keep hold of Mia with its super demon grip? Why was it crawling so slowly? Just like everything else in this film, it came up short.<br/><br/>And the Last thing to nit pick about was the lack of dismemberment. Don't get me wrong, there was a lot of blood and gore in this film. It was all done practically with no CGI so I liked that. The Movie states that the only way to stop these creatures is to Burn them, Bury them, or dismember them. The problem is that they never actually dismember anyone, and yet that seems to stop them. In the original Ash and Scott had to cut the girls into pieces in order to stop them. In this one it seems that doing some damage to the brain will kill them. In the case of Olivia, all they did to her was blow off her arms, and suddenly she is dead. A little bit of arm loss would not have stopped the demons in the first one. The movie sets up the rule that the body must be dismembered, but then didn't follow thru. And don't get me started on the alternative methods of ""saving someones soul."" They can Burn or bury someone alive, and that, to me, just seemed like a cop out for the dismemberment. Why they felt the need to add that in I have no idea.<br/><br/>Alright! Enough with the negative stuff. The gore was great. There was lots of blood. The pace was quick, the movie did not lag in the middle. I liked the opening, where we see a completely different set of characters deal with the book. I also liked the fact that they were there to help their friend detox. It gave then a nice reason to be at the cabin in the first place, and it also gave the characters a reason to stay.<br/><br/>The original did a better job of creating dread, as well as a mythology. But go and see it for the gore and the one or two jump scares that might get you. It was fun quick, they defiantly could have done a worse job."
"smileybug-356-78305","8","0","10","8 July 2013"," If you can stand the HUGE amount of gore, pretty good movie
","I have not seen the first Evil Dead. So I am basing this review entirely on my thoughts of only this movie. First, if you are squeamish at all about blood and gore, this movie is most definitely NOT for you. If you aren't bothered by it, than this movie is actually pretty good. There are some obvious parts where, like in any other horror movie, you are sitting there saying, ""please, no halfway intelligent person would do this"". The thing I liked best about this movie was the demon which possesses Mia. Very scary looking, especially all the scenes in the cellar and when it was peaking out of the cellar. I reminded of Linda Blair in Exorcist. The big question I had was, in the book Eric found, it said the demon had to get 5 souls and then it would be released from hell. I don't think it ever got the 5 souls. As you see in the movie, there is one part where one of the characters dies, but it isn't by the demons hand. So his soul wouldn't have been taken by the demon. Then, the soul of Mia, although originally possessed, gets returned to her by the actions of David, so again, no soul there either. Ahh, but no horror movie is without goofs! I still liked it and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, VERY Gory, horror movie."
"PassPopcorn","8","0","10","16 May 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","To be honest, I was sceptical when I heard the news that an Evil Dead remake was being made. And, seriously, who wasn't? The original (and the whole trilogy) was an excellent trash movie that perfectly combined horror and low budget comedy. The remake couldn't have possibly top that. Regardless, a serious question remained – who will replace the genius Bruce Campbell and his character Ash? No one is good enough to fit his shoes. Furthermore, rumors started circulating, about the fact that Diablo Cody was going to write the screenplay. In that moment, I was sure the remake would be God awful. Suddenly, something miraculous happened. Initial reactions from the screenings were really positive. And, thankfully, Diablo Cody didn't write the screenplay after all. She just 'polished' and 'americanized' it (whatever that means), and wasn't even included in the credits. My hopes for the movie went up, I was actually eager to see it and when I finally did, I wasn't disappointed. Of course, that doesn't mean this remake is without flaws. And I'm still going to blame Diablo Cody for them, because I can.<br/><br/>In case you don't know, Evil Dead is about a group of five young people who go into a remote cabin in the woods and there, by pure chance, summon bloodthirsty demons. The demons start possessing them one by one and the survivors have to fight for their lives. This time, there is a little twist on the classic story – the main female character, Mia (Jane Levy), is an ex-junkie who is going through withdrawal. In fact, her friends organised the trip to the cabin as a part of her rehabilitation and they plan on keeping her there, by all means necessary, until she gets better. Apart from that, the remake follows the original story – more or less. In addition to the plot similarities, there are numerous references to the original trilogy which I liked in particular. Currently, there are some other rumors circulating – that the original and the remake are a part of the same universe and that there could probably be a crossover in the future where Ash would meet the surviving character(s) (I won't give out any spoilers) of the remake. I stand behind that completely, and I would really love to see it happen.<br/><br/>Anyway, the Evil Dead remake is pretty good. The movie relies much more on practical effects instead on CG ones, which is always a plus and gives it a certain old school vibe. That being said, the movie is rather gory. It's one of the bloodiest, most violent movies I've seen in quite a while. Which, depending on the way you look at it, may be a good or a bad thing. I certainly liked it – the original trilogy was also extremely bloody from time to time, although this movie does go an extra mile. The remake also has a creepy, uncomfortable atmosphere through it. It also produces several effective scares. So, strictly viewing it as only a horror movie, the Evil Dead remake fulfilled its cause. This time, we even had a little more insight on the Book of the Dead. That serves mainly as a plot device, to explain the nature of the demon that is possessing everyone. Still, it was nice to find out more about the whole Evil Dead lore. All in all, the upside of this remake is that it's a fun, violent, gory movie, with plenty of references to the original. If that sounds appealing to you and you're into the horror genre, this flick will surely keep you entertained. I'd even say that the majority of the fans of the original will be ultimately satisfied or, at least, won't be severely disappointed.<br/><br/>As I said, the movie does have a few flaws. This one isn't necessarily a flaw, but all the characters in the movie seemed like stereotypic modern horror movie characters (damn you, Diablo Cody!). This isn't automatically bad, but it kind of goes against that old school vibe I mentioned. However, to be frank, the Evil Dead movies were never about the characters (save Ash, of course). Also the guy who plays the male lead David, Mia's brother (Shiloh Fernandez), did an awful acting job, I am not sure how he managed to land a role. The next flaw is that the movie sometime takes itself too seriously. By no means would I call this movie a serious one but still, the whole concept of the Evil Dead franchise is that they are just ridiculous movies and should be treated that way. So yes, this movie really did need an Ash character to elevate things a little. But, even though he wasn't there, I had a great time and enjoyed myself nevertheless.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"Jeff_Dahmer2014","Null","0","9","15 May 2013"," If ""Ash"" is your primary concern for this movie, then I suggest you don't see it.
","First of all, I am a huge fan of the original EVIL DEAD, and when I heard it was being remade, sure...I had reasonable doubts. Everyone will...and classics should be left alone...unless handled by well known directors, specifically horror ones. Take an example at the original ""The Hills Have Eyes"". Now...since I saw Aja's ""Haute, or HIGH TENSION..etc SWITCHBLADE ROMANCE"" I honestly didn't have any worries because he showed and created such a strong and disturbing impact with that film.<br/><br/><ul><li>I just saw EVIL DEAD as it recently arrived at my local cinema, and boy...the bloodshed, the extreme violence and carnage...the movie won't disappoint you when it comes to graphic violence. Now we all know the original EVIL DEAD was in it's own way a black comedy...it wasn't truly scary...but the other things made it a true classic...a horror gem. This remake does certain things a different way (I won't spoil which).</li></ul><br/><br/>Before heading off to the ""GOOD"" and ""BAD"", I'll just mention one thing (one little thing that several people are probably cracking their heads open out of anger...because they just can't see with reason.) There is no Ash...no Bruce Campbell...sorry everyone. But people...honestly, he can't play the same character again...it's not the 1980's anymore, jeez! And if they picked another actor or renamed the already casted one to ""Ash""...would you be upset then? Of course you would...only Bruce Campbell can portray Ash, right? Well, I do agree with you...on some level...but give the other actors a chance. The acting in this movie was great...no one was terrible or anything close to that. So stop beating yourself up and posting rubbish nonsense about how you won't see it ""no Ash, no cash"" and other crap. Guess what? No one gives a damn...it's not an opinion, it's ""lashing out"", out of stupidity...you cannot realise that something, sometimes can't go your way.<br/><br/>Now the GOOD points.<br/><br/><ul><li>The GOOD -The opening scene is great, in a way like ""DRAG ME TO HELL"" but with less, or should I say no humour at all. Chillingly well done.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The music in the film is absolutely incredible...capturing the essence of dread and isolation spot on, not to mention the beautiful and dark cinematography. This is the true highlight throughout the entire film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters are developed well (not perfect) but they aren't one dimensional either. Stupid at times (a lot, yes) but you care about them...at least I did. And they had a reason for going out to the cabin (unlike the original where it was just pointless). The main character's sister is/or was since she sweared not to do it anymore, a drug addict. And you can really feel the chemistry between the actors (especially with David and Mia) - The violence in the film is extremely graphic, bloody and gory to HIGH heaven. I won't tell any of it, but just know...dismemberment is this movie's mother. And another excellent thing is the lack of CGI...great prosthetic usage and good makeup effects. Congratulations for not using CGI...it would greatly distract everyone and it would look ugly and terrible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The overall atmosphere is really beautiful at the beginning (not the ""very"" beginning). When it comes to jump-scares, yes...you can expect some of them...but some come out completely at random points. So I really don't have any issue with this film's ""jumpy moments"".</li></ul><br/><br/>Now there is plenty of great stuff to write down from this film, I just wrote the main ones / the ones I considered to be truly great.<br/><br/><ul><li>The BAD</li></ul><br/><br/>Honestly...not that much. There are far worse remakes to horror classics. I don't think I have to mention them.<br/><br/><ul><li>Sometimes I think the pacing could've slowed down and develop the character more...so what if it's slow-ish, at least you get to know the people that are gonna get brutally sliced and dismembered.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Some of the effects (like the vomiting for instance) looked weird and tomato soup like...the expired kind. Also some bad CGI is present if you look closely at severed body parts / areas in some scenes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The ending was rushed and was kind of cliché. But at least there is a awesome chase sequence.</li></ul><br/><br/>And that's it...um, for the BAD points. I won't mention more, because to me...there isn't any. I loved this EVIL DEAD and I still love the original of course, but I certainly won't forget this one as it was a complete joyride of terror and gruesome violence and images.<br/><br/>GIVE it a chance...when you see it...when you consider renting it (if not for yourself, but let's say for watch with a friend) have an open mind and don't have a speech bubble floating above your head that contains ""Ash, Ash, Ash"". Because then...you really are lost in time and space.<br/><br/>PS: David, Eric, Mia, Olivia, Natalie (Don't you just love the way they named the characters) ^_^"
"eonbluedan-1","5","0","7","14 May 2013"," Well made but forgettable
","As with most of these remakes nowadays, it is not to say they are not better made films, but they are often not a touch on the original. Evil Dead lacks a lot of what made Raimi's film so legendary; it lacks a lot of the humour, it contains scenes that don't really hang together, characters who aren't much more than fodder and whose decisions don't always make a whole lot of sense. Some of the editing in places is more messy than need be and it is ultimately a bit forgettable. This is not to say, however, that it is not gleefully, wilfully gory fun, not to mention, at times, quite an exciting experience. A mixed bag; best rented."

Not much to say really.<br/><br/>Gore<br/><br/>Lot's of overkill blood that I like, again, with the original in mind. But there is just too much saw-like moments, where it's not scary but it's just sickening to look at something. In the original franchise, you didn't see Ash cut off his arm, but your imagination did that for you. Here you just see it. It's boring, and disgusting. <br/><br/>Acting<br/><br/>Besides the blond guy with the glasses, everyone was horrible, and I did not care one bit about them. The blond guy was great though, and all the unbelievable pain he went through was a good take on the old Evil Dead humor. He also was the only one with a brain.<br/><br/>Writing<br/><br/>The thing that killed this movie though was the use of the word bitch, and rape, and what-not.<br/><br/>""your sister is being raped in hell!"" ""Come here and let me suck your cock, little bitch"".<br/><br/>Is this the exorcist? Completely stupid. What happened to classic lines as:<br/><br/>""I'll swallow your soul!""<br/><br/>This is what killed the movie and made it not worth more that a 6. It's a horror movie, and an average one at that, that felt the urge to follow the ""we need a lot of swearing"" thing that's going on in horror's lately.<br/><br/>Fun flick, but no more, and a bit too disgusting. A few really good scares in it though. <br/><br/>And the ending is a disappointment for those that have seen the original."
"thewillt08","6","0","10","19 April 2013"," Gore > Scare?
","Kids in their twenties in a cabin in the middle of the woods to help their friend get through heroine withdrawals. There is the obvious stoner, the dumb girl, the hot girl, the troubled girl, and the strong, older brother. Here we go, this is the review for Cabin in the Woods, oh wait I already reviewed Cabin in the Woods, oh wait this is Evil Dead, oh wait, their almost the same movie. Evil Dead is a remake and Ii starts out like every horror movie ever. I hate horror movies today because they follow the exact same formula but at least the second half was mainly different and changed it up a bit. Evil Dead has a basic storyline, isn't scary at all, but it very disturbing with a lot of blood and gore, but it was enjoyable.<br/><br/>It's obvious that a evil spirit or demon is present in a house, or in this case cabin, the obvious answer is to leave. I give Evil Dead the benefit of the dead because they stay for the main character who is struggling with heroine withdrawals so when she acts nuts it makes sense that they stay. How would they know she was possessed by a demon? Then when they finally realize what they have done it's too late, so touché Evil Dead. This still follows the stereotypical cliché horror movie. They find an evil book and of course they read it even though it says not to read it in blood on one of the pages. That's our story to the movie, basic, you know who will live and who will die, but at least it's still entertaining to see how.<br/><br/>I was hoping that the atmosphere of a movie theatre would boost the scare factor while saw this movie, but it didn't. I cringed at the gore and jumped at most of the jump scares but that's not scary. Jump scares are the worst form of a scare in a movie, especially in horror movies because you expect it. So if you are concerned about being scared then you have nothing to lose with this one. However, if you have a weak stomach and don't like blood and gore you may want to reconsider. The gore is intense with arms being cut off, chainsaws, it rains blood, ya real blood, and I laughed, nail guns, shotguns, crowbars, third degree burns, and the poor girl even gets raped by a tree, I did not laugh. That probably crossed a line. There is a few things a movie should never do, one is murder kids, that's just a no no. The second is definitely getting raped by a tree, that's beyond unnecessary. Other than the tree the most disturbing image was when the girl licks the knife and cuts her tongue in half. It was hard to watch.<br/><br/>Other than that the gore was awesome and made the movie that much better. There was one character, whose name I'm forgetting because the characters were so forgettable, but he suffered the most. He got a needle in the eyelid, nails in the arm, he got stabbed, anything bad really happened to him. He was probably my favorite character because well I don't even know why, but he was. He made me laugh along with the gore. I'm not sure why but there were a lot of scenes where I just laughed and laughed. Especially when she talks with a weird whisper to her brother saying they need to leave because there was a demon or something there with them. I couldn't help it, I just laughed. The scene when they discover the cats hanging in the basement, laughed. The chainsaw, laughed. I probably laughed too much for a horror movie but I was entertained.<br/><br/>The acting is usually awful in these types of movies but Evil Dead wasn't as bad as I expected. Characters are usually irrelevant and are just there to look pretty, be dumb, or die in a sadistic way. Now these characters existed but the relationship between the brother and the possessed sister was interesting. They have a dark and troubled past and it shows a little characterization in them and I liked it. It sucked me into the story a little bit and I even felt a little sympathy for them, but only a little. <br/><br/>The character I hated the most was the black girl, no not because she was black, but because she was so obnoxious. I hated everything about her character and I was counting the minutes until she died. I could not wait until the demon tore her to shreds. When it happened, I could not have been happier. The demon was interesting because it possessed the body and made them kill themselves which I thought was neat. I don't want to spoil it but when it's all said and done you will probably clap because it was so awesome and fulfilling. <br/><br/>Overall, Evil Dead was a lot better than I thought it was going to be. It wasn't as scary as I wanted it to be but I didn't feel like I wasted my money either. I loved the gore, loved the demon, and thought the deaths were sadistic but fun to watch. I laughed more than I should have but that's not a bad thing either. I thought it was funnier than most of Adam Sandler's movies recently. I hated the acting, but I had low expectations, didn't really get into the characters, the story was bland and predictable, but it's a horror movie and for a horror movie it was good. For a movie overall it wasn't but I can't compare a horror to a comedy or to a drama. All movies should be judged based on their genre and for this genre it passes. Evil Dead gets The WillyT Recommendation. Go see and be disturbed by all the blood in this movie."

","I went to the theater with an open mind for this one. I held the original close to my heart but knew the revamp would be nothing like it. I knew if I had high expectations of the perfect remake i would be highly disappointed. I've been sifting through the reviews for this film and haven't too many positive words. I must be a ""sociopathic teenager"" because I quite enjoyed this film. <br/><br/>Horror as a genre is pretty much dead. REAL horror anyways. In the age of SAW 6, Hostels,remakes, adaptations, and borrowed ideas nothing is original anymore. Viewers have become so desensitized that nothing is scary or gross. If this film could be scored strictly on shock value I would give it a 9.It was actually raining blood at one point. <br/><br/>What the story lacked was easily made up for in blood. The acting was beyond horrible, but I've never known horror movies or at least ""friends in the woods slasher movies"" to be acting showcases. You almost go into the theater knowing you're going to laugh at a few lines. <br/><br/>The characters were 2 dimensional which was perfect. How connected do I really want to become with a character I know is going to die in 20 minutes. Makes it easier to say goodbye. <br/><br/>The story was sub par, full of plot holes. The triple ending twist was probably the best part of the story which isn't saying much. Although how in depth and interesting could the story be, 4 people, cabin, book of evil. Of all the things this film lacks it makes up for shock value, gruesome realistic gore, visual effects, and music. If I was so desensitized I'm sure I would've been cringing the entire film.<br/><br/>And for all the people who think Raimi and Campbell would be ashamed of this film, they were both involved. Just wait for a little message at the end of the credits ;)"
