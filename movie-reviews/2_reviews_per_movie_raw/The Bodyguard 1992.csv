","Why do people trash this movie? It's not high art but it's thoroughly entertaining. WH's performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner's idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of 'I will Always Love You' acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE."

","The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.<br/><br/>Trust me this is better than you think it is.<br/><br/>The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.<br/><br/>Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy."

","Frank Farmer is a top line bodyguard, formerly secret service protector to President Reagan, he is approached to guard Rachel Marron, the latest pop sensation on the cusp of Hollywood domination. After initially being reluctant to take the job, Farmer gets to the task of protecting Rachel from a potential maniac who's been sending her threatening letters. As the initial in camp hostilities die down, Frank & Rachel start to draw ever closer, but so does the person who wants her dead...<br/><br/>The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen (it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s) and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him. Then it resurfaced in 1979 with Diana Ross to play opposite Ryan O'Neal, but the two stars just couldn't get on and the project again fell by the wayside. Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance (thankfully) of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary. In stepped Whitney Houston (brilliantly diva casting), Costner gave himself a crew cut (in homage to McQueen) and The Bodyguard went on to make $410,900,000 worldwide.<br/><br/>The film now seems like a myth to me because the rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture. That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it has got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core. The good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, even with that song that seemed to top the charts for years! (the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone).<br/><br/>In spite of the obviousness of the plot, and the general feeling of familiarity, The Bodyguard has much going for it, things that ensured it became a monster hit and had cinema goers queueing round the block to see it. Houston is something of a revelation, here she nails the diva bitch heart of gold portrayal of Rachel with astonishing ease, and couple that with a voice sent from some deity paradise far away, makes her total value for money. Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with. The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.<br/><br/>See it with someone you love, don't just take my word for it, look at the box office take, it doesn't lie. 7/10"
"mjw2305","7","70","89","25 December 2006"," I quite enjoyed it
","The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.<br/><br/>With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I have watched many action movies but this one makes one think: what happens next? This material could have been handled badly, but it comes out refined and elegant.<br/><br/>Both Whitney Hustoun and Kevin Costner stay true to their types, yet sharing a common purpose giving a spiritual dimension to the movie as observed by a commentator.<br/><br/>This is not a conventional romantic movie and that is why many are disappointed. It is a throwback to old concepts of chivalry and knighthood. The remarkable point to observe is that it is a modern story about an independent woman and her child.<br/><br/>This is a movie which feels good and genuine in the end."
"PWNYCNY","10","50","71","3 August 2006"," Wonderful Movie
","Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch."

"g-kupresanin","Null","92","145","13 September 2004"," The best bad movie ever
","The Bodyguard is a movie with many flows and one redeeming factor: the WH factor. People went to see this picture because they wanted to see Whitney singing and she delivered some of her most passionate vocal performances before the mesmerised eyes of her millions of fans on the big screen. Let's face it, who wants to see her acting when she can sing so beautifully? <br/><br/>The unrelenting criticism by couch 'drama experts' of her acting seems a tad over the top. She never claimed to be an actress and despite this being her film debut, she did not disgrace herself. She did the best she could with what she was given: a patchy character with very little to say. What else could she do to play this role? Well, just what she did, sing her heart out.<br/><br/>The best thing that Kevin Costner did was to insist that Whitney was the only one he wanted for this part. He knew he had a winner, but he also tried to do too much with the story: a romantic thriller with patches of 'comedy', a study in professional-personal conflict and 'who done it' thrown in. That's the reason for the plot's erratic turns and the non existent character development. The glue that holds the whole mess together is Whitney, the singer, looking stunning and sounding like an angel.<br/><br/>This could have been a gigantic flop and instead it was a massive hit. It will remain a phenomenon in popular culture because it delivered what the vast majority of its audience wanted: escapism, a couple of hours away from their own reality and a look inside the glamorous life of a superstar. They were entertained by a great pop singer, who had made a huge video clip for her songs and they did not mind paying for the privilege. Those who hate The Bodyguard, went to see it with some unrealistic expectations of 'serious cinema and acting'?! Hey, go to see foreign movies with subtitles for that and come down from your pretentious cloud."
"charlotte-yonge","9","14","20","7 February 2011"," I didn't like it that much the first time around...
","but oh! it was magic to see it again after all these years. Probably the most awkward time to do so, alone, in the middle of the night, when most IMDb reviews suggested to watch it with your ""sweetheart"", i rebelled, thinking I can handle the oozing cheese coming out of the film from all sides.<br/><br/>Honestly though, for a Hollywood flick, it's a classic. I know there's a love/hate thing going on with The Bodyguard, but it should be all love, if not for anything else, the two leading stars Kevin Costner (at the prime of his career) & Whitney Houston (at the prime and beauty of hers). You don't see a lot of chemistry these days like the one these two had, they must of known they were meant for their parts because they were played so well under the circumstances. It's *hard* to make a decent movie when it's partly a musical. You have action + suspense + romance + and epic soundtrack rolled into one, you think people would be happy? But no. It's either Whitney's acting is horrid, or Kevin is too short. Well maybe he is, but I still enjoyed their performances nonetheless.<br/><br/>What I also liked about this movie was its heart. There were the lovable other body guards, the cute kid, the envious sister, and intimacy like you've never seen! Call me immature, but by the end I was gushing (not crying) simply gushing over their last passionate kiss goodbye. This film was made to be remembered, a sort of time warp back to the 1990s, when there weren't cell phones, but soundtracks about real love, and a lot of spandex (as you will see in numerous outfits throughout the movie.) In a nutshell, I loved it. Fully recommend it, because we all get those late night cravings for ultimate cheese, and this wasn't so much as cheese as it was heart-warming, butterflies in your stomach, at least that's the feeling I got. Open up your mind & heart (corny, yes) to The Bodyguard... and no I will not stoop down to add to the pre-crack Whitney jokes. Goodnight folks."
"PortugalOle7","6","21","35","7 October 2006"," Costner and Houston's chemistry save a bland plot
","A movie/music star who needs protection from a psychotic fan, wow what a concept. And who better to play it than Whitney Houston, a stretch I know.<br/><br/>The plot is totally disappointing and bland. Luckily the on-screen romance and chemistry from Houston and Costner, along with a great soundtrack, save this film from being a total bust. The love story between Costner and Houston becomes the main driving force, preventing the film from running out of ideas. In the end the romance is what you take away from the film, not the convoluted mystery plot.<br/><br/>It's enjoyable in the end and I would recommend it. Of course the soundtrack is one of the best and most popular in history with ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Run to You"", ""I Have Nothing"", and ""I'm Every Woman."""
"JamesHitchcock","6","22","39","20 July 2006"," Adequate Thriller-Romance
","I was interested to note from your ""Trivia"" page that it was originally intended to make this film in the seventies with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the leading roles, but that the film never got made because it was ""too controversial"". The cause of the controversy was presumably the mixed-race love-affair between Frank and Rachel, as there is little else in the script that might upset anyone. The story centres around Frank Farmer, a former Secret Service agent now working as a private bodyguard. He is hired by Rachel Marron, an African-American pop star, who has been receiving death threats, presumed to come from a mad stalker. Frank's obsessive concern with security initially alienates both Rachel and some of the other members of her entourage, but, after a number of misunderstandings, he becomes first her friend and then her lover. He, however, is unhappy about becoming emotionally involved with a client and ends the affair. He would also like to end his employment with Rachel, but she is becoming genuinely frightened for her own safety, and he agrees to stay on to protect her when it is clear that she is in danger from an unexpected source.<br/><br/>When I first saw this film in the cinema I disliked it. I was a great admirer of Kevin Costner's performance in ""Dances with Wolves"", and I went to see ""The Bodyguard"" in the hope that it would be a film of similar scope and vision. Of course, it isn't, but then it was never intended to be. Having seen it again recently on television, I was rather more impressed than I had been the first time. There is a respectable performance from Costner as Frank, a man who on the surface seems cold and detached but who hides his emotions under the surface- not only his love for Rachel, but also his feelings of guilt stemming from the assassination attempt on President Reagan in 1981. Frank was not on duty at the time- in fact, he was attending his mother's funeral- but he cannot escape from the thought that, if he had been present, he could have prevented the President from being shot.<br/><br/>Whitney Houston is a beautiful woman, with a beautiful voice which was shown off to good advantage in this film. Her rendition of ""I Will Always Love You"" is one of the most haunting ballads I know, far superior to the Dolly Parton original. Her character is supposed to be an actress as well as a singer- the finale actually takes place as she receives a ""Best Actress"" award at the Oscars. Unfortunately, it seems unlikely that Whitney will ever emulate her alter ego in this respect, as her acting is certainly not in the same class as her voice. She seems to have too small an emotional range, and it is no surprise that her subsequent film career has been so patchy. ""The Bodyguard"" is a perfectly adequate thriller-romance, if at times too slow-moving, but I felt that it might have been better with a more commanding female lead. 6/10"
"NewEnglandPat","3","16","27","24 May 2009"," A lightweight melodrama
","Whitney Houston's screen debut is a lavish urban thriller that takes itself quite seriously but never gets going. The film stumbles from one scene to another and never has any semblance of a coherent, believable story. The production values are top notch all around but the plot is utterly senseless. Houston does well in her role as a temperamental diva, is talented, pretty, bitchy and vulnerable. She fares much better than star Kevin Costner, who plays the title role. Costner seems unsure of himself and comes across as tentative and hopelessly wooden, although he and Houston do seem to have a bit of chemistry between them. Ralph Waite is fine as the bodyguard's father but the rest of the cast overacts to the point of silliness."

","One of the greatest soundtracks of all time linked to one of the lamest movies of all time.<br/><br/>The entire premise of the movie is a bodyguard, played by Kevin Costner, out to protect a rock singer, played by Whitney Houston, and the 2 fall in love. But outside of that, there is no story. No plot. Nothing to make it watchable.<br/><br/>However, its soundtrack is still one of the best soundtracks to date. Especially with one of the best love songs of all time, ""I will always love you."" In fact without the soundtrack, the movie would have died on its first weekend. The song is the whole premise of the movie ""The Bodyguard,"" while the movie itself is 2 hours of aimless garbage.<br/><br/>Without the soundtrack, the Bodyguard is at best zero out of ten. But even with the soundtrack, it still rounds out to a disappointing 2 out of 10."
"frankfob","3","21","45","7 August 2004"," Overblown, overheated, overrated
","Annoyingly stupid movie, meant to launch Whitney Houston's acting career and, apparently, Kevin Costner's fallback career as a model for terrible haircuts. Houston is, of course, gorgeous and sings like an angel, but her acting ""talent"" is nowhere to be seen, and her ineptness brings down the whole movie--not that it had a lot going for it in the first place. After Houston, playing a pop diva, starts getting death threats from an obsessed and obviously crazed fan, Costner--a former Secret Service agent--is hired to protect her. Instead of showing appreciation for his efforts to save the lives of her and her family, however, Houston proceeds to fight him at every turn, insulting him, mocking his attempts to turn her house into a secure area and generally making a complete ass of herself, and her attitude spreads to her entourage and hangers-on, all of whom turn on Costner. In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot ""twist"" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>Anyway, like I said, Houston is great to look at, her voice is divine, and Costner tries hard, but overall this movie is not much more than an extended episode of ""General Hospital"" or some other equally brainless soap opera, and is just as predictable and badly acted. Houston's fans will like it, Costner's fans might like it, but anyone else is strongly advised to avoid it."
"BeccaGudd","8","6","10","6 February 2017"," A great film, underrated in my opinion
","I don't know why The Bodyguard hasn't got a higher rating than 6 stars?! I think that this film maybe only appeals to a certain audience. Whitney Houston plays the part of Rachel Marron a singing superstar who has recently became the victim of an obsessed stalker. Kevin Costner plays the part of her newly appointed bodyguard, Frank Farmer. Without going too much into it, Rachel and Frank end up falling for each other. However because Frank is hired to be her bodyguard, the lines get blurred as Rachel wants more. The music in the film in my opinion play a big role. As most of the songs were hits of Whitney Houston and the soundtrack was very successful. I didn't like the albino stalker guy in it, he was very creepy. Overall I love this film, it may not be for everyone but I've seen a lot worse."

","I had the misfortune to see this film when it was first released. A decade on, and my hatred for this puerile stinker remains unabated.<br/><br/>Think of your very worst celluloid nightmare. Multiply it by a hundred and you are only a fraction of the way to realising what an artistic shambles this film really is. Even ""The Swarm"" had some redeeming features.<br/><br/>All the depressingly familiar ingredients are here: wooden acting, stilted dialogue and warbly singing. It's overlong, overrated and features one of the most irritating soundtracks in the history of American cinema, which makes me want to stick pins into a wax work effigy of Dolly Parton every time I hear it.<br/><br/>Mow the lawn, bath the dog, watch paint dry. I implore you do anything but watch this film.<br/><br/>How the respected British Director, Mick Jackson, became involved with this outrage is anyone's guess. Back in 1984, he brought us one of the most disturbing and innovative films ever shown on British TV called ""Threads"". Perhaps he should attempt to combine the two films together. Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner disappearing under a mushroom cloud - now that's what I call a happy ending!"

","TCM was showing this as part of their ""Oscar"" month. I ended up staying up late to watch it.<br/><br/>Wow, what a waste of time! The problem isn't KC or WH or their chemistry (or lack thereof), but the idiotic plot that just doesn't make any sense. I could fill pages with examples, but the one that made me really sorry that I had sacrificed my beauty sleep to watch this was when Costner's character dives into a freezing lake to knock a kid out of a boat, but for no apparent reason other than he just figure out that the bad guy is nearby. After safely out of the water, the boat stops in the middle of the lake and blows up. Since neither Costner or Houston's characters had been in the boat or shown any interest in the boat, the whole idea that someone would try to kill them by blowing it up made absolutely no sense at all.<br/><br/>And what about the ridiculous attempt at romance, which is obviously the whole point of the film? There is not one credible scene that explains either character's attraction for the other. None. So, the reason for no chemistry between the two is that the idiot who wrote this didn't provide any dialog or staging to provide them with any motivation.<br/><br/>So, my advice is to buy a Whitney Houston album so you can hear her fabulous voice without interference from all the foley noise, and then rent ""No Way Out,"" which provides all sorts of motivation for the romance and sex scenes with an equally serious, but far more plausible performance from Costner."

She hires a high-priced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner). They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. <br/><br/>Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously, it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousy--full of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout (but that DOES fit his character). Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singer--but she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.<br/><br/>Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits (especially ""I Will Always Love You"") but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards (for the music). So, use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo."

Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.<br/><br/>Put these 2 together and voilà, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know."

","The problem with this film is the total lack of chemistry between the two lead characters; or rather, between the actors who play them. That attraction is supposed to fuel the movie and drive it forward, but it's water in the gas tank; this clunker only rolls a few feet.<br/><br/>Whitney Houston is so talented and beautiful, but exudes no sex appeal. In that respect she is like Julie Andrews of old; very talented, lovely, but, as one critic wrote of Andrews, ""Has all the sex appeal of a very efficient dietitian."" I would rather have seen, oh...Halle Berry or some actress with real dynamism (and dubbed voice) getting mixed up with Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is a fine actor who was absolutely doing his best Steve McQueen impression. Women love to see a powerful, internally sensual man succumb to a woman so sensual or otherwise desirable that the poor guy's helpless. Costner is a powerful actor and few female actresses have that presence...Angelina Joli? Costner even was too powerful for Susan Sarandan in Bull Durham. <br/><br/>I agree that, second to the flat interaction of the main characters, the story made little sense. If Frank Farmer had such a fragile ego that he could not come to terms with a tragic event he had nothing to do with, he would not have been selected by the Secret Service in the first place.<br/><br/>And what was the plan with taking the entourage to the lake? Were they going to live there indefinitely? Papa Walton, by the way, was miscast as Frank's father. He seemed to be ready to break into a smile at any moment; or perhaps the corners of his mouth got caught on his dentures.<br/><br/>The sister and son were very good. I liked the acting ability of both; Fletcher was very subtle and sensitive in a film that wasn't.<br/><br/>The Oscar scenes were funny. Anyone who saw Naked Gun 33 1/3 keeps expecting Mary Lou Retton to come flipping and bouncing down the aisle. Rachel's (joking) reason for risking her life in attending was ludicrous...you gotta cheer when Frank's stoic chastity appropriately caved; if she was a Darwin award candidate, her days were numbered anyway, so why not? <br/><br/>Actually, I thought Whitney Houston's acting was fine; she downplayed the role, seemed rather shy, and perhaps if there were more chemistry with the male lead, she would have received less criticism. I would like to have seen Diana Ross and Steve McQueen; they were equally matched dynamic folks.<br/><br/>Oh well, there are worse movies. Just because this one lacked chemistry, motivation, and sense, doesn't make it half as bad as the remake of Lost Horizon...my overall standard of rotten films.<br/><br/>And hey, I thought Frank's haircut was sexy."
"imbluzclooby","5","6","12","14 December 2005"," A successful and bad movie!
","Why was the ""Bodyguard"" so successful at the box office? I know the reasons. Does it mean that it's a good movie? That all depends on who you ask. The Bodyguard is a story that only appeals to one's emotions and never intellect or depth. This movie has a very weak script. The plot is just elongated with the spirit of your typical love story formula. And it touches on all the essential romantic buttons to have girls flocking to the theater. No it will never be heralded as a masterpiece and it even lacks the depth of movies like, ""Love Story"" and ""The way we were"". First off, the pairing of Houston and Costner was unique and somehow drew you in. Houston plays herself pretty much; the spoiled, talented and exceptionally beautiful pop star. Costner plays the dry, uptight and boorish professional bodyguard. They are both opposites, but that is what makes the love story intriguing. Costner has been bashed for his boringness, dullness and lack of charisma. He never really qualified as a leading man in my opinion. But here it somehow works, because Houston's beauty was more revealing as a foil to his bland as goat milk persona. And Whitney Houston was at the height of her career and beauty in 1992, and Costner was at his prime as well. Intellectuals and film critics are more likely to be annoyed by this sappy and overblown love tale. But there are those that just can't help but be immersed in the romance intrigue of it. This is your rare and typical successful bad movie that ranks up there in the same phenomenon as ""Rambo"", ""Terminator 2"", etc. Brainless films that just appeal to our senses and emotions."

","Whatever films I comment on this site, The Bodyguard was clearly a movie that saw Kevin Costner's film career start to wane through highs and lows where to this day, he makes frequent appearances in inferior films and because I did not read any reviews from the film critics when this 1992 film first came out, The Bodyguard looked to be promising due to the number of promotions it had with a TV commercial or movie posters displayed at lit-up bus stop shelters and shop windows.<br/><br/>However, a couple of years later when I viewed it on the living room box, I couldn't believe what a stinker this turned out to be and even seeing the average ratings given in the TV guides for one of the biggest problems with this film is that turned out to be rather dull for a number of reasons with the plot about a bodyguard assigned to protect a celebrity singer played by one Whitney Houston, fictitious or not! <br/><br/>Even if some say that Costner was miscast as the minder, then Houston's ""off-stage"" part is so annoying as if she cared less about her own safety from a mob of deranged fans and behaves like a spoilt child and all I can say, considering the number of promotions this film received around the time it hit box office in the early 1990s, its such a waste,"

","Usually one can count on high production values to make even a bad Kevin Costner movie interesting.  Alas, despite having high production values, ""The Bodyguard"" was a bore.  Let me count the ways:  slow plot, preposterous story, and bad acting -- particularly by Whitney Houston.  In fairness, I should say that the completely unbelievable conduct of Houston's character does serve to make her performance seem even worse than it was.  Costner does not a bad faux Steve McQueen as the existential and dour (depressed?) athletic pretty boy, Frank Farmer.  But his performance does not save the film.  Indeed, I doubt that De Niro could have saved it.  Spend two hours and ten minutes elsewhere; not recommended; 5 out of 10."

","Strange as it seems the director of THE BODYGUARD is a former BBC director called Mick Jackson who made the nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS . I say it`s strange because there surely can`t be a bigger contrast between a director`s two pieces of work . On one hand you have a very cheaply made kitchen sink drama dealing with a subject you pray will never happen , or if it does you`d hope to be vapourised in the opening exchange while on the other you have Hollywood blockbuster melodrama material (Though the plot has also popped up in several latter TVMs ) featuring love and songs and the occasional shoot out <br/><br/>There is a stylistic connection between these two Jackson directed contrasts and that`s the jump edits . I checked the credits on both THREADS and THE BODYGUARD and was very surprised to find that different editors were used in both because the editing is very similar in its jarring quality of having a scene where noise is overwhelming followed by a scene of total silence which lasts several seconds . I guess it`s the fault of the director<br/><br/>
As for the rest of this movie I didn`t think much of it . For a romance to work on screen you need a lot of chemistry between the two romantically linked protagonists and THE BODYGUARD features the charisma free Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston , and I was certain that the film would have worked far better if the movie was produced in the mid 1970s with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the main roles . It wouldn`t have saved the film from its TVM type plot but at least we`d see some convincing characterisation and acting <br/><br/>Finally the title song is one you will either love or hate .

They make an appealing enough couple and their chemistry together is of the simmering type. Some have criticised the leading female, but I believe her underplaying works well enough that we can glimpse a vulnerable dimension to her character.<br/><br/>The whole thing seems content to serve as a glossy potboiler for the shameless romantic - and help to shift millions of soundtrack units along the way, of course. It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged.

Hollywood couldn't find away to make truly good movies in the 1990's, and many times through together movies like this, roped some big time actors into doing in in order to get people in the theaters, only to see the flicks quickly disappear when the audiences quit showing up. What we have in a contrived, rather implausible little story that never gets the viewer interested, and can't even get the viewer to care about their respective fates. Whitney Houston, providing scant actor ability, has zero chemistry with Kevin Costner, who should be more happy to include Waterwold, or the 1970's drive in flick Sizzle Beach USA on his resume then this fluff. Shoddy direction, implausible ending, and more or less, a script that seems like it was written on the fly. I remember being so bored out of my mind, that I was actually reading the box my popcorn came in. Even the girl was completely bored. We left as the movie was ending, as did the friends we came with. We all agreed that we could have spent the money better by tossing it in the toilet, and flushing.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","5","3","5","7 July 2012"," A thriller that needs to find a main focus
","Romantic thrillers can work, they just need to have good direction. But for this film, directed by Mick Jackson, did not keep a steady eye on where the plot had to be. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what on earth was happening with the plot that seemed to go on endlessly.<br/><br/>The story of the bodyguard is about Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a veteran in the art of protection and now only takes care of special VIPs. Sadly, the character of Farmer is so thinly written that nothing ever changes for the better in this man. His entire outlook on his job is strictly to be emotionless. The audience isn't even explained to why the only beverage he drinks is a glass of orange juice.<br/><br/>Co-starring Costner is Whitney Huston, a pop culture icon ironically playing a fictional pop culture icon named Rachel Marron. Her character is eccentric and snobby but it works. At least she tries to excite Mr. Farmer, but even she is not able to get him to come out of his cage of cautiousness. It's almost as though the lines written for Huston's character were supposed to be more entertaining than Costner's.<br/><br/>The problem with these two characters is that the connection between them just didn't feel or look like it was there. That and the fact that the film focused more on these two people more than the plot. The main plot here was to about Farmer protecting Marron from a psychotic killer whom when, on screen, seemed like he had some serious issues. Turns out though, this creep is hardly ever focused on at all. And it's because of this that the tension in this ""romantic thriller"" is lost. Nothing gets tense at all until the finale.<br/><br/>The music, which was for the majority of the time provided by Huston, nonetheless has energy but all this does is support the fact that Huston is better at singing. Of course her acting is good but her voice is the top gun that she has. The rest of the score was produced by Alan Silvestri and once again, just like Unlawful Entry (1992), was a let down by the fact that there was not enough music to keep the scenes tight. But then again, who could blame him; how could you produce a score for a thriller film that rarely focuses on the thriller aspect of it?<br/><br/>Huston isn't bad at acting here but all this does is prove that she should stick to singing. Not to mention, the lack of balance in romance and thriller makes this film hard to enjoy."

"MickeyTo","Null","7","17","3 January 2000"," Predictable fluff suitable for Houston debut.
","The Bodyguard has a history behind it that should have served as a warning to Lawrence Kasden and Kevin Costner when they considered making this film. Of course after the box office that this film grossed, (it made a lot) I am certain they don't see it that way. <br/><br/>The script for this film was originally intended as a vehicle for Clint Eastwood with Diana Ross to star as the female lead.  I'm not too sure what happened over the years, but the script sat in limbo and the stars got too old to play those parts.  <br/><br/>Kevin Costner got the script and originally wanted Madonna to play the female lead.  A bad mistake, to say the least, but suffice it to say, she turned it down.  In the end Whitney Houston, who was looking for something to launch her inevitable movie career took the part and history was made.<br/><br/>The Bodyguard is the story of a former secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who can't forgive himself for the fact that he had the day off the day that Ronald Reagan was shot.  I'm sure Jim Brady would have some choice words for this guy.  (In the original script, Eastwood would have been agonizing over the Kennedy assassination.)   To console himself he works as a bodyguard for private citizens.<br/><br/>His latest job offer is for pop diva, Rachael Marron.  She has a stalker after her and her people are keeping her in the dark as what is going on. Even though Frank doesn't do celebrities, Rachael's people convince him to take the case.  <br/><br/>And from here the story moves on its predictable course.  Naturally Frank and Rachael do not get along at first.  He's the serious type who puts all of his energy into his work.  She's the bitchy type who puts all of her energy into her work.  <br/><br/>Frank finds fault in Rachael's current security and goes to great lengths to fix everything.  At the same time, a list of suspects start to come out of the wood work.  It seems that Rachael has a few enemies in her jealous sister, her over eager publicist, her macho bodyguard and some freaky looking albino guy who can't stop following her.  <br/><br/>Some mayhem occurs, and of course Frank and Rachael start to fall for each other.  <br/><br/>Kevin Costner is by far the most boring actor ever and this film simply serves to prove that, even though he over acts to the bitter end.  Whitney Houston is OK playing the disco queen from hell, however something tells me she didn't have to stretch too much for this one.  <br/><br/>All in all the film follows along the typical Hollywood path of boy meets girl, boy hates girl, boy has sex with girl, boy and girl fight the bad guys and so on.  <br/><br/>The Bodyguard is a movie that I suggest you pass on, particularly if you like some depth in your films. Whitney fans should stick to the sound track. Costner fans should stick to some of his better films, like Field of Dreams and Dances with Wolves."

She is reluctantly to have the bodyguard interfere with her life, and it's obvious that they haven't told her the worst of the situation.<br/><br/>Written by Lawrence Kasdan and directed by Mick Jackson, this is a very standard and predictable thriller. Kevin Costner is very solid as the straight laced guard. Some may downgrade the movie because of Whitney Houston. However I found her to be a good natural performer especially for someone who is untrained. She actually adds a sense of reality. There is no denying that she has the persona of a pop diva. And it helps to have her great soundtrack to prove the point. The romance is a bit corny. That's probably its biggest weak point. The movie expects a little too much from an acting novice."

I feel like RAchel should have been less selfish and thought more about her young son's needs before getting into an intimate relationship with Frank/Kevin Costner. I'm sure the writers wanted them to get that close to add more drama and maybe some heart ache to the story, but I often think it's a bad idea for a single or divorced mother to get close to a man before considering how the man or the relationship with him might affect her children, especially if they're young and the relationship ends up not working out. Maybe it would have been hard for someone like Rachel, considering the situation (that her life was in danger) and her career to not get too close to/involved intimately with Frank, but I was really sorry to see them chose to go their separate ways just because she was too selfish or maybe too insecure to think ahead to see how the outcome of their being together would ultimately affect her son.

"tdrish","6","1","1","18 March 2019"," Good movie! So why isn't the rating a little higher?
","Well, I have a theory. It could have something to do with the length of the film. In general, this could have easily be all wrapped up around the hour and half mark, but instead the writer and filmmakers decide to stretch this out with long, and often times boring scenery. They think that they can make it up to us with amazing and dazzling lighting, and engaging with powerful music, right? It works, right? To an extent. Just don't beat a dead horse. And unfortunately, The Bodyguard not only beats a dead horse, it drills it, too. The story line is quite engrossing, however, its as if we have to make believe that this has never happened before. A man falling in love with the women he's suppose to be protecting. Didn't they do this in 1987? I believe the film was called Someone To Watch Over Me. Yes. Mimi Rogers, and directed by Ridley Scott. Maybe I have been alive too long. I shouldn't remember these things. So just pretend, and maybe you won't see that things are just a little too predictable in this romance thriller. We pose another threat here. Keven Kostner can act. Houston can sing. She CAN'T act! So, you cast her as one of the lead roles? This cannot be good. However, much to my surprise, its actually quite good. Whitney Houston can easily be dismissed. She does her best, but she comes off too over the top, and way too dramatic. ""SOMEBODY WAS IN MY HOUSE!?"" The was she freaks out, it's believable, but she just didn't know when to pull back a little. Instead of working with her, our director here decides to let it slide, and let all that ability slip through the cracks. Hmm. Maybe we won't notice. Judging from the rating, it seems some of us did. Not to mention, maybe its just safe to assume that many people do not like Whitney Houston except as a musician. So she stars as an actress who is getting death threats from an unexpected source. A bodyguard is hired, but its not the one she wanted. This bodyguard is the best of the best, and he won't work for less then 3 grand a week. His name is Frank Farmer. ( Doesn't sound like a very dangerous man to me, but play along.) So! Needless to say things get heated along with the way, both inside and outside their relationship. I thought it was funny that they mentioned that she had an 8 year old son, but he's barely in the movie. In fact, I don't remember seeing him at all in the film. Anyway, The Bodyguard has a lot of unnecesary shots and footage that could have easily been discarded, but its clear they were just trying to beef up the running time on The Bodyguard. I don't know why. Who cares how long your film is, as long as its good. With that said, I do recommend The Bodyguard, however, its going with a warning: The same old formula is used that you've probably seen before. If not, many times. Expect good. Not great."

","I don't care if people say it's a chick flick. I don't see it that way. I think this movie was a great start for Houston's acting career. The character of Rachel Marron was complex, and her personality clashing with Fram Farmer's set the tone for this movie.<br/><br/>I quite enjoyed the soundtrack as well. The music as well as Rachel's performances at various stages of the plot fit perfectly with the mood. The ""Queen of the Night"" performance was out of control, as was the situation at that point in the movie.<br/><br/>What can I say about the end? A perfect ending for a chick like me, I suppose. On a more serious note, I liked how the movie wasn't perfectly happy and warm at the end. It was obvious that these two could not be together at this point in their lives, because they got in each other's way. But, that does not rule out the possibility of them finding one another again later on down the line."
"ironhorse_iv","6","3","6","24 April 2015"," I will always love you, movie, even if you're a bit mediocre.
","Houston, we don't have a problem. At least, not in 1992. In 1992, both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston could do no, wrong. At the time, Kevin Costner was one of America's most accomplished thespians and Whitney Houston was one of the most popular singers. When you combine them, in the movie, 'the Bodyguard'. You get a semi-OK-masterpiece. This schmaltzy proposal for this film was rejected 67 times before Kevin Costner got the rights. It was originally written by Lawrence Kasdan for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the 1970s. Directed by Mick Jackson, the movie tells the story of Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a former Secret Service Agent for the President, who became the private bodyguard for international pop star and actress, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) after she been, receiving death threats from a dangerous stalker. Can Frank save Rachel or will the killer win out in the end? Watch the movie to find out! Without spoiling too much of the film, I found Kevin Costner's acting in this, pretty dull. I know, that his character is supposed to be stern, but geesÂ… they could have, lighten up, the character, a bit. Even, in the lake scenes. He was pretty blend. Despite, that, he made a pretty realistic bodyguard. He was also, a pretty cool, action star at the time. He deserve more credit for this movie, from stopping it from totally tanking with his action scenes. The scene where he was chasing the killer, through the woods was intense. Kevin Costner was so insistent that Whitney Houston and no other black singer/actress play the part that the film production waited 1 year for Whitney to be available to film. In my opinion, it was a good choice. She was a good singer, but not a good actress, even when seemingly playing a variation of herself. Whitney Houston as Rachel, was mediocre, at best. I give her some credit, for at least, trying to act. She did suffered a miscarriage during production and missed a couple of weeks of production recovering, and you can't tell, by her performance, how truly depress, she must have, been at the time. I just glad, Whitney Houston's character wasn't playing like a gimmicky black singer stereotype. Still, most of the movie, I felt that her character was a bit annoying. Even, test audiences, couldn't stand all, her b*tching as the film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting. Still, with those cuts, her character never truly understood, how much, she was in danger, even when, things became really serious and it bugs the living hell out of me. I know, she supposed to play a diva, but I didn't like, how much, Rachel and Frank fought against each other over, how much protection, she needs. It made the romance seem so unrealistic. I didn't think, that the actors have that much chemistry on film. Still, they both look, beautiful, together. One thing that I kinda love about the film, is how brave, the filmmakers were in showing interracial relationships. Even in the 1990s, seeing this was rare. Houston's mainstream appeal allowed people to look at the movie color-blind, and never once, did I find the fact that a black woman and white guy falling in love, jarring. Still, controversy arose as some felt the film's advertising intentionally hid Houston's face to hide the film's interracial relationship. I think, this was made to keep, the movie from being spoiled. The reason The Bodyguard scored more than $410 million worldwide is not, because of the two stars sex appeal. It's the film soundtrack, which to date, as of this writing, stands as the highest selling in movie history. It features six songs by Whitney Houston, including ""Queen of the Night,"" a remake of Chaka Khan's ""I'm Every Woman,"" ""I've Got Nothing,"" and, of course, her signature cover of Dolly Parton's ""I Will Always Love You."" Although her songs make up half of the soundtrack, she is credited for the album's popularity, which in turn drove people to see the film. Two songs from the film, ""Run to You"" and ""I Have Nothing"", were nominated for an Oscar for Best Original Song. While, 'I will always love you' got her, multiply rewards and became one of the best-selling single by a woman in music history. The character of Rachel was originally going to sing ""What Becomes of the Broken Hearted"" instead of ""I Will Always Love You"", before 1991's film, Fried Green Tomatoes used the former song. Kevin Costner is the one who wanted the song written by Dolly Parton to be sung by Whitney Houston. He convinced Whitney to sing it ""a capella"" for the movie. Whitney's rendition became so good, that Dolly Parton pretty much, disowned it and gave it to Whitney. Regardless of whether you're a Houston fan, her talent as a singer is what makes the movie halfway watchable. If this movie was made today, it might be an all-out-disaster. Both celebrities went into a shaky time in the late 1990s/early 2000s. While, Whitney Houston's career never really, bound-back, to the success of this film and its soundtrack. She did have some minor hits, before dying in 2012, in a drowning/drug overdose accident. Kevin Costner was able to have some success after his double whammy of post-apocalypse sci-fi flops movies in the mid-1990s, and his career is still going strong. In many ways, he always thought of this movie, as one of his greatest works, and always felt open in making a sequel or remaking it. Celebrities like Rihanna, and Princess Diana was once sought for re-dos. Who knows, if a sequel will be made? Overall: Yes, it could had been better, but I quite enjoyed the film. I do recommended, at least, seeing it, once. In the end, if you don't bother watching the film. At least, try to listen to the soundtrack. You'll probably enjoyed it."

","There was a time when there were no internet for me, no video and no satellite.
I was a 19 y.o. boy, young and full of emotions. A naive young fellow knowing nothing about life and its twists.
One day, while waiting at a bus station, I overheard two friends talking about a movie called 'The Bodyguard' and that how good that was, how they enjoyed it and how Withney Houston shone in it.
Years passed, I lived my life, but I always had memory of that conversation in the back of my mind as if waiting for the right moment and opportunity to grab and watch that film.
And opportunity it came one day with its video from a friend. I put the cassette in the player and started watching the anticipated movie with unbelievable excitement and happiness.<br/><br/>And the movie rolled over me like an avalanche...<br/><br/>That was a rollercoaster of emotions, chemistry, love, acting, music and one of the best and unique voices of the 20th century that I experienced.<br/><br/>That was one of the most beautiful and heartwarming movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner and Withney Houston were just diamond-like in it and outshone themselves in every aspect.<br/><br/>Tears are appearing in the corners of my eyes as I am writing this review. This is a review full of memories of my youth as well as the rainbow of true emotions that were conveyed by the eternally alive comet called The Bodyguard.<br/><br/>Withney, I've always loved you. No other singer has ever been like you and never will be.
You had one of the most beautiful, powerful and mind-blowing voice of all time. All you needed was a microphone and the audience was in awe.

","You do not watch a movie like this expecting reality. There is a reason this movie and it's soundtrack were huge hits. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston were at the top of their game, she looked and sounded fantastic and was completely charming and believable in her role. Kevin Costner was perfect in his role and in a change of pace as the lead male in this film, he is the object of desire. The story is completely Hollywood, and also completely entertaining. They have real chemistry on screen. Throw in Whitney belting out Dolly Parton's ""I will always love you"" and this movie is perfection."

","Having recently resigned from the Secret Service, a bodyguard by the name of ""Frank Farmer"" (Kevin Costner) is offered a high-paying job protecting a musician by the name of ""Rachel Marron"" (Whitney Houston) who has recently received several serious threats upon her life. Although initially hesitant, he eventually decides to check out the situation as a matter of courtesy and is thoroughly appalled by what he finds as not only is her security greatly inadequate for the task at hand but her carefree lifestyle makes things even more difficult. Yet, despite the fact that it goes against his better instincts, he reluctantly accepts the security position-and it's then that he discovers just how precarious the situation really is. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film with an interesting plot and a nice twist at the end. Along with that, I would also like to mention that this film received several awards and nominations with most of them pertaining to the musical abilities of Whitney Houston rather than her acting abilities or that of Kevin Costner. To that point, although both of them were panned by the Razzie Awards, I personally didn't think that either of them deserved this criticism. That being said, while this certainly wasn't a great film by any means, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average."

This movie was a big hit in the nineties, with both Kevin Cosner and Whitney Houston being the most popular actor and female singer. It is still an enjoyable movie to this day, with decent acting performances and a reasonably suspenseful story. Especially recommended for all those girls who dream of living the life of a popstar."

","Besides turning out a smash hit song Bodyguard was also a good movie.<br/><br/>The stunning Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron, an entertainer who's had threats on her life. Kevin Costner plays Frank Farmer, the no-nonsense bodyguard that's been hired to protect her. Their personalities couldn't be more different. She's loose, open, and dangerously carefree. Frank is conservative, tight-lipped, no-nonsense and all-business. They were definitely an odd couple.<br/><br/>The storyline was a dandy and the onscreen chemistry between Costner and Houston was good. To be honest, I was surprised by Whitney Houston's acting skills. It's not an automatic that a singer can crossover no matter how accomplished of a singer she was. Michael Jackson was just passable as an actor. ""The Bodyguard"" overall was a solid production with one of the best pairings you can think of."
"SimonJack","6","0","0","14 February 2019"," Some drama, intrigue, crime, music and romance
","""The Bodyguard"" has some drama, a little intrigue, crime, music and romance. That's about the best that can be said for this film. It has just enough of each to hold one's interest to the end. And, the ending makes watching this film worthwhile. It's the best part of the movie.<br/><br/>Everyone knows, or should know, the plot. A former CIA agent is hired to protect a hot female singer. And, he falls for her and she for him. Whitney Houston is good as Rachel Marron, the big name singer. Kevin Costner is mostly wooden as Frank Farmer. I get it, as I think most movie buffs do, that a real bodyguard doing a serious job is not going to be a friendly, funny Joe with the people around him. Mike Starr's Tony, as such a glad-hand character, exaggerates that notion with his distractions for lunch, watching and enjoying the show, etc.<br/><br/>But Costner's Farmer goes to the extreme in the opposite direction. He's almost sullen in his constant alertness. He's overly calm and slow to the point that he doesn't shoe much life or intelligence behind his apparent thinking and critical watching. The plot dances around, as do the scenes, with sharp breaks, so it doesn't have a feel of fluid continuity.<br/><br/>One very good scene in this movie makes it worth watching. It takes place at night in the kitchen of Rachel Marron's mansion. Frank Farmer is sitting alone at a counter drinking his orange juice. He has just gotten Rachel home safely after a near riot broke out with her fans at an event. When they sped away, they left Tony behind.<br/><br/>Now Tony kicks the door in. He's mad and goes after Frank - four times. Each time, Frank uses his martial arts and fisticuffs and lays big Tony out. Tony's face is bloody and he's about to try a fifth time with a big butcher knife. Frank picks up another knife and hurls it so that it sinks into the woodwork beside Tony's head. Tony backs down. Not a word has been spoken to this time. Frank turns to leave and says, ""I don't wanna talk about this again."

","The stage curtains open ...<br/><br/>I just finished watching and reviewing the documentary released this year simply titled, ""Whitney"" - so I thought I would revisit ""The Bodyguard"" since it has literally been years since the last time I saw it. Most movies, as they get older, become dated and not as viable as they once were. Not so with this film. In fact, it just seems to get better over time, like a fine, aged wine. Some of the little things that used to get under my skin with this movie (ie: Kevin Costner's hair style, Whitney's choppy debut acting performance, some of the mistakes they made in regard to how a trained secret service agent would really act in certain situations, some of the bad camera work at the end of the movie) - these things just don't bother me anymore.<br/><br/>The power and the strength of this film is the music, the chemistry between Costner and Houston, and the strong characters. Of course, maybe it is just the age I'm at now that makes the difference. It has been over 25 years since it came out and the first time I saw it. Maybe, the movie has always been this good and I'm just now starting to realize it. In any case, it has grown to be a personal favorite of mine. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the plot, since this one is so well known already. But, I will say that with the passing of Whitney Houston, this one can be a bitter pill to take now. I did feel my heartstrings being pulled a bit more and the sadness creep in. Despite this, however, I still love this movie. It is a must-see in my opinion, and a high recommend to any of those who have yet to watch it for the first time."

","There's really only legitimate reason to watch The Bodyguard: if you're a Whitney Houston fan. And I mean total, complete, number-one fan. Anyone else in the audience will see from the first scene that Whitney is a terrible excuse for an actress, and the plot is as thin as the romance. And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.<br/><br/>Whitney's blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. It's boring, there's no chemistry, and there's no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.<br/><br/>So, even though Kevin Costner's a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs."

","Ah, The Bodyguard, I was 7 years old when this film was released, and the funny thing about it is that I actually remember all the hoop-la there was about it. Well, mostly what I remember is how much my mom and sister complained about it's hit song by Whitney Housten, I will Always Love You, was way too over played on the radio. Hence the reason why I never saw this film, well, I passed it at Hollywood Video and I figured I would see what it was about and if it really should of got all the praise that it did in 1992. Now when the film started out, I was actually surprised, I found myself enjoying it, but then it got into a mystery thriller that wasn't really needed in my opinion, that wasn't explained very well or wasn't even enjoyable.<br/><br/>Frank is one of the best bodyguards around, he has protected some very important people in his life, but he refuses celebrities. But when a superstar, Rachel Marron, is getting death threats, her assistant begs him to join the team. One problem, Rachel is a bit of a diva, big surprise. Her and Frank keep clashing but can no longer hide their deep sexual tension for each other and give in. But Frank must remember that he is here to protect Rachel and save her life and protect her family as well.<br/><br/>The Bodyguard had it's moments and a very promising plot that could have worked, but unfortunately what happened with the character, Rachel's sister, just got too confusing among with the friend of Frank. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film or not, but I do think it's worth a look. But I agree with my mom and sister, I did fast forward through the singing moments, no offense, Whitney.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I too have seen this movie at the theater a long time ago, and the memory of it was on the positive side as I've always appreciate K Kostner's work and don't mind W Houston voice although I would not go as far as declaring myself one of her fans. Yet her rendition of the song is so powerful, it has to be taken noticed of! So today when it was screened on our TV screen I decided to have another go at it and certainly do feel it was a worthwhile decision! I enriched my feelings about this film, beside my own, reading very interesting entries in IMDb. I understand now why Kevin Kostner reminded me so much of Steve Mc Queen. I won't repeat what others have already very well said and what is also fairly well documented in that regard. I am a little surprised too by the low average rating of what I think is a very entertaining movie and do share the thought that someone expressed already here; something like: There are too many snobs ""would be critiques"" who look at this kind of work as it it was a piece of art fated to go in a dusty museum shelf and studied under a microscope for every possible imperfection, instead of its entertainment value. I consider myself having been well entertained and I guess I should give it a 10 just to rectify the balance, but who's counting! I did not feel W Houston acting was that bad either and what she delivered, to me, was fairly appropriate. A successful, talented singer who enjoyed the ride and wanted to make the best of it. Something I believe she did with her career anyway. So she probably just had to be herself anyway."

You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.<br/><br/>At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer. <br/><br/>Probably a film that women would enjoy more than men but despite the flaws, I did enjoy it.

It is an enjoyable movie, I happen to have watched it a lot in recent years, and I always like it, but I can go years without feeling the need to revisit it.<br/><br/>It is hard to say what I don't like, as it's nothing in particular, I just find the directing a bit flat, and at times the actors are poorly framed. I remember I loved it when it was released, but by the time I watched it again on video, my opinion if it, had dropped considerably. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is very effective, all the new songs are catchy and for the second year in a row, the single to a KC movie dominates the charts. I knew the song I Will Always Love You from the Burt Reynolds/Dolly Parton movie The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. And whilst I still call it a Dolly Parton song, I know many call it a Whitney Houston one, and think of her version as the definitive one. <br/><br/>Of the cast, in her first movie Houston is very good. I'm surprised she didn't make more movies (she only made 4 more) as the talent was there. It's another less is more performance from KC, similar to his performance in The Untouchables, but it's still effective here, and he has some good, witty lines. All the supporting cast are fine too. <br/><br/>The film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting when test audiences hated the original ending with Farmer dying after saving Marron. I remember KC saying in an interview, that he didn't even understand the new ending to the movie. <br/><br/>Sadly for me the tacked on happier ending ruins things a bit!! As Farmer is clearly shot in the chest and gut at Oscars, but he turns up at the airport with his arm in a sling. <br/><br/>It was another $100 million plus grosser for KC as The Bodyguard finished the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 1992, with a domestic gross of $121 million. <br/><br/>8/10 for this reviewer."

When Kevin's character jumped to save the kid, it's not because he predicted that the boat will explode, but it's because if the kid goes very far with the boat then Kevin will not be able to reach him. The kid obviously doesn't know how to ride the boat, so if he goes too far, what is Kevin's character supposed to swim for 15 minutes in freezing water to get to him? No. So he didn't take a chance and jumped to prevent the kid of getting away and going too far.

","I am a personal fan of Whitney Houston, and I believe she didn't cause any dishonor to her flawless reputation. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston truly portrayed the couple of the year. What I like about this movie is its simplicity, honesty and magnificent music. I don't know why the Razzie Awards attacked the film so much, it's a truly classical love story with great performance, music and directing. Although the roll was originally for Diana Ross, I can't imagine Rachel Maron being interpreted as any other woman but Whitney Houston. If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos. It has no special effects or any computer tricks, it is as simple as it gets, and I believe that that's the secret to a great film. The outline of this movie is Frank Farmer (Costner) being an extremely serious bodyguard protecting Rachel Marron (Houston), an extremely immature person. The different points of view of both affect Farmer's way of working, causing chaos during the process of Rachel's protection."
"TxMike","Null","2","9","25 January 2005"," Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston have good movie 'chemistry'.
","Whitney Houston, in a role that wasn't much of a stretch for her, plays a famous singer Rachel Marron. I suppose it is a reality of the entertainment business that ""fans"" can get out of control, so bodyguards are necessary. Ms. Marron's handlers are also concerned that she is being targeted for death. They recognize that her personal security isn't as tight as it should be, and with much coaxing get noted specialist Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) to take the job of providing security.<br/><br/>When we first see Frank entering the grounds of Ms Marron's home, he doesn't come in the usual way. Instead, he basically breaks in, as a way of demonstrating to himself and others how poor the security was. I really liked the role of Tony Scipelli (Mike Star). Being the current security specialist, and a somewhat intimidating looking person, he doesn't look kindly on his rather small person in Frank coming in to tell them what to do, so he challenges him. That scene alone, where Frank whips up on him is worth the movie.<br/><br/>Farmer has been hard on himself since President Reagan was shot, because he wasn't on duty that day. That is part of what he has to overcome personally through the movie.<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS. Frank does his thing, security is top notch, there begins some romantic feelings between Ms Marron and Frank, during tense minutes at a concert, Frank figures out who the assassin is, and gets the upper hand. As a professional he realizes that a romantic relationship with his client is out of the question. As the movie ends we see he has taken a job guarding a politician again.<br/><br/>Overall a good movie, one of my favorite Kevin Costner roles.<br/><br/>April 2008 update: We watched it again, on the special edition DVD. It has an excellent 25-minute special on making the movie, and the picture and sound of the movie are first-rate. This is definitely a better movie than its low IMDb rating would suggest. Costner is good as the bodyguard and for a singer, Houston is excellent in her role."

","I Will Always Love You will be remembered for a long time with this movie. In fact, singers imitating Whitney Houston are still winning Karoke Contests using this song 20 years later. The power of this song is perhaps more powerful than the film itself.<br/><br/>Still I would argue this film is one of the roles which helped establish Kevin Costner's career as he is excellent in his title role. Whitney Houston gets to play herself in a lot of ways here which makes her acting very effective. There is a lot good about this film.<br/><br/>The creepy part is hindsight. While the body guard in this has to deal with an insane killer trying to shoot Whitney, the reality is she really needed a bodyguard for an entirely different reason - to stop her substance abuse. Her line ""I am not a morning person"" is one of the cliché lines of a person with that problem. That makes the film creepy in a real retrospect fashion.<br/><br/>When you look at Houston in this film, she looks as great as she ever has. She is actually portrayed as a beautiful young rock star who her fans and a lot of others would fall in love with. I have the same feelings for her here as many would in that her character portrays success in the way that it is often achieved, at the loss of a personal life for the star. The script then exploits that perfectly by having her fall in love with her Bodyguard. That makes all too much sense and I have felt often that singers who die too soon tragically like Houston has fit the way the script is written like a glove."
"highwaytourist","6","1","3","19 February 2012"," OK romantic thriller with some good scenes
","For the most part, this is a passable love story with thriller elements thrown in. It's easy to watch. What's odd is that Whiteney Houston, who is not an experienced actress, gives a more believable performance than veteran actor Kevin Costner. Costner has done well in other movies but was wooden here. He's trying to do a Steve McQueen cooler-than-cool turn, but he seems like a wind-up toy soldier. Also worthy of censure is Costner's haircut, which was rightly criticized at the time. Houston is convincing enough, but it's because she's essentially playing herself. They have a love scene, which was also OK but nothing memorable. There is the supporting cast, which is good enough but nothing memorable. The screenplay is occasionally exciting but usually routine and not always believable. Costner's character probably wouldn't have been in the secret service to begin with if he's traumatized by a shooting that took place when he was off duty at a funeral. The soundtrack is the real star and this film features some great songs. Also praiseworthy is the ending, which was one of the few parts to avoid romantic clichés. It's very easy watching and will appeal to fervent fans of Whiteney Houston and romantic drama."

It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. ""The Bodyguard"" is one of Whitney's best performances. You can tell she is in her prime with her career. She and Kevin Costner are outstanding in their performances. I love the performances throughout the movie most..<br/><br/>Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluded view that she is invincible. Houston plays a character that parallels her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan. Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career. Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shining moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible. Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the soundtrack while you're at it).<br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."

","***SPOILERS*** Kevin Costner as ex secret service agent Frank Farmer looks genuinely board stiff as his role demands him to be guarding the body of singer and actress Rachel Marron, Whitney Houston, as her bodyguard in ""The Bodyguard"". Coaster or Farmer walks around looking so deadpan throughout most of the movie that he seems to be suffering from a serious case of shell shock from his previous job as a secret service agent. It's a habit that he picked up over the years guarding both Presidents Carter and Regan in him being able to blend in with the furniture or background in him remaining inconspicuous, to any attempted assassins, on he job. Taking on an assignment at the insistence of his good friend Mr. Dewaney, Bill Cobbs, to be Miss Marron's personal bodyguard the company that he surrounds herself with get so intrusive in him doing his job that he almost quits before he begins. It's Rachel's sweet looks and bubbling personality that keeps him on the job guarding her and also the fact that those in her entourage of flunkies and hanger on being so completely incompetent in doing their jobs that makes him stay.<br/><br/>We and Farmer know right away that someone out there is trying to do Rachel in but that fact is kept from her by those around her that makes Farmer's job that much more difficult. Acting as if she doesn't have a care or fear in the world Rachel doesn't realize that her life and body, the body that Farmer is guarding with his life, is in serious danger. It's only much later when Rachel gets a disturbing pone call, on her private phone number, that she finally gives in and lets Farmer do his job protecting her life. It's her obsessed fan and stalker who's planning to whack her at the biggest moment in Rachel's life when she's to accept the Academy Award for best actress with over a billion people watching the great event live and on TV all over the globe.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** The love angle in the movie doesn't quite pan out with Farmer and Marron never really clicking in their love scenes that come across mechanical and not genuine at all. Farmer for one is so intense in all of his scenes that showing affection towards Rachel seems out of character for him in the movie. It's only in the last few moments that Farmer gets his act together in realizing who's out to knock off Rachel that he really seems to care for Rachel and tries to save her life even at the expense of his own. But by then she's so turned off by his almost zombie or robot like action that she almost allows her intended killer to do her in by not believing or responding to Farmers frantic attempts to save her life.<br/><br/>Both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as Frank Farmer & Rachel Marro did their best to make their parts in the movie work and the final payoff with a by then a disgraced, in letting things get out of hand, Farmer saving Rachel's life which saved the film from being total disaster. It was sad that the film ""The Bodyguard"" in a way predicted its star Whitney Houston's actual death some 20 years later in 2012. It was then just like in the movie Whitney faced death this time in her hotel bathtub, not from an assassin's bullet, just before she was to receive a Grammy for her music like an Academy Award for her acting in ""The Bodygurad"". But this time in real life not in the movies the outcome was sadly a lot different."

","The Bodyguard is a romantic thriller film starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. Costner stars as a former Secret Service Agent-turned- bodyguard who is hired to protect Houston's character, a music star, from an unknown stalker. Lawrence Kasdan wrote the film in the 1970's, originally as a vehicle for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross.It was directed by Mick Jackson. <br/><br/>When imperious musical superstar Rachel Marron begins receiving death threats, she is compelled to hire a bodyguard. An ex-Secret Service agent, Frank still hasn't purged himself of his guilt feelings over his inability to protect from an assassination of the President of the United States.He is now a highly successful private and professional bodyguard who protects corporate VIPs. He is hired by Rachel's manager, Bill Devaney to protect her after she receives a number of threats against her life and a small bomb detonates in her dressing room.Gradually,Rachel and Frank fall in love. <br/><br/>This 1992 crowd pleaser made almost as much money for Whitney Houston as its chart-busting soundtrack. A high-wattage star vehicle as only Hollywood can make as she is baring her tonsils with a rousing rendition of the Dolly Parton chestnut ""I Will Always Love You"".Overall,it is a cheesy, melodramatic potboiler with occasional moments of electricity.But nevertheless,it does contain a love story, but it's the kind of guarded passion that grows between two people who spend a lot of time keeping their priorities straight."

","The Bodyguard is an OK film, but nothing particularly exciting, I am usually a huge fan of Costner's but here he pretty much bored me, and Whitney Houston should really stick to singing, plus while there are a few memorable moments, like the finale at the award ceremony, I found the killer to be quite predictable. Costner and Houston's chemistry was really lacking, and it's also way over long for it's own good, plus I am surprised this was the huge box office hit it was. It does have a few tense moments here and there, and Costner has a couple good scenes, however the ending is too stupid, as I felt there kiss was too passionate!. None of the characters were particularly likable, and this deserves it's low rating it has, plus the dialog was quite boring in my opinion. This had the potential to be a great entertaining film, but it's ruined by over length, and dullness, and characters we can't give a damn about, so Overall it's worth a watch i suppose but don't go out of your way to see it. **1/2 out of 5(barely)<br/><br/>The Acting is OK. Kevin Costner is alright here, but not at his best, I think he is a great actor, but here he is mostly dull, as is his character, he tried to come off as a Bodyguard who was tough, but I simply didn't buy it, he had a couple of good scenes, but he was mostly miscast. Whitney Houston is so so in her 1st major role, she's definitely good at the singing, but acting she's not that great at, I didn't buy her role, and her character got on my nerves. Gary Kemp plays his annoying selfish role well as Sy. Bill Cobbs is good in his role as Devaney and did what he had to do well. Tomas Arana is OK in his role, and did a decent job near the end. Michele Lamar Richards is OK as the selfish sister she did decent. Mike Starr is alright as Tony and brought some comic relief. DeVaughn Nixon is a cute kid, and did fine in his role."

All in all a very good example of a superstar topping up the pension scheme and possibly the worst of Kev's movies. Having said  all that,it is watchable,in a daydreamy sort of way.

The scene at the Oscars was pretty good stuff.

It's a great drama--romance, mystery, with a spice of humor thrown in here and there, enough to make you smile and lighten up the mood but not enough to make it seem tawdry. Kevin Costner's performance makes the whole thing for me: he spins a great character without becoming bland or stony. Whitney Houston is fairly good as an actress, smiling and charming in her pleasanter days, and obviously her songs are very good--I hope no one will contest that she has an excellent voice (or did; does she even sing anymore?). Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat. He's the precocious-almost-to-a-fault genre, but it was fun seeing all his antics and especially hearing the things he said.<br/><br/>I think this movie has gotten a much lower rating than it deserves.

When a singer hires him after she gets death threats, conflicts begin but feelings follow.<br/><br/>The Bodyguard plays out your basic romance and resists the urge to jerk any tears. I don't think the actors could pull it off though. There's a point in the movie, when they realize their romance, when their reactions don't make any sense, but afterward everything about the movie plays out like it should and it's well made!

","You're going to see ""The Bodyguard"" spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of ""The Simpsons"" with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song ""I Will Always Love You"" swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.<br/><br/>Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. ""The Bodyguard"" is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.<br/><br/>The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.<br/><br/>Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you.<br/><br/>""The Bodyguard"" is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numerous times, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!<br/><br/>I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in ""The Untouchables,"" opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).<br/><br/>The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it. But I don't respect it.<br/><br/>3/5 stars.<br/><br/><ul><li>John Ulmer</li></ul>"

"mattymatt4ever","7","1","6","23 September 2002"," The soundtrack is outdated, but the movie's still good
","I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it. Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy.  I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape.  It's a very impressive film that's both suspenseful and romantic, without being over-the-top.  The only thing that really bugged me was the soundtrack.  My cousins upstairs bought the soundtrack and would listen to it constantly, so I'm pretty much tired of hearing every single one of those songs.  <br/><br/>Kevin Costner gives an engaging, charismatic performance.  Whitney Houston is not a terrific actress, but she can pull of a dramatic line without making me burst into laughter.  So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance.  I've seen much worse.  And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs.  And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it. <br/><br/>
I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film.  We never see clips of her films.  All we see her do is sing.  So why not make her a singer and have the climax at the Grammy Awards?  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film.  It works well as both a love story and a thriller. And unlike most romantic films, the two characters don't constantly jump into bed together and the sex is left to the imagination.  We actually feel some real chemistry, through dialogue and character development.     <br/><br/>

"kira02bit","1","0","3","16 September 2019"," A real bore
","Critically ravaged action/mystery/romance has a cult following among viewers of little discernment, but it is difficult to see why. Stoic bodyguard Kevin Costner is hired to overhaul the security for pop star/actress Whitney Houston in light of some death threats. Naturally the two clash and then fall in love. Yawn.<br/><br/>The clunky screenplay had been growing mold around Hollywood since the days of Steve McQueen, who was the first star sought for the title role. Costner is oddly made up to resemble McQueen here. Costner's bodyguard, who is described as the best in the business, holds himself personally responsible as he was assigned to Reagan's detail but had a day off when the attempted assassination by Hinckley occurred. Thus ends the character development.<br/><br/>Naturally, since Houston is being threatened and Costner is there to make sure she remains out of harm's way, she will be cooperative...NOT. Truly there would be no movie if Houston's character reacted in any credible manner to anything that goes on around her. She talks tough to Costner in a few scenes and tries to order people around, but she reveals herself to be such a clueless ninny that she cannot even finesse an overly exuberant crowd during one of her concert shows - and she has purportedly been in the business for quite some time. In short, she exists solely to place herself in some form of conspired danger at every opportunity and then wilt.<br/><br/>Truthfully, the film is unsuccessful at whatever it tries its hand at. The mystery elements are half-hearted and even snoozing viewers will pinpoint the person behind the threats. Then again, Houston receives so many threats throughout the film - from audiences, from nuts, from people close to her - that it becomes difficult to keep track of who or what has her in their sights at any given moment.<br/><br/>The action scenes are a bust. Everything unfolds in such a plodding manner that even the most obvious and clumsy of scenes are related as though they are of monumental importance and dripping with relevance. Houston never seems to be seriously in any danger, the assassin seems almost foolishly clumsy, and there is zero sense of urgency to anything that unfolds.<br/><br/>The romance is deadly. To say that there is a lack of chemistry between Costner and Houston would be an understatement of colossal proportions. I can imagine frozen cadavers generating more heat. Costner is devoid of personality here and every line reading is flat. His pulse never seems to rise above resting. A bit of humor would have helped, but other than a mid-movie quip to an unwanted pass from a female partygoer, Costner remains a glum and uninvolving performer.<br/><br/>Houston is every bit his equal on this front. Playing a pop star diva/actress should not be much of a stretch for her, but the woman has no energy or life onscreen. Even her concert moments are lifeless. There is no warmth or excitement to her - even her attempts to be diva-esque are pitifully weak. The conclusion set at the Oscars is unintentionally hilarious because it is impossible to imagine Houston being seriously considered for any acting awards given her emotionless line readings herein. And listening to her relentlessly wail ""I Will Always You Love,"" which quickly became grating after endless plays on the radio is no selling point either.<br/><br/>Costner and Houston are singularly bad, but casting them as a couple on which to hang a film their combined effect is a virtual primer on how never to cast a romance. They are the antithesis of chemistry.<br/><br/>So we have a romance populated by leads that have no chemistry, an action film with no action and a mystery with no surprises. To say this is a huge failure would be kind. It does not even have a camp element to make it unintentionally fun. In short, it honestly has nothing to recommend it."
"lisafordeay","7","0","1","29 March 2019"," Incredibly underrated
","The Bodyguard is a 1992 Oscar Nominated film starring Kevin Costner and the late Whitney Houston and tells the story of a bodyguard named Frank Farmer (Costner) who is assigned to protect a well known pop star named Rachel Merrion(Houston) who is been stalked and threatened to be killed by a twisted killer. Although romance does blossom between Rachel and Frank,will Frank catch the stalker/killer who is trying to kill Rachel in time?<br/><br/>Overall the story is great,but the real reason why this film is good is for the music which is mostly done by Whitney Houston herself. The real twist with the killer is surprising as it builds up to allow the audience to assume that it's the white haired guy who has photos of Rachel everywhere but nope it's not him.<br/><br/>
<<>Spoiler alert>>><br/><br/>
It was Portman(who used to work with Frank) was the real killer all along. Nominated for 2 Oscars and won a Razzie for worst movie back in 1992(if I'm correct),this is actually not as bad as the critics were saying it was going to be.<br/><br/>

","This was a jock to romantic movies. I gave it a try because I'm a huge fan of Whitney Houston. As expected the soundtracks were amazing and I sang throughout the entire movie, but everything else was just BAD !
The acting was good, and Houston did a very good job unlike what others say, but the script was lame and predictable! And the worst part was definitely the inexistant chemistry between Kevin Costner (the bodyguard) and Whitney Houston. This was supposed to be a romantic movie, but there were barely any romantic gestures and to end the movie on such a unromantic-banal conclusion ?! I was very disappointed. The direction was awful and I think Breakfast at Tiffany (1960 movie) was better directed then this. I could clearly see the green-screen in the back during the scene where Frank was being shot at the cottage.
Very disappointed as I was told all my life how much of a classic this is. Awful, just watch for the good music!"

The highlight is of course the soundtrack which is also the best selling soundtrack of all time and one of the best selling albums of all time.

","Starring Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, who were both at the height of their star power this film is about a diva singer and her bodyguard. When Rachel (Houston) Marron's life is threatened, Frank Farmer (Costner) is hired to defender her. He is ex-secret service and she's a world famous pop tartlet. To co-exist they and survive they develop a special bond. This film looks at the relationship and all the drama along the way, as well as following the murder plot to take Rachel down and how Costner plans to thwart it. <br/><br/>I have to admit, I wasn't really a fan, maybe it's because it's a blatant chick flick - or maybe it's the soundtrack song by Whitney Houston that makes me shudder every time I hear it - putting me off the film. The plot isn't that complex and there isn't really any sexual tension or chemistry between the two stars - which is a surprise as the whole premises is the whole 'will they/wont they', 'do they/ don't they' between the two potential lovers. They aren't that engaging as characters and I didn't care less what happened to them throughout the film. Where Houston and Costner are authentic is in their individual persona delivery - Costner is supposed to be fairly dull and bland - which I believe; and Houston is supposed to be a bratty diva - which I could also have believed. This felt more like a vehicle for Houston's vocal talent than a real attempt at a film. <br/><br/>Overrated and not my cup of tea. I can't say it's a terrible film as some production value has gone into it and at least it's got a linear enough narrative to follow. 4 out of 10 from me."

"axlrhodes","7","0","1","23 March 2018"," An easy target for critics.
","The willingness to sacrifice oneself to save the life of another person is inherently romantic, which is the idea at the centre of The Bodyguard, a two-worlds-collide drama-thriller starring two of the hottest tickets of 1992's film and music scene, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston. <br/><br/>While it might make an easy target for critics, The Bodyguard is a film that connected well with audiences upon release. Much of that comes down to the perfect storm of three elements; Lawrence Kasdan's script (it rattled around Hollywood for years), Kevin Costner's leading man status and Whitney Houston's incredible vocal performance - particularly the mighty power-ballad 'I Will Always Love You', which ate up the pop charts. These three elements are competently stitched together by British director, Mick Jackson, who captures enough chemistry between the leads to paper over the gaping cracks that emerge. <br/><br/>Costner carries his brand of quiet man chivalry, which gives Houston room to find her character in their scenes, which are always engaging. You can only guess, but it doesn't seem a stretch to imagine the similarities between her character and what her life was like. The writing tries to examine what it's like to live in the cocoon of celebrity, but the direction of the narrative becomes increasingly about the thriller aspect of the story, leaving some, but not much to chew over. When the finale comes, it's a messy combination of awkward positioning and bad logistics, culminating in a predictable, mostly underwhelming conclusion. That said, given the right mood, The Bodyguard is entertaining mainstream cinema, held aloft by its star credentials."

I wasn't expecting much, and I guess that's why it exceeded expectations<br/><br/>. . . but only just.<br/><br/>Whitney for the most part fits what the role requires: stuck-up, naturally über-talented; she doesn't need much range.

He's got a ridiculous character name - but also drives an El Camino. The man is complicated.<br/><br/>But on the whole, the movie never rises above mediocrity. It's a love story without passion and the tension doesn't come until the last ten minutes of the movie (which it really needed much earlier). But I also didn't feel like quitting before the credits rolled, which kinda surprised me.

","The film that is chose is ''The Bodyguard''. This film is directed by Mick Jackson, the actors are Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner. Whitney Houston is a famous singer, she has a lot of 'love' songs very popular like: 'I Always Love You', 'Greatest Love Of All', 'How Will I Know' and 'All The Man Need'. She died on 11 February 2012, because she used too much drugs and alcohol.

Rachel and Frank learn each better and at the end, Frank is in love with Rachel."
"ElMaruecan82","8","0","4","21 November 2013"," One of the most emblematic romances of the 90's ...
","1992 left two romantic moments for cinematic posterity, both musically immortalized: the magic carpet ride in ""Aladdin"" where ""A Whole New World"" opened itself to Jasmine's dazzled eyes, and Kevin Costner protecting Whitney Houston from the riot that just interrupted her concert. While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with ""I Will Always Love You"" playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.<br/><br/>It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music: a film like ""Titanic"" will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and ""My Heart Will Go On"", ""Ghost"" for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the ""Unchained Melody"", and ""Dirty Dancing"" when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.<br/><br/>My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of ""The Bodyguard""'s reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. ""The Bodyguard"" would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of ""Titanic"", a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.<br/><br/>Today, most successful films are action blockbusters / Pixar / Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like ""The Bodyguard"" wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads): a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in ""The Barefoot Contessa"", she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.<br/><br/>Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy: ""anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part""; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.<br/><br/>And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.<br/><br/>Indeed, ""I Will Always Love You"" is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. ""The Bodyguard"" is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.<br/><br/>Naturally, ""The Bodyguard"" was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for ""Mommie Dearest"", some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called ""Mommie Dearest"" a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed ""The Bodyguard""."

","In this Mick Jackson-directed film from Warner Brothers, which was produced by Lawrence Kasden, Jim Wilson, and one of the two main stars...Kevin Costner..., the issue of interracial relationships is addressed; while that is a matter now tolerated but not totally accepted, even though it is much more frequent than it used to be, this movie presents it as a situation which can be warm, so much so that the sometimes-negative attitude toward it does not ""stick out like a sore thumb"", to employ a favorite cliché. Kevin Costner is in one of his best roles as the secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who is hired to protect Rachel Marron (played by Whitney Houston in her movie-acting debut), but neither has any idea that there will be love between them. In the movie Farmer does not beg Rachel Marron to be protected by him when the independent Marron is often hostile toward him, but that changes and then, again, love develops between them. Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waite do well in their supporting roles. The color is beautiful, so much so that the northern part of this country, with its snow-capped mountains is, in turn, beautiful and refreshing, and the ocean bordering Miami Beach is drawing and refreshing. There is plenty of exciting action, a bit of mystery, and, obviously, warm romance. Whitney Houston is her beautiful self as she portrays her consummate singing ability through such songs as ""If I Don't Have You"", as well as a signature song ""I Will Always Love You"". Because of all its trappings, the movie is one that could never be easily forgotten."

","I'm one to not like a lot of sex scenes, but I wish there was more romance between Rachel/Frank.... Overall I still love the movie. Hearing Whitney's voice however brought emotions to my ears, because her voice is beautiful, as well as she in no longer with us:( I like the suspense with a little romance all mix in one. As written in some of the previous reviews I saw about there being no chemistry between Kevin/Whitney? I notice it, but it's not throughout the entire movie... I saw chemistry on/off.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it was a great little movie, even my guy enjoys watches it, he sure isn't one for soft movies, but when a movie is great, its that! thumbs up to the late Whitney. a special thumbs up to the sexy Kevin Costner!"
"Robert_duder","7","0","2","24 September 2012"," An undeniable classic thriller, Costner at the very height of his career
","The Bodyguard was always one of my favourite Costner flicks. I am a huge Costner fan even though he has slipped from Hollywood stardom in the last few years. I hadn't seen The Bodyguard in awhile and wanted to review it so I sat down to enjoy it again. I was surprised to discover that I found it a little slow at times, that it looked a little dated, and while I still enjoyed my favourite parts, the grainy and gritty romantic thriller definitely ages itself. But don't let that discourage you. The film is still a classic of its time. The pace of the film is definitely methodical, it doesn't apologize for taking its time to really lay out the characters and the mystery surround the stalker. The characters are all very well developed and the chemistry between Costner and Houston is really what makes this film, and the music of course. Houston's soundtrack to the film is formidable, and brilliant and you buy her as an insanely successful pop princess because she was and still is.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner's Frank Farmer is this brooding, seemingly hardened former Secret Service agent. He enters the film mysteriously but you learn more about him throughout the film. Its really a great character and I can't imagine for minute anyone other than Costner playing the role. The late and legendary Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron. She's the hot headed, short tempered diva but her character takes a lot of turns too and she definitely becomes more likable though she really does remain a diva throughout. Her and Costner are just sexy and brilliant together. The film has a terrific supporting cast including Bill Cobbs, Gary Kemp, Tomas Arana and Mike Starr should be called out for especially strong supporting performances. Michele Lamar Richards does an okay job as Marron's sister Nicki. I always thought she was one of the poorer performances in the film which is really unfortunate especially being what a big important part she has in the film. DeVaughn Nixon does a decent job as Marron's son Fletcher.<br/><br/>Everyone works very well together and some of the chemistry (as previously mentioned) is truly great while others go a little understated like Houston and Richards as sisters. Director Mick Jackson was really just getting his legs under him when he directed this film. He does a good job, his direction is decent, but the pacing could have definitely been better handled by more experience. I think he got lucky with a strong cast, especially the stars, and a well written story. Regardless of its few flaws and its slow pace, The Bodyguard is a nineties classic and must see viewing for Costner fans and Houston fans. Its the perfect romantic thriller for a quiet date night. 7/10"
"TheLittleSongbird","6","0","3","21 September 2011"," Love/hate...
","The Bodyguard is an example of a movie that isn't for everyone. I personally didn't either love it or hate it, I was overall kind of eh on it. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters underdeveloped and lacking subtlety, the pace drags in the middle and the story makes little sense. However we do have some good cinematography, locations, costumes and editing, credible direction and a great soundtrack including the haunting And I Will Always Love You(and it will always be the best version no matter how many Huston wannabes try to sing it and end up murdering it). The acting is fine, Kevin Costner is good and Whitney Huston is more than credible in a role that showcases her beautiful voice excellently. Overall, The Bodyguard is a love or hate it sort of movie, but for me my reaction was mixed. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

","""The Bodyguard"" is bookended by two very excellent scenes.<br/><br/>Everything in between those scenes is primarily interesting in the way it condenses a number of very powerful fantasies. So you have the fantasy of a celebrity falling in love with a regular guy, of the chivalrous knight rescuing the princess, of being the ""strong silent type"" who can't help it that ladies (and their kids and sisters) fall for you, and for the ladies, you have a man dedicating his life to defending you, your nest and your kids.<br/><br/>The film was directed by Mick Jackson, a television director. His direction is plain, but the film channels well the tone of 1960s/1970s crime movies (""Point Blank"", anything by Siegel, Peckinpah, Steve McQueen etc). Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner are our stars, he doing a monosyllabic Steve McQueen routine, she a bit abrasive in front of the camera. Their romance is underwritten.<br/><br/>""Bodyguard"" movies were all the rage in the late 80s/early 90s, think ""Terminator 2"", ""The Specialist"", ""In The Line Of Fire"" etc. Why is this? <br/><br/>Pop culture and pop music have a lifespan of a few months if you're lucky, today's fad swiftly turning into tomorrow's joke. All this film's ""hollywood"", ""MTV"", ""music"" and ""popstar"" moments thus now look tacky, changing trends having rendered them silly. Costner's the only artifact who's survived, his character modelled after Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" and other Samurai flicks. Like McQueen often did, Costner strips his character down to the bare minimum, leaving time with nothing to take away.<br/><br/>7.5/10 – ""The Bodyguard"" made zillions at the box office, writer Lawrence Kasdan and actor/producer Kevin Costner hitting upon a script that condensed a powerful set of very archetypal fantasies. The film is worth watching for its opening and closing scenes. Plans are currently underway for a remake."

"jboothmillard","4","0","7","8 July 2005"," The Bodyguard
","Most people know about this romantic (not very thrilling) thriller film because of the number one theme song, from director Mick Jackson (Volcano). Basically former Secret Service agent turned on bodyguard Frank Farmer (Razzie nominated Kevin Costner) is hired by the manager of successful pop singer turned actress Rachel Marron (twice Razzie nominated Whitney Houston) who has recently been receiving threatening notes/letters. Farmer is haunted by the fact that he quit being a bodyguard for Ronald Reagan, just before he got shot. Farmer wants to keep his relationship with Marron professional, but he does agree to go on a date, and they do sleep together, but of course he feels this was a mistake, and she is obviously being bitchy towards him, and he knows he can't stop thinking about her ""in that way"". Rachel had been nervous going on stage during this difficult time, but you can imagine her fear on the big Oscar night when she is presenting an award, and then nominated for Best Actress, which she does win, and her assassin is certain. Rachel was saved by Frank, and he is later seen as she boards a plane with a new (older) bodyguard, but she can't take off without that big kiss. Also starring Gary Kemp as Sy Spector, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer's Bill Cobbs as Devaney, Ralph Waite as Herb Farmer, Tomas Arana as Portman, Michele Lamar Richards as Nicki, Dumb and Dumber's Mike Starr as Tony, Christopher Birt as Henry, Terminator 2's DeVaughn Nixon as Fletcher, Home Alone's Gerry Bamman as Ray Court, Batman's Robert Wuhl as Oscar Host, Debbie Reynolds and Deep Impact's Richard Schiff as Skip Thomas. Costner isn't completely believable, and as for Houston, while her singing is fantastic, her acting is lacking a lot of flare, and it is ironic that she was nominated a Razzie, and that in the film her character wins an Oscar. It just isn't my cup of tea for a thriller or love story, I found myself wondering why do so many people, particularly women, like this mediocre schmaltz, it is as the critics say (not very, in my opinion) entertaining baloney. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for ""I Have Nothing"", and Best Song for ""Run to You"", and it was nominated the Razzies for Worst Original Song for ""Queen of The Night"" (it's not that bad), Worst Screenplay and Worst Picture. ""I Will Always Love You"" was number 65 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Number One Singles, but also number 51 on The 100 Worst Pop Records, why? Okay!"

","Okay, I gave it a 10. I just can't help it. Costner is sexy as the reticent bodyguard and Whitney Houston was at her most beautiful. I'll even admit to having loved the soundtrack when it came out. I think the plot surprises, too - though that could be my relative innocence. My recollection is that the movie was critically panned. But it kept me up all night on late-night TV tonight - because I had to see the ending just one more time. I think my 9 year-old will love it, and I'm ordering it on Netflix. If you're looking for something intelligent, forget it. I also think you need to be female to see any merit in this movie at all, because it really is about Costner's appeal - to Whitney and to those of us up too late at night. He's not Benicio Del Toro (there's only one of those) but he's definitely well-cast for The Bodyguard. Watch it with a girlfriend."

","The movie ""The Bodyguard"" is of a singer, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), who is been followed by an obsessed fan. Her new bodyguard is an expert, Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), who is flawless and does everything to protect Rachel. So, it was a short plot in my words. The movie was actually pretty good, romantic and entertaining, though there was a little too little of drama and thriller. Kevin Costner probably did his best role as nowadays it is hard to even remember that there once was an actor by his name. Whitney Houston is a define B-class star, she should stay with singing.<br/><br/>The songs were the ones that saved the movie and made me almost but not quite love it. ""Queen Of The Night"" and ""I Have Nothing"" made me shiver and search the Internet for mp3-s. I'm really sorry that Whitney has gone from a great singer to a drug addict. Sorry, but that is the pure truth. So, to put this all together in a few words, I would say: sweet, entertaining, full of fantastic songs. 8/10 points from me."
"nitratestock35","Null","0","4","28 April 2003"," underacting, a wise choice
","Saw this movie when it first came out in the theater. I just saw it again on tv. <br/><br/>I must admit I always thought - and still think - that Kevin Costner is an overrated actor. He manages to be quite believable in this flick because of his underacting. But yet he has a hard time always finding the right facial expression within his (IMHO) limited range. Whitney Huston on the other hand did a rather good job since she has to go through many more emotions. Of course she only is really at ease when she sings. When she is afraid or furious, her lack of acting experience shows through. <br/><br/>I only can thank the director Mick Jackson for telling both stars to take the underacting approach during dramatic and romantic scenes. It actually works. Check Kevin Costner in JFK when he has his final speech and fights his tears with his voice failing. He just seems to shy away instead of putting his heart into it. The same goes for the, admittedly much less dramatic, scene near the end of ""The Bodyguard"" when he has to fight his tears for a moment (sure he is a tough guy). I still bought it because it was very subtle. Very good direction.<br/><br/>The only movie where Kevin Costner really convinced me was ""A Perfect World"", directed by Clint Eastwood, made one year later.<br/><br/>
The music is definitely outdated especially for ther flashy digital keyboard sounds which are by now replaced by either rougher or more machine-like sounds. Yet it's nice listening to the last remains of glamour in pop music. It's all but gone by now. <br/><br/>Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>I found some of the music numbers a bit exaggerated with all fireworks and everything. I also found it one too many that Rachel (Huston) actually won the Oscar. I guess it's the lack of a setup (we don't even know the film Rachel is in and neither the other nominees, so we don't really care).<br/><br/>I totally agree with one user comment that points out the poorly constructed plot regarding Rachel's older sister and the killer. I even would like to add that her phrase ""I never would hurt Fletcher"" was of very bad taste. So she's a good girl after all. She doesn't hurt her nephew, she ""only"" wants to kill her sister. Hmmm. That can't even be explained with feelings of guilt clouded by booze. <br/><br/>End of spoilers.<br/><br/>All in all still an enjoyable movie. Production values are excellent and the complete supporting cast is simply great. I also liked the fact that the racial differences are not mentioned in the dialog.<br/><br/>*** out of *****"

","Lawrence Kazdan has written a dozen of memorable films and directed some of them ( 'Body Heat'(qv) is among the very very best films noirs ever ). Here he selects the hate of Nikki for her extremely successful younger sister as the basis of his plot. Why not ? But difficulties arise when it comes to explain how a girl without connection with the underworld can get the services of a gun for hire. Kazdan tries it thus :  full of guilt over the unwanted near-death of her nephew, Nikki confesses that ,-though so drunk as not to remember the name of the bar she went to -, she made enquiries and got in touch with a go-between , and hired  a killer (perhaps the best one in the States, by the way!); and she paid the whole price (a quite sizeable sum ) in advance - when she could have been so easily swindled . The confession is conveniently stopped  by the yapping of the watchdog; and immediately after, she is ( also conveniently ) bumped off when trying to stop the killer ... But "" The Bodyguard "" being a very well made and entrancing film, the foregoing shortcomings of the plot  appear only long after the film has ended . The cast is quite satisfactory  : I am not an unconditional fan of Costner's, but he manages well enough, and has some powerful chemistry with Whitney Houston; she is quite convincing in her movie debut, and her voice is a marvel. And all supporting actors are well selected , including reliable veterans Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waithe, and intriguing Tomas Arana. The film made quite a  pile of money, but apparently did not help the career of its  director, Mick Jackson."
"teejayniles2345","9","0","5","5 July 2002"," Why it's nowhere near CASABLANCA
","This fairly well-constructed movie/music collage is rather dated as my wife and I watched it again July 2002.  The 10-year gap wherein some of the plot deficiencies would be unbelievable nowadays makes this seem ""long ago in a legendary land.""  The ""Mine"" club scene especially seems like a 1930's kind of gag since passing a grown woman in a kind of ""mosh"" setting would never really happen with such a harmless, happy ending.  Being stranded at the remote family hideaway with no lines of communication or emergency back-up plan also seems pre-World War II. To enjoy this movie one must enjoy the pop sound of Ms. Houston as well as tolerate the country (light) music of ""I will always love you.""  It is admittedly wacky when it dissects the Oscar/Academy Awards facade; after all, nobody ever really muffs their lines when the television audience is 2 billion viewers, really (??). This movie should never get serious consideration for telling its viewers that much about ""LOVE"" as does a much better but still ""dated"" movie: Casablanca (director Michael Kurtiz).  I believe that BODYGUARD is alluding to it in its choice for an airport penultimate scene; neither principle actor in the 1992 casting approaches the sensuality and romantic extremes of Bergman and Bogart.  Who is the ""third"" side of the LOVE Triangle in this subtextual riff?  Probably the Bodyguard's own sublimated Father-figure aspect with the Diva's son.  That kid is left adrift in more ways than one in the course of the movie -- whether he can swim and just what the ""name"" of the Diva's nominated movie is seem to be not very solid at different points of the screenplay.  For its strengths of music and comedy (sometimes inadvertent), I give it an ""8"" out of 10 star rating."
