"TheRationalist","5","161","192","31 March 2008"," Not The Movie It Could Have Been
","This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.<br/><br/>In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.<br/><br/>The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.<br/><br/>Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.<br/><br/>an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","6","158","216","3 April 2008"," Nothing new, but it's worth the watch
","21 is definitely the major film for the spring time, it has young hot actors, including an incredible academy award winner, Kevin Spacey, and another great actor who's head looks like it grew quite a bit bigger, Lawarence Fishburne. So it has all the key ingredients for a good movie, a decent plot, over all a good combination of actors, and looks like a well put together movie. So I saw it this weekend and I have to say that I was a little disappointed, I think this movie was more for the teenagers, with the actors and the rating, I think it should've been more adult. It was a typical rise and fall story with cliché'd characters. Kevin Spacey, seriously my favorite actor, he's always a dead on hit with every role he takes on, but he seemed to just sleep his way through the film and didn't really care about it. He and new and hot up-comer, Jim Sturgess were not a bad couple on screen, but were not strong enough to hold the story into something original.<br/><br/>Basically we have Ben Campbell who needs $300,000 for Harvard Med. School, he's extremely gifted with numbers, so when his professor, Micky Rosa notices his gifts, he invites Ben with a group of his other students to go to Vegas and play 21. But there is a way to beat the game apparently, by counting cards. Ben promises up and down that it is just for school, but of course when he gets so hot, he takes it way further and ends up making a huge mistake and gets caught with some nasty security guards you don't wanna mess with.<br/><br/>Now 21 has decent enough acting, the movie itself is decent, I didn't mind at all watching it. For the most part, it's the young group of students that keep the movie interesting and keeps your attention. My main problems are for example about the characters Ben and Jill hooking up, I seriously doubt that would happen for real, but for the movie, they want these two hotties to get together at least for the teenage audience's sake. Also supposedly the group says they have to stay on the down low in Vegas so they don't get caught, yet they go around Vegas buying all these new clothes, clubbing, drinking, etc. 21 is worth the watch, but to be honest, if you're reading this, wait for the rental, it's just a regular rise and fall story.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Rogue-32","2","92","125","1 April 2008"," Doesn't even work as a fairytale
","I was intrigued by the preview of 21 because I'm a sucker for films about gambling, and this is a film about gambling ~ it's the director/writers gambling with our intelligence, hoping we're completely devoid of brainpower, which would make us stupid enough to buy any of the claptrap we see on screen in this bonafide turkey.<br/><br/>The beginning is good, it's only when the true fun should be starting - when Ben starts going to Vegas as part of the blackjack team headed by Micky (Kevin Spacey) - that the movie begins to seriously fall apart.<br/><br/>Vegas is a huge town, with literally hundreds of casinos, but these clowns wind up going back to the SAME casino, over and over, using the SAME signals to one another (their ridiculous signal to indicate a hot table, for instance), until it's more than blatantly obvious to the security overseer, Laurence Fishburne, that these stooges are playing a very dangerous - and stupid - game.<br/><br/>The story then continues on its deathtrail of stupidity, with the storyline and the characters' behavior becoming more and more ridiculous until Ben - duhhhh - loses Everything and has to - double duhhhh - find a way to outsmart Micky (a 2-year-old could outsmart this guy) and get his life back together. The way it's done is even stupider than what proceeds it, what with Ben luring Micky back to the SAME casino for one last shot at the Big Money. ""They'll know us there,"" Micky says, ""So we'll have to wear disguises."" Oh yeah, genius - a cowboy hat and fake mustache really make Spacey look like a totally different person (not), and even stupider --- they show up using the SAME signals that they've used all along; yes, these giboneys are that dumb.<br/><br/>Then, to insult the audience even further, the writers tack on what they believe, in their deluded states, to be a double surprise ending. By this time, the only surprise is that anyone is still left in the movie theatre."
"Lechuguilla","8","214","310","28 March 2008"," ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner""
","Slick camera work and some good performances rev up the technical quality of this fact-based story about a 21 year old MIT student named Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) who, along with his brainy Ivy League chums, travels to Vegas to win tons of money at the blackjack tables. Their sleazy math professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), leads the group. Rosa has devised an elaborate and conspiratorial card counting scheme that consists of code words and hand gestures. With all that preparation, the group's scheme does work ... for a while. And in the process, the shy, cautious Ben, who only wants the money for tuition costs, morphs into his alter ego, a person quite unlike his original self.<br/><br/>The film's pace starts off leisurely, then alternates between fast-paced Vegas casino action and periods of downtime wherein Ben and his girlfriend, fellow conspirator Jill (Kate Bosworth), talk shop and take in the high life. The story does have a villain, but it may not be who you think it is.<br/><br/>The script's dialogue is snappy and hip, and contains minimal tech jargon. ""Variable change"" is one such math term, and it has thematic implications toward the end, as the story twists and turns in ways that may surprise you. And ""winner winner, chicken dinner"" is the group's lingo for gambling success.<br/><br/>Production design is realistic and lavish; this is a big budget film. Color cinematography, by DP Russell Carpenter, is polished and slick. There are lots of elaborate camera dissolves and close-ups. The best parts of the film are the close-ups of the characters at the blackjack tables. Film editing coincides with plot pacing, and ranges from slow to super fast. Acting is all-around good. Kevin Spacey gives his usual topnotch acting job; Sturgess and Bosworth also give fine performances.<br/><br/>It's not a perfect film. Background music was noisy and rather nondescript for my taste. And I could have wished for more card playing, and less time spent on Ben's college buddies in the first Act; the result is that the film gets off to a slow start. Still, the script is credible, and stays close to its book source ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich.<br/><br/>Thematically relevant in today's world of greed and materialism, ""21"" is a terrific film, one that has greater import than other films, because the events in ""21"" really happened. And the fine performances and polished visuals enhance the overall look and feel, to create a film that is both engaging and entertaining."

","21 is worth seeing on a restless Friday or Saturday night with friends, but it isn't anything more than that. The film features nice performances from actors Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, as well as nice entries from the lesser known ensemble.<br/><br/>However, it doesn't take a film expert to notice some of the more...awful lines. ""That's is impressive software.""...come on, seriously? Just bad writing.<br/><br/>And the flow of the plot is painfully cliché, up until the end where things are admittedly pretty unpredictable. The ending was unexpected, but it worked and made up for earlier plot points that were predictable.<br/><br/>""21"" is entertaining, that's it. Nothing more, nothing less."

","The true story of six MIT kids who try to fleece Vegas is embellished to say the least in ""21."" There's lots of added drama, a heap of unintentional campiness, plot twists you can see coming down the Strip, and a love story thrown in for the hell of it. This flick was made for the MTV set...the mechanics of how these kids actually count cards to beat the system is explained quickly but not well. I'm probably an idiot (and I haven't read the book upon which the movie is based) but I still don't get it. This movie makes the ""how"" not really matter anyway. Why explain boring old math when you can have montages of our ethnically diverse group of spoiled geniuses bar hopping and shopping at Louis Vuitton? If you've seen the trailers than you know 21...there are no surprises here. There is a long running time that makes the last 30 minutes of the film agonizing. There's a few ham-fisted plot twists and double crosses and I kept expecting the movie to end...then WHAM, another scene of our lead character back at the tables in a cheesy disguise and more slow motion shots of the dealer flipping cards.<br/><br/>Sturgess is barely passable as Ben...he doesn't quite have the magnetism to pull off the various emotional shadings required of the role. There are parts where he underplays emotion and parts where he overplays them...he never really finds a medium. ""21"" would have been great ten years ago; give me Giovanni Ribisi in the Ben role and you have something cooking. But Sturgess is pretty blah...so is Kate Bosworth, who looks a lot like Priscilla Presley and nothing like a college student. The only two actors worth a damn here are Spacey, the acerbic ringleader of the young card counters, and the underused Jacob Pitts, who helps recruit Ben into the group.<br/><br/>21 does well to show the all-night-long decadence of Vegas, and there are some beautiful shots of the Strip at night. Otherwise the flick is by-the-numbers garbage."

","Before making a movie about blackjack and card counting it would have been a good idea to read some of hundreds of books on this subject available in any major bookstore. That would have prevented the creators of this movie to look like a bunch of ignorant fools totally lacking even general knowledge of the game of blackjack, card counting and casino's countermeasures. Here is why:<br/><br/>1. Nowadays blackjack is played with 4-6-8 deck shoes cut in the middle (or 2/3 at best), which makes the player's edge (if any) so small, that making any profit is mathematically possible only in the long run. It means that no matter how favourable the count is, you chances of winning a particular hand are increased by such a small percentage, that before making any profit you may be losing many hands and even suffer substantial financial losses. Only if you are ready for losing streaks in the process and patient, and if you don't make mistakes with count and basic strategy, you may be winning in the long run. Coming to Vegas for a weekend and making fortune by winning all the time is an absolute nonsense.<br/><br/>2. To prevent card counters from making money casino's security personnel do not abduct them in the middle of a crowded casino, torture them in the back office and take away their winnings - casinos simply ban card counters. Casinos in the US are legally private clubs: they don't charge admission fee and it's up to them to decide who will be allowed to enter the club. Since card counting is not illegal (it's just a skill), nor casino security, nor law enforcement can arrest anybody for it without serious consequences like losing casino license and possibly serving jail time. Not all casinos ban card counters, but those which don't changed blackjack rules to the degree that card counting would not overcome house edge.<br/><br/>3. Besides blackjack related issues a person who keeps more than 300 grand cash in his dorm room can only be seen as a complete idiot. Obviously depositing this money in a bank account in the US could have caused problems with IRS, money laundering regulations, etc., but renting a bank safe deposit box could have solved the problem altogether. The image of a brilliant MIT student acting like a retard doesn't make any sense and makes me question the intellectual level of the screenplay writers.<br/><br/>Conclusion: stay away from this movie - don't degrade yourself by watching it."
"waltboyisme102","8","116","179","26 March 2008"," 21 Leaves out Elements of the Book, Adds New Excitement
","After Reading Ben Mezrich's ""Bringing Down the House"", upon which this movie is based, I was excited to the movie. I am usually let down by movies that are based on books, but that was not the case this time.<br/><br/>Although there were a handful of cliché parts of the movie, all in all it was excellently done. The visual effects were well done, and the acting on the part of Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, and Kate Bosworth, was exemplary. Some people may criticize Spacey for his 'gusto', but I believe his portrayal of Mickey was stellar.<br/><br/>The movie had suspense, a solid plot line, scattered funny scenes, and a good ending. The people I went with, none of whom had read the book, found it an even better movie than I did. If you like the movie enough, I recommend reading the book for a more complete story."
"pyrocitor","7","66","100","2 April 2008"," Just as predictable yet enjoyable as the game depicted
","Considering the risky pleasure generally associated with gambling and the seductive thrill of watching a heist or scam unfold, it should come as no surprise that 21, a film which combines the two aforementioned premises should excel at being enjoyable. And while the film may be very familiar ground to anyone with in any experience with Ocean's Eleven style crime capers, and the majority of the film's plot points verge on being almost laughably predictable, it is executed with enough exuberant flair to make it worthwhile in the midst of its formula. <br/><br/>A slow start gives the necessary exposition as to how a thoroughly ethical young MIT student (Sturgess)'s desperate need for money to attend Harvard medical school leads him to join a team of mathematical geniuses trained in blackjack card counting who routinely rip off Las Vegas casinos during weekends between class. However, this opening proves overlong, overly predictable, and largely unnecessary, dragging far too much before plunging into the film's real fun as Sturgess and his team are engulfed by the seductive glamour of Vegas and the thrill of the huge monetary takes. Some judicious editing, clearing away such unnecessary subplots (such as a robotics competition with Sturgess' tiresomely stereotypical nerdy friends) could have resulted in a far more streamlined and faster paced film. <br/><br/>Some viewers may take offence to the ""Hollywoodizing"" of the MIT team, with team members of different ethnicity largely shoved to the background in favour of the typically gorgeous Caucasian leads, a disconcertingly common practice in modern day cinema. However, the flashy MTV style cinematography and editing ably capture the engrossing spectacle of Vegas, and once the film gets going, it would be difficult to deny the sheer enjoyment of being swept up in the heady rush of quick wealth and all of its hedonistic trappings.<br/><br/>The film's quality cast add credulity to the frequently underwritten characters they portray. Jim Sturgess once again impresses as the ethical math prodigy slowly corrupted by a world of superficial glamour, his endearing charm putting an intriguing enough take on the ""troubled but well meaning hero"" archetype. As one might expect, Kevin Spacey effortlessly steals the show as the charismatic but ruthless professor managing the MIT card counting team, and Spacey's easygoing yet commanding presence is a profound boost to the film. Kate Bosworth contributes a typically flat performance, but given her token 'inevitable love interest' role, she fails to detract much from the film's overall quality. Lawrence Fishburne adds class, much needed dramatic weight and moments of grim humour to his antagonistic burly head of casino security, gradually catching on to the MIT team's scamming.<br/><br/>While the age old adage of 'style over substance' certainly holds true here, 21 may essentially epitomize the modern Hollywood crime caper film, but the formula hasn't quite run dry enough to overly detract from the enjoyment factor. The film's snappy visuals and strong casting are mostly enough to make up for a largely uninspired and frequently weak script. However, fans of similar works will not be disappointed, and for those willing to forgive the film's frequent delving into the wells of convention and accept entertainment over profundity, 21 should prove an ideal watch.<br/><br/>-7/10"
"mike872","4","21","29","31 March 2008"," 21 A Bad Shuffle of a Superb Nonfiction Classic
","21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.<br/><br/>The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movieseems bent on helping casino ecurity Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.<br/><br/>In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.<br/><br/>Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.<br/><br/>In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.<br/><br/>In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is not an MIT prof but a professional gambler.<br/><br/>The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another.<br/><br/>In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.<br/><br/>The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. <br/><br/>Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma and the four fellow MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them even graduated from MIT.<br/><br/>Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was marekt designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.<br/><br/>The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity."

","There are three kinds of bad movies. The kind that you'll see for free on HBO or the like if you're bored enough, the kind that are so bad they're actually funny and worth the occasional viewing, and then the kind that you never want to see again. 21 is the latter. And the only reason it got a two instead of a one was Kevin Spacey since he was the only interesting part of the whole movie.<br/><br/>You know those movies that leave you with the feeling of ""thank god that's over""? Well, 21 goes above and beyond in terms of bad moviedom and found a way to rob us of that nice, warm, and lovely feeling of accomplishment for managing to sit through the whole thing. Among the incredibly numerous cliché's in this film you find the hero of course getting everything he ever wanted in life at the end yet for some reason the director decided to play ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" during the wrap up portion and credits of the movie. Now I am all for movies that make you think and have a big message at the end but playing ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" while the main character is going over in detail how he did get everything he wanted is like saying violence is bad while shooting someone repeatedly in the head, it just doesn't work.<br/><br/>There was one thing I will give the movie. It's predictable. I love the comfortable feeling of knowing that I will be able to predict the course of each and every scene two seconds in to them. I can't stand it when the scene where the main character becomes estranged from his best friends due to varying reasons depending on the movie that are usually incredibly childish springs on me from left field, especially when its followed by the scene showing him losing his cool and doing something stupid, I hate seeing that coming! And I wouldn't have been so touched by his mom offering him $68,000.00 dollars to pay for college if it hadn't been painfully obvious she was about to do so. And of course who would want to not know without even having to think that he was going to refuse the money and make up a lie about why he was because he was ashamed of himself? Because of course no one likes original work, we need more clichés damn it! More story arcs and more recycled characters we all have seen god knows how many times!! I will cease this ragging after I bring up one more point. At the end, surprise surprise, there is a case scene of the main characters running away from the casino security. *SPOILERS* the main character Ben gives the bag of chips to Spacey's character and split up to ditch the guards. Later Spacey opens the bag and its all fake chips and they justify this by showing Ben and his girlfriend Jill switching bags but the problem with that is simple, there was no time. From the moment that Ben had the bag to the point he gave it to Kevin he was with Kevin every step of the way and the shot of the switch they're in a bathroom or some kind of hall, calm and taking their time. It again just doesn't work.<br/><br/>I'll admit I didn't have the highest hopes ever for the movie but I had expected it to be better then this. Just keep this in mind if you're thinking about seeing 21, you have seen this movie. You have seen it many times with many different names. But you have in fact seen it. I promise you."

","Unless your in the mood for a extremely predictable movie that can be watched mindlessly this is not the movie for you. It consists of watching endless amounts of hands of blackjack which is the most boring card game probably to watch ( I play poker so I am probably biased but I wasn't the only one who said this of the people I was with.) I also found the main character to be annoying with just how awkward he was I dislike all characters in movies who are awkward this always disturbs more than mild violence because I probably can relate to it better. i felt the main character tried way to hard to achieve this role if your looking for a gambling movie definitely just re-watch the classic Rounders."

","I went to see this movie, earlier this afternoon, because Kevin Spacey and Lawrence Fishburne were in it. And, any film in which they appear is pretty good, more often than not. This film, however, was one of the ""not's.""<br/><br/>I mean; the premise was initially intriguing. And, some of the banter thrown about, by the various characters, was surprisingly somewhat funny! But, past the ninety-minute mark, I began to get bored. I actually ceased caring about Ben Campbell!<br/><br/>His gradual transformation from ""the Anakin Skywalker of MIT"" to ""the Darth Vader of black-jack"" was so predictable, to describe the rest of the film as ""less-than-riveting"" would be putting it charitably. So, I walked out. Completely uninterested in knowing whether or not Ben got the girl and/or the Harvard medical scholarship. Nor will I waste any money on the eventual DVD to find out.<br/><br/>In short: the early promise shown by this movie gets broken really fast. And, not even Messrs. Spacey and Fishburne can change that."

","I was lucky enough to see this film for free at a special screening in greater London as part of a market research by the film industry. even though it was free i would have paid good money to see that film. but I was presently surprised about how good the film was and everyone seemed to agree that the film was really good. I thought it made the card playing parts actually riveting even though i am not a card player myself. i thought the acting performances were all good especially that of Kevin Spacey's. In terms of the story. In many ways it reminded me of all the good things that was in the BBC TV show hustle. But in a much more real way. On the down side, you may see the ending coming and there is a romance part of the film that feels unnecessary. However it is a very slick film that gets away with it. I would say that it clearly the best film in this genre of film. I enjoyed it more than films such as Confidence and the Oceans 11 type films. I would highly recommend it to anybody when it eventually comes out in April!! I would have thought that they would cut down and re-edit it a bit on the basis that it was quite long. however it kept my attention for the whole film and that is not something that is also done during these sorts of films"
"JustCuriosity","7","73","125","9 March 2008"," Good, but not Great
","This film screened at the SXSW Film Festival in Austin, TX. It is a reasonable well-made based-on-a-true-story film that tells the story of a group of MIT students who attempt to make a fortune counting cards in Vegas. The screenplay apparently plays pretty fast-and-loose with the version told in the book. Never-the-less, the acting is excellent - especially Jim Sturgess in the role of the lead student. Honestly, his accent was so good that I didn't realize - until he came on stage afterward - that he was British. He does a great job with the mannerisms to give you a real sense of the character's evolution. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are solid - although Fishburne's role is fairly small. The minor characters are not as well-developed as they could have been. The cinematography of both Boston and Las Vegas is quite good, especially on the big screen. It's an interesting story, but they could have edited down a bit to make it move a little quicker. This is a good film, but it probably could have been a lot better."
"Mccadoo","6","11","15","15 April 2008"," Entertaining but with major problems
","Let me begin by saying that I haven't read the book this movie is ""based on"" so I went in with no pre-conceived expectations. I enjoyed the movie, it was definitely worth a night at the movies however, I had some major issues with it that really detracted from my viewing enjoyment and yes, I know it's just a movie, but when things occur in a movie that's based on actual events that yank me out of the flow of the plot that's a problem. Things that jumped out at me were; The main character is supposed to be a genius and yet he hides over $300,000 in his ceiling?? No one is that stupid. Especially since there was no need for him to hide it at all; he won it gambling in Vegas, where gambling is legal, hello? He would have had to pay taxes on it but all he had to do was declare it as gambling winnings and open a bank account, or better yet, a short term CD to earn some interest. What did he plan to do, drop $300,000 in cash on the Dean of Admissions desk at Harvard Medical School? That would have gotten the IRS down on him in a heartbeat. It just didn't make any sense and was an incredibly stupid and unbelievable move.<br/><br/>The group was counting cards which is not illegal but will get you banned from any casino that catches you. I would think they would have wanted to keep a very very low profile so they didn't attract attention. Wasn't that why they wore disguises? And yet, they stayed in suites, walked into the casinos greeting everyone by name like high rollers, they did everything they possibly could TO call attention to themselves. Again, it just didn't make any sense.<br/><br/>Vegas casino's are all owned by major corporations these days, the days of the mob running the casinos are long over. Casino security does not beat people up over counting cards anymore, they haven't for a very long time. They escort you off the property and ban you and that's all. The main character could have filed a complaint with the Nevada Gaming Commission (because again, he hadn't done anything illegal), and the casino would have had a lot of questions to answer.<br/><br/>The main character's mother offers him a check for $68,000 for medical school, telling him that she's been saving it for years for him so he could go to medical school. So she obviously didn't pay for MIT if she's been saving for years for this, how did he pay for MIT? I assumed he'd gotten scholarships but they never tell you one way or the other.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey's character steals his money and is going to see that he doesn't graduate, huh? Again, the main character hasn't done anything illegal, other than not declaring his winnings and paying taxes on them. On the other hand, I can't help feeling that the powers that be at MIT would take a very dim view of one of their professors acting the way Spacey's character did. All our hero had to do was go to them and spill his guts, I'm sure he could have gotten at least one or two of the others to back him up, probably the guy Spacey had already bounced from the team. He also could have gone to the police and reported the theft of the money in his room, OK, so he would have been in a little hot water with the IRS, but he would have kept at least a large portion of the cash.<br/><br/>Casinos don't usually comp luxury suites to big winners, more often to big losers so they'll keep coming back. They want the big winners to go elsewhere. And we're back to the low profile thing again.<br/><br/>There are a great many casino's in Vegas, if your trying to get away with counting, why would you go back to the same one (the Hardrock) again and again? Those are just the ones that come to mind at the moment. Again, I did enjoy the movie, but my enjoyment was tempered by the things I've listed above that were, in the end, kind of an insult to the viewers intelligence."

","""21"" bets that it can build on the excitement of the book upon which it is based but busts by going over the top.<br/><br/>Here's how bad this movie was: ""Jumper"" was more entertaining. 'Nuff said. Need more explanation? OK, here goes but there are lots of spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the book ""Bringing Down The House"" by Ben Mezrich. The book is a quick read with a detailed and captivating explanation about how a group of college students, led by their professor, beat the system in Blackjack using knowledge of statistics, memorization techniques, and teamwork. That is, they had a really successful system for counting cards. I found the book compelling.<br/><br/>However, as I read it, I realized it wouldn't translate well into a movie because there just wasn't a lot of action in the traditional sense and it didn't have a ""Hollywood"" ending; the card-counting team just kind of fell apart and each member went his or her own way. So I was very curious to see how the filmmakers would try to jazz up the story.<br/><br/>Here's the irony: They embellished the story significantly and still managed to produce a tedious, predictable movie that didn't do justice to the characters, setting or tone of the book. I recommend reading the book and skipping the movie.<br/><br/>Here are some of the differences I remember between the movie and the book. Caveat: my memory might be a bit fuzzy here - I read the book a few months ago. <br/><br/>In the movie, there is a scene where a jealous card-counting teammate practically rats out his buddy at the Blackjack table, likening him to the Dustin Hoffman character from Rain Man. This scene is awkward and unbelievable and a far cry from anything in the book. In the book, the tension and dynamics between the teammates were much more subtle, but I guess subtle doesn't work on the big screen.<br/><br/>Apparently, the inexplicable popularity of ""Superbad"" means there now has to be an incredibly nerdy, weight-challenged, wannabe stand-up comedian in every major studio release. That's a shame. He wasn't funny in ""Superbad"" and he wasn't funny in ""21"" (yeah, I know it's not the same actor). Nothing against the weight-challenged, just the blatantly unfunny. <br/><br/>You know a screenplay is weak when the big confrontation between the college student with the double life and his techno-geek buddies occurs because he puts an 8K chip in their science project instead of a 16K chip. Who writes this stuff? <br/><br/>I don't remember the ""Ben abandons his nerd buddies"" subplot being in the book, but I could be wrong about that. It's pretty trite regardless. <br/><br/>In the book, the team kind of just falls apart, primarily as a result of too many close calls with casino staff and a particular loss prevention specialist. The team also corrodes from within due to jealousy, disillusionment from a few big losses, and resentment that the organizing professor doesn't seem to be taking any of the risk while collecting his reward. Some of the money gets stolen but they're never sure who did it and so the team just kind of dissolves. They try to regroup in various configurations but it doesn't last. Financially, everybody still makes out reasonably well in the end.<br/><br/>In the movie, Ben gets beaten up by the loss prevention consultant (played by Laurence Fishburne), gets all of his money stolen by his professor (played by Kevin Spacey), exacts revenge on the thief by improbably teaming up with LF (who has a personal vendetta against KS), then loses it all again to LF's five-finger pension plan and six-shot revolver. But don't worry, he'll probably get a scholarship to Harvard by wowing the administrator with tales of his wild experiences. I haven't seen a college administrator that wowed by irresponsible behavior since Richard Masur in ""Risky Business"" (and he had a much better reason). Then again, I guess it's not much different than scoring big by writing a book about it, which actually did happen.<br/><br/>So far, you might be thinking the movie sounds a lot more exciting than the book and I'd have to agree. But somehow it still manages to fall flat on screen. <br/><br/>The book emphasized the team's use of disguises and alternate personalities very well. This was an element of the movie, to be sure, but it seemed very underdeveloped and I was surprised how much more entertaining it was on the printed page than the big screen. Same thing with the initiation scene, Ben's transformation into a ""player"", his enjoyment of the Vegas VIP life, etc. <br/><br/>In the book, the pursuit by the loss prevention consultant was much more dogged. It wasn't confined to just one or two casinos but went nationwide. The film really didn't capture the determination of the pursuit very well or the number of casinos the team hit.<br/><br/>I could go on and on but, thankfully, IMDb's word limit won't let me. So I'll just mention a few bad things about the movie that have nothing to do with it being based on a book: <br/><br/>1) At 2 hours long, the movie seems very drawn out given its rather shallow treatment of the subject matter. <br/><br/>2) Kevin Spacey seems to have a trademark style. It is menacing yet monotonous - as contrasted with Jack Nicholson's style of menacing and maniacal. Jack's style usually works, sometimes in spite of itself. Kevin's style doesn't seem to be producing memorable performances lately. He's made some great movies, to be sure, but after ""21"" and ""Superman Returns"" I'd say he's officially due for a comeback. <br/><br/>Many movies that have strayed from their literary inspirations have been entertaining and worthy in their own right. ""21"" is most definitely not one of those movies."

","I'm pretty easily entertained and I thought this was perhaps the worst movie I've ever seen in the theater. I was intrigued because of the documentary of the MIT group I saw on one of the cable channels (History Ch., Discovery Ch., or something like that). The movie moved entirely way too slow. I can't believe Kevin Spacey decided to be affiliated with this horrific waste of film. Seriously, the documentary was more entertaining than the movie. <br/><br/>I've already spent enough time in the theater on this piece of garbage so I'm not going to write anymore about it...but what a complete waste of a Saturday night this was."

","I enjoyed the movie because it was entertaining all the way. It was slick and had interesting characters. The only problem was the last half of it where credibility when flying out the window. The movie is all about supposedly very intelligent people, led by the smartest of the all the group, the only veteran in this college age-dominated cast: ""Professor Mickey Rosa,"" played by Kevin Spacey. Well, Rosa would not do what he did here, for starters, meaning trusting an untrustworthy and revenge-seeking kid. If you've seen the movie you know what I mean. The others in the group wouldn't go along with the renegade - ""Ben Campbell"" (Jim Sturgess) - either. There is no way this kid is going to totally outsmart the professor, but it makes for good Hollywood dramatics.<br/><br/>There are a bunch of other holes, too, such as wanting to be anonymous but going back to the same place; a ridiculous chase scene through the casino gambling area and kitchen; hand signals that a junior detective could see (and are never changed!) and - maybe the worst - winning tons of money in sessions. Nobody with half a brain would win much at any session, because it draws attention. You win a little here, a little there and go from place-to-place and remain anonymous. This movie is based on a true story, and I can guarantee you that's what the MIT students did in real life - not what you see here.<br/><br/>Still, facts aside, it's still a fun movie to watch and since entertainment is the name of the game with films, it succeeds and I still give it an ""8"" star rating for that. At no time was I bored and overly insulted at the dumbness that I would have stopped playing the DVD. It will hold your interest and you'll be thoroughly entertained, especially if you don't know a lot about blackjack and how casinos operate.<br/><br/>Oh, as a postscript: they don't beat up ""card counters"" in back rooms of casinos. If they think you are counting cards, which I don't believe is illegal, they still have the right to kick you out of their establishment.....but they ask you nicely and you are removed from the floor with no big scene or violence. They have your picture, there are security people everywhere, and you aren't allowed back.<br/><br/>So, enjoy the film but don't believe the screenplay."

It was just BORING. I figured it would boring, but I saw it anyway just because nothing else was playing at the time.<br/><br/>Aside from being totally boring, there was one particular error that really bothered me. The characters throughout the movie are visiting a variety of casinos in Las Vegas. All kinds of different casinos on the strip, and some of the casinos that are nowhere near the strip, such as the Red Rock Casino. However, no matter where they go, Lawernce Fishburn's character is watching them, and happens to be at the casino they are in no matter when they are there. How did he magically transport himself around the entire Las Vegas valley like that? It was really obvious that the movie makers did not take this into consideration. They just expect you to believe the Fishburns character is inside every casino at all times.<br/><br/>Another thing that bothered me about this movie was the geographic setting of the casinos. I live in Vegas, so I know that the Hard Rock casino is NOT located on the strip, as it was depicted in the movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie sucked, I hated it, and I wish I had not wasted my time seeing it.

I couldn't have been more pleased. Was it the same as the book? Of course not (except for The Green Mile, what was?) But it was action-packed, smart, fun, well-acted, well-directed, and just plain enjoyable. Spacey, Fishburne, and Bosworth are at the top of their games and Jim Sturgess is going to be a star. The visuals were great, the editing sharp, and the score right on point. I don't know whether to stay up all night re-reading the book or hop on a plane for Las Vegas to try to win while I still halfway remember the counting system. I enjoyed this as much as any light fare I have seen in a long time. I love George Clooney, but ""21"" is an order of magnitude better than any of the ""Oceans"" movies."

Then we meet our leading actor Ben something, the singing frog of the movie ""Across the Universe"", as a very sharp-witted campus kid trying to persuade the dean of the Harvard Medical School to access student scholarships.<br/><br/>A gambler gang of campus kids leading by Kevin Spacey drives Ben and the others' -including Kate Bosworth as another campus kid- minds over gambling in Las Vegas by means of proved mathematical methods of counting cards. Ben, who must have swallowed a calculator, becomes the smartest one of all. We are witnessing our campus kids how actually they gamble with cheating over cards at a casino.

There are a bunch of technicians trying to catch whoever does cheating on the games.<br/><br/>The actual happenings of the story is hidden behind the script.

The best friends (total fiction) were cute and made for some comic relief.<br/><br/>This COULD have been a really good movie if it followed the true story closer though, rather than having the ridiculous premises that it did.

","I personally think that Jim Sturgess is a very promising actor. His stage presence was believable and he has a lot in store for him. Being a film with Sturgess, Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishbourne, I was pretty stoked for this film. However, 21 turns out to be quite drawn out and the trailer for the film seemed more exciting.<br/><br/>The story is inspired by a very popular book called ""Bringing Down the House"". The main character, Ben Campbell, goes to MIT and need 300,000 dollars to go to med school. To suffice this requirement, he is invited by a group of students to a Blackjack group. He learns the technique of counting cards and goes to Las Vegas every weekend to make money and enjoy the high roller life at the same time.<br/><br/>The premise of the story sounds very interesting. However the story seems to stray to many Hollywood clichés. Despite interesting characters, it can be pretty obvious how the characters affect the plot. The film also incorporate multiple strands of storyline together into one film. The film is built of Ben's experiences in Las Vegas, his relationship with his older friends/his mom, and the security professional who is trying to put an end to the Blackjack Team. Although the transitions between storyline are effective, the side stories aren't very exciting to watch and again it is pretty predictable.<br/><br/>The dialogue is very slick and fluid although I was not completely assured by Sturgess's ability to act and speak in American English. Also, the film doesn't throughly explain the concept of counting cards. I was confused to what he was doing at many points during the film. Also I think it was possible to cut out some of the scenes in the film. It got a little drawn out and wasn't adding much to the overall story plot.<br/><br/>When the ending was nearing, I felt like this was going to end very poorly. It had caused me to temporarily not like any of the characters. However, the film went a little further in the ending than I thought it was going to be and it turned to be a fulfilling ending. Overall, 21 was a bit of a disappointment. Despite the slick dialogue and promising story, it became too predictable and drawn out."

I'll sum up how boring the movie makes LV: several scenes in strip clubs with no one naked. Oh, I almost forgot...there was one happening stripper with rose colored star shaped pasties. Pastie bosomed strippers/lap dancers in Las Vegas circa 2008? Not even in Shecky Greene's day.<br/><br/>It would be hard to care for these characters even if you were related to the actors. One more howler: card counters from MIT staying under the radar, winning hundreds of thousands from various casinos, but shown in several scenes (I should have counted them) being greeted by name as a high rollers by doormen, casino executives, and dealers.

Based on what I've read about the movie's background since watching it, I think I'd describe that as ""very loosely based ..."" Essentially, the story is about an MIT student (Ben, played by Jim Sturgess) who needs $300,000 to attend Harvard Medical School. How's he going to get it? He's applied for a full scholarship, but although he's brilliant, it's not looking good. Then , along comes one of his math professors (Kevin Spacey), who turns out to be a former gambler who's developed a system for counting cards in Blackjack and then recruits the best and brightest students at MIT to be his team - he teaches them the system and they fly to Las Vegas repeatedly to gamble and share their winnings, until they get caught.<br/><br/>Setting aside the Hollywood deviations from the ""true story,"" I just didn't find this to be all that interesting, nor did I feel any particular sympathy for or closeness to anyone, except maybe Ben's two former best friends, who essentially get the brushoff from Jim once he's embraced his new lifestyle as a high roller. For whatever reason, there was an attempt to build an unnecessary romance into the story between Ben and one of the female gamblers which added nothing to the story.

","Yes, 21 has elements of the wonderful book ""Bringing Down the House"", but the core of what this bastardized film is was taken from a Canadian film by the name of The Last Casino (2005, Maple Films, Starring Charles Martin Smith, Katharine Isabelle, Kris Lemche, Albert Chung and Jullian Richings.) In The Last Casino, Professor Barnes is a broken down gambler with a serious debt to be paid. To buy himself more time he trains a group of math students to count cards and earn money for him and ends up biting off more than he can chew and his team can handle. That's about the only major difference between the two films other than big name actors in 21 and the characters in both films. Personally, save yourself the long agonizing trip, go to BlockBuster (Or go online.) and rent The Last Casino. You'll get almost the exact same movie, with better acting, a better presentation from a film made with less money by a better company at likely less than the cost of a theater ticket.<br/><br/>Even Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne aren't enough of a saving grace to make 21 a decent watch to me and many of my film loving compatriots.

","Unfortunately for audiences going to see the new movie ""21,"" the producers of the film didn't adhere to that all important Vegas slogan that gives reprieve to the city of sin: ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas."" In the case of the new movie that follows a team of Blackjack card counters, the story should've been left alone in the book it was based on and never graced the silver screen. Unlike other films of Las Vegas lore, ""21"" didn't feature such grittiness like that of ""Casino"" nor the charming wit of ""Ocean's Eleven."" What the film did feature, however, is monumental melodramatic moments and lackluster directing that had me struggling to keep that $10 soda I bought from squirting out my nose. In fact, the only redeeming quality of the film was the end, which came only after an excruciatingly slow two hours.<br/><br/>The story, based on the bestselling book ""Bringing Down the House,"" hinges on Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) as a quiet MIT undergraduate who lacks the resources to attend Harvard Medical School. It is only after he is invited to join an established team of card counters that Ben sees a way to raise the $300,000 he needs to pay his way to becoming a doctor. The team features four other students, including Ben's schoolboy crush Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth), and is lead by MIT professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Ben finds himself to be a whiz kid at this card counting business and starts raking in the cash, meanwhile abandoning his best friends (one played by Josh Gad channeling an unfunny version of Jack Black) and his studious lifestyle of old. Shenanigans prevail and sooner or later, Ben finds himself in deeper than he can handle.<br/><br/>Where the film falls flat is undeniably in it's writing. There's an old Hollywood adage that says you can't make a good movie out of a bad script and this is no more true than in the case of ""21"". The film seems to force the concepts behind card counting and blackjack on the audience through unnatural speeches that divulge too much of the info through the dialogue. For instance, Campbell is explained how Blackjack is played early in the movie, but this crash course of game rules seems more intended for the audience than for Ben and thus it fits weirdly in the movie. The script also is chock full of one-liners that fall flat on their face. The opening line is ""winner, winner, chicken dinner"" and there are other magical nuggets of word wizardry sprinkled throughout like ""you were born for this,"" or ""In Las Vegas, you can become anyone you want."" And not to mention that the nerd jokes - ""We almost had a girl at our party!"" - become decreasingly funny after the second one.<br/><br/>The movie also seems to suffer from a cinematic and directorial standpoint. Director Robert Luketic, whose other efforts include ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Win a Date with Tad Hamilton,"" doesn't know when to stop using slow motion. The movie probably wouldn't be, or feel, as long as it did if there hadn't been such a ridiculous amount of slow motion. There was slow motion everywhere to the point where it became so diluted and lost its power as a device. Luketic also decides to sprinkle in heavy use of montage that, when juxtaposed to the melodramatic scenes in between, serves only to remind of the touching scene in ""Zoolander"" that results in a montage of frappuchino drinking and gas fighting.<br/><br/>""21"" tries to be complex in its story and its themes and motifs but along the way it forgot what it should've been about  a team of young geniuses scamming hundreds of thousands of dollars from Las Vegas super casinos. Instead, the film spends much of it's time trying to elevate itself above a generic heist movie. The mistake in this, however, is that most moviegoers are there to see a heist movie. Luketic devotes so much of the 2 hour running time trying to build up Ben's world to the audience that the money making card counting scheme gets relegated to slow motion montage.<br/><br/>There was little that I enjoyed about ""21"" save for the bright neon lights of the Las Vegas strip making for some beautiful shots of the glowing city. It's a shame that the film came out as it did because it featured a cast capable of so much more and a story that had potential to dazzle audiences. But instead, the movie lost itself in trying to be more than what it was and transformed into a monster of bad pacing and over emphasized emotions. ""21"" was trying to bet the house but unfortunately for itself and audiences alike, it only came out busted."

Its cast are barely noticeable providing solid but forgettable performances. Instead of going all out 21 plays it really safe meaning there isn't much progressing at all. This is an absolute waste of money for anybody who isn't committed to sit through two hours of absolute nothing. It even manages to make gambling boring.<br/><br/>Our lead man, Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) puts up with a dry uninteresting script and tries to make something out of it. Its only real attraction ho0wever are Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey who if you ask me can do a hell of a lot better than this. Its beautifully shot with some spectacular cinematography but like a lot of 2008 outings 21 is a good looking dud that pilots down the runway but never takes off.<br/><br/>Director Robert Luketic adapts Ben Mezrich's best-seller Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions to tell the true-life tale of six genius students who used their brains to beat considerable odds. <br/><br/>Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) may be shy, but his wallflower reputation betrays his inner brilliance. As smart as Ben may be, however, if he can't pay his his tuition he'll be kicked out of M.I.T. Fortunately, the answer to all of Ben's problems is right there in the cards. <br/><br/>Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader -- eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) -- in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code.<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate teammate Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits. Laurence Fishburne stars as Cole Williams, the Sin City security chief who catches on to the group and makes it his mission to expose their lucrative blackjack scam.<br/><br/>There isn't much more for me to say only that even if the plot synopsis might excite you really don't bother with it. Its 30 minutes too long, and even at that its one of the dullest outing of 2008. Avoid at all costs. <br/><br/>My Final Verdict? Is that 21 is a poor adaption of Ben Mezrich's best seller and if you're looking for a good gambling film your best off stick to Oceans 11 starring George Clooney. A film that isn't afraid to take chances and that actually manages a few smiles."
"TheUnknown837-1","3","5","7","18 December 2009"," one tired old cliché after another in a movie that had me looking at my watch every ten minutes for the entirety of the second and third acts
","""21"" is one of those movies where if you are only looking for an investment where all the dollar value was put into the visual presentation and not a dime was spent on the story, it's right up your alley. If you like movies that are eye-rolling in their idiocy but make up for it with oh-so-popular clichés, it will suit you, as it did the majority of my generation. But if you are like me, where you realize that the story and the integrity of a picture is most important, then ""21"" is nothing but sheer boredom. Just as a measure of my ennui, I didn't have high expectations, but I looked at my watch for the first time at the forty-five minute mark. And my eyes shot back there every ten minutes for the remaining one-point-two-five remaining hours of the film before the credits finally rolled and I unleashed a big sigh of relief. The torture was over.<br/><br/>""21"" is also one of those movies that assumes that just because it's based on a true story that it's automatically going to be gripping. Well, documentaries are the same and I've seen some documentaries that were flat-out boring as well. It all depends on the quality. And in terms of its visual presentation, ""21"" works. But where it really counts, in the story, in the characters, in the timing, it falls before it even takes off. It's about a Harvard professor (Kevin Spacey) who enlists the top students in his classes to travel to Vegas for the weekends to ""count cards"" at the casinos and make millions. The latest recruit is a stereotypical dweeb well-played by Jim Sturgess who needs money to pay for tuition. And what follows is just one tired old cliché after another.<br/><br/>There was hardly a moment in ""21"" that I could not predict. It's just the standard rise and fall story with the same old morals about pride and greed. Once again, we have the dweeb with talent but no money. Things go well at first, then he goes over his head, things go bad, his hot girlfriend gets ticked off at him, so on and so forth. I knew right off the bat the sort of mentor-student relationship that Spacey and Sturgess would have. I knew that Sturgess would have a pretty girl (Kate Bosworth) smiling at him from the corner of the screen. I knew there would be a moment where somebody just blows it andwell, you get my point.<br/><br/>Most premises, even clichéd premises, can work out if they are done right. But ""21"" is not done right. The look of the picture is good, the directing is acceptable, the acting is quite good, but the story, the characters, the energy of the picture, the believability, it all just goes out the window, or should I say, into the card dealer's pocket. And it's our money they're snatching unfairly away from us. It's got the look of a professional picture, but is just as fun as watching a gambler's home videos. ""21"" is not a worthy investment."

I could criticise the one-dimensional characters, the irritating soundtrack, or a Kevin Spacey who came across as an actor who was busy saying his lines, while concentrating on something else entirely, but there's something even more seriously wrong with this film, and it's this: The whole foundation for the movie is blackjack card-counting, yet isn't it astonishing that the fundamental theory for this is never explained. I wasn't expecting an in-depth yawning analysis, but c'mon guys, the explanation is limited to a couple of sentences of blackjack rules, and that's it!

","""21"" was the official Opening Night Film of the 2008 SXSW Film Festival. The film is based on the true story of a group of MIT students who use their math skills to ""beat the house"" at blackjack in the Las Vegas casinos. Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") directed the Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb adaptation of Ben Mezrich's bestselling book ""Bringing Down the House.""<br/><br/>""21"" is pure Hollywood all the way -- slick and polished, like the wardrobes and personalities inhabited by the kids in their transformation to high rollers. The tight ensemble cast includes Kate Bosworth and Jacob Pitts as team players and Laurence Fishburne as a security chief with a massive dilemma on his hands. But the show belongs to Kevin Spacey as professor Mickey Rosa, mastermind behind the escapade, and Jim Sturgess as Ben Campbell, the reluctant recruit who drives the film as it barrels headlong to a breathless climax.<br/><br/>The script is clever, funny, and worthy of math geeks everywhere, and the widescreen action is as nonstop as that on the casino floor. Spacey is Spacey at his best -- just the Kevin we know, nothing more, nothing less -- and that's good enough. Sturgess, a Brit playing an American here (quite well, by the way), proves that he is destined for stardom in the States.<br/><br/>In the intro to the screening, Luketic explained how Spacey had bought the rights to Mezrich's book, leading to his having to fight to win the actor over and let him direct the film. Memo to Kevin: thank you. And, whatever you do, wait for the end credits. The stunning remix of the Rolling Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" is almost worth the price of admission."

","21 and the Change Education Can Make<br/><br/>Ben Campbell is a poor college student. He wants to transfer to the Harvard School of Medicine to become a doctor. With his poor background he must obtain a scholarship of some sort. When he applies for the scholarship the interviewer tells Ben to tell him something special about him, something crazy that stands out. He has nothing. At this point. During one of his classes, Ben surprises and grabs the interest of one his professors with his knowledge. This professor leads a team of very bright students who go to Vegas on weekends and times off to count cards at casinos and make a lot of money. After Ben surprises his professor someone tells him to go to a room later that night. At this point Ben has no idea what they are up to. When he finds out what it is they are doing he wants nothing to do with it. This shows that educational goals are personalized. The team uses their education for money and luxuries while Ben uses it to advance and makes money by working not something that could toil with his future. Ben is laid back and could be better known as not much of a risk taker. As the movie progresses and his education on something else changes you will see a big difference in his character.<br/><br/>A girl on this traveling team finally gets Ben to take a different path than what he is used to. He starts to go the practices the team has and eventually is talked into going on one of these trips. He realizes the big money he is making will pay for Harvard and then some. As the movie progresses his education on card counting and making of money change his personality. He starts to dress up nicer, become a little cocky, and loves the feeling of winning. Which is a complete different person than from the beginning of the film. I feel education definitely changed him. If he was never given this opportunity he would have never been like this. His identity changes completely to the point he doesn't use his real name and changes his appearance. This movie indirectly shows that the goal of education is money. He always needed it and when he got it he was happy and lived a more satisfying life. He almost even forgot why he started counting cards in the first place. In Ben's case education was the key for him to reach his aspirations as a doctor. This movie really displays the use and change education can make. Ben goes from one person to a complete different other just because of education.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the movie all of Ben's acquired money is stolen by the group leader. After this he realizes he forgot what he has started all of this for and how he has changed. The team, other than the leader, decide to go back on their own. Where Ben makes enough money for school and then backs out. He is no longer this craving gambler after this but definitely is not the same as he was in the beginning of the film."

","Fairly entertaining, but you've seen all of this before. It's another story about people beating the powerful gambling houses in Las Vegas at their own game.<br/><br/>The movie's line, ""It's counting, not gambling!"" should read, ""It's futility, not science."" The counting key cards idea is neither effective nor new. It's characterized here as being genius, which is almost laughable. Also, they use the old routine about gorilla-sized casino security guards watching everybody on video, standing by to beat somebody to a pulp. Like always, their leader is some demented head-basher. Then, when they actually chase somebody, there's maybe three guys (in a casino which would hire hundreds of people), and they always grab the wrong person, lol.<br/><br/>Most of the cast overact somewhat, especially the lead who goes emo for no apparent reason. The lead couple have no chemistry. Kevin Spacey, as the unilateral demigod of the blackjack team is effective in his role, and Laurence Fishburne as the casino boss is suitably menacing. Many of the later twists can be seen from a hundred miles away, but two items might creep up unexpectedly. Some plot complications seem contrived. There seems to be a weak reference to gambling addiction or something; but it's not developed properly. It's used only as a cheap plot complication.<br/><br/>Worth a watch if you have nothing else to do."

Perhaps someone from IMDb should publish a definitive protocol. But 21 was just such a film. I didn't actually walk out of the cinema early because I was at home watching it on DVD. But I really had neither the patience nor the heart to carry on with this formulaic drivel. Yes, I know that the US market it so big that even drivel can recoup its costs and then - hopefully - some.

Otherwise save your money, whether this is showing at you nearest fleapit or 'on offer' at your local supermarket. Save your money and buy a decent DVD instead.

","This is a film about a group of MIT students who count cards in Vegas under the mentorship of their linear algebra professor, and win big before inevitably it all goes wrong. It's apparently 'based' on a true story; trouble is, I guess the true story isn't terribly cinematic so they've had to embellish it, and it's obvious where they've done so - the additions are grafted on very heavy-handedly.<br/><br/>Certainly at the start it's not a bad film, it's quite light in tone and has some nice humorous touches. The introduction to card counting is fairly interesting, although I think the method outlined here is probably rather simplified to allow cinema audiences to follow it.<br/><br/>A major problem for the film is that Blackjack simply isn't a much of a spectator sport; poker may not be all that great to watch if you're not playing, but at least you can craft some drama from the to's and fro's of a hand. Pontoon, though? Forget about it - it's just too simple a game.<br/><br/>Since the game isn't all that interesting, the film must rely on the characters, and while Jim Sturgess is good enough in the lead role of the student who takes part reluctantly only to raise funds his doctorate before being seduced by the easy money, reminding me here a bit of Tobey Maguire and Jake Gyllenhaal, none of the others ever rise much beyond a cardboard cutout - including Kevin Spacey, who has precious little to do here as the professor. Most wasted (and objectionable) of all here, however, is Lawrence Fishburne, playing a casino 'loss preventer', in the film for little more than a cameo, and never really rising beyond the role of a simple thug. The other gambling students are shallow and unlikeable, whereas Sturgess' old friends are geek stereotypes straight out of Weird Science.<br/><br/>One flaw that really stuck in my mind was that for all the talk of the need to be surreptitious and under-the-radar of the casinos, the students go out of their way to get noticed, going crazy Vegas-style repeatedly, and employing ludicrously obvious signs to each other, never once varying them - if they wanted to get noticed by the casino security people they went exactly the right way about it. I very much doubt if this is what happened in reality.<br/><br/>The twists at the end are all a bit contrived and aimed towards producing an ending that ties everything up neatly; too neatly for me, it was totally unsatisfying. The choice of You Can't Always Get What You Want for the final credits is as predictable as the rest of the film. Horrible mix, too."

He is in desperate need of money required to study in Harvard. He is trying hard but that's not enough at all. He then joined his professor Kevin Spacey and gang of four students to explore the gambling world of Vegas. Plan is to make a quick fortune with their skills to count cards while playing. How Jim joins this group, gets addicted and finally, comes out of it is what the movie follows. Crisp narration by the director, well thought of script and excellent cinematography is enough to keep you engaging. Though you can predict the outline as what will happen next but the way it is been shot has made this movie an interesting watch. Jim as the main lead has done full justice to his role and so do Kevin Spacey. The supporting crew including Jim's friends and four students as partners in crime is worth watching. Laurence fishburne too looks so real in his character. In a good movie, every character is assigned to bring out specific emotions and feel like love, fear, etc. In 21, each character is for specific feelings. You can relate feeling of fear, love, betrayal, anger, affection, confusion and etc with each character.<br/><br/>Another best thing about this movie is the climax. I think the director knew that his audience is smart and they can easily predict what will be coming in the end. This is where director uses an interesting twist which excites the viewers and surprise them. In 21, my favourite scene is not one but various close-up shots of actors playing at tables in the casino. Brilliance of great camera work. Movie doesn't have punchy dialogues which I think is an deliberate attempt. Characters could've had become loud and over acted with heavy dialogues which is not at all required here. Characters in this movie have deliberately been kept low and close to reality. 21 gives a fresh feeling with its gripping script, focused narration and great star cast. And that's the reason why I thoroughly enjoyed the new hit formula of movie making called 21."

","This film has a youthful enthusiasm which is infectious and a young cast that pulls off the infection. It is done Hollywood Flashback style in that it starts after everything happens, goes to back to how it happens and then ends by going back to the beginning.<br/><br/>Overall, sadly, it obviously spent a lot of money in production but tries to simplify things a bit too much. While it is entertaining, it is much too simplified to interest the serious gambler. The appeal here is in telling the story in a light mood, interesting a young audience, and entertaining it. In that sense it succeeds though not on quite the stylish ease that a movie like ""The Sting"" did. Of course that one was a best picture. This one is not.<br/><br/>AS I have not read the novel, I am not sure what liberties were taken from the true story but my feeling is that the true story here is a better tale than the movie one. That being said, as I put my brain away & look for light fare, this one fills the bill quite nicely. Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and the rest of the cast do quite fine in going through a not too serious treatment.<br/><br/>I have seen worse, & better films than this one."

","The story never gripped me; there never was a point in the story where I was in suspense or moved emotionally. The plot plodded along with predictability and shallow conversations that left me wishing the movie was over long before the end came. As much as the movie was supposed to deal with counting cards and gambling, there were very few scenes dedicated to it. The transformation of the lead character was predictable. The only bright spot was the actor who played his best friend - he seemed like the only believable character in the film. If the film was supposed to be based on a true story, they should have left some of the Hollywood out so that the story felt a little more authentic.

I had to figure out what the count of cards was on my own. It felt nice to have to use your brain a little to figure something out, but as I was reading other posts (comments) I learned that what I had figured out on my own was very primitive and much more elaboration would have made things clearer and given the movie a little more edge - although its pretty round edged to me.<br/><br/>Why would the MIT professor be so cruel and mean and cold, to the point that he had to call the casino security which results in the beating of one of his ""brilliant"" students who had made him tons of money.<br/><br/>How could that same professor so quickly be convinced in a scene of about 1 min and 45 seconds to go back to the table and play a ""last round"" with the same student he had screwed over and so openly called as a cunning genius...

","Straight A student Jim Sturgess at MIT is having a real problem, he's one of many geniuses trying to get into Harvard Medical School, the cost is going to be over $300.000.00 if he does not get a prized scholarship that several other geniuses are competing for.<br/><br/>So it seems too good to be true when his advanced calculus professor, Kevin Spacey, let's Sturgess in on a little sideline he has going for him. Seems that Spacey has recruited an elite team of his most promising students to work the blackjack tables in Las Vegas, something he used to do himself, but now he's too well known there. Blackjack or 21 he says is the most popular game at the casinos and the one it's easiest to beat if you know how to count the cards.<br/><br/>Counting cards isn't exactly illegal, but something the casino owners do discourage. The discourager is Lawrence Fishburne and he's pretty good at his job, at both spotting and discouraging counters.<br/><br/>Spacey's team consists of Sturgess, Jacob Pitts, Aaron Yoo, Kate Bosworth, and Liza Lapira and all do a good job at convincing you they are actually MIT students and not pretty faces from Hollywood pretending to be geniuses. Spacey of course is his usual fine self.<br/><br/>I particularly liked Pitts's performance as the kid whose jealousy of Sturgess ultimately wrecks the whole operation. 21 is a pretty good film with good location filming on MIT and in Las Vegas giving it an air of authenticity.<br/><br/>You have to love how Sturgess gets the bankroll to Vegas."

"Quinoa1984","4","4","7","2 April 2008"," want to take a gamble? this movie STINKS!
","Robert Luketic, director of 21, doesn't have as his major folly to change the characters from the book (which I have not read but heard a bit about) from an all Asian group of card counters in Las Vegas to a more 'mixed' lot (i.e. about 1/4 are Asian now). Nor is it even his casting of his lead actor (Jim Sturgess probably brings more charm to the two-dimensional part than one would've thought was possible). His biggest folly was not questioning as he went through the motions of making a silly, contrived, hyper-slick-music-video-shot-in-Jiminy-Jilikers-High-def if there was anything to change up on an audience who knows such motions through and through. The only thing that might differentiate this movie from a whole host of smart-guy-in-a-new-dirty-pond flicks (and I can't name them all but the likes of Rounders is a masterpiece compared to this) is that the characters turn into models from GQ and Maxim by the time they hit it big in Vegas. Not expecting much from 21 is just about right, or even worse.<br/><br/>And don't get me started on Laurence Fishburne and Kevin Spacey. It's a paycheck day once again for these two very good- sometimes even fabulous- thespians, who slum their roles as a would-be-DeNiro-in-Casino and a shady MIT professor who by the looks of the movie should be characterized as team-leader-Satan respectively. They too understand what is going on in 21, which is an ol' fish-out-of-water fable about smart people doing stupid things with lots of money at stake as an MIT kid (Srugess) with aspirations for Harvard med joins a group that goes to Vegas and stakes out hundreds of thousands per weekend by counting cards and hustling from table to table. I guess, in a way, I don't blame them for not doing much at all with their roles. But one would hope that there would be something, ANYTHING, that would make this as something for them to distinguish, that the director &/or the script would give them something to do aside from filling in pat performances from at least a good few other parts they've played.<br/><br/>As mentioned, Sturgess at least brings a little bit of interest to a character carved out of some sympathy as kid who gets in way over his head. There's not much else with supporting players either. Kate Bosworth is the kind of actress whom you think can sort of act, or at least knows how to *pretend* to really act. But there's also something just not there clicking, something when she puts on the 'concerned' face that just screams so bland that you can't even take it. The writers also plug in clichés of yester-year (and not long enough): Jacob Pitts as the snotty side character in the group who is just too jealous and stubborn to stay in the group long once Benn arrives; the old nerdy friends from before Ben's trip into blackjack land, who are there as a function and not as any real character 'base'. And then there is the script in and of itself- giving us such forlorn twists and turns in its final reels that I want to choke on my popcorn- and the direction as well, which pumps up the volume for the kids while making sure to completely sanitize a real Vegas experience for college-aged younguns (and, of course, the shallowest of all, the two hot male and female leads have to hook up, without much connection whatsoever).<br/><br/>Maybe you could give it a couple of quick peeks, maybe five minutes, when it's on TNT in a couple of years. But as far as giving any substantial money to this enterprise? The house wins, Johnny, that's the way it is."

","You know the studio is nervous about a film when the publicists are leaking stories about the ""steamy"" love scene between the stars. (As it turns out there was a harmless 10 second scene that had no steam and no passion). ""21"" is an unusually slow paced drama loosely based on a card counting scheme pulled off (at least for a while) by some very smart MIT students. The fingers of the development executives are all over this film--an unconvincing love story about a nerd who gets the hot chick; the devious professor masterminding the kids for reasons that are murky; the security team worried about how advancing technology is impacting their careers, once based on gut and guile. The film meanders to find a real theme and the conceit that the single smartest student at MIT had to count cards in Vegas to pay for Harvard Medical School (according to the movie only one scholarship per year is granted and the last recipient was a Korean with one leg!!) is preposterous. Apparently, student loans are a thing of the past. Instead of a fast paced story about greed (which is what this film should have been about), we get a meandering drama that fails to convince at any level. The acting was generally good considering some of the ridiculous dialog that the actors had to embrace. Kate Bosworth has lost any sex appeal she may have had--anorexia ain't sexy. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne get a chance to ham it up a bit. In the end, the film is too driven by a need to please all quadrants and ends up pleasing none."

","21 certainly won't go into my books as the most intelligent or deep movie I've ever seen, in fact as far as Hollywood films go 21 is about as shallow as they come. They stack the cast with some big names, flashy romance, the latest fad...in this case cards...Blackjack to be exact, and people will come out in droves to see it. Now there was a Canadian made film about this same story entitled ""The Last Casino"" (see my review) and if you ever get a chance to see it definitely check it out because it's one of the better Canadian movies I've seen and it also actually is much smarter and more artistic than 21 but tells the nearly identical story. Still 21 has some key elements going for it including a new hot lead actor that is very talented, a big budget, fun with cards, a half decent story and a little romance thrown in to boot. It just won't have you walking away feeling any smarter or better about life and that's okay as long as it entertains.<br/><br/>Latest It Boy Jim Sturgess following his success in Across The Universe plays math genius Ben Campbell. Sturgess has this definite quality about him that I predict will make him an absolute star and big movies like this definitely help and he already has a recognizable face. He is very energetic and really shines on screen and he is just someone you relate to and can watch him in this adventure plus he gets to show some emotion and probably the only character with depth in the film. Kevin Spacey is the powerhouse of the film or at least he's supposed to be. I mean in all fairness he does well as the leader of their gambling group and a University professor but he doesn't do as much with the part as I would have thought. He doesn't really grip you as much as he could have considering the man can act and is a legend in his own right. Kate Bosworth is lovely but in all honestly I found her downright boring in this film. She does little to nothing other than look cute and be a romantic interest for Sturgess' character which I thought the entire romance felt forced anyways although they had decent chemistry. Fellow team members Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira are practically non existent as the entire film focuses almost entirely on the three of the main big actors which is unfortunate for them. Someone who does stand out from the rest though is larger than life Laurence Fishburne as an aging security agent for Casinos. He is really great in the role and makes an awesome anti-hero to the story.<br/><br/>The cast is decent although no one really is mind blowing but that could be because of the rather lack luster script. You know a twist is coming and you're trying to figure it out as you go but even if you don't figure it out the twist doesn't really shock you or anything. Basically what I am saying is that millions will see 21 and probably enjoy it and I don't disagree with them. The film is fun but it's just not something that will stick with you for very long. It's Hollywood fodder made to make money and it will likely do that but don't expect it to be a time lasting classic or anything. But check it out and see for yourself. 7/10"

","In this exuberant, smart and fast-paced drama/comedy, there is no denying that you can't have fun watching a hard working, but financially struggling kid, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) become seduced by the wily king of card-counting Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey). It is good to have thrown in such a veteran actor like Spacey into a mix of new comers like Campbell, Kate Bosworth or Aaron Yoo. Also Spacy produced the film, based on Ben Mezrich's autobiographical novel ""Bringing Down The House"" which chronicles the uprising and downfall of the group of card-counters. Campbell is a hard-working kid that uses his intellect to arouse the attention of his mathematics teacher, who just happens to be the leader of a group of intelligent cheaters who go to Las Vegas every weekend to, well, count-cards. At first Campbell is skeptical in taking part in such an activity, with a history as unnerving as it is, but being informed that there is no danger and it is not at all illegal, he rethinks, because in order to get into Harvard Med, he needs 300,000$. Mickey informs him that within a month of joining them on their escapades, he will have the money easily. The humor is spread through the film, the dramatic elements are the dangers that the weary kid faces, being Casinoss what they are with security, and the serious points about what greed and desire do to you. Campbell said he was only in for the money he needed to get into Harvard, but it is harder to stop then he thinks. That is why Spacey's role as Mickey is so important, the mentor is both guiding them on the table, and off the table. He was more right about Vegas then anyone. Director Robert Luketic's trip from chick flicks like ""Legally Blonde"" and ""Monster-In-Law"" to this was quite a voyage, but there is a sub-text that remains true to his conception that 'the law is the law, and heck if were gonna break it...'. And the lead protagonist in this film really developed from the quiet, geeky kid to the partying and greedy monster that Vegas spawned was a very down-hill, bumpy trip that would land him right back to the drawing board, but the end is one that came to no surprise, but to my regret, I can't tell you just yet. See it yourself, it was a fun trip. Funny."

The car not being behind door 3 essentially said that the car had to be either behind door 1 or 2. (So it'd be a 50-50 shot @ either door). Can anyone explain why he'd choose to change & why his probability of car being behind door 2 was 66.7%? <br/><br/>OK - Never mind - I think I understand that by switching, his probability for winning goes up to 66.7% on avg...<br/><br/>That was my main question but I also have to mention that Jim Sturgess is just adorable - I didn't know he was British.

","21 (2008, Dir. Robert Luketic)<br/><br/>In order to be accepted into Harvard School of Medicine, Ben Campbell (Sturgess) will have to save $300,000 for the course. Only problem about this is the Ben can't get this amount of money. After being impressed by his skills in his Math's lesson, Prof. Micky Rosa (Spacey) invites Ben to become a member of a small group; a group who are planning to walk out of Vegas with millions, thanks to Ben's card counting. <br/><br/>There are certain things about '21' which would attract audiences towards it, as well as certain things which would put others off. '21' is not an action film, nor is it a horror; it is in fact a drama. Some audiences would consider a drama boring, but is this drama boring? Not at all! Firstly, '21', does contain a small, yet great ensemble cast. Relatively unknown British actor Jim Sturgess heads the pack, which includes a small number of known stars. Kate Bosworth, who is much better in this than her recent performance in Superman Returns, provides the romance of the story. Whilst not a household name, Aaron Yoo is starting to build up a steady fan base, since starring in Disturbia, and clearly has fun playing Choi in this. The problem with any scene involving Yoo, is that you will always need to be watching him. Whether it's slipping a bottle into a bag or making a quick quip, Yoo is someone you need to be watching. Rounding off the group are Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts and the always awesome Kevin Spacey. Like every other role he has, Spacey is a joy to watch and makes the film even more enjoyable. Another high profile name featured in 21, yet not with the ""heroes"", is Laurence Fishburne, who like Spacey, is always wonderful to watch. <br/><br/>The majority of the film is based mostly on the actual game playing, but it is filmed in a way which prevents it from being boring. Watching the techniques and interaction between characters make an interesting watch, as you wonder how far they will get before they are caught. 21 isn't completely perfect however. In particularly, remembering the rules to the actual game can be a struggle. As well as remembering the rules, you also have to remember the signals that characters have to give. Picking up the signals can be fairly easy, but if you have no interest in blackjack and similar casino games, then there's a possible struggle to keep hold of the rules. Best thing to do is sit and enjoy the characters in their environments.<br/><br/>I think he's gonna be ready for our little trial run tomorrow.  Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey)"

"rzajac","Null","2","3","12 July 2008"," Interesting story; a little shallow emotionally
","Nice try--and I always want to cut no less stellar a personage as Spacey some slack--but in the end it didn't quite resonate.<br/><br/>I think I have a bone to pick with movies that resort to plot devices like 1) the sting 2) guy-gets-girl (absent a genuinely warm human interest), 3) a litany of reversals, and 5) a ""rising from the ashes"" wrap-it-up-put-a-bow-on-it feelgood ending, without a proper denouement.<br/><br/>Reflecting on this gives me new respect for the core narrative power of opera. Opera is, come to think of it, irrational, in that typically no effort is made to vest one narrative element with special resonance by virtue of its contrast against other elements. The goal in Opera is to simply present a fairly unitary image, and tease the romantic power out of that image. The idea is that love, courage--even unmitigated malfeasance--properly presented, will deliver the goods, if all the buttons are pushed that properly present that image in a way that can't be made light of or otherwise ignored.<br/><br/>""21"" doesn't really have that unitary image; something truly heroic, notwithstanding that fairly artful final scene.<br/><br/>In the end, the film feels gimmicky. Too many moving parts, some of them just don't quite fit, and those weaknesses could have been avoided by stripping them out and having a core image that resonates; which, despite efforts to make the central theme do so, didn't.<br/><br/>Sorry! Can't recommend this one....<br/><br/>I do want to add one thing: I feel that Spacey is a kind of Mingus of American movies; he has this abiding desire to assemble a crop of young talent and make then deliver. That's respectable. But sometimes the actual effect is like that when Mingus was working with a passel of raw talent: A lot of rawness. And, of course, the preceding observations re weakness in conception/design apply."

I would also have liked to know why everyone in the team is in this business venture, but the film only explains why Ben is in. This would give the other members of the team more development and depth. In the film, Kianna and Choi are nothing more than mannequins that give signals one in a while.

","21 is a film by Robert Luketic starring Jim Sturgess, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, and Lawrence Fishburne. It is inspired by the true story of the MIT Blackjack Team, and is based on Ben Mezrich's bestselling book, Bringing Down the House. The film revolves around Ben Campbell, a Harvard Medical School hopeful studying at MIT. His dreams of going to HMS are put on hold because he does not have the necessary amount of money required to enroll. He is pulled into a group of 'geniuses' who, under the supervision of Mickey Rosa, their mathematics professor, learn the art of counting cards in order to outplay the casinos in Vegas.<br/><br/>All of the above added with some flashy Las Vegas images, heartfelt (not really!) best friends, a cheesy sequence near the end, and a non-existent romantic chemistry between Sturgess and Bosworth, makes 21. It's not as bad as I make it sound. The introduction is nice, so is the technique in which they show how one learns card counting. I had no difficulty in understanding it at all. The film is fairly gripping with some nice background music, and the Vegas shots are kind of okay. I've seen much better though. Jim Sturgess and Kevin Spacey are the only ones who actually act. Kate Bosworth is flat. I loved her in Superman Returns. Here, she hardly makes an effort to act. Plus, she looks highly weird (with her whole doll-hair). And lets not even talk about Lawrence Fishburne. The film is verging on two hours. It might have been a better movie if they did away with about 15 minutes (read: the whole best friend thing!). It got a little boring near the middle.<br/><br/>I liked Jim Sturgess in Across the Universe. He was quite good here too. He's building a nice career for himself. Getting to the main point.. If you've got nothing better to do, you can watch 21. You surely wont be missing anything if you don't.<br/><br/>5/10."

","21; a movie about an exceptionally talented young mathematician, Ben, who reluctantly joins 4 other students in an attempt to count cards in Vegas and raise $300,000 in order to attend Harvard School of Medicine, but Ben soon finds the wealth he gains more alluring than he imagined.<br/><br/>21's main strength is also its biggest weakness on many occasions, it tries very hard to span several different genres; smart thriller, Apatow style geek comedy, teen coming of age drama, sweet romance and profound morality tale. 21 dubiously juggles these balls, for the most part, successfully. The plot is, more often than not, engrossing, Ben's close friends provide an effective comedic counterbalance to the moralising of the main Vegas storyline, Kevin spacey and the other students manage to prop up an often two-dimensional performance from Jim Sturgess (for example: whenever something happens to Ben that is new or outside of his comfort zone, Sturgess does the same breathy sigh and looks at the floor) while the tale's concluding moral, one that rewards friendship, loyalty, reminds you not to forget who you are once you achieve success, and values hard work over corruption, may seem like a tale that's been told before, but remains a worthwhile message nonetheless.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, 21 drops a juggling ball or two along the way. An insistence to portray Ben as some sort of nerdy hero causes the film to indulge in trite clichés, most annoyingly, Ben's initial encounter with the card counting students, a shameful example of the 'outsider that's learnt to be accepted by the cooler kids' storyline. The romantic subplot appears underdeveloped and rather impromptu. Excursionary story lines that, while enjoyable, don't often add much to the overall plot bring about an excessive use of montage to hurry the story along, which can become tiresome and result in a loss of tension in the casino scenes (as opposed to the tense and gripping games in Casino Royale). The final twists are possibly the biggest let down though, predictable and too sugary , they may be impressive to the pre and early teen audience, but anyone older should really be left wanting something more substantial.<br/><br/>21 is a film that lets itself down by trying to be too many things to too many people, (ambition is good, but you can't please everyone) which is a shame, because it could have been a really great escapist fantasy and despite its many flaws this was an enjoyable Vegas caper."

","A fairly good watch if you've got nothing better to do on a rainy day.<br/><br/>Bad things first, I felt that the first half hour/45 minutes of this film was painfully slow and I couldn't help but chuckle at the slightly cheesy and cliché card counting montage. Although this was based on a true story, I thought the ending was also horribly predictable as I could see the ""twist"" coming a mile off which sullied it slightly, and despite its obvious merits I didn't feel the film sucked me in at all.<br/><br/>On the plus sides Kevin Spacey really stood out for me, as he usually does I suppose, but his performance was probably one of the highlights of the film. Once the film entered full flow when the counting started, as a bit of cards fan, I found the system and gambling scenes quite intriguing, and surprisingly 21 also provided quite a few good laughs.<br/><br/>Overall by no means one of the best films of the year, but well worth seeing."

The reason the above scenario has become such a cliché is because it is used quite a lot, and the reason it is used quite a lot is because can be a really popular and entertaining cliché in the right hands. This brings us to ""21"".<br/><br/>I thought ""21"" was just a fabulous, unpretentious, piece of entertainment. Nothing more and nothing less. It has a young, attractive cast (Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth are, frankly, too beautiful to live), the gravity of experienced hands (devious Kevin Spacey and granite-like Laurence Fishburne), a cracking soundtrack (horrible remix of the Stones' ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" aside) and, lest I forget to mention it, the backdrop of Las Vegas looks amazing.<br/><br/>So, clichés aside, I really enjoyed ""21""."

Kevin Spacey steals the show as the mastermind behind the MIT card-counting team (who are all remarkably glamorous - wonder if they were in real life?) The cinematography captured the bright lights of Vegas particularly well and the sheer fun and excitement of what they were doing was well communicated to the audience. It plays the twists and turns in a similar way to the Ocean's series and there was a flavour of those here.

","The movie was good but awfully familiar....In fact, living in Canada, there was a film called ""The Last Casino"" starting Charles Martin Smith as a University Professor who assembled a team of his brighter students and taught them how to count cards playing Black Jack. While certainly there were differences between the two films, I couldn't help but get the feeling I'd seen it all before. I did enjoy the acting of Jim Sturgess as the main character, and Kevin Spacey was chillingly evil. Kate Bosworth was good, but mostly eye candy. Laurence Fishburne had a good role as a Security consultant at the casino. I have to admit, the scenes where Jim Sturgess was showing his mind worked while counting the cards was ingenious. It gave the feeling that everything was slowed down and he could interpret the cards in a leisurely fashion, while in fact it was probably happening at break neck speed. The ending was satisfying."

Upon seeing this film you will discover the game of Black Jack as never seen before via the mystery of card counting. The aching to learn the skill of counting cards is equivalent to yearning how to play the guitar upon hearing your first Zeplin track. 21 brings to light the thrills and spills of learning to take chances, and explore your true potential even if it is illegal. It will inspire you to search for that Real Life changing experience that is missing in all our lives. The present day version of a 90's thrill is spot on with the guidance of an absolute natural in Kevin Spacey. The idea of experiencing the unknown and the amazing reality that comes with it convinces be to believe that this movie will be one of those Classics that is aired on Cable TV for years to come, just like a Rounders or the Color of Money.

","Winner winner chicken dinner. An enjoyable tale even though it may have delivered too much set up and exposition. It also shifted gears way too abruptly, taxing believability. Long yet focused set upshift gears in to something uglyshift gears in to something clever. This felt like the director's version of the film with every nuance of establishing characterization left in the final cut but the reason for mood changes and compromise hammered in to fit a running time. Did anything hit the cutting room floor from the first half of the script? Since the characters were believable and likable as well as perfectly portrayed, that is not a bad thing in this case but it could have been pieced together in a crisper fashion.

I love the characters, and im sorry the Asian kid.. haha all I could think of was disturbia ringtone.. HAHA!<br/><br/>I loved the way Kevin Spacey played the whole good guy, bad guy role.. It was nice seeing him in a role like this, simply because I relate him back to Pay it Forward, and I believe that this is a great role for his personality. The main character does a great job really showing the struggles that college students do face everyday. Though most of us cannot say that we have a 4.0 at MIT and are awaiting money to attend Harvard, I can personally relate to the financial struggle college does bring to myself personally. Maybe I should go card count!??<br/><br/>Once you started to pay attention I really began figuring out the true meaning behind card counting and it really is very simple, with the word connection to the card value. As for the gestures, they were a big out there, and I really think that Vegas PD would catch on to the whole arm behind the back thing 10 times quicker, simply because it is such a drastic move. <br/><br/>The movie is great, and I personally loved it because it played out the roles of each of the characters and came to a conclusion with all of them.

","""21"" follows the rise (and ultimate fall, and what happens afterward) of a college math wiz recruited by his professor to outwit the blackjack tables at Las Vegas and make a ton of money. It's a well made movie with lots of class and style, and if you aren't turned off by the notion of filthy lucre, then you are bound to enjoy this.<br/><br/>The movie works well because of its cast. Jim Sturgess, the young male lead, is outstanding. He does a great job of transitioning from initial uncertainty to eventual acceptance and ultimately relishing his new ""career."" He's eminently likable and you can't help pulling for him all the way.<br/><br/>Kate Bosworth is lovely as his love interest, always impeccably polished. She looks a bit old for the part of a college student, and especially her style of clothing in the casinos (while ravishing) is not quite right for a 21-year old. I wish more buildup had been devoted to her relationship with Sturgess, but the movie is all told from his angle. Best of all, Kevin Spacey is dead-on as the ringleader. He is cool, efficient, very sharp with every line. As always, he always manages to steal every scene he is in.<br/><br/>There is also a nice subplot about these aging casino security agents, who are being phased out in favor of software recognition systems. It gives the movie more depth and interest, and ultimately you can't help realizing that these guys, while ""villains"" in one sense, are also ""heroes"" in another.<br/><br/>The look of the film is fabulous, well worth consideration for art direction. It's all about Vegas, but not over the top, somehow. You never blame the character for falling into the trap, because it is all so addictive: the cash, the clothes, the fabulous rooms (it's almost worth seeing the movie just to see those penthouse suites!). The editing and camera work are awesome. They did an especially good job zooming way in on the cards, to where they almost become characters in the story. But it never gets technical, it never dwells on splitting 8's or hitting a soft 17 or anything like that. Even if you know nothing about the game (and I know very little), it won't impair your enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>It's not a very deep movie, but it does have insight into human character and motivation. It's mainly just a lot of fun to watch. I give it a solid 8 (maybe shading towards 8-1/2)."

Everything else about this movie was played safe and done the easiest and most simply way. Camera work was just normal no cool shots or movements by the camera. Acting was pretty flat and even though I know Spacey can play a villain, he didn't intimidate me at all in this film. Music wasn't that great and sometimes felt out of place. Even Fishburne didn't seem that scary to me and he was suppose to be very scary.<br/><br/>Every time I felt excitement start to creep into me, it was gone and I was back to being bored.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a 5 for being a so so movie with a cool story that could've done so much more."
"Chris Knipp","6","2","3","2 April 2008"," Dross into dross, for fun and thrills
","Luketic ('Legally Blonde,' 'Monster-in-Law') provides a few thrills and some pretty mindless fun in this more or less reality-based story about a half-dozen college students involved in a risky but successful get-rich-quick gambling scheme supervised by their MIT math professor. Interest is provided by the contrast between the dour snow-covered Boston area setting of the Ivy League school and the glitter of Vegas. Kevin Spacey plays the manipulative, larcenous prof who masterminds the scheme and Lawrence Fisbourne is his old hood nemesis, protecting casino interests. It's slumming for such good actors to indulge in this sort of shallow diversion, but they add tone to the proceedings. A movie like this that skips over details like fine-tuned dialog, character development, or intelligent exposition cuts little ice with critics but is catnip at the box office in this winter-release dead time. Younger viewers can if they choose enjoy the images of honor roll kids grabbing quick money at the Blackjack tables in a world of danger and romance; gambling freaks may fantasize on sequences wherein players beat the tables for hundreds of thousands. The risk factor is real: ""counting cards"" may not be illegal in playing ""21,"" as Spacey's character says, but a team working the tables in a coordinated operation using secret signals is the best possible way to get casino goons on your tail.<br/><br/>The weaknesses of 21 are many; nothing works too well unless you watch with your brain on hold. The young characters have no depth. Spacey and Fishbourne are on hold too. Spacey, whose classroom talk predictably has precious little to do with MIT-level mathematics, is never anything but a bossy and threatening smart aleck. Fishbourne is a tough and relentless meanie, about whom we know only that he's soon to retire without benefits and that he once knew Spacey as a Blackjack ace long ago. The details of the game and the counting are mushed up. The pleasant enough, mildly cute young English actor Jim Sturgess as Ben, the brilliant new recruit of Prof. Micky who becomes the team's big player, is about as lackluster and generic as a young lead could be. As his sidekick on the team and erstwhile girlfriend Jill, the (also) cute, stylish-looking Kate Bosworth is another actor whose talents are debatable and whose character is so underwritten as to be nonexistent. For ""color"" we get one Asian guy, Choi (Aaron Yoo), who adds a few lines and a head of wacky, Basquiat-like hair. The real-life Asian identity of most of the MIT team has been dropped. <br/><br/>An excellent online discussion by Ian Kaplan (bearcave.com) gives evidence that the fictionalized true story '21's' based on, 'Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions' by novelist Ben Mezrich, is a page-turner, but itself shallow and poorly written--and possibly exaggerated as to the amounts of cash involved. A weakness in execution in the movie version is that the team members don't use disguises until after they think they've been spotted. They don't ever change their signals, and the key one is ridiculously obvious. It's doubtful that Ben could come in as a high roller, win big, and then just move to another nearby table; the real life team had to win often but small--and in many other places besides Vegas. Ben also violates the rules of winning by counting by being flashy and getting on a first name basis with doormen as well as staying at deluxe comp suites with Jill, another gauche attention-getter. He would have been spotted and barred. The team's partying a lot and going on shopping sprees when they win big are two other obvious no-no's. Are they trying to get caught? And the depiction of the tables action is simple, one scene hard to distinguish from another. Director Luketic and his writers Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb don't know how to make card play compelling and specific. The prof, Micky Rosa (funny name for somebody teaching non-linear algebra at MIT, but real name of an actual Blackjack ace) is accompanying the kids to Vegas and getting half their take, but what follow-up supervision is he providing? No wonder that when Ben succumbs to hubris and messes up big time and Micky dumps him they decide to proceed on their own. The movie provides a level of violence the real life account lacks. Counters are usually barred, not beaten. The movie nemesis Cole Williams represents a whole team in real life, shown here as giving way to computerized devices; in reality both high tech and human elements are used to protect casinos from being wiped out. But in general the movie has, by the evidence, dumbed down and simplified an already low-IQ book.<br/><br/>The movie's narrative framework is as mildly clever but shallow as the whole. Ben is being interviewed for a full scholarship at Harvard Medical School where he's been accepted and the interviewer tells him to get this special prestigious all-expenses ""Nelson"" award he needs to exhibit ""startling"" attributes and tell a story that ""leaps off the page."" This is that story. Only trouble is, he's trying to raise the $300,00 he needs for Harvard throughout the narrative. ""Did that leap off the page?"" Ben asks the interviewer at the end, who responds with a dumb look. We're supposed to respond to all this with dumb looks too. Ben is provided with a naive mom who offers her limited life savings to put him through Harvard Med. He also has two nerdy MIT best buddies working on a science robotics contest whom he drops when the excitement starts and then touchingly reunites with thereafter. Neat, and dumb. Movies have been known to spin weak books into gold; not this time though. Luketic & Co. have spun a book with an interesting story to tell into a down-time diversion that rated only a 48 on Metacritic. But in spite of all this, it still has some entertainment value."

The only thing I could critique on this film is how some of the open endedness of particular parts in the film like: what happened to the Professor?, did he get killed?, did Ben get the scholarship at the end of the movie?, and how can the professor give Ben his credits back when he is currently getting the life beating out of him by the casino owner?<br/><br/>One thing that I took away from the movie is that what comes around goes around. This can relate back to how the professor took everything away from Ben and left him not even being able to graduate and with no money, which led to Ben fakingly asking for forgiveness to get revenge and set up his professor with the casino owner. This movie has lots of good life lessons that the audience could take away. One major takeaway is how you can't take life for granted because it can get taken away in a second."

","As a fan of movies based off of high stakes gambling and the manipulative way of how Hollywood has glamourized Vegas to death, I do come to the realization that Sin City id not as glittery as they make you all believe. Sure it may be biased in my point of view because I'm not a gambler but I was never turned-on by the seductive nature this city unapologetic exposes to us making it feel as if it's a giant amusement park for adults. No matter how much profit you make the results are always the same, the house emerges victorious. Aside from the casinos many hotels surround them and guess where they get their revenue from? Need I say more?<br/><br/>Inspired by real events based off of a novel by Ben Mezrich, ""21"" centres around six MIT students who esoterically use their cunning wit that no textbook was offered to them to come up with their own codes and rhythms to win it big on the Vegas strip. As usual, Hollywood successfully sexes up the scenery combined with Kevin Spacey taking charge as Prof. Mickey Rosa and the students are donned in their trendy night outfits. Although they are super smart, the students are persuaded by Mickey that they deny they are cheating, but rather outsmarting the system by way of card counting. Sure there's a hint of complex mathematics and some methodology to avoid being caught even by means of going incognito, fake names and different gestures, words and body language.<br/><br/>What gets me annoyed here is that the filmmakers try to dumb us down by providing us every detail stating the obvious that through every casino codes change, and that no trick is ever repeated twice. It makes it that way so that the subplot featured here leaves a bad impression that their manipulative influences are out-shined and downplayed by technology the threat of head security officials like Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) in an unimportant job.<br/><br/>After the success of the 2006 film ""Across the Universe"", Jim Sturgess seems to be increasing his credentials to his resume as desperate for money MIT student Ben Campbell who like every academic is trying to enroll at Harvard Medical School is willing to rake in the dough with the limit of $300,000 which is how much it is to get that prized scholarship. So then we have this formulaic theme as Ben becomes so good at the game that all his earning get taken away from him and the lesson that greed will get you nowhere.<br/><br/>The other students under Mickey's guidance include Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth who co-starred with Spacey in ""Superman Returns"" and ""Beyond the Sea"") Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts) their mathematical methods are honed by a systematical montage. They go through the tests and regiments and the strategy in how they're going to pull themselves through the tables. While this is proceeding, they have room for some romance, and their obsession for quick cash, intensity is in high gear and the not so glorious lifestyle of being wealthy. As sad as it seems, the supporting cast add very little significance to the story. Bosworth is just on for the cliche love interest and while the two token Asian performers are just stereotypical caricatures like a kleptomaniac.<br/><br/>Though Spacey is convincing in another chilling performance and Sturgess handled the naive pretty boy role fittingly, however '21"" just has to spoon-feed us putting every piece of development right in front of us and all the essential plot twists are just a motion away and how the mathematical rouse is fully explained. If you think this will be an educational trick to learn from, don't be fooled. There's a myriad of mathematical know-it-all and the methodical practices are more complex than what is given to you. Maybe you'll be luckier on the slot machines.<br/><br/>What was great about ""21"" was that it demonstrated just how crooked the Vegas tables really operate and how getting good grades are not the only requirements in getting a good education and that money and finance are the keys to your goals. And yes tuition is expensive and salaries increase every year, it's believable that students who aren't privileged will go through great lengths just to reach their goals educationally and financially.<br/><br/>In the end, ""21"" succeeds in being an entertaining heist film and keeps itself as serious as it can be. And sure it's colourful like the average Hollywood film normally is, the cheaters never prosper moral message is pasted on the while time through. And that only the smart survive once the dust clears and that earning money is better than winning money."

Recruited to join a team of extremely gifted students who have used their mastery of numbers to beat the odds at blackjack, Ben procures a fake identity in order to join the casino scammers and their brilliant leader who is an eccentric math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa in some highly profitable weekend excursions to Las Vegas. Counting cards isn't illegal, and by using a complex series of signals, this team has cracked the code. Of course, it doesn't take long for Ben to become seduced by the glamorous Las Vegas lifestyle, and the attention afforded to him by his sexy teammate Jill Taylor finds him pushing his luck to the absolute limits.<br/><br/>The film is definitely a fictionalization of a true story.The viewer get the essence of this insanely crazy double life that these kids led as they were breaking the bank in Vegas.This makes it for glossy and lightweight fun.Spacey makes a nicely chilly villain and Bosworth a warm and glamorous leading lady, if an implausible maths genius."

In this movie, everything is business, everyone is a player, and everyone is playing everyone (in one way or another, i.e. not only for money). A good set up for intrigues, and there are a enough of them, not too many though, to make this a good thriller.<br/><br/>However, it lacks a little to make it a great one. For one thing there is really never any doubt how it will end, because of the way the movie is set up. It just a question of how to get there, and as the movie progresses fewer and fewer options remain. Fortunately it doesn't become totally crystal clear, and it does some twists at the end to throw you off. It is partially successful but not wholly. It manages to become suspenseful enough to be entertaining but not surprising.<br/><br/>There are some good actors, most notably Spacey and Fishburne, but this won't be the height of their respective careers.

OK, some of the situations were, as previously mentioned, a little set-up, but on the whole the inconsistencies didn't spoil my enjoyment.<br/><br/>Spacey is, in my book, one of the best and most natural actors working at present. He, and Fishburne, give excellent performances here. Spacey's handling of a controlling and mendacious lecturer is one of his best efforts.<br/><br/>It was a little disappointing that the old chase-through-the-kitchens scenario was hauled out yet again, but the way the finale came round again to the Harvard Med school interview to round the movie off was, I thought, a nice touch.

"Dr_Coulardeau","8","1","1","5 October 2010"," Kind of funny, even if perverted
","Be it true or not, the story is funny. A rather impoverished student at MIT decides to accept a proposal to make some easy money, since he is good at numbers, by playing Black Jack in Las Vegas. That student will get the scholarship he needs to go to Harvard medical school that costs 300,000 US dollars. He is dragged into the black jack business by some math teacher who is using a group of students to make easy money (he gets 50% of the winnings) without being seen because he is persona non grata at all and forever in Las Vegas, though they do not know his face. That professor is of course a crook and when one night, unsettled by some riff raff with his best friends, our student, Ben, loses a lot, the professor destroys everything: he blocks him at MIT, he visits his room and steals his money that was hidden in the false ceiling, ruining at the same time his dream of Harvard, he even tells the security people that the student is back at the black jack table. But the student gets his revenge on the professor, the hard way, but he had to deal with the security boss in the casino who cheats him in his turn and he is still without any money left. But that really dazzles the Dean of Harvard Medical School who interviews him a second time: he went to Las Vegas 17 times, won the 300,000 dollars twice and they were stolen from him twice too. Apparently that is a dazzling life experience that deserves a scholarship. That film is immoral, wicked, perverted, and that student is going to be a doctor. I just hope he does not gamble with the life of his patients the same way. And yet it is fascinating because it demonstrates some people are ready to do absolutely anything to satisfy their desires, to reach their goals, to succeed, no matter what it may be. At the same time some are ready to betray anyone to get even or get revenge or just to get a profit out of these others. But are you sure you would not do that too? You can't imagine what some very decent people were able and ready to do in Nazi concentration camps just to be a Kapo, which meant they had a chance to survive longer. In some situation you cannot know what you would do. Anyway, to defeat casinos on their own ground is absolutely funny for us the spectators and must be absolutely funny for the ""gambler"" even if he has to be good with figures, which means slightly autistic, which means slightly retarded. But a rich retarded person has a lot of fun in life, provided he has a real good brother and he is ""an excellent driver"".<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID"

It tells the story of Jeffrey Ma, renamed Ben Campbell in the movie and possibly the book on which it is based on. It focuses on a system of counting cards and the basics and complexities to getting there. Certain characters did not exist actually. It moved the story along in both the book and for the writer who says he did exaggerate and switch facts around. The real Blackjack team was mainly comprised of Asians or Asian- Americans. The most important imprint it left on me was not the urge to count cards and win big. In fact, many people who try and duplicate lose which is why casinos allowed this movie at all. No, the biggest imprint it left was the story of the ""ultimate"" cheating method and what it can do to you if you let it. Cheating may not always be bad, but it is dangerous. The movie was produced for big business. The actors act well mainly for big business, but the movie itself is fantastic. I suggest seeing it despite the controversies and scandals. If the movie affects you the way it affects me then it has done the job it should do. Read the book afterwards if you enjoy reading. That should leave even a bigger imprint.

","If you didn't know that ""21"" was based on the true story of a handful of MIT students taking Vegas for millions by counting cards in blackjack, you'd have no idea. Not that it's not plausible, but the movie plays out so melodramatically, so predictably Hollywood, that it strips the story told in Ben Mezrich's book ""Bringin' Down the House"" of its uniqueness, its potential to show what happens when young aspiring college students get caught up in the other-worldly glitz and glamor of Las Vegas. ""21"" chooses to go for style points, moving quickly through a basic plot line simply to deliver what it thinks is slick entertainment. It keeps your attention, but it's amateur-ish in its delivery.<br/><br/>""21"" focuses on the specific story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess of ""Across the Universe""), a genius MIT student whose one dream is to attend Harvard Medical School and his only obstacle is money. When his professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) discovers his mathematical genius, he enlists his help as a ""business partner"" training him to join his team of blackjack card-counting students who take weekend trips to Vegas to make bank.<br/><br/>Ben is initially very resistant to the idea, saying a definitive no to a very tempting Kate Bosworth. Naturally, he has a change of heart, but the film lets out that it doesn't really care about its characters when we see no motivation for the change. We could assume the money is too hard to pass up, but we really don't know. The characters merely go through all the motions, same with the relationship that eventually buds between Bosworth's character Jill and Ben.<br/><br/>The movie follows this basic nobody prodigy discovers a hidden talent and rides the waves of fortune until he becomes cocky and thickheaded and trouble starts. Not that you expect anything different, but that's really all it is. Pepper that with flashy gambling shots and montages of living it up in Las Vegas and that's your movie. There are several scenes that seem so forced or dialog that seems unnecessary that you have to laugh at it. It's just not something you can take too seriously. All this just detracts from the interesting storytelling possibilities that the concept offers.<br/><br/>All the same, you root for Ben anyway, you want to know what happens and you feel reasonably entertained. Despite director Robert Luketic (""Legally Blonde"") choosing a lot of poor, overdone techniques, ""21"" is paced well and keeps your attention. The only difference is that you don't care what happens, you just want to know.<br/><br/>There's nothing clever, smooth or edgy about ""21"" though it just seems to come off that way. You're usually a step ahead of what's going on, so there's no way you can be dazzled by the story. It's the thrill of Vegas and winning big that keeps us tagging along with the story."
"DonFishies","4","1","1","12 August 2008"," A shoddy script and terrible characterization make 21 barely watchable
","Ben (Jim Sturgess) is a math whiz-kid at MIT. He dreams of going to Harvard Med School, has the grades and the acceptance, but has nowhere near enough money to put himself through it. Enter Professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey), who takes a shining to the kid after a rather brilliant mathematics discussion during a class. As it turns out, Rosa is running a blackjack counting group who goes to Vegas on weekends and make tons of money.<br/><br/>Obviously, we know as an audience that this can lead to no good, but are taken along for the adventure anyway. Unfortunately, the ride does not last very long.<br/><br/>What plagues 21 incessantly is its wanton desire to be a more complicated and intricate movie than it is. Yes, it does deal with a lot of intense mathematical equations, but it never tries asking the audience to answer them. It does give us a rather lengthy montage as to how this team works (using hand gestures and certain words in phrases), and then tells us again when anyone mentions one of these words. It almost gets to the point where the filmmakers begin beating the audience over the head with these simple words (such as ""eggs"" and ""sweet"") that we wonder if they had any subtle notions over their subject matter. We see the varying hand gestures multiple times too, but at least they blend in a lot better than a blatant cut to that specific scene in the original montage.<br/><br/>The story itself is a bit of a mess in that it plays out almost frame for frame like any other film with a young person looking to make money the quickest way they can (with an interesting, little-seen twist nevertheless), right down to the supportive mother and neglected friends. And after seeing movies like Martin Scorsese's lengthy epic Casino and the small Canadian film The Last Casino (based off the same material as 21, but somehow ended up being a smoother and more interesting film), you can tell exactly where this film is going to end up by its last frame. Hell, Lawrence Fishburne shows up for less than thirty minutes of screen time, and right after he starts talking, predictability more than just sets in. It gets comfy and makes you feel stupid for even attempting to give this movie a shot.<br/><br/>And because it is so predictable, the movie becomes boring quickly. Seeing the same montages over and over again becomes tedious, and watching these characters move to their eventual ending is almost painful. But the film drags its heels for every minute of its just over two hour run time, and rather than try and attempt to make the film interesting, everything thrown in just makes it more dull and repetitive.<br/><br/>The characters are not much of a help here either. The main character has his motivations for joining the club, but we are never given any sort of indication why any of the other group members are there. Jill (Kate Bosworth) is the supposed sexpot goddess of Ben's dreams, Fisher (Jacob Pitts) is the has been of the group who has a grudge against Ben, and Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Choi (Aaron Yoo) are there simply as glorified seat fillers. Those two do the majority of the hand signaling, and just about nothing else (Choi has a bizarre, albeit useless, subplot where he steals bottles of booze and cheap hotel room pens). Jill and Fisher serve their purposes, and then spend the rest of the movie in a daze, basically going through the motions right up to their character's final moment on screen. I realize this story was based off a book, which in turn was based off a true story, but there has got to have been more to these characters than these simplistic cut outs.<br/><br/>Sturgess, in his first truly lead role (Across the Universe was an ensemble to its very core), is weak as Ben. We can see him struggling to hold the picture together from the start, and he does not get much better as the film goes on. I think it could have been significantly stronger without his continuous narration, but even without it, Sturgess just looks uncomfortable with what he is doing, and almost looks out of place. I can understand that Julie Taymor's uniquely flawed musical opened a lot of doors for him, but this is one he should have either missed entirely, or trained up for a little bit better.<br/><br/>Out of the supporting cast of young people, Bosworth is the only one who really gets a chance to shine, and she does a fairly lousy job of it. As said previously, she plays the supposed sexpot goddess, and she does that. But only, that. She never makes any attempts at giving the character something interesting to do besides watch Ben, and gives even less of a reason for Ben to be so infatuated with her.<br/><br/>Spacey and Fishburne on the other hand, appear to be enjoying themselves as they chew scenery literally limb from limb. This is clearly not their best work, but their roles allow them the space to give their characters a certain finesse and originality that this script clearly made no mention of having. If only they could have rubbed some of their talent off on these young actors, we could have truly had a watchable movie on our hands.<br/><br/>Even with an interesting concept, 21 managed to entertain very little, and frustrate even more. Even with great performances from two seasoned character actors, there is no saving this film from its shoddy acting, and even worse storyline. A solid polish, and less feeling like those that have come before it, could have only made this film worthwhile.<br/><br/>4/10."
"mike-925","Null","1","1","6 August 2008"," 21 A Bad Shuffle of a Superb Nonfiction Classic
","21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.<br/><br/>The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movie seems bent on helping casino security Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.<br/><br/>In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.<br/><br/>Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.<br/><br/>In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.<br/><br/>In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is an MIT prof and a professional gambler too.<br/><br/>The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another. And that is what they did.<br/><br/>In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.<br/><br/>The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. <br/><br/>Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma is not a WASP like the one Campbell portrayed, but an oriental. The four fellow Oriental MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them ever graduated from MIT. Ma didn't.<br/><br/>Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was market designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.<br/><br/>The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity."

","MIT professor Micky Rosa (Spacey) recruits some of the brightest minds there to help him take Las Vegas down by having these students count cards at the Blackjack tables. Counting cards is not illegal, but if caught there are consequences. <br/><br/>This movie is based loosely on events that happened in the 1990s when MIT students took Las Vegas for millions by counting cards. The story here is fiction and goes to show how things might have been done.<br/><br/>We knew what they were trying to do without understanding the mechanics of counting cards. And, we are left with Ben (Sturgess) getting greedy by gambling and not counting as per the system. So it turns into a story about some MIT students, greed, betrayal, and retaliation. There's a twist in here. Was there that twist back in the day when this all happened.? Probably not. Actually, the twist helps save the movie. How about that deal?<br/><br/>The acting was fine by all, but I do not know why they bothered to have a love interest story too as there was no chemistry between Ben and Jill (Bosworth). Oh, it wasn't much but it was there. Wait a minutegood looking guy, good looking girlOh, I get it..Got to have it now.<br/><br/>How, in real life, in the 1990s, were these students caught? Casino people kept seeing the same faces at the same Casinos over a period of time and put 2+2 together. No, this movie did not ""catch"" them that way. <br/><br/>Usually, when a story is true we learn what happened to the participants at the end of the movie before the credits are run. There was nothing shown here along those lines. But then again, in real life, the students were rotated over the years so I guess that would be hard to do. In real life, there may not have been an MIT professor who managed and supervised the operation so it may have just been the students themselves. The students were told never to come back to Vegas or they would be prosecuted for trespassing. Did someone say ""DEAL?""<br/><br/>If you take out the DVD, there is a Special Features section on it where the cast will explain Card-Counting. Good luck with that. <br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

Furthermore, the professor (who has everything to lose in this scenario) recruits his super-smart students in some kind of organized crime syndicate that flies to Vegas on the weekends.<br/><br/>Oh, and the super-smart geek changes his mind about joining the blackjack group for absolutely no discernible reason. He turns down the brilliant professor. Then he turns down the beautiful temptress. Then, suddenly, for seemingly no reason whatsoever, he shows up to the card-counting class.<br/><br/>Oh, and instead of flying to Vegas and withdrawing the money there, these supposedly super-smart geeks stuff the money into their pants to get it through airport security.<br/><br/>Oh, and the card counters, who are not supposed to know each other, walk into every single casino in a dramatic slow-motion Delta formation -- and gather in the same suite to plan their strategy, as if there are no cameras in the hotel portion.<br/><br/>Oh, and 10,000 security cameras on the floor are not supposed to notice the tall, lanky HOT women obviously and conspicuously CROSSING THEIR ARMS BEHIND THEM to signal the super-smart geeks at the high-roller tables.<br/><br/>Oh, and the super-smart professor who manufactured this brilliant scheme does not suspect a thing when his ostracized prodigy comes back to the fold to help him win more money without the professor lifting a finger.<br/><br/>Get my drift?

"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","1","24 June 2008"," Could bring down to less than 100 minutes
","The length of a movie doesn't matter if it's a good one like the 6-hour ""La meglio gioventu"" (""The best of youth"" 2003). But when it's a borderline case, having its length trimmed down to the double-digit range helps to earn viewers' goodwill.<br/><br/>Based on the true story of a group of MIT students taking the Vegas casinos to the cleaner with their sure-win system in black jack, this movie starts almost like a documentary, but soon wanders into the realm of melodrama and even near-fairy-tale. The fictionizing is not a problem as this is after all just a movie. The problem is the fundamental premise of using mathematical principals to devise a system for the black jack table. I don't know how many in the audience are math majors but that isn't even relevant. With just a layman's appreciation of the beauty of math, I was intrigued when I watched movies like ""A beautiful mind"", ""Goodwill Hunting"" and ""Proof"", not because I understand the math but because of the skillful presentation by the scriptwriter and director. Whatever they do with math and black jack in this movie simply doesn't work for me, perhaps because the math is too complicated and the game is too simple.<br/><br/>Nor is the ""adventure"" in Vegas terribly exciting. Through the middle section of the movie, scenes keep cutting back and forth between Boston and Vegas, when we see the students alternate between bicycle-and-hamburger and a high-roller existence. It was fun for a little while but soon starts to drag. The repetition soon makes the game table routine and hand signals somewhat tedious. The story itself, as mentioned, is melodramatic, and also predictable - ""twists"" you have seen so often that they cease being twists.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be fair if I fail to balance the negative with things positive. This movie can almost be seen an a biopic of the lead student Ben Campbell, and I like Jim Sturgess's (""Across the Universe"", ""The other Boleyn girl"") performance. I consider him the best of the three fast-rising young actors, although I also like the other two  James McAvoy (""The last king of Scotland"", ""Becoming Jane"", ""Atonement"" and now ""Wanted"") and Shia LaBeouf (""Bobby"", ""Transformers"", ""Indiana Jones 4"").<br/><br/>In ""Penelope"", Reese Witherspoon, one of the producers, takes a supporting acting role. Kevin Spacey, a producer of this movie, does something similar, but it's a more important role, as the professor who trains the team. Spacey is always good to watch but in this movie, his role is not well written, as it degenerates from an all-business mastermind into a regular villain. Acting opposite Spacey's Bobby Darin in ""Beyond the sea"" was Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee, but she is probably better remembered as Lois Lane in the more recent ""Superman returns"". Her role in this movie as the member of the group who entices Ben to join (and later becoming his girlfriend) is somewhat bland but she discharge admirably her responsibility in the movie of looking pretty.<br/><br/>There are quite a few other supporting roles: Lawrence Fishburne (a bit wasted) as the casino goon and a number of MIT students (other members of the team as well as Ben's buddies who get neglected). Josh Gad as Ben's neglected best friend is good; so are the two Asian actors playing members of the heist team  Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira."
"jaredmobarak","6","1","1","8 June 2008"," Did that dazzle you?21
","I wasn't averse to checking out this new film. That is until I started hearing all the bad press going around the circuit. So, with low expectations I finally took the opportunity to try it out and while there are definite problems, 21 is not too bad. Obvious and generic as far as story structure goes with a concept well known in America about beating the game of Blackjack, my main gripes were with the small stuff. What I found really working was the fun/entertainment factor. Even though I could guess how it would all turn out, the ride was a joy to partake in.<br/><br/>We have our genius student who did everything right throughout his school career to get into Harvard Medical. What does this kid have to complain about, besides maybe the lack of a stimulating social life? Well how about the $300,000 tuition necessary to actually attend the school itself. Thankfully for Ben, an opportunity presents itself very early on in the application process, for a full scholarship, that could solve all his troubles. A whiz at numbers and pretty much everything to do with analytical thinking, Professor Rosa sees a younger version of himself in Ben, the perfect choice to lead his team of card counters in wiping Vegas clean. Not only does this proposition play on Ben's need for money, but it also gives him an excuse to get away from the dweeby friends and drab school life. Las Vegas was calling and he was ready to live for the first time in his life. I mean, without any consequencescounting cards is not illegalwhat did he have to lose? It turns out everything. I'm sure if you've seen the trailers at all you understand the magnitude of what happens in the ""backrooms"" of casinos, the place where those on the payroll inflict their own sort of justice. The thing about this film is that the moment when they experience what truly happens isn't until pretty much the end. We are allowed a nice exposition of how the team nurtures their new point-guard and gets him game ready. The relationships formed become stronger, the takes become bigger, and the theatrics more brazen. There is some nice movement in the shooting style, low angles, extreme close-ups of the signals, and nicely choreographed sequences with the cards flipping, giving a cursory introduction to the system being utilized. I really liked this aspect because it allowed me as the viewer to get a handle on what was going on. At first I was bored, hoping movie magic would gloss over the lesson, but in the end I am thankful for having watched it. All the process jargon is tempered with more humanistic moments to keep us grounded in the story too. Ben and Jill's friendship evolves; Ben begins to distance himself from the only two friends he had before his recruitment; Ben and ex-top dog on the team Fisher butt heads; and ""eye-in-the-sky"" Cole Williams watches everything from behind the scenes, looking for a huge bust in order to save his job from being replaced by computer facial recognition software.<br/><br/>It's all by the books, our hero faces the challenge of stepping out of the villain's shadow and then giving a little pain back himself. We watch to see how it all turns out, no matter how obvious it will be. The scholarship meeting bookmarks help frame the story nicely, showing what it was all for$300,000 and he was out; sometimes it's not that easy. And because of that fact, the cast needed to be a good mix of personalities, all who could pass for geniuses and miscreants. Jim Sturgess has the exact unassuming charm needed to pull off the transformation from bookworm 4.0 student to the high-rolling playboy Ben becomes. He has an everyman quality about him perfect for us to put ourselves in his shoes and think whether we would have been able to resist temptation. The rest of the team is great as well with Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapira adding some humor, Jacob Pitts showing what fame and jealousy can do to your soul if not held in check, Kate Bosworth is solid as the love interest, and Josh Gad exudes soon to be millionaire dork with grace. The real surprise had to be Kevin Spacey though. I would have thought he'd chew as much scenery as possible and while he does overpower at times, the humor he portrays as a quick-witted professor and the glee when he gets to Vegas in the middle of the action really rings true for Rosa, as well as the serious times when his darkside comes out.<br/><br/>Besides the generic Hollywood quality on display, the small things are what bugged me. Should they have as much as they did? Probably not, but nonetheless they nagged at me the entire time. One is Sturgess' bad American accent. It is weird because when he plays the role, it's hardly noticeable; however, during every instance of voice-over narration, it was as if he was reciting dictation in a class where he was learning to hide the British. Another example is in the casting of Ben's friends. These guys are the epitome of geek and yet they are with Sturgess, a guy that can pass for geek if necessary, sure, but do they have to stick him with these two guys? The juxtaposition is so broad that it just stuck out like a sore thumb. Sometimes bashing the audience over the head isn't the best way to go about your business. Otherwise, a good effort for a brainless popcorn flick. One could do a lot worse."
"angelsfang","Null","1","1","28 May 2008"," Good in certain parts, awful towards the end.
","Good god, this is a movie of two halves. The first half is fantastic, I'll be frank here I pretty much loved it. I hadn't read the book, and I might if i ever get the chance, but i REFUSE to acknowledge that i HAVE to read the book to be entertained by a movie. I'm just a regular movie-goer, I knew about ""21"" from checking out Now Playing, strolled into a theatre and went for a ride. The first half was amazing, the concept was very interesting and keeps you engrossed in. Everyone loves Vegas/gambling movies... the exciting, high-rolling lifestyle, the glamor, the fun. Unfortunately it kind of dropped off near the middle, and completely sank in the end with the textbook Hollywood ending where the hero ""learns a life experience"" after screwing up. I heard that the script was altered from the book, and judging from the popularity I can only assume the book was really good (and very real), so the screenwriters should really hang.<br/><br/>Seriously, they killed the movie. After the so-called ""twists"", it just isn't enjoyable anymore because it becomes predictable and there are plot holes that keep popping up and leaving you in a state of What-The-Eff! I can never understand why the hero (I didn't even bother to remember his name) keeps his money stashed in the ceiling of his room. I'm just surprised his cash wasn't bitten to pieces by mice. There were parts so cringeworthy, that I just couldn't give this movie anything higher than a 5 despite some decent entertainment in the beginning. It gets another point deducted because of the AWFUL acting. The hero's so called ""acting"" is completely wooden, I didn't know there could be someone more wooden than Paul Walker out there. His concept of being ticked off or disgruntled, is pulling a smirk and then turning his head away. What is he, some 13 year old teenage girl who's just been denied by her parents to go to the party? Even poor Kevin Spacey got dragged through the mud, his character acting completely OTT when his favorite student (the hero) messes up once, losing I think most or all of his money that he brought along, but he goes NUTS. Since all the MIT students acted like high school freshmen (immature babies), I'm surprised he wasn't more tolerant. The only characters to get any credit were the two Asian kids, the girl played a steady consistent role, and Aaron Yoo, although not an Oscar worthy performance, he always has his own unique style and he again plays it successfully here, playing the easy going laid-back guy. Wait a minute, then again I can't remember his character doing anything significant during the gambling either. Strange... I thought the original MIT team consisted of mostly Asian-Americans. Hmm. And the jealous kid, I think his name was Fisher, was so bad that the movie didn't even give a shoot about him after he got kicked out. I thought he might come back for revenge or something but no, he's completely irrelevant. Wow. And what about their disguises in the final scene. The textbook Mr.Potatohead spectacles and moustache. Classy.<br/><br/>So all in all, if you don't mind B-grade acting, a cliché storyline and overlooking painfully obvious plot holes just to get a few cheap Vegas thrills, be my guest. I'm just disappointed because it could've been SO MUCH MORE. Using mathematics (card counting) to beat the system in Vegas, it could've been a classic."
"brendon-kenny","6","1","1","19 May 2008"," 21 - Any substance behind the bright lights, glitz and glamour?
","<ul><li>This review was originally written for South Yorkshire newspapers and featured on BBC Radio Sheffield, Leeds and York.</li></ul><br/><br/>In a bid to fund his Harvard education Ben (Jim Sturgess) is persuaded by his college Maths lecturer (Kevin Spacey) to join a team of top students and embark upon a card-counting hustle in Las Vegas. Ben soon casts aside his geek origins and friends when he finds that his maths genius brings him easy money and easier women at the casino Blackjack Tables. 21 is based on a true story, documenting the rise and fall of a handsome college nerd, as he deals with moral dilemmas, his sexual awakening and the lure of being a high roller.<br/><br/>It's great to see that director Robert Luketic has branched out beyond the lurid pink fluffiness of Legally Blonde and got his teeth into something a little more blokey  thankfully he proves himself competent at providing sprightly amusement for both sexes. This is just as much enjoyable schmaltz as anything else Luketic has made; only this time it's lit in neon - Vegas style. <br/><br/>The nerd who gets a taste of the cool life has served many a film maker well in the past so it comes as no surprise that Ben's first few Vegas visits provide the film's flightiest scenes. Following this initial buzz, the card playing feels like a missed opportunity. The sheer drama of Blackjack could have been used to great effect, but here screenwriters Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb have failed to capture any of the game's inherent excitement. As a result, 21's numerous casino scenes are all bright lights and no depth. It's what happens when six mathematical whizzes apply a formula to eliminate surprise and doubt.<br/><br/>Ben's fellow card counting con-artists are two-dimensional caricatures with simple personality traits that provide an immediate sense of character  a necessity given their limited screen time. At least their varied wardrobe and Beadle-esquire penchant for daft disguises at the tables ensure that they're fun to be around. Stick-on sideburns, cowboy hats and Hooker wigs are probably not the most proficient means of going unnoticed, even in Vegas, and contrary to the film's 'true story' mantle it does require that you suspend belief. It's not just the outlandish costumes and the contradictory role of Ben's hunky geek that pushes the boundaries of reality either; the film's love interest Jill (Kate Bosworth), happens to be an intellectual who would look more at home on the catwalk or the school's cheerleading squad than hitting the books. <br/><br/>It's testament to the quality of the two young leads that the more far-fetched elements of 21 don't become a grating distraction. Bosworth is sweet, sassy, cool and collected yet sufficiently feisty as the object of Ben's affections. But it's Sturgess who makes the movie. The young Brit, who recently starred in 'That Other Boleyn Girl' (reviewed on these very pages several weeks ago) is like a young John Cusack, having a charismatic, natural appeal that gives the movie a solid heart. Spacey is clearly enjoying himself immensely playing Professor Mickey Rosa, maintaining an undercurrent of menace throughout his role as the team's leader - a father figure that exploits his adopted 'children'. Unfortunately Laurence Fishburne is surprisingly limp as the villain of the piece, playing a security supervisor from the old school, on the brink of being usurped by new technology. He's more of a wet lettuce than a hardened pit boss employed to doll out punishment to cheats and hustlers. <br/><br/>The only truly bad hand that the film plays is during the finale; no amount of bluffing can disguise the obvious con and it plays out unconvincingly. This doesn't tarnish the film too much  it deals out plenty of fun for the most part, and it's all wrapped up quickly and with plenty of gusto. As shallow entertainment 21 is a safe bet, but like Vegas, you shouldn't expect to find much in the way of substance behind all the glitz and glamour."

","I read the book and appreciated it greatly, i did feel it was a little light (you get to seem some more reality in the actual gambler's short essay in the back) but it at least gave some of the real data behind the cards. the degree at which the game could be mathematically gamed, etc.. The movie doesn't even say what is a low card and a high card. (face cards -1, 2-6 +1) Trying to combine 'Oceans 11' and a lame ""perfect-kid getting into college"" film into one has produced a bland nothing, you can also see how they changed the main character from a Asian kid to try to make it more appealing, in fact they totally changed the main character in order to make it a a stock rise-and-fall movie. The real life man was actually one of the few who also had a great engineering job while others were relying fully on card counting for their sustenance. And then wrapping the whole thing in the context of a college interview---ewww thats exactally the same thing as that prissy movie Spanglish. They have tried to make it more modern with reference to a job at google and dot-com millionaire. I also hate the direction of incorporating lame corporate-sponsored ad-libs into movie scripts.

","The film 21 was built up in the media and only television to be a great, exciting piece of cinema and sadly it did not live up to that hype. I mean the cinematography of the film was good and so the way the storyline played itself out. Even the card playing scenes were not too bad but the worst thing by far was the two lead actors. Both Jim Sturgess and Kate Bosworth were awful. The accent of Sturgess was fake and contrived. It was obvious he wasn't an American actor and it ruined the illusion of the film for me. Also Bosworth was stiff, wooden and lacked any real emotion in her performance. She made the character seem hollow and uninvolved with the action. The only saving grace about this film is Kevin Spacey. As per usual he is very good in his role and really makes his character the star of the film. Only a shame he wasn't in it more. To conclude I would have to say that a well written and directed film was fundamentally flawed by 2 leads who just can't act."

","What a snooze.... the technical aspects were quite good but if one is were to be honest, this is nothing but another big Hollywood film geared up to polish a turd. As for plot, character, etc.: who cares? Spacey almost has enough gusto to distract us from the fact that his character is utterly improbable and ridiculous -- almost. ""Nice guy"" Ben is corrupted so fast and then uncorrupted just as fast that it's amazing we don't have whiplash. All the other ""characters"" are empty. The main girl was (sexy) and Boswroth did what she could -- but she was a plot element, not a character. The nerdy friends made no sense: did the filmmakers spend any time at M.I.T.? And the dialog! Except for the initial classroom exchange between the professor and the student (a game show analogy), which was somewhat credible banter, most everything else was ""dialog of the obvious: "" I did bad, I did the wrong thing, sorry...."" But the most offensive thing is that it all comes down to being an advertisement for the casinos ""You Can't Always Get What You Want"" may play on the soundtrack, but the message is that you ~can~ always get what you want: the girl, the scholarship...: just go to Vegas ; but if that's the case, why waste money on going to see the film: watch any free TV show about Vegas and/or playing poker, or wait for the DVD if nothing else is exciting for that week."

I rented it with a bunch of friends and most of us were groaning fifteen minutes into it. A couple of the guys wanted to give it a shot, so we toughed it out for another twenty minutes and by then we were ALL ready to give up on it. If it weren't for the hot girl from Blue Crush, we probably wouldn't have lasted that long. The preview and box make it look like an exciting, Vegas action film, but it plays like at best a drama, at worst, a boring documentary with some good camera work. All the actors were solid and seemed to fit the roles, but that just didn't cut it. I don't know how true they kept to the real story, but maybe that was their problem. They should have spiced things up to make it fun...the story itself just wasn't interesting enough for a full length movie. A very strong pass from me."

The MIT Blackjack team originated in the late 70's. This incident, with Ben Campbell, took place in '94. There was no Vitamin Water and there were definitely no PSP's.

","In ""21"" M.I.T. mathematics Professor Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) and boy genius Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) discuss an intriguing mathematical paradox surrounding the game show ""Let's Make A Deal"". In the ""Let's Make A Deal"" scenario, the contestant is offered one of three doors. Behind one of the three doors is a trip to Hawaii. Behind the other two doors are two goats. After making a door selection, one of the two unselected doors is open to reveal a goat. Now the contestant is offered a chance to change his original selection. Ben says that it is incumbent to now select the other door. The point being, that when he originally made the choice, the probability of picking correctly was one third. Given this new information, the probability changed from one third to now a half. Still not intuitive to me, this is amazingly intriguing. The rest of Director Robert Luketic's ""21"" is not entirely intriguing, although it is entertaining for what it is. Peter Steinfeld and Allan Loeb's screenplay based on the book by Ben Mezrich, is a kinetic and over-the-top rites of passage tale involving our hero Ben, well played by Jim Sturgess. The over the top elements are chewed on by the performances of Kevin Spacey as Micky and Laurence Fishburne as old school casino surveillance expert Cole Williams.<br/><br/>My bud John had read the book ""Bringing Down the House"", but told me that there was no Professor Ringleader character. So that is an interesting narrative choice by Steinfeld and Loeb. For the most part it works, as Spacey does his charismatic best, providing a visceral protagonist for Ben as he reclaims his soul. Ben (Sturgess) is a brilliant M.I.T. student, even for an M.I.T. student. Ben's future at Harvard Medical School relies upon him winning a prestigious scholarship of which he is one of 41 applicants. The dean challenges Ben, ""Dazzle me"" Micky (Spacey) acknowledging Ben's brilliance attempts to enroll Ben in his assembled team to win big at Blackjack in Las Vegas. Here Luketic bends over backwards to clarify that this innovative strategy is not ""card counting"". Oh, well. Circumstances mount, and Ben agrees to join the team which includes the beautiful and fetching Jill (smart and tough Kate Bosworth). Ben becomes a star, and predictably alienates his geek buddies Miles and Cam (believable Josh Gad and Sam Golzari), who were depending on his partnership for critical science competition. Ben is seduced by the dark side: money, sex, and power. He also falls for Jill. But the ride can't last foreverat least not in these kinds of stories. Betrayal and retribution eventually reign supreme. However, Jim Sturgess as Ben keeps ""21"" engaging. He's got a natural, smart, and edgy charisma which weathers most the narrative flat spots and formula.<br/><br/>""21"" also has sense of corny justice and karma. In the end, Ben in his low key and confident way gets to ask, ""Did I dazzle you?"" ""21"" is not great cinema. But for what it isit is a smart and entertaining time at the movies."

Here he plays scammer turned Math Professor who grooms a team of MIT students to rip off the Vegas casinos by legitimately mastering the art of 'counting' the cards. The inescapable fact that this is perfectly legal cuts no ice with the casinos who naturally prefer to retain the advantage so Lawrence Fishburne is apt to show up and 'discourage' gifted amateurs - who have, after all, spent hours honing the art of memorising discards - from darkening their doors in future.

","Being a blackjack player myself, I was looking forward to this movie and seeing the system they used to beat Vegas, though I know I'm not smart or patient enough to employ the tactics used by the card counters. I though Jim Sturgess did a good job in this role and didn't have a hint of a British accent, and Kevin Spacey was good as usual. There were of course many hokey Hollywood moments like the romance between Ben and Jill, the eventual downfall of the operation, and the transformation of Ben from bookworm to Vegas high roller practically overnight, but the movie was well made and the actors were convincing enough. One other thing that bothered me is the fact they often played at the same casino and were recognized by the dealers and casino staff, which would seem to me would make it easier for them to get caught. There are tons of casinos in Vegas, wouldn't you try and hit up every one of them so you're not recognized by the security people. Still, I enjoyed the picture, you could certainly do worse..

","""For the first time in my life, the world made itself easy."" <br/><br/>The second Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) says yes to joining a small group of MIT students on their ""weekends, and Christian holidays"" trips to Vegas, you pretty much know where 21 is going. Ben is accepted into Harvard Medical School, only doesn't have the cash to pay for school. Why a bank loan is never mentioned is never explained, but anyway. He's warned to count cards, not gamble. Think Ben won't succumb to the glitz and glamour, get a big head, only to hit an eventual downward spiral and need redemption? Presenting your first movie.<br/><br/>21 is good-looking pulp who's main drawback is it's no better than it absolutely has to be. Entertaining though it may be, we're familiar with the rise and fall of a kid given the opportunity of a lifetime and squandering it. Quite. Another stumbling block, for me, would be Jim Sturgess. The muddled accent doesn't help, but I got used to it. He does a couple of things right, namely a scene where Jill (Kate Bosworth) comes into the store where he works, and Ben gets kind of breathless and stammery. Who wouldn't? But, I never once bought his evolution into arrogant prick  especially considering how short-lived it is. Nor was it very believable what happens to make Ben angry enough to go and get rebellious and continue playing at a cold table. Come to think, his reluctance to get on board with the MIT guys in the first place isn't clear, either, since Ben obviously has the math skills, could use the money and wants life experience. We never get a sense that Ben wouldn't entertain the idea of breaking the law (even though the whole card counting business isn't technically illegal), through his actions. Maybe these are more script issues, but Sturgess never fully sells it. He stays kind of bland and just... there.<br/><br/>Better is Kevin Spacey, as the professor jockeying for Ben's participation. His opening classroom scene is fabulous. Mickey Rosa is a former blackjack player, now with a roving eye for students disciplined enough to steal ""under the radar"". If Spacey's given an off performance recently, could someone remind me? Other highlights: Josh Gad, as Ben's best friend. He's obviously channeling Jonah Hill, something awful, but it works (""Does the way I use it.""). Liza Lapira has perfect timing with her ""now, I need a drink"" line. And, Kate Bosworth standing against the window in one of Sturgess' hotel rooms, curtains drawn, is surely the reason man created cinema.<br/><br/>I enjoyed 21 while it played. Is what it is. Won't be revisiting, any time soon."

","Blackjack might look like a formidable card game, especially when witnessing the blood, sweat and tears at tables in the lavish casinos of Las Vegas. But actually, if you strip the rules back, it's fairly simple. 21 presents its simplicity to extreme levels, to the point that even children could start playing and believe in the old ""counting cards"" technique (please don't...). Despite the basic approach, it's an enjoyable crime drama. A ridiculously smart student lacks the funds to attend Harvard medical school, and is coincidentally recruited by a professor to participate in the ""business"" of blackjack.<br/><br/>Utilising his intuition and inhuman mathematic ability to ""count cards"" and rake in large amount of chips from casinos. Essentially resembling a human calculator, succumbing to peer pressure for nefarious reasons. It all seems too good to be true. Alas, a few predictable twists and turns sends our protagonist down a journey of reflection, however the pace and frantic energy within the narrative consistently makes this flick enjoyable. The first half constantly threw enough mathematical equations, logical scenarios and variables to complete a degree in advanced statistical analysis. The second half then tossed in some unwanted melodrama, romance and plot conveniences. But hey, it's fine.<br/><br/>The fun light tone throughout was never diminished, and the bright illuminations of Las Vegas enhanced the enjoyment even more. Spacey (excuse my language...) was excellent. Slimy, sarcastic and sophisticated as all businessmen/professors should be. Sturgess overplayed the awkward nerd slightly too much, but by the end I was invested in his performance. The soundtrack of trashy pop songs detracted from the flamboyant environment that the characters spent many nights in. Not enough for me to not recommend this film however. A light-hearted crime caper that could've been a ""winner winner, chicken dinner"" but settled for a ""I'm going to call it a night"" instead (no idea where I'm going with this...)."

"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","19 March 2018"," Mediocre.
","This is a movie that tries to act smarter than it is. It exists in a world that is inherently intelligent, since counting cards clearly takes skill and innate talent. The card counting is shown in a way that makes it so that the audience understands what is going on, but doesn't have to actually learn the skill of card-counting for themselves, which is definitely good. The characters also go to MIT, which is obviously a place that takes crazy intelligence to get into. So, basically this world should be intelligent. But at its core, it really isn't. There aren't plot holes per se, but the characters definitely miss things that they shouldn't miss. Given everything that is shown about Mickey before the climax indicates that he should really have been too smart to accept Ben's proposal. I really think he would have smelt a rat and not taken the bait. The minor team members, including Jill, didn't give the impression that they had an MIT level of intelligence. I can't think of a specific example, but just the way that they characters interacted with each other and particularly the content of their arguments was not as intelligent as it should have logically been. Yes, having a great mind for engineering does not necessarily mean that you can argue well with someone, but it does often come with a level of perceptiveness and logical acuity that is lacking in the characters here. Not every movie has to be that smart, some shouldn't be, but this was a movie that should have. The main issue was that it started off with things like the game show host scenario in Mickey's class, and then ended with a Guy Ritchie-style reveal that just felt cheap.<br/><br/>The plus side of the movie is that it's somewhat entertaining and has a good, cinematically appealing subject matter. I mean, when you're doing something as cool as cheating the casino system, there's only so bad your movie can be. There's also some standardly cool camera/editing techniques in the casino scenes that are cool. It's also decently paced and keeps you interested in what will happen next.<br/><br/>However, the protagonist, Ben, is pretty flat. He's kind of like an action hero in that the stuff he does is cool and he has mad skills, but as a character, there's not much there. Despite what he says in the ending monologue, there isn't really that big of a change that he goes through from the beginning to the end. Yes, he learns to have fun and gains confidence as he learns how skillful of a card shark he can be, but he really doesn't learn anything in the end. Jill is about as standard and flat of a female lead as there is. Mickey is really only a decent character because he's played by Kevin Spacey (yeah, I've heard what he did, but the guy's a heck of an actor). The other parts are similarly unremarkable, including Lawrence Fishburne. The only character that I actually liked was Miles, Josh Gad's comic relief character.<br/><br/>Overall, it isn't bad, but it's really nothing special despite what it may try to fool you into thinking. It will keep you entertained for two hours, but you'll probably forget it soon afterward. One final bone to pick, there really didn't have to be as many scenes in the strip club as there were, especially in a PG-13 movie. Basically, my main problem with the movie is that it could have been much better given the subject matter and the world that was created in it. So watch it if you want, but don't expect anything on an Ocean's Eleven level. Overall Rating: 6.9/10."

1. Going to the same casino on repeat. - As another user pointed out, Vegas IS casinos, so why consistently go to the same one, especially consider Spacey's character knows that the casino is scouted by the man who cause him in the past. 
2. Using the same signals.- Hand gestures are a dime a dozen, you're telling me they couldn't use a cycle formula to change them out from time to time, if they're spending so much time on disguises, then why not seconds on gestures?
3. Glorification of power and corruption as a shocker (it wasn't a shocker). 
4. Stashing over $300,000 grand in your dorm room ceiling? - Get a safe deposit box for goodness sake. 
5. Falling for the girl that of course gave you no mind before. - Tired story line that could have been completely left out all together. <br/><br/>It's just a sad thing because based off of the book and the cast it had true potential, but if you want to play 'look how smart this team is', then stick with the plot line and don't let their genius be valid or apparent only in Vegas."

The accusations of whitewashing are fair enough, and it's a shame the cast wasn't more reflective of the real life characters. <br/><br/>But hey, Hollywood is unfortunately replete with such whitewashing type examples. Valkyrie I don't think had any Germans in the cast. It was pretty much Americans and Brits playing Germans. The director wasn't German! Also in Schindler's List, same deal, no Germans in the lead roles. Similarly, Hogan's Heroes didn't have any Germans in the cast - in fact quite ironically some of the Nazis were played by Jewish actors. Also in in 'Allo 'Allo, no Germans were featured - all Brits played the Germans. Nary a German actor in Raiders of the Lost Ark. So unfortunately Germans are being whitewashed out of casting roles sadly."

","The story is based on a book so it does feel very much grandiose. The movie nicely introduces the basics of the subject of blackjack card counting and showing good depiction of first hand practice. Yet the movie wisely refrains from showing the details of the introduced basics so as not to encourage the practice even more. The added twists nicely start at the exact half time of the movie. Those twists and turns escalated on an accelerated rate well enough until the movie hits us with the double hidden story flow that's revealed as the surprise ending at the finale. The acting overall is decently good. Jim Sturgess portrayed the semi nerd college student with almost perfect expressions. Kevin Spacey lives up to his reputation as one of the ultimate antagonists. Kate Bosworth nicely provided the love interest angle. Aaron Yoo and Liza Lapra also adds well enough to the team setting."

The movie depends on Jim Sturgess and where the movie chose to concentrate on. I'm not thrill about the romance being glued on to this. It feels ill-fitting. If there is one compelling relationship, it should be Ben and the professor. This could have been a great dark character study. Instead it tries to be flashy and cool. The romance drains the edginess out of the movie. Also it would be more compelling to have Ben start off as a more introverted loner. It would allow more room for the character growth and some possible father issues."

","21. It is the fact-based story about six MIT students who were trained to become experts in card counting and subsequently took Vegas casinos for millions in winnings. First lack of money drives characters to do something insane and then abundance of money make them insane. Genius and selfish Professor Mickey played by master actor Kevin Spacey and simple sober smart student played by Jim Sturgess both are the strength of the movie. Supporting actors also do OK. Movie aimed at youthful emotions in an easy ride never getting dark or overly emotional. The big guy Laurence Fishburne playing the spoiler in the otherwise a foolproof plan makes his character quite enjoyable. I am going with strong 7 out of 10 for 21.

By the time we've reached the predictable twist at the end, a lot if the dramatic tension has been dissipated with each succeeding development as it affects Jim.<br/><br/>Of course it's tricky to make blackjack gripping on the big screen and despite some clever time-lapse photography, with the threat from the security team lacking menace and too many loose strands in Jim!'s. The acting is okay amongst the younger set, but Spacey isn't really stretched here, plus his character disappears for a significant period before making the unlikely decision to return with his acolytes to Vegas for one last hit.<br/><br/>Running about half an hour too long, considering the slightness of the story, even the sights of Vegas itself couldn't adequately fill the gap.

","I saw a short television trailer, and it was obvious it was about card playing and gambling, specifically the game Blackjack, or rather 21 like the title, from director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde, Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!, Monster-in-Law). Basically young student Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) has very high intelligent, and has ambitions to get a scholarship and transfer to Harvard School of Medicine so he can become a doctor, but for four or five years he needs $300,000, which he can't afford. One night he meets Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), an unorthodox math professor, and he joins the teacher's group of fellow students, Jill Taylor (Superman Returns' Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Fisher (Jacob Pitts). All are being taught by Micky in the skill of card counting in the game of blackjack, using a clever number of hand signals and key words to use during play, and if successful obviously they could make fortunes. Eventually, after some training, Ben and the others are ready to use the techniques they have gained in the real paying casinos of Las Vegas, and naturally the young man is only going to keep going until he has his tuition fee. Jill sees that he is being corrupted by greed and becoming arrogant in the process, and he is also caught out by casino security enforcer Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), this angers Micky, who Williams has a grudge against. There is the point when there may not be enough to money to go to Harvard for the young man, and no way to get any new blackjack games for high stakes and money, but eventually Ben is welcomed back for one last big con in Las Vegas, and this does go well. Also starring Jack McGee as Terry. Sturgess is okay in the lead role, but of course Spacey and Fishburne are the one you pay the most attention to as they are the big shots of the film, the story is reasonably interesting, the card games are certainly the scenes that grip you as you wonder if they will get away with it, a not bad drama based on a true story.

So he resorts to trying to get a scholarship to get into the school. However the dean would only give him the grant only if he could ""dazzle"" him. Then he meets a professor, Micky Rosa(Kevin Spacey) who sees a gift inside Ben and teaches him a get rich quick scheme. Card Counting. Since he has such a powerful memory he could easily make a quick buck in all the major casinos. But he will soon realize that gambling can quickly turn into an addiction.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie is what it is. Everyone plays their part well. The one that stands out in my opinion is definitely Lawrence Fishburne as the disgruntled head of security. The writing is good throughout. Although there are a little inconsistencies in the movie there is really nothing to really gripe.<br/><br/>And I do have to say that the movie also does in a way ask us to go and card count. That is the truth. Telling us that card counting in the casino is easy. Even though at the end of the movie there is a message not to be addicted to gambling. Its an oxymoron.

","21 is a movie for which your level of enjoyment will probably depend on how much you actually think about the plot. In this case the less thinking you do the better. Thinking will make you realize very quickly that the film's central characters, reputed geniuses all, do a lot of very stupid things. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the movie for what it is. It's not a particularly smart movie but it is entertaining and sometimes that's enough.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the true-life exploits of the MIT blackjack team. The movie veers quite a distance away from the actual true story but the basic premise remains the same. The two key characters here are Professor Micky Rosa, played by Kevin Spacey, who runs the team and new recruit Ben, played by Jim Sturgess, who joins the team to earn the money he needs for Harvard Med School. As soon as he has enough cash for his tuition Ben is out. At least that's the plan. But we know better than that. Once Ben gets sucked into the Vegas life he's not leaving. Unfortunately, and inevitably, things go awry. So then we get some twists and turns and drama as Ben tries to rescue the situation.<br/><br/>As the movie plays out our team of math geniuses are basically begging to get caught. But if they're not going to face any potential consequences there's really no conflict, no drama, and ultimately no movie. So there's quite a bit of stupidity from the blackjack team. And that stupidity is not limited to their time spent in Vegas. So Ben, when you return to MIT with hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash where are you going to keep all that money? Oh dear, this will end badly. OK, some of the plot contrivances are a little hard to accept. But accept them you must for the movie to move forward. There's enough good here to make you look past the movie's flaws. Sturgess does well with the key role of Ben, creating a compelling and sympathetic character. Spacey is reliably excellent as always. Unfortunately nobody else in the cast adds much. As the required eye candy a film of this type demands Kate Bosworth's character of Jill disappoints. There's no spark, no personality there. When we first see her the MIT geeks build her up to be some sort of goddess but when we actually get to know her it's a letdown. None of the other blackjack team members make much of an impression at all. And in playing an old-school casino enforcer type Laurence Fishburne is little more than a cliché. But despite all that's wrong with it the movie still somehow succeeds. It's well-paced enough to hold your attention throughout. At times, especially in the end, things get a little convoluted but the story works. More or less. As a whole the movie is not quite winner winner chicken dinner but good enough."

","In ""21"" Ben, a bright young student (Jim Sturgess) with an amazing memory for numbers is approached by his teacher (Kevin Spacey) on a big plan: go to Las Vegas to make money by counting cards on Blackjack. The teacher has a whole team of students along with him, and they will help Ben in the plan by making signs and codes. Why Ben joined the team? Because he wants to go to Harvard Medicine School and he doesn't have money, and even with an excellent background and many extracurricular activities the director is not impressed. So in order to get a scholarship he needs to convince the man that he has a impressive life experience to dazzle him. I'm sorry...did I just delivered the whole thing and ruined the experience for you? Sorry my bad!<br/><br/>I haven't read the book in which Robert Luketic's movie is based or even haven't heard about the real life story in which this was based but I can say that it's a very good film about how money and education always are walking on the same side. <br/><br/>For someone who lives in a third world country this movie doesn't make no sense for one can think: Or you born rich, pay for your studies until high school and then go to a public college, without paying but getting a good education, and then get rich otherwise you're gonna be locked in the lousy public school system during high school and then paying for a college degree and having a mediocre formation. That's how it sounds for those who live in countries like Brazil. And what's the connection between the movie? Everything! <br/><br/>Ben is only doing the counting thing in Vegas because he wants to go to a prestiged college, it's his dream, even that his already studying at MIT. He's smart, hard working, but he's attracted to other things while ""gambling"" such as women, money, fun, all things he didn't have with his nerd friends at MIT. He dreams big and knows exactly what he wants and that's great but here's a real tragedy bigger than to be beaten by the security staff of the casino: Ben is good with numbers so why he can't think about millions of people that won't have what he's get so far and be happy with it? It's not mentioned in the film why medicine is so important to him, if at least he said that in the future he would work for Doctor Wihout Borders and go to a foreign country where the health system is poor, okay I would get it and I would be more favorable to his character. That's not the case. <br/><br/>And even with all the ""Winner Winner Chicken Dinner"" cheered throughout the movie, and all that fun of playing like a hot shot in Vegas what was the lesson that the director in Harvard (played by Jack Gilpin) gave to Ben in the end? That if you participates of a little and innocent scheme to make money, deceiving his family and his true friends and even making a strange deal with his mentor (and deceiving him too in the end) you really can impress Harvard and be welcome to be a doctor! We're talking about medicine, folks, the most ethical of the professions and that's how Ben finally entered in by coming clean with a fraud? This took a lot of credibility of the pursuit for a good education theme.<br/><br/>Despite these criticism it's a quite enjoyable, thrilling and interesting movie. Well acted by the incredible cast (Sturgess is fascinating; Spacey efficient as usual), and directed with a fast good rhythm by Robert Luketic ""21"" is a must see film for those who enjoy stories with a difficult mission to achieve. It has a great soundtrack too. In the very last scene it starts to play Rolling Stones's ""You can't always get what you want"" which is ironic considering that Ben talks about several things he missed and gained, and it seems that he didn't lose anything. 9/10"

It's not as easy as it all sounds and they have a good system working together and they have casino guards constantly trying to catch them.<br/><br/>Not only is main character Ben realizing that life can be fun and that he might be letting his dreams slip, he is also finding he's losing his friends and changing from what he wants to be.<br/><br/>The real story is about some Asian kids at M.I.T. but here its mostly played by white kids. The actors were okay. Jim Sturgess was brought to my attention first in the wonderful Across The Universe movie and Jim did a wonderful job, it's one reason I picked 21 up to begin with. He is English and his voice coach did a wonderful job teaching him to speak more American. I am a huge fan of Kevin Spacey and usually think he chooses great roles. Laurence Fishburn is so so too, and I like seeing him as a bad guy in a co-staring role, never liked him in large doses so here he is fine. I do however want to point out I hate the Asian kid Aaron Yoo, he plays the same guy in every movie and is rather annoying. Josh Gad is another young actor I want to see less of, he's always playing the fat cliché geek friend in these movies and just does a horrible job.<br/><br/>This movie is okay, I wont lie and put it down, because I did enjoy it the first time, I will say all and all it's a nice little film...It's neither great or horrible..its average...worth a watch.. 4 out of 10 stars"

","I, like lots of others, am captivated by the idea of hitting Vegas and winning big at the tables. We would love to be able to beat the house but live with the knowledge that the decks are deeply stacked against us. Which is why I loved the premise of this film - a team of MIT students with the intelligence and guts to do so take on the casinos and win. Well, kind of.<br/><br/>The first point for anyone watching this who has any knowledge of the book/true story that the film is based on - creative licence has been used quite liberally. Not that this is a bad thing - without it we would have been denied Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburnes performances which are, as ever, very assured if not their best.<br/><br/>The story develops a little too quickly for my liking but I am aware of the time constraints a film like this suffers from. My main issue is that there just did not seem to be sufficient character depth, especially for the supporting cast. Kate Bosworths love interest almost gave us a back story but all we learnt was that her father played blackjack, lost a huge hand and is now ""gone"". The other team members are so transparent as to be see through. You don't care for them, shown when the other big money player (I don't recall his name!) is booted from the team. You have no empathy for him and the feelings of jealousy he is having. The story continues without a second thought.<br/><br/>With a little more effort from the writers I think an extra dimension could have been given to the film, particularly with Bens relationship with his teammates. Its a shame as the friendship he has with his ""geek"" friends seems genuine and you feel for them as he begins becoming distant from them.<br/><br/>I understand the reasons the film was written like this - the relationship between Ben and Kevin Spacey's character is the crux of the film and, more specifically, how easily and quickly Ben becomes corrupted. And it is this corruption that proves the second fault in the film - we go from seeing a well rounded, likable character fully focused on the job he is doing fall from grace in the space of a couple of scenes and find redemption in a few more. It all happens too quickly and without any real conviction that this is in his character to switch so violently against character in such a short space of time.<br/><br/>He gets everything he wants and does not seem to pay for his arrogance and mistakes much less learn from them. Indeed, he seemed proud of his story, (which includes dishonesty, double crossing, promiscuity and all the excesses of a life in Vegas as a high stakes gambler) I would question whether an establishment such as Harvard would really want to give such a prestigious scholarship to someone of such questionable character?! The other main problem I have with the film is that the ending is a little too Hollywood - he walks away unscathed and with the ""life experience"" he needs, the security guard gets his pension and Kevin Spacey is the only one who is punished. Lets remember that Ben was keeping the money in his roof and breaking the same tax laws as his mentor! But for these faults, however, there is a gripping thriller/drama that is well worth checking out. I always enjoy Kevin Spacey. His ability to control his menace throughout before unleashing his true, nasty personality in two or three quietly gripping scenes was a particular highlight. Here is a person who gains the full, unquestioned trust of his pupils, uses them and spits them out when they are no longer of use to him. He is manipulation personified.<br/><br/>Laurence Fishburne is also very believable as the old school Vegas security struggling to come to terms with the future and, indeed, his past. The scenes where he is ""interogating"" the card counters is reminiscent of Christopher Walken in True Romance - he exudes very confident malice, a softly spoken tough guy that you will not want to cross again.<br/><br/>The score of the film is perfect as well. It complements the story perfectly. The picture itself is shot very stylistically, which is something you expect from a film of this nature. I can recommend this film for someone with a spare couple of hours to fill - sit back, relax and enjoy the ride! 6.5/10"

","21 tells the story about young MIT student Ben Cambell who is trying to somehow finance Harvard medical school. He is admitted the school but does not have the funds to pay for it. He is a brilliant student in the areas of mathematics and logic and by chance is spotted by his teacher Michael Rosa, who welcomes him into his student group of competent card counters.<br/><br/>In my view the theme of the film is achievement. What does it mean to achieve something and are all the ways of achieving great things legitimate? This central theme is especially apparent when looking at Bens relationship with his old friends that cools way down when he starts spending all his weekends in Vegas, and suddenly does not have the time for his buddies anymore. It is precisely in Ben's treatment of his friends that we really begin to question the legitimacy of his new path to gaining funds for MED school. <br/><br/>The film does engage its audience but to my mind the characters surrounding Ben are way too weak. There are too many unanswered questions about the motivation of the other characters. For instance about the teacher Rosa. How is he using all the money he wins? What happened in the past? The love interest Jill Taylor seems more of an image than a real character - what is her motivation? The same goes for the other team members. The central characters are portrayed in a sketchy manner where we do not have any idea about their motivation. It is only Ben's story and Ben's motivation that is part of the film. <br/><br/>It would have been a much stronger film, if the theme of achievement would have been supported in the characterization of the other characters in the film."

","Yea, this movie was entertaining but NOT a blockbuster. With a very controlled and understated performance from the young lead, Jim Sturgess, which has been woefully overlooked, ably assisted by the master-class actor himself - Kevin Spacey - the movie does entertain even if he has ridden roughshod over the book. Spacey hams it up, slightly, but that's just a little bit of scene-stealing technique the old salt is prone to do when in danger of being upstaged by a younger acting talent. There were anomalies in the plot and sometimes it seemed a bit too Ocean's Eleven a la Blackjack as the actors were shoe-horned into a formulaic over-plot that threatens on occasions to blow the charm factor out of the water - or ocean!"

","""21"" is the story of the famous MIT Blackjack Team that plays fast and loose with the real story. Nevertheless, it's still a compelling and interesting movie. It's really a morality tale about a brilliant young man, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) is talked by a professor (Kevin Spacey) into joining a blackjack group that counts cards, uses hand signals, codes, and disguises, and goes to Vegas every weekend. Ben has been accepted into Harvard pre-med but has no way of getting the $300,000 tuition. In this story, there are no such things as financial packages and student loans. Ben reluctantly joins the group but only until he can make his Harvard money. Of course, that's not what happens. Once in and living the high life, he can't stop. He finally becomes so arrogant that he makes what turns out to be a very costly mistake.<br/><br/>The shots of Boston, where I went to school, and Vegas are great, and the acting is excellent. Sturgess is joined by the beautiful Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, and Jacob Pitts. Laurence Fishburne has a small role, but he's scary as all get-out as a security man. Two real-life members of the Blackjack Team played card dealers.<br/><br/>In the actual story, there were several of these groups out of MIT that played for years. In telescoping the story, there are a few holes. For instance, Campbell never wears a disguise until the end, which in real life, never happened. The only one who consistently wears a disguise is Bosworth; these teams were much more careful than that. Also, they seem to go to Vegas every week instead of switching off with Atlantic City, for instance, or laying low for a time.<br/><br/>There are a few interesting twists in ""21,"" and it moves quickly. Recommended - a very good movie."

Brit Jim Sturgess comes across much like Toby Maguire here, as Ben Campbell, serious student who is trying to get into MIT Medical school, but can't afford it unless he gets a grant. Ben also happens to be a natural math genius.<br/><br/>One of Ben's professors is Kevin Spacey as Prof. Micky Rosa.

Micky is a poor loser and steals the money Ben had stashed above his dorm bed in the ceiling. But Ben gets the last laugh, luring Mickey to Vegas one more time, where a trap had been set for Cole to capture him.

","I don't recall where or when I heard about some MIT students who'd managed to make a killing counting Blackjack tables throughout Vegas and(I think it was also)Atlatnic City. I'm not even sure it was the book ""Bringing Down the House"" that was being discussed,but the story that 21 is based off of seemed pretty familiar to begin with. Off the top,the thought of a film on this subject populated by Kevin Spacey,Laurence Fishburne and a promising newcomer named Jim Sturgess seemed to have a lot of promise going for it.<br/><br/>Alas,that was not the case.<br/><br/>One of the cadre of problems I had(And I'm not alone,judging by the many comments and posts along this site) is that this is most certainly and inescapably a morality tale,established practically from the fifteen second mark of the trailer. The seduction of one Ben Campbell(Sturgess,who hopefully will get stronger material in the future)is a fairly plain one: he is,besides being an already gifted student excelling at MIT(of all places),he is a numbers whiz,whose prowess is noticed by a sharp,charismatic professor(Spacey,who's as crisp and interesting in the first half of the film as he is dull and one-dimensional in the second half),who draws him into his team of fellow math whizzes/grifters who routinely go to Sin City and work the Blackjack tables.<br/><br/>The progression of events is pretty darned predictable,as young Ben is able to use his talents to become rich beyond his ambitions(he's of course,saving up for HArvard medical school),fall in love with a fellow student(Kate Bosworth,not very convincing here,but that might be how her part's written)and end up being the quarry of a wiry Casino security chief(LAurence Fishburne,one of the few things that didn't disappoint here)who's seen Ben and his gang there one too many times. <br/><br/>Somehow and for some reason,the makers of this film(including director Robert Luketic,co-writers Allen GArfield and Peter Loeb)decided that to make this film would require making this sexier,sleeker,less steeped in such trivial things as veracity,thoroughness or realism. The end result is something that truly deserved a mid-winter release: full of star power,youth,sound,image,sex(restrained as it is)and at least two chase scenes but a very pedestrian story and payoff underneath.

"Siamois","5","0","0","22 August 2008"," Decent drama neglects its core subject...
","First, lets get the obvious out of the way: several people have noticed they have ""seen this movie before"". Indeed, a small budget Canadian movie called ""The Last Casino"" was released a few years before this one, with much of the same plot. But 21 is not a ""ripoff"" of The Last Casino. As a matter of fact, both appear to be based on a book called ""Bringing Down the House"" although only 21 properly credits the book. It would thus appear that it's the Last Casino which is technically the ripoff. I have seen both movies but it's been a long time since I saw Last Casino and will not compare them here.<br/><br/>Now that this is cleared, it's time to look at 21 on its own merits, which are unfortunately few. The movie is competently directed, rather luscious and features a pretty impressive cast. The premise is rather interesting and Jim Sturgess, whom I had never noticed before, pulls an engrossing lead performance as Ben Campbell, a poor but extremely promising young man looking for a way ($$$) to get to Harvard. He gets the opportunity of a life time when a group of students led by a teacher offer him to be in on a counting card scheme to ""beat the system"" and get rich quick. Naturally, Ben is portrayed as a decent guy who becomes conflicted between following the straight path or becoming caught in the high life of Vegas and quick bucks, not to mention his feelings for one of his partners in crime. And the script flows smoothly and the frames are pretty and everything is hip... but there are problems with the movies nonetheless and they start with expectations one might have.<br/><br/>The movie is called 21 and the entire plot capsule revolves around Blackjack and casinos... yet you never get much of a feel for the game. It's brushed off by a script and direction which seem totally uninterested in that aspect. Instead, we seem content to follow young and ambitious Ben on his journey, where the director highlights how pretty and fast and tempting and easy everything gets in Vegas. Now, I do respect wanting to illustrate and emphasize that, but not at the expense of the actual game of cards and the science that goes around it. And that's where 21 fails most. Another rather important (and somewhat related) aspect is that of choices and decisions, or lack thereof. In 21, our protagonist almost never makes decisions. Be it at the game table or his personal life. The whole movie screams for decisions to be made, it revolves around the weight of choices. When to bet. When to stop. When to resist temptation. When to confide in close friends or family members. Yet these important elements are ignored, or handled off screen in the most bland way. As a result, the thrill we would (should) feel for Ben, the tension that should exist, is never there. We as an audience never feel any indecision, we never question what is going to happen as Ben goes from plot point A to B to C and so on... this ends up being a catastrophic failure.<br/><br/>I really feel director Robert Luketic's previous experiences (his resume is filled with bland, vanilla romantic comedies that require a railroading script) put him as a disadvantage because 21 falls flat on its face. Kevin Spacey, as a sort of flawed mentor is wasted as his character only seem to further the plot and equally, Laurence Fishburne as a main antagonist with shades of gray is a non-factor for the story. The movie (much like Kate Bosworth) is pretty enough that you won't skip parts but it all feels remote and lacking in realism or real sense of drama. It's a tremendous idea but left unfinished and sketchy. How can an action-thriller with a super-heroic icon and a busy plot like Casino Royale succeed in highlighting both the romance, the gambling aspect and a fulfilling story while the much more straightforward 21 fails at highlighting anything? Poor story and direction.<br/><br/>Watch The Cincinnati Kid or Rounders instead."

","A film on card counting might seem interesting but can it really hold viewers for about two hours? Well, it depends on how interesting, original and coherent the plot is if the viewers are to be placed at an utmost priority. In addition, cinematography and atmosphere is also an important consideration no matter what the demographic of the intended film. In the case of 21, the answer given to the question posed would be a resounding no.<br/><br/>The film follows Ben Campbell who is quite literally put, a genius. He is unable to go to Harvard because he does not have the $300000 for it. Luckily enough, one of his lecturers spotted him and took Ben under his wing to teach him to count cards. With his tutelage, Ben, with other card counters, is able to rake in the cash playing blackjack at casinos in Las Vegas. The question is, at what lengths does Ben have to go in order to keep the chick, friends and Harvard? The plot for 21 is a rather predictable one that might make viewers fall asleep if they have no control over their central nervous system. This film definitely needs more time in the editing room to make it more cohesive. Running at 123 minutes, probably about 80 minutes of this film is watchable while the rest of the time you will be cursing while fighting off drowsiness in hope that the film will end immediately. Some scenes are cringe inducing for seasoned film-goers where certain plot points used are walking clichés. An example of this is where Hollywood enforces the fact that any characters can throw away their own characterisation just to get the plot moving.<br/><br/>Loud blaring music and fast cuts are abundant in this film much like a music video found on MTV. This film might work for a young audience in this aspect and non-young people will feel alienated while watching this. In fact, the cinematography and overuse of loud music simply makes this film look like a cheap feature film version of Las Vegas except for the lack of women in skimpy clothing. The director shows no vision at all in this weak piece which easily passes off as a Las Vegas look-alike that it's no surprise he is an unknown and might continue to be an unknown if he does not buck up his work.<br/><br/>The casts are particularly lazy in this film as there is a lack of energy in their performance. This can be seen in Kevin Spacey who looks like he just wanted some money and thus decided to play the smart-ass character he has been doing yet again. Kate Bosworth's appearance is mostly eye candy to excite young men and as a result, an unmemorable love interest is presented to the main lead. On the less dull side, Laurence Fishburne and Jim Sturgess are probably the only ones who wanted to achieve something and they gave slightly more zest to their characters than the other casts. In the end, weak character development makes their characters only somewhat decent and not memorable.<br/><br/>All in all, the good points from this film are probably the reason one watches a TV show like Las Vegas and CSI. With that in mind, this film does not fail outright but becomes barely watchable. It is nothing great and not downright awful. If you are a teenager and is excited by loud music, this film should mildly entertain you. Other than that, it is a missable affair that nobody cares to dwell over."

It revolves around counting cards on a blackjack game and allocating points according to each of the cards that is dealt. Low cards are given -1, mid cards 0 and high cards are +1. Once the score rises to a certain figure the odds suddenly favour the player rather than the dealer.

With its protagonists and leading character being the brightest minds of the MIT, some of the conversations in the movie tend to make you look stupid.

It is about the life changing experience that Ben undergoes through the steps that he undertakes to collect money to fund his Harvard ambitions.

","If I was eleven years old, there's a good chance I would have loved Robert Luketic's 21. But, unfortunately for the last 123 minutes of my life, the eleven year old kid is all grown up. Watching this movie I got the feeling it was Australian director Luketic's first film, but after fact checking I was a little shocked to see it was his fourth. Based on 21's steady parade of ""seen it all before"" it's obvious he hasn't learned much in his four trips to the helm, unless of course his intent is to recycle every film-making cliché available. It's not that 21 was painful to watch, it actually is entertaining, but it begs one very real question: does Luketic have an original idea in his head?<br/><br/>Things start off with the introduction of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), whom everyone refers to as ""the smartest guy they know."" Ben, despite being the smartest guy everyone knows, is stumped at how to come up with the 300 grand he needs to attend Harvard med school. Ben's hail mary is the Robinson scholarship, although the one thing keeping him from qualifying is a lack of real life experience -- can you guess where Ben finds it? I'll give you a hint: there's about 110 minutes of movie left.<br/><br/>The problem with this setup is, while it does a great job providing us with a (requisite) dilemma, it spoils the (requisite) 3rd act twists. I guess the screenwriters felt sacrificing surprise was a small price to pay to establish Ben's motivation for getting involved with Prof. Micky Rosa's (Kevin Spacey) ragtag band of genius card counters. Either that, or they assumed the audience would completely and conveniently forget about the scholarship.<br/><br/>While most young filmmakers worth their salt reference Welles, Godard, Fuller, Scorsese and other screen giants in their films, Luketic establishes very early into 21 his major influences are the makers of cookie cutter 1980's teen dramas. Case in point: the entrance of Ben's love interest Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). As we cut to the POV of Ben and his friends, we cut to an over-cranked, slow-motion shot of Taylor striding across the gym floor. The shot wouldn't be complete without the hit-you-over-the-head musical cue, and Luketic does not disappoint. The only thing missing was a wind machine tussling her golden locks. <br/><br/>This shot is so cliché that even spoofs of it have become cliché. Perhaps Luketic missed the memo that this shot was officially retired after Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Remember the shot of Phoebe Cates, bikini clad and dripping wet, rising out of the swimming pool with nothing but the Cars ""Moving in Stereo"" blasting across the soundtrack? Even Phoebe was smart enough to know her career had plateaued, prompting her to disappear into retirement/motherhood not long after. On another tangent, let me ask you this: if not one hockey player in the NHL has the arrogance (or ignorance) to don the number 99, what possesses Luketic to think he has the right to regurgitate this tired cliché of a shot?<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, Luketic pulls out all the stops: voice over narration, flashbacks, montage sequences, time lapses, match dissolves, pop zooms, etc. His film-making is very democratic in the sense he refuses to leave anyone confused about what is going on. In other words, this is idiot proof film-making -- every idiot will be able to follow what's going on. The result: every nuance, every gesture, every raised eyebrow, every nod is shot in super slow motion and smash cut to an accompanying extreme close up. Luketic simply refuses to let subtlety get in the way of slapping the viewer across the face with what is going on. Even the product placement in 21 is shameless and overt, as evidenced in the bar scene when Ben orders ""two BUD LIGHTS"" and then nails his mark as he perfectly positions the bottle's labels within the camera's line of sight. I feel sorry for the actors in the film since every reaction demanded of them is telegraphed with utter disdain for realism. Watching 21 I could imagine Luketic redirecting his actors: ""can you do it again, but make it bigger this time."" I'm at a loss to explain why Spacey would even sign on to play a character that is practically a parody of his previous work. I found it really hard not to snicker as he dispensed rat-tat-tat, yoda-like pez of wisdom.<br/><br/>There's no question 21 is a paint by numbers affair, yet despite being formulaic and predictable, it somehow manages to be entertaining enough to not walk out of. The source material is definitely fascinating and the eye candy is worthy of most hip-hop music videos, but unless you are eleven years old, you can't excuse 21 for its bluntness. I mean really, are MIT geniuses really so stupid to think the same set of deliberate hand signals are never going to get detected? And if you do manage to stay through to the end, you will be witness to one of the most poorly directed chase scenes ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>21 ends with a very literal soundtrack cue that is as on-the-nose as the Rolling Stones' track is infamous for being overused: you can't always get what you want. No sir, you sure can't.<br/><br/>http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/"

","So this is a movie about blackjack, right....well, not really.

Then, of course, his turnaround when he realizes the error of his ways.<br/><br/>It was fairly well acted... not perfect, but not bad either. I was a little disappointed in Spacey's performance. He is usually very solid, but the problem may have been more with the lines he had to work with than anything else. Fishburn did very well with his part as well. All the other performances seemed a little uninspired. You can tell that there were parts forced into the movie that weren't in the true story it is based on. ... and it is pretty predictable It was a decent way to spend a couple of hours, but I probably would pass it up until DVD.<br/><br/>Overall the story was pretty good, probably because it was based on actual events.

","Java Man Reviews ""21"" (Rated PG-13). Directed by Robert Luketic. Written by Peter Steinfeld & Allan Loeb, based upon the book ""Bringing Down the House"" by Ben Mezrich. Starring Jim Sturgess, Kevin Spacey, Kate Bosworth, Laurence Fishburne, Aaron Yoo, Lisa Lapira, Jacob Pitts, Josh Gad & Sam Golzari. Running Time: 122 minutes. Originally appeared in LakewoodBuzz.com, May, 2008.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW: <br/><br/>Ben Campbell (Sturgess) is a shy but brilliant MIT student who wants to enroll at Harvard Medical School once he graduates, if only he can come up with the $300,000 for tuition. His math professor, Mickey Rosa (Spacey), recognizes his genius for numbers and invites him to join his special ""math club,"" a group of fellow students who make weekly trips to Las Vegas to beat the casinos by counting cards at blackjack. Why apply for a student loan when so much easy money is to be made? The Vegas lifestyle soon seduces Ben -- as does one of his sexy-smart teammates (Bosworth) -- and he begins to lose his way. Warily watching all of the goings on is Cole Williams (Fishburne) the casino's old-school security chief who is trying to figure out why the weekly airbus from Boston seems to coincide with big losses for his client's casino.<br/><br/>REVIEW: 3 out of 4 Java Mugs <br/><br/>Based on a real-life account of MIT students who won millions in Vegas casinos in the 1990s, the screenplay adds Hollywood melodramatics and romantic comedy tropes to an already remarkable story. In other words, its a lot of fun... and if you ever had a fantasy to beat the bank at your favorite gambling parlor, this is the movie to see.<br/><br/>Sturgess and Bosworth are fine as the white-bread romantic leads, but the supporting cast is far more fascinating, including Gad and Golzari as Ben's nerdy pals, Yoo and Lapira as two of his colorful teammates, and Fishburne as the menacing casino cop.<br/><br/>But the other actors might as well fold their cards when Kevin Spacey comes to the table. Feel free to hiss, because that is exactly the way he plays it; he chews up every scrap of scenery in a performance which alone is worth the price of admission.<br/><br/>Watching a group of people sitting around playing blackjack is not the most visually exciting experience you could imagine, which provides a challenge for the filmmakers. They meet it by employing extreme close-ups, imaginative special effects, flashy camera angles and dynamic editing. Authentic backgrounds and great-looking characters don't hurt either.<br/><br/>Pay attention to the card-counting lessons, and maybe you can make some money on your next casino trip. Just watch out for a mean-looking guy with spiky rings on every finger."

The movie also is unpretentious and tells a story without trying to moralize.

The disappointingly slow plot (even the Ocean's franchise is more interesting, and certainly more glamorous) plods rather than cracklesI found MIT's Will Hunting (Matt Damon) story more engaging, and he didn't even go to Vegas.<br/><br/>Undeniably watchable as always is Kevin Spacey's Mickey, with an icy confidence compromised only by a silly denouement finding this brilliant gamester reduced to clichés about a turn of fortune that comes too quickly to a stats guy, who in real life could have seen what was coming by just remembering not numbers but the eye in the sky at casinos. Cool Danny Ocean (cool George Clooney) he is not; Lex Luthor he should channel.<br/><br/>The glittering neon of Vegas is well represented, but the new day of computer facial profiling replacing house dicks is unfortunately underdeveloped, leaving some old-fashioned roughing rather than new-fangled software to carry the tension.

Much of the acting is satisfactory. Kevin Spacey is a good actor. It was filmed at ""Planet Hollywood"" in Las Vegas, which until recently was the ""Alladin"". The problem is that this movie has about as much resemblance to (Card Counting / Blackjack / Casinos) as Johnny Depp's portrayal of Captain Jack Sparrow's does to the real mouth- breathing knuckle-dragging seaborne psychopathic Neanderthals that we called pirates.

The actors did an exceptional job with their roles, including even the minor roles, portraying exactly what was necessary. Kevin Spacey, of course, stole the movie with his absolute command of every situation, both as the commanding character and the obviously experienced actor. Because of his amazing ability, other actors stepped up to the plate, taking risks that I believe would have otherwise not been taken. I would recommend this movie for about anyone.

"cwrumd","1","5","23","10 April 2008"," yes, this movie is racist
","Much of white America just does not understand the systemic racism that Hollywood has committed over the years. Let's get one thing straight. The way people of different races are portrayed on film/TV DOES make a difference. It does affect the way people think. For example, after Bruce Lee made all those movies, it was assumed that Asian people were all kung fu masters even though it's obviously not true. So this refrain from people that ""it's just a movie"" has got to stop. Movies/Film help CREATE REALITY.<br/><br/>So given that film creates reality, the systematic exclusion of Asian Americans from film does make a big difference. It means that Asian Americans continue to be made invisible and marginalized here in America. When people think of America, they don't think of Asians and a large part of that has to do with the fact that they aren't seen on film/TV. Asian Americans are 5% of the US population (over 10% in places like California and New York) and growing and somehow they are rarely shown on TV/film. And when they are, it's almost always in a secondary role or a role that emphasizes how ""odd"" or ""strange"" they are. Asian Americans are often shown as foreigners and this is insulting. Asian Americans are real Americans.<br/><br/>Hollywood has tried to justify their casting of white characters by saying that they are ""bankable"" and that they would like to cast more Asian Americans, but they cannot because they are not bankable. This is circular reasoning. Asian Americans cannot become ""bankable"" because Hollywood studios refuse to cast them! Lastly, let's take a scenario where there's a movie about George Washington. Let's say that he is played by an Asian American. There would be a firestorm of controversy and all of a sudden white people would be clamoring that only a white man could play the role convincingly. All of a sudden the racial integrity of the actor would be essential. So hypocritical."

While ""Tropic Thunder"" used the main premise of ""Soul Man"" as a comedic sidebar, this movie used its sidebar as the main premise. No one wants to feel sorry for someone who's admitted into Harvard but can't pay for it. If you got in there, odds are you'd be accepted into a state school which you can most likely afford. Once C. Thomas Howell accepted the scholarship in ""Soul Man"", his inability to pay was no longer an issue. He simply had to live his life undercover as a black student.

Fate lends a hand when Ben proves his ingenuity in an advanced maths class taught by charismatic lecturer Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey), during which he successfully solves a complex probability question. Later, Ben is invited to join Professor Rosa and five other students who are part of a well-organised gambling racket involving the card game blackjack. Using their mathematical know-how, the team have devised a system for winning tens of thousands of dollars at the blackjack table. They take it in turns as ""spotters"" (card-counters who place minimum bets and look out for tables where the game is about to yield big money), and ""big players"" (players who move in with the expensive bets once a promising table has been identified). Ben is suddenly caught up in a world of glitz and glamour as the team work the Las Vegas casinos. he's having a blast, winning a fortune, and falling for the girl of his dreams - team-member Jill (Kate Bosworth). But trouble brews on the horizon as old-school security expert Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gradually latches onto the team's scam..<br/><br/>Based on the Ben Mezrich book Bringing Down The House, the film is generally quite believably plotted. It only really slips into moments of unpersuasiveness when melodrama and clichés take over (e.g the somewhat fanciful love scene between Ben and Jill; the contrived ""sting"" planned by Cole Williams to nail his longtime nemesis Mickey Rosa; etc.) It's nice to see a clutch of personable new stars coming through in a film like this, even if the script doesn't place huge demands on their acting ability. Spacey and Fishburne are the older, more experienced hands on deck, and they do their thing with an air of confidence and professionalism. The book-ends of the films - during which Campbell tries to ""dazzle"" a Harvard interviewer with the story of his gambling adventures  are a bit forced and obvious and, if I'm honest, irritated me a little.

","Even though 21 constitutes of elements you can find in a lot of movies, I did not feel I was watching the thirty-fourth version of the poor, miserable kid getting rich and then losing it all again, so there can be a lesson learnt, that it is not money that makes our life but honest relationships and loyalty. All was there, in the script, for it to be a forgettable flick full of uninteresting characters, common places and shallow moralizing, but good pacing, nice photographing and a terrific Kevin Spacey made it a good past-time to sit it through. A heartfelt performance from Jim Sturgess was just another surprising add-on.<br/><br/>I am not a huge fan of cards, but this film has implanted an honest curiosity in me for blackjack. I know the system these kids follow is partly false - it has to be; I never endorsed a film teaching you to cheat, to build bombs out of household materials, to paralyze somebody by tapping on a hidden stress point -, still, it makes me wonder what stunts you can pull to enhance your chances of winning in card games.<br/><br/>The last action sequence, however, is too very reminiscent of the plots of cheap B movies and there also are some awkward moments - very unlikely situations - throughout the whole movie, nevertheless, I tend to like it. Regardless of how things conclude, it gives you back your childish hopes and dreams of once kicking it big time.<br/><br/>You too, like Ben Campbell, can get fooled by the fake facade of Vegas - the city that only comes to life when it is soaking in floodlight -, and the blinding contrast it shows with the grey, slushy winter streets of the traditional, WASP college cities of the Northeast."
"classicalsteve","9","1","2","23 August 2008"," MIT Student Genius Comes of Age in Vegas--Ocean's Eleven meets Rounders
","Life experience versus book knowledge is at the heart of ""21"", which is apparently based on a true story. This perfectly enjoyable but somewhat fantastical film centers on a mathematics genius who climbs out of the womb of academia and into the fast lane of Sin City, via everyone's favorite Vegas game, Black Jack. Ben at first seems an unlikely candidate. At MIT, he has an IQ measured in light years, but he has about as much street smarts as Mister Rogers. Seems the last time he was outside of Boston was during a previous life. He hangs out with two similar like-geniuses who get A's in chemistry and physics and F's in sociability and charisma. They giggle at the local pub but have no idea how to approach any girls.<br/><br/>But one of his professors, a conniving mathematics professor with ulterior motives, played with sly intelligence by the incomparable Kevin Spacey, detects the computer-in-tennis-shoes in one his classes. Spacey signs him on to an underground group of Black Jack players that make money for themselves and their mentor on weekends. And they return to Boston to their ""normal"" lives of students and professor. Much of the film flip-flops between the glitz of Vegas and the snow-clad streets of Boston, similar to Rounders where the poker playing world and the law school world are contrasted.<br/><br/>Ben learns not only the subtleties of the game but also how to use his computer mind to discern when to bet high and when to lay low. The other members of the team act as scouts to determine which tables are ripe for action and those to be avoided. They wear disguises and use assumed names. The only thing that was a little hard to swallow was that when Ben gets to the table, he can't seem to lose. No matter how good a player may be at determining what cards have yet to be played, they don't always turn up the way you want. I might have wanted him to lose a little bit to differentiate when he won he big.<br/><br/>Like Rounders, Ben is flying high. He is winning hundreds of thousands of dollars for himself and the team, and particularly Kevin Spacey. Until a savvy spotter (Laurence Fishburne) starts to see Ben a few times too many. And see him win one times to many. How this plays out is the best part of the film, with a good twist towards the end.<br/><br/>Some have complained that the movie is predictable, but I found it a breath of fresh air when compared with most of the Hollywood sub-par Vegas fair being offered today. ""21"" is far better than the likes of the ridiculously silly movie ""Lucky You"". ""21"" is well-written, mostly believable, and with an outstanding performance by Jim Sturgess who carries the whole film much like Matt Damon in Rounders. Sure, maybe it follows the typical W form of story-telling a little too closely, but I was never bored and I was pleasantly surprised by the ending. Overall a winning hand, I mean film."

","21 is pretty much as advertised in the many trailers I had seen, but in this case that's not all bad. It's trailer pretty much sets up the whole movie, introduces pretty much every character and gives me a pretty good guess as to how it will all play out. Trust me in no movie where the character says ""I'm going to do this but just until I get a set amount of money, then I'm out"" do they ever hold true, never. I guess that would make for a very boring story, maybe, then again maybe not. Anyway the predictability for the most part doesn't bother me here, I'm too distracted by some solid performances and just some amazingly beautiful cinematography and camera work in all the Las Vegas scenes. But, and yes there is one, in the early moments of this film there is a scene that leaves the main character in what he feels is a hopeless situation, of course him not having the benefit of seeing the trailer like we all have, he doesn't know that the answer to his problem is just around the corner. Which separates us from the character and makes all the scenes after where he doesn't know what he's going to do so pointless to the audience. Also that early scene I mentioned earlier, remember? Ya, that anyone could watch that scene and not figure how this whole thing was going to end is beyond me. So I guess my bottom line is, the trailer tells you everything but doesn't seem to ruin it because it is a fun ride, the only thing that remains a mystery is how the ride will end, well the first 10 minutes took care of that mystery for me, so what remains, the fun ride and yes it is. Kevin Spacey is great, and by the way where has he disappeared to recently. Jim Strugess is a great up and coming young actor and Kate Bosworth plays her part well enough (but she should never have been Louis Lane). Laurence Fishburne has been better, way better but the length and pace of this film leaves little time to delve much deeper into his character and what time he has he puts to good use. Overall a fun and enjoyable movie, but far from worthy of a Chicken Dinner."
"joemamaohio","7","1","2","16 July 2008"," My Review
","""21"" is the true story of Jeff Ma (who also has a small cameo in the film) - who is called Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess) in the film, a kid who's incredibly intelligent with regards to numbers, and is recruited by an overzealous college professor (Kevin Spacey) to join an underground group of students who count cards and go to Vegas on the weekends to win at the Blackjack tables.<br/><br/>Ben's in the club just so he can get enough money to go to Harvard Med, but as the money piles up, he begins to fall into the trap of greed. He thinks he can do no wrong, and he becomes overconfident and arrogant - forsaking his old friends, without a fear of repercussion.<br/><br/>However, unbeknownst to Ben, he's being watched by Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne), who works for the casino to weed out card counters. As Ben becomes more and more arrogant, he becomes more and more suspicious to Cole, and suddenly Ben's luck runs out in many areas of his life.<br/><br/>With a blend of great actors, great story and awesome scenery, ""21"" delivers the drama with impeccable timing, and is well worth the time to see the film!"

","21 is a movie that will catch you from the very beginning, in my opinion it has everything a movie needs to enjoy and entertain. Its a very well developed drama with some moments of adventure and with the necessary amount of humor. It has a really quick rhythm causing the movie to never fall down and get tiresome. With a very interesting and original story based on actual events, about Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who--needing to pay school tuition--finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school's most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. It has a very good cast, beginning with Kevin Spacey in the role of Micky Rosa, an ironic and greedy math professor, his performance is almost brilliant, Lawrence Fishburne as the casino's guard is excellent as always in his acting, Jim Sturgess is convincing enough, he really makes you to believe him in this role and Kate Bosworth was also very good. In conclusion, this is a movie worth to watch and very recommendable."

","When I saw the trailers, I got interested in seeing the movie. I found the concept quite good. I read its reviews in the Amsterdam Weekly, which were not so great, so I was in two minds  but still decided to go and see the movie. The story is based on true event.<br/><br/>Ben Campbell (Jim Strugess) is brilliant in his academics, and aspires to be at the Harvard Medical School, but does not have USD 300K for fees. Prof. Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) comes to Ben's rescue when he knows Ben's expertise with numbers. Micky picks Ben along with a team of four other students. He trains them to master the computations that would surely help win the game of Black Jack at the Las Vegas casinos. Things work in the beginning, but once Ben makes an error and looses money, Micky abondons the team. Ben and the team try out things on their own, but Casino Manager - Cole Williams (Lawrence Fishburne) finds out the trick and beats Ben up. Micky takes away all Ben's savings, de-grades him in his classes. Ben without any choice  approaches Micky to join hands for one last time and have a BIG go to get back the lost money. Micky agrees and the rest forms the end of the movie. Will they succeed? <br/><br/>The movie has an interesting premise. Ben Campbell though has acted well, does not fill life and soul into the role, nor does his chemistry work with the heroine of the movie Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). Whenever Kevin Spacey or Lawrence Fishburne are on the screen, the story becomes more intense. So there is a patchiness in the way the story moves  with jerks of interest and boredom. But in the last twenty minutes the movie catches up with the missed opportunities and finally I felt quite okay and satisfied with the movie.<br/><br/>Australian born young director Robert Luketic does a decent job in the movie. I think a bit of good editing could have reduced the time by 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>I think this movie would be liked and enjoyed by school and college going students more, as there are sub-plots, topics of money and images that might interest them.<br/><br/>Overall above average 6.25 rating out of 10."

","first, Jim Sturgess is just the perfect opposite of Kevin spacey's versatility. though he did look like a dork, he didn't look anything like brilliant. his acting was really really disappointing; lacking too much in expression and conviction, lacking in subtlety and emotion. lacking in almost everything. why him? second, the plot was very ambitious but lacked the necessary intelligent twists and means, not that the main character was unable to portray his part convincingly, but that it was just too damn simple, clichéd, and threadbare.<br/><br/>third, the film wanted to depict that some of the best institutions in the world harbor incorrigible offenders amid all the years of teaching of doing what is right. Mr. spacey and MIT just gambled their names in vain. this is just the worst film Kevin spacey had been into.<br/><br/>fourth, if this film were intended for the intelligent audience, then it should have delivered crafty story lines. but by the looks of it, it really was anything but intelligent.<br/><br/>overall, this movie was a complete waste of time. the only redeeming part this movie has to offer is the seemingly less obvious twist that Mr Sturgess so sorely failed to orchestrate."

","It is not so common that we come across a movie about a math genius. Of course, there was ""A Beautiful Mind"" and ""Good Will Hunting,"" now comes another one. ""21"" is the story of Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), an MIT math nerd who wanted to go into Harvard Medical School. However, being poor, he needed to come up with $300,000 for him to get through med school. Opportunity presented itself when his math professor Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) noted his skills and recruited him to join their blackjack card counting group. This group would go to Vegas in the weekends, make a killing at the blackjack tables by employing pre-arranged signals, code words and card counts, and go back to school on Monday as if nothing happened. Of course, you know that with schemes like this, happy days will not be forever.<br/><br/>I liked the movie very interesting. I did have to gloss over the fact that I honestly did not understand any of the card counting techniques they were using. What on earth does is mean if the card count is ""+17"" or ""+15""? In any case, I liked the character arc of Ben Campbell and the predicaments he was in. I knewthere would be retribution at the end, and I liked the fact that this part of the movie was not cut and dry. There was still a lot of suspense and unexpected developments.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess, though I have never seen him before, played his role very well, as the shy intellectual turned blackjack high bidder. Kate Bosworth, while gorgeous, looked too old to be his love interest. She did not look like her Lois Lane character here, but she also does not look credible as an MIT rocket science student. Kevin Spacey played his role quite efficiently as always. It was a bit of a stretch to believe how an MIT professor can run this ""business"" while having a record in Vegas back in his heyday as a card hustler as well, and still keep using his real name.<br/><br/>Overall, I found this very interesting and a movie worth watching. It is even more interesting to find out that this was actually based loosely on a true story!"

While the artistic and deep films are enjoyable and further the art of cinema and the fluff makes some (like me) want to burn my DVD collection and call the industry catatonic, these are the movies that lie in between that make the movies fun again. <br/><br/>I'd recommend it. Go have fun, turn off the mind, enjoy it for what it is and walk away with out wanting to stab your eyeballs out."

","Ben Campbell is a gifted maths student with dreams of getting into the best university and getting out of his humble Boston roots. The reality is that talent may not be enough and that the costs may be prohibitive. Regardless of his future plans, Ben's maths professor sees other potential and invites him to join a very unusual after-school activity  practising counting cards to beat the odds at the Blackjack table. Why? Well because Professor Rosa's group spends their weekends under assumed identities taking the casino's for tens of thousands of dollars a time. It all seems so simple but is Ben just naive to the risks?<br/><br/>One can easily understand what it was about the story that appealed to the makers because, to coin a phrase ""it's Vegas baby!"" - the city of women, lights, money, gambling and shows. Hey, if nothing else we have scope of loads of cool slow-mo shots of people walking in casinos, quick-cuts of cards and chips and so on - after all people watch poker etc all the time on TV shows so it is an easy sell. And so what we get in this film is lots of sweeping shots and glamorous locations, none of which ever make you forget that what we're talking about here is maths students using their skills to beat the odds and win money. The only outcome of getting caught appears to be a severe beat from Lawrence Fishburne and being sent on your way with whatever you got before being caught.<br/><br/>And that is really the problem that I had with the film is that it didn't have a great deal to offer in the delivery to convince me that I should be interested in it. The true story is enough to make me watch but somehow it doesn't translate into a gripping narrative. The risks aren't all that tangible whereas the earnings are significant to the point where it seems a no-brainer. With this element stuttering the film really could have done with stronger characters to make for a good tale but, as it is, Campbell is a fairly dull subject whose changes are obvious and not that interesting. This just leaves lots of a card games but even without the card counting, blackjack doesn't lend itself to tension and mind-games in the same cinematic way that poker does (and even that is not done that well that often). So the film pushes the easy stuff and loads it up with the visual style that CSI, Oceans Eleven etc have conditioned us to associate with Vegas-set stories.<br/><br/>The end result of that is that these scenes do have a bit of pace and energy to them but as soon as this goes away, there is almost nothing of interest to focus on. I was surprised by just how so-so much of the film was and it is hard to ignore that the weakness comes from the lack of substance for the viewer to get into. In the lead Sturgess does OK because his performance feels natural enough and I assumed that with a better script and clearer direction he could have engaged the audience more; as it was his was a case of nice but bland. Spacey does his usual turn and is a good presence but not much more. Fishburne is more realistic than the Ocean's Eleven style casino bosses/heavies but he also comes over a bit toothless at the same time and not that much of a force in the film. Bosworth is a cool love interest though, genuinely cute and works well with her fellow actors even if it must have been tough to generate chemistry with them within the film. Support from the remainder of the group is OK even if their characters are basic.<br/><br/>21 is an occasionally slick and cool film based on a true story but it puts all its chips on the stylish and swish Vegas delivery and forgets to spread its bets by working on character, narrative and engaging the audience in more solid ways. This means that at times it feels fresh and cool but ultimately the minute you have to look deeper you find there is surprisingly little to work with. It is still ""OK"" but never consistently more than that."
"jhabeles","10","1","4","5 May 2008"," Realistic, but with anachronisms, terrific casting, loved it!!!
","The legendary stories of card counting - dating from the 1960s Edward Thorp book ""Beat the Dealer"" - are seductive for anyone, but especially mathematically talented students at MIT and similar places. Jim Sturgess happens to bear an incredibly striking resemblance, in facial appearance and expressions, to a very well-known U.S. Washington DC scientist and administrator; how's that for casting? Kate Bosworth is incredibly appealing with that short but perfectly combed haircut - though perhaps not stereotypical, I nonetheless find her credible as an MIT student especially in the gym scene. Equally beautiful woman undergraduates have graced the MIT halls however unexpected. This is real, make no mistake. The cinematography of MIT is stunning and real, except there is little pedestrian traffic on Memorial Drive (where Jim Sturgess encounters other characters). Originally blackjack was dealt from a single deck and counting was a breeze. When Atlantic City was opened in the late 1970s, they instituted 8-deck shoes, so you had to keep the count not from one single deck but from 8 of them. There were subtle but statistically significant changes to the rules that better evened the odds in favor of the house. Nonetheless card-counting syndicates are said to have attempted to win under those rules using more advanced techniques than those depicted in 21. One aspect of 21 I did not like much was the emphasis on having to come up with $300K to attend Harvard Med. Certainly much of that sum could have been borrowed, so it was not factual as presented. An aspect of the movie I did not appreciate were the anachronisms: The heyday of this activity was prior to the introduction of 8-deck shoes i.e., in the 1970s yet the movie was set in the 2000's. Go figure. The 2.07 contest was not famous then. And, Harvard Med was much less costly in dollars. Dropped ceilings were not used in any MIT dorm room. Incidentally, the penurious student played by Sturgess would have undoubtedly lived at home, not in a dorm, rather than work retail sales at a preppy clothing store. It would have left more time for studying (or ""tooling"" -- to use the accurate MIT vernacular eschewed by the film). One other comment: I think the movie panders to the popular conception of the math ""whiz"" in that it seems no effort whatsoever is required for the Sturgess character to get up-to-speed. Certainly he would have needed to build his skills and even for the ""genius"" it would take a little while. But it's more palatable for the theatre-going public to believe that it's all talent and no hard work. That's Hollywood for you!!!"

","21 feels more like a dramedy, than pure drama, but what a fast paced and exciting film with a solid cast and writing. Kevin Spacey is in top form with biting dialog as a cynical Harvard Professor, bored by his career, but brilliant enough to captivate a group of students out for adventure and gain. Jim Sturgess from ACROSS THE UNIVERSE continues to dazzle an audience and is completely believable here in this film as a Harvard student on the precipice of a brilliant chance for Harvard Medical School, and the lovely Kate Bosworth adds to the mix of glam and love. The diversity of cast in 21 makes the film such an interesting mix of characters and the fantastic Lawrence Fishburne brings a tower of strength to a character in 21 that is more than enough of a challenge to ""Spacey & Co."". Really loved this film on many levels."

","Knowing people that attend MIT, and trying to confirm many of the facts presented in this movie I cannot agree with much of this ""this movie is based on facts"". <br/><br/>This movie has a lot of resounding issues with me not to be impartial but a few of these are: <br/><br/>All Students are A students, All A Students are Geniuses, All Students that Attend MIT are Great Card Counters for Blackjack, MIT has a History of Card Counting back to when the actor Kevin Spacey playing Micky Rosa, hit the card counting at MIT long before ""21"" unfolded as a flashback.<br/><br/>For me genius has anything but to deal with education or institutionalism and more to do with the nature/nurture issues perhaps environment and different approaches to solving problems. Of course there will always be cases in which higher learning enhance the gifts of some but most geniuses swing by the wayside of conventional metrics.<br/><br/>This segmenting society into the leaders and the followers or the gift of a degree often to find a job which this movie appears to suggest is the way of life is unfortunately in many cases reality and we furnish our fortune 500s with tic tacs. Tic tacs in the sense that they are hard coated almost perfect replicas of what industry requires, we throw away tic tacs that are not shaped uniformly. A few of these throw aways are so disgusted with the system they start companies like ""Microsoft"" and ""Apple"" to name a few.<br/><br/>Telling someone they're not good enough for something and that another person is a more suitable candidate is great as it was approached in this movie. The issue that resounded with me was this means to an end to make the cut by describing trials and tribulations with a casino scheme as a means to attain acceptance which seems rather like a casino advertisement. ""Hey get busted by the security at a casino and we consider you really smart and worthy of a scholarship"" <br/><br/>I will admit we live in a complex almost impractical world everyone knows the saying ""life is not fair"" but for many of us we try to make the best of it. For me as someone in the 25-29 demographic I have some serious reservations with what this movie is telling people that are struggling with money and other pressures associated with life. This casino option is the wrong message to send, Hollywood is a powerful message sender and these are the wrong messages; Gambling doesn't solve anything. Even if Kevin Spaceys character states ""you need to follow the system and not get emotional we arnt gambling here this is a business we are in"" the quote is a summary of what was said and not word for word from the movie. <br/><br/>Treat this movie with a grain of salt. I am still researching to see if the facts are even true for the baseline plot (or lack there of with no character development and no glue putting anything other then the money making scheme).<br/><br/>All in all this movie may appeal to some who just want to be dazzled by the mighty brilliance of the rich, straight A geniuses of MIT with 4.0s and perfect SAT scores or the romance of the ""geek beauty and the bigger geek"". <br/><br/>For me this is not the case. I thought this was a cheap shot at the working middle class and struggling citizens who struggle on a day to day basis to make ends meet and get educated ( college, university). Being successful or great has little to do with MIT, if we look at research itself we find the top schools do not account for a disproportionate amount of good research or scholarly articles amongst all the other universities out there worldwide. Anyone is capable of great things from a bum on the street to research being done at any school with or without resources. These schools like MIT are for the most part well funded and have the power through cash to scoop up talent from lesser known institutions, still most of the break through work is never done in their own institution.<br/><br/>All it takes is some hard work and a bit of drive and ""sometimes"" not always assets for higher learning where a university or some vessel capable of providing tools can help, I believe in the next 20 years Google and infrastructure like Google will become the next education or institution dynamic of tomorrow and give these MIT class institutions a run for their money. I have a saying "" a few smart cats cant do anything many can change the world"" and these education institutions are only producing a few smart cats every year.<br/><br/>My rating is as such."

","It doesn't aim to be anything incredible and just allows itself to be a lot of fun with a great cast. Jim Sturgess again shows some great talent as the film showcases his naturalism and diversity. He does a superb job of leading the story and is really proving to be a true rising star. Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne are great to watch as the veterans of the film whose pasts lead to some twists and turns at the end that I really didn't see coming. But neither overstep their parts like some big stars do in supporting roles; they let Sturgess make the film the entertaining up-and-down story that it is. Kate Bosworth is incredibly sexy in a rather underwritten role. In a small role, Aaron Yoo again delivers a hilarious performance as he did in last year's Disturbia. It's a little too long and I didn't really buy the fact that everything works out so well in the end, but overall it's just an enjoyable little film that demonstrates the strong talent of a great young actor."

"Anonymous_Maxine","5","1","5","1 May 2009"," How to ruin a fascinating true story.
","Ah, Las Vegas, the city of lights. The place that probably offers more false promises than anywhere else in the world, Hollywood included. I've never been much of a gambler myself, usually when I go there I plan a given amount of money to gamble with and, once it's gone (because I understand in advance that I'm gonna lose it) then I stop and go back to my buddies and concentrate on getting nicely drunk. But cards are even less my thing. My friends back in Venice Beach had almost nightly poker tournaments that I couldn't get myself interested in to save my life, so my experience in gambling real money on card games is almost nonexistent. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I have an endless fascination with Vegas, and the true story of those people from MIT who raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars by counting cards at the blackjack tables should have been a great movie. Unfortunately, 21 is not it. The movie deals with the true story of those MIT students, but the movie is so heavily fictionalized that it's nearly impossible to tell what really happened under what ultimately turns out to be a twisted mass of Hollywood clichés.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess plays Ben Campbell, a college student graduating from MIT and about to fulfill his lifelong dream of attending Harvard Medical School. The only problem is that he doesn't have any money and Harvard Med will run him $300,000. Since he lives in a world that contains one single scholarship opportunity and not a hint of student loans (seriously, with an academic history like Ben's, there are about a million ways to get the money he needs), he sees his chances of going to Harvard Med slipping away. <br/><br/>Soon he meets a professor, Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey) who introduces him to a carefully designed card-counting scheme involving himself and a few of his most gifted students. They all head to Vegas and try to beat the system, while security chief Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) lurks in the darkened security office surrounded by TV screens watching out for people like them. I wanted to see a movie about the real story, something almost documentary-like that tells not only how they beat the Vegas system but also how they got caught and what happened afterwards, but 21 plays more like a completely fictional story. It's like a cheap version of Ocean's 11 except the only laws being broken are when Williams drags various characters into the casino basement to, ah, knock some sense out of them. <br/><br/>I have no idea how card counting works, I'm just not a math guy. The movie doesn't concern itself with helping us understand it either, beyond some quickly edited sequences showing the main characters devising an intricate counting and communication scheme that will allow them to work together in the casinos without anyone realizing that they are a team. The problem is that the card counting itself requires a tremendous intellect, but the characters are phenomenally stupid. <br/><br/>Are we supposed to believe that the same people who perfected this counting scheme would come up with signals so stupidly obvious as linking your arms behind your back when the deck's hot? It was bad enough that they all constantly glance nervously at each other whenever they're in the same room, but that arm-linking thing was amazing. Every single time!! Didn't they ever think it would be a good idea to change things up a little bit? It would require a stupendous quantity of incompetence on the part of the security administration to miss THAT. <br/><br/>Even worse is the fact that in order to remind us that they're humans, the characters have to make drastic mistakes, but drastic gambling mistakes done well will give you something like the poker scene at the end of Casino Royale. Here, they get dunk and blow their cover or make gambling errors that can only be described as purely moronic, and the screenplay is more concerned with cheesy relationships between the characters that only distract from what the story is really about. Pearl Harbor had the same problem. We want to see a story about a major historical event, not some idiotic romance between Josh Hartnett and whoever that girl was. <br/><br/>Even worse, nothing is told about what happened after they were caught. They won't go to jail because counting cards isn't illegal (and shouldn't be), but the movies ties everything up with so much obviously fabricated nonsense that it's nearly impossible to walk out of the theater without feeling cheated. And in a movie about card-counting and taking Vegas for hundreds of thousands of dollars, it's the casinos who should feel cheated, not the audience."

I have been to MIT several times to visit, and it is fun seeing scenes around Cambridge (why did they keep saying ""Boston"" in the movie?) Also,the robotics 209 is really 609 -I believe?? I also wish they would have mentioned the MIT Infinite Corridor or shown scenes inside of it- maybe even the Nuclear reactor (kids walking past it or something as it is very interesting) and some other MIT spots. It was a very fun movie to go to all in all!! I wish they would interview some authentic MIT students or talk to profs there to get more information about the school, and what it is like in real life? One more question: Why do the movie stars that are interviewed constantly (especially Kate B)never mention the students from MIT or if they chatted with any of them- tried to get to know them? The interviews always seem about only their star selves. Personally, I'm curious about real life at these actual schools/places and the people who are there not so much the stars (atleast after the first interview where they talk only all about themselves)."

While it was quite the drama and adventure, 21 also had a few quick witty one-liners, but not enough to grow old or ruin the dialogue. The witticisms fit in with the script.

","In the film, 21 the main summary is about Jim sturges (Ben Campbell) a very gifted- smart student from Massachusetts needing money to get into Harvard medical school, he meets a group of other very gifted students being led by one of his professors Mickey Rosa (Kevin Spacey) who is leading them and teaching them to use their math skills to win large amounts of money in black jack, going on runs and loving the luxurie life with a good twist at the end, and don't forget the intelligent Villain Laurence Fishburne (Cole Williams) as he plays the serious ""invincible"" type man as he plays in the Matrix as well. As all Kevin Spacey movies usually are, this movie is an entertaining, high stakes intense movie that keeps the audience engaged. Kevin Spacey having so much talent and successful films form the past, playing the part as the man who brings adrenaline to the movie like the Usual Suspects (1995) being one of my favorite Kevin Spacey movies. Ben Campbell being somewhat new to the movie scene plays that part very well of being the young genius who falls in love with the luxuries and thrill of winning enormous amounts of money.
Overall I think the movie is very entertaining with many scenes and action that will keep your attention and keep your heart racing, the director Robert Luketic does a great job with the angles on which he films the sciences in the casino and the detail he accounts, with the disguises they wear to High tension scenes using close up portrait shots where you can see there forehead sweat from being so nervous. The movie displays a story line that gives the ""nerds"" a praise in the movie that's very entertaining to see. The film let's you experience the thrill of winning big through the TV screen and feel as if you are there in these high anxiety moments. All though this movie has many upsides there are also some flaws in the movie, the movie seems to always come back with an intense scene ever so often to keep the audience engaged but the film also seems cheesy in a way as it feels to jump around and becomes somewhat unrealistic. The movie does a great job of portraying as something that has or could happen in real life but some of the flaws come from getting too crazy with it, as you see in the movie when the group uses their secret signal tactics to indicate something using the same ones over and over again, as in a real casino I believe they would get caught a lot earlier in their road to fame. Although this movie suffered from some flaws as all movies do, with a combination of some great actors, the thrill of luxuries and thrill that many dream about I found this movie was an eye catching movie that I enjoyed watching greatly."

","This movie was based on a true story, and if the makers had stuck closer to the true story it could have been a much better movie. But no, they had to Hollywoodize it and dumb it down so that anyone with the least knowledge of the game of blackjack and how casinos operate will be saying ""No way"" to themselves all through the movie. It actually ends up with a chase scene and characters running through the kitchen, for God's sake.<br/><br/>In real life the team's success was 90% in being careful to not attract the attention of the casinos detectors and only 10% in their scheme, which was based on the well-known technique of card-counting to get an edge. In the movie, the team's actions were childishly crude even to the point of continually returning to the same casino...so the movie makers could develop the characters of the casino bad guys. In real life the team was careful to not win much at any one table or at any one casino, not more than $1,000 a session, which would be well within the amount any lucky player might win without counting. In the movie they hit the same table for tens of thousands of dollars, which would have set off alarms all over Nevada. Even the hand signals the team used in the movie were childishly obvious. All this by the supposedly brilliant MIT students and professor. No way.<br/><br/>The movie actually had the bad casino guys torturing card counters when they caught them. No way. In real life a casino has the right, tested in court, to kick anyone out and ban them from ever playing again...they do not have to prove cheating or card-counting, they do it under the laws of trespassing on their private property and this is what they do. Remember, card-counters are only making what amounts to an hourly wage, so they are not a serious threat to a casino.<br/><br/>Another example of the Hollywood treatment was that after showing how brilliant Ben was at counting cards when they were recruiting him, he was not used as the card counter, he was used as the big bettor and one of the female team members did the counting.<br/><br/>an entertaining movie for someone not knowledgeable or much interested in real life casino gambling, but dumb and dumber for those who are."

He accepts the offer for two reasons. 1) As a means to an end. 2) His long time crush Jill (Kate Bosworth) is in the team. Finally he ends up getting sucked by the glitz, glamour and easy money of Las Vegas. How he gets his act together comprises the rest of the story. <br/><br/>Extremely cheesy with enormous number of redundant scenes featuring characters that are mere caricatures. Cinematography is good, background score is peppy, editing is slick and the lead character is believable. Kevin Spacey has given the worst performance I have seen of him and was a total letdown. They could've added a little more fun while presenting the Blackjack games than just the calculations in the minds of the geniuses that we should imagine. I was a bit disconnected with that.<br/><br/>I could not think of any recommendation like 'Watch it only if ...'.. nothing comes to mind. Just drop it. It's easy and more fun."

","21 is predictable and has clouded motivations on what we are hearing this story.<br/><br/>Despite a few performances the acting is dull and wooden. The characters are not fleshed out except for our leading actor who had the strongest performance, even though his performance was still not that strong. The script is messy and predictable. Once Kevin Spacey's character is invited back to play in Vegas again you know what is going to happen for the last half hour of the movie. The opening and closing scenes are probably the worst thing this movie has going for it. It opens up that this college student wants to get a scholarship to Harvard because he can't afford the tuition and he has to write an essay about a life experience that would make the school want to give him this scholarship. So he decides to tell the school about how he went to Vegas and became a criminal and got his teacher at MIT beat up by the casino security. Then in the closing scene he makes all of these comments like: ""Does that impress you?"" or ""Did that make you go 'wow'?"" The other part about the script that bothered me was how they kept going back to the same casino even though they knew security was watching them and knew who they were. For the dialogue, there is some really cheesy romantic dialogue that doesn't work. Also some scenes are supposed to funny and they really are not. <br/><br/>This movie was very disappointing please don't watch it. Save yourself the pain."

","21 (2008): Dir: Robert Luketic / Cast: Jim Sturges, Kate Bosworth, Kevin Spacey, Laurence Fishburne, Aaron Yoo: True story starring Jim Sturges who hopes to get into Harvard Medical School. He is recruited by a professor to join other students in Blackjack. He learns the basics of counting cards, which casinos take a dislike to when they clean up during several visits to Vegas. Fine setup becomes predictable with questionable attitude towards the consequences or just merely the payoff. Directed by Robert Luketic who previously made Win a Date With Tad Hamilton and Monster-in-Law. This marks quite a departure from his usual romantic comedies but certainly he proves that he can indeed scout other genres. However, his romantic comedies seem to elevate beyond what this ambitious premise ultimately reduces to. Sturges does a fine job as someone caught up in wrong and going full throttle without care or consequence. Kate Bosworth is an object of romance thus doing little more than being Sturges's girlfriend. Kevin Spacey plays the professor in what is a limited role but not without consequence. Laurence Fishburne plays the casino head security with ties to the Spacey character. He will do the standard pursuit but not without a great payoff. Very bland and certainly not as good as it should have been but it demonstrate how such addictions can lead to a downfall. Score: 4 ½ / 10"

","Along the years, England had given the world a long list of great exports. Charles Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Harry Potter! Now the gent named Jim Sturgess doesn't belong to this list at all. In fact, due to him.. England should be ashamed of herself!<br/><br/>When you have an actor who doesn't act well, then it's a problem. But when you have an actor who doesn't act well in a movie, where all the actors along with everything else are very well, then it's a bigger problem!<br/><br/>This is a smart movie. I loved the way its narrative works. It follows, to great extent, the pattern of Oliver Stone's Wall Street, but mastered having its own merits. It is about wicked manipulating, once on Vegas casinos, then once more on the impostor teacher and us as viewers (the end's twist). The real wickedness is in how that is told; through the lead while talking about experiences that he had while being in his early twenties. To assure that, see how the old experience of the casino's head of security could beat the scientific cunning, or how the impostor teacher - imprisoned in his classroom, hotel rooms, and theories - is the one who loses eventually. So, having an experience, by wading into practical life, has unmistakable glorification.<br/><br/>The script makes a nagging boss for that security man, not to thrill by secondary conflict, but to underline the message of ""your computer can't do this"". The complicated mathematics, and the huge very advanced electronic minds, all can be defeated in this movie by the human wit. Human relationships are being defended too, since the lead discovers that his friends are more significant than money and business. While glorifying the human experience, intelligence, the movie's substance glorifies, and has victory for, the human in general against a world of machinery and pure materialism.<br/><br/>It seems perfect as fun ride with tight pace, many surprises, colorful image, a very happy end where everybody wins, and the evil goes to hell. So as a whole, this is smart and enjoyable as well. However, there was a love scene that I thought was unnecessary as the heroine herself. And.. there was Mr. Sturgess!<br/><br/>That guy was an obvious dissonant tone. Between Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishburne, he seemed like Droopy in Tom and Jerry Kids show. And while being the lead actor, it was even worse than that Tom and Jerry show!<br/><br/>Seriously speaking, he's as sleepy as Droopy, and less fun than him; remember the moment where he was making faces in front of a mirror; it's one of the most AWFUL scenes I have ever seen in a Hollywood movie lately! At another moment, he tells, ironically, that he's used to be mistaken for Tom Cruise. Baby, one look at you made me finally discover how I underrated Cruise as an actor for ages!<br/><br/>Save the sole thing he mastered, a flawless American accent, Sturgess was undoubtedly a flaw in this movie. He looks all-the-time stoned, or totally indifferent at best. With his pale charisma and monotonous utterance, I don't know how he is chosen to be in this movie or any movie for that matter. Sturgess' character availed a lot of his 2 mentors in the movie, played by Spacey and Fishburne, unlike Sturgess himself with these 2 acting mentors I suppose!<br/><br/>21 is a memorable commercial movie about brilliant swindle done with another brilliant swindle, which could produce a meaning about growing up. It gives ""21"" a peculiar double meaning and good reputation in terms of being the right age to learn about life. And it portrays, in a way, how ""slick"" overpowers ""genius"", ""friendship"" overpowers ""business"", and ""man"" overpowers ""machine"". Its sole problem isn't in the lifeless Jim Sturgess, it's rather in the weird decision of casting him, being a stupid move in a movie full of smartness.<br/><br/>If whoever manages the process of casting doesn't know how to perfect their job, then, my advice will be for Sturgess himself: dear jimmy, for the love of god, your homeland England, its repute, and the poor us. Before handling your next movie, try to have a good, really good, deal of sleep. Then, after being so awake and fresh, please, think of another possible career or.. continue sleeping!"

But Ben has a special skill that might make it possible to cover his bills and then some. It turns out he's a genius when it comes to numbers, and it is this talent that brings him to the attention of Micky Rosa, Ben's professor at MIT, who has come up with what he believes is a full proof system for winning at blackjack. Rosa invites Ben to become a part of a handpicked team of similarly gifted students who are getting some extracurricular lessons in how to beat the house at 21. Ben is, at first, reluctant to sign on to what seems like a morally questionable enterprise, but the lure of easy money and the appeal to his ego finally win him over. So off to Vegas they go to put their system into play. But can a clean-cut, wholesome boy like Ben stay true to his goals and principles once he's had a taste of life in the fast lane? <br/><br/>Based on a true story, ""21,"" directed by Robert Luketic, is a slick, superficial, well-oiled crowd-pleaser that holds one's attention while it's playing itself out but doesn't provide much food for thought or emotional resonance after it's over. Jim Sturgess makes for an appealing protagonist as the acceptance-craving Ben, but the real acting here is done by Kevin Spacey as the odious professor who uses blackmail and bribery to keep his minions in line, and Laurence Fishburne as a head of casino security who may turn out to be the one serious impediment to the team's success. The script fails to make the card-game esoterica comprehensible for the lay audience - we're forced to accept way too much of it on faith - but hardcore gamblers will probably be taking notes for future pointers.<br/><br/>Plus, there's a great moment at the end that makes the whole shebang suddenly worthwhile."

","This is a movie about counting cards is about trying to beat the system in gambling. And revolves around students that go to MIT, and the character Kevin Spacey plays tries to recruit some brilliant math students to join his crew and beat the system and Kevin Spacey does what Kevin Spacey does best. Although I like gambling movies this movie isn't about gambling but beating the system, and the conflict that comes with trying to beat the system. Cause some other intelligent character Laurence Fishburne is trying to catch them red handed. I didn't find anything surprising about this movie, it was just cliché on top of cliché. Although this movie had some flare, but it ran like a fairy tale and that sort of disappointed me, and the MIT students just wasn't that smart in this movie. ""21"" entertained me the first time I saw it, but it also didn't pull any surprises. The characters weren't even interesting, except maybe Choi the character Aaron Yoo played.

"pc95","6","0","1","26 September 2009"," Pretty Good Story, but with bland support and poor middle
","""21"" reportedly inspired by real events has pretty good pull and storyline. The leads in the movie of Sturgess and Kevin Spacey do a respectable job keeping the picture afloat. However (spoilers), the rest of the ""team"" and development for supporting actors is underdeveloped and unremarkable. They become cut-outs in the background - almost stick figures. Worst of all is Bosworth who may be a better actress than this role provides, but is utterly uninteresting and unbelievable as MIT brainiac, and playing the love-interest blandly. Lawrence Fishbourne in a guest-starring role gives the movie a bit of depth and validity while the finale scene(s) are foregone conclusions and predictable as are a lot of the happenings the simple drive of the story works and is entertaining. This is something akin to ""Rounders"" but not quite as good. The middle third or so of the movie feels empty nonetheless as edits show too many boring Vegas parties and lavishings devoid of meaning or fire. Finally The narration is satisfactory as well as the ending, so Overall mildly recommended if you like gambling."

"tsmith417","5","0","2","17 May 2009"," Just another teenage action/romance movie
","I know there are pages and pages of reviews already but I just had to write something or bust after wasting my time watching this movie.<br/><br/>The film has really nothing to do with being a blackjack counter; it uses the Las Vegas casinos and the premise of card-counting only as a vehicle for a teenage action/romance story.<br/><br/>The script is full of contradictions. The most beautiful girl on the campus of M.I.T. is supposedly a rocket scientist. We know this only because one of the nerds says she is; she never utters a word or gives us a clue about the scope of her intelligence or her field of expertise.<br/><br/>A college math professor, who becomes the organizer of a blackjack card-counting team, mentions more than once that this is a business and that emotions should be kept out of it, yet once the team starts showing a profit they go crazy-wild, spending exorbitant amounts of money going to boutiques and topless bars.<br/><br/>He tells them ""When we get to the casino we don't know each other and we'll wear disguises"" yet only one girl ""disguises"" herself with a wig once in a while; the rest of them don't do a thing to change their appearance.<br/><br/>For five people who are supposed to be strangers they spend an awful lot of time watching each other intently at the gaming tables and partying and shopping together; the only time they keep their distance from one another is back on campus where they strangely don't interact at all.<br/><br/>They're supposed to stay under the radar and not draw attention to themselves but they play at the same casino every weekend and within a few weeks the main character goes from being a shy college kid to the biggest whale Vegas has ever seen, and is on a first-name basis with every dealer, pit boss, and valet in the joint.<br/><br/>And for someone who doesn't want to draw attention to himself and his team, a 50-ish professor shouldn't be caught hanging around with a bunch of 20-ish kids, especially not in a titty bar.<br/><br/>As for the card-counting, I found it to be slightly unrealistic to say the least. A count of +10 is a counter's dream; to consistently find counts of +15 and above at every table is ridiculous. Not to mention that pit bosses are competent counters themselves and any one of them would order a change of decks in a New York minute if they saw the count staying that high for that long. Oh yeah, another thing about counting cards ... a high count is favorable to the players because it means they might get more 19s and 20s, but the dealer stands the same chance of getting those 19s and 20s so a high count doesn't necessarily guarantee a win on every hand.<br/><br/>I found myself wondering how a college kid could fly to Vegas every weekend without his mother, who obviously kept in close contact with him, calling the police and filing a missing person's report. The kid's friends ask why he doesn't return their phone calls but they never think there's anything odd about the fact that it's only between Friday and Sunday that he can't be reached.<br/><br/>What I found really confusing was the time frame. The original M.I.T. team worked the casinos in the 1970s, yet the film makes no attempt to make Vegas look anything like it did thirty years ago. The casinos shown were all built within the last twenty years and even the bars, clothes, and music are 21st century, and I don't think anyone called anyone else ""dude"" in 1974 and I know for certain there were no cell phones (the kid's friends question why he doesn't call them on his cell when they can't reach him). If this is a story about one of the later incarnations of the M.I.T. team, however, since the newest team member is recruited to replace one who left to work for Google which wasn't even a glimmer in anyone's eye in the '70s, then it's just as confusing because they're talking about facial recognition software just coming into use when those types of programs have been around since the late 1980s. <br/><br/>In addition, if the team has been working this gig for a long time, as suggested by the fact that they need a replacement member and are not starting from scratch, then why do they go money-crazy all of a sudden? Why haven't they been filthy rich for lo these many months prior to the addition of the new member? The whole scenario makes no sense any way you try to explain it.<br/><br/>If you want to know how blackjack counting teams really work, don't think you're going to get any insight from this movie. But if you enjoy unlikely romances, bad guys chasing good guys, silly plot devices, and watching otherwise intelligent math professors getting double-crossed by inexperienced students in unbelievable situations, then this is the film for you."

","The movie is loosely based on the true-life successes of the MIT Blackjack Team during the early 90s. In large part though, the characters and plot are generally fictional - but who cares - it's fun to watch! The lead character is interesting and because it's told like it's a true account of an amazing experience - it's pretty suspenseful.<br/><br/>The movie is about a gifted MIT student who joins a 'secret' blackjack team that is run by a math professor. As his only option to pay for enrolling at Harvard Medical School the following year, he reluctantly engages in 'legally', yet covertly, scamming a number of Las Vegas casinos. He learns that it's a dangerous game though - not just because of the casino watchdogs, but the professor too! <br/><br/>If the above plot line sounds interesting, then you'll likely enjoy watching the movie. There's tension, suspense, romance, guilt, big bucks and nasty thugs - all the makings of a fun way to spend 2 hours. Definitely recommended."

","In this vacuous drama supposedly based on a true story, Old Hand (Kevin Spacey) teaches Teen Models (Kate Bosworth, Aaron Yoo, Liza Lapira, Jacob Pitts) to count cards and take on Vegas. Happens that Old Hand is college professor Micky Rosa, and his Teen Models are his students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Boston. I don't doubt this may be a true story. That the characters displayed such stupidity, I do doubt.<br/><br/>From a book by Ben Mezrich, Bringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six M.I.T. Students Who Took Vegas for Millions, 21 follows talented young M.I.T. student, Ben Campbell (Jim Sturgess), struggling to pay fees for classes he can't afford. He is invited to join the covert team of Teen Model Card Sharks (who make us cringe with their Too-Kewl-For-Skool 'tudes) aiming to break Vegas.<br/><br/>When the Teen Team recruit Ben, they speak like they're old hands at the Vegas scam, wowing him on how his lifestyle will change, yet when they gather in Vegas, Professor Micky lays down instructions like they've never been there before. I call this the Movie-Astronaut Rule: Always save the most crucial information on space travel for the actual journey, when the cameras are rolling. For the Ignint Audience.<br/><br/>Two glaring loopholes in logic ruined this film: first, they have no fence. These are just college kids. When they come into large cash, how do they propose to launder it? Ben hides it in his dorm roof, but when he starts paying for that college he couldn't afford, the IRS is gonna rain down on him like a Vegas jackpot.<br/><br/>Also, their attempts at discretion are ludicrous: they all arrive in Vegas at the same time, sometimes in asinine disguises, check into the same hotel together, go drinking together at strip clubs, constantly acknowledge each other and spend big in loud montages. Smart - but no Common Sense. Their fantastic ""secret signal"" (on whether a table is hot to hustle) is to fold their arms behind the chair. Nice for some podunk operation in Ohio - but this is Vegas! <br/><br/>Sure enough, a sinister casino cop, Williams (a beefed-up Laurence Fishburne) notices the scam signals on these new inventions called Security Cameras, and uses the Bush Administration Interrogation Policy of ""America Doesn't Torture"" to torture some answers outa the dweebs. Williams, on Professor Micky's tail for years, now sees his opportunity to get Micky through his Teen Model stooges.<br/><br/>In most scam movies, we marvel at the ingenuity of the criminals. In 21, we cringe every time these jokers are on screen. Spacey and Fishburne carry the movie on their shoulders alone, as every time we turn to the Teen Models, Sturgess is too busy looking like Tobey Macguire and Kate Bosworth is too busy pretending she's hot, and the movie falls flat.<br/><br/>The attitude casinos have towards ""counting cards"" bugs the babyjesus out of me! In Blackjack or 21, everyone maintains counting cards is not illegal. So why do casinos allow any jackass to play the game except those who are exceptional at it, who can count the cards? Casinos will fleece anyone, but anyone who fleeces them - legally - is taken to a room with no windows to get the intelligence beaten out of them...<br/><br/>Ben loses his mind over plain Bosworth and starts losing and drinking, and then defects from the Teen Team to scam solo. To stop Ben's stupidity leading up the chain to Micky himself, Micky grasses up Ben to the authorities - sadist Fishburne. He had every right to do this, as Ben was ""gambling not counting"" with Micky's outlay-money, so Micky cut him loose. It's a dog eat Teen Model world out there.<br/><br/>However, Ben has one last con up his sleeve. He gives Speech Number 32 in the Generic Screenwriter Inspirational Speech Catalog (the ""Let's Do This One Last Time... For the Honor, For the Game... For The Boys"" speech) - and grasses up Micky to the Ethical Non-Torturing Fishburne, who proceeds to torture Micky.<br/><br/>The twisted message 21 sends is that even though the Teens betrayed their mentor and he tried to protect himself, the Teens won by being even more unethical, amoral and underhanded. And they're justified because... well, because they're Teen Models fer cryin out loud."
"Oceans17","8","0","1","7 January 2009"," Stylish ""life experience""
","***Spoilers ahead***<br/><br/>Many people pinpoint plot holes as if they were very smart, or as if the plot holes were very obvious, and I think they don't realize films need not to be taken too literally. In fact, the obviousness itself can be a signal to the clever viewer, telling her/him that she/he is being presented with a metaphor, a narrative license, an excuse to be stylish, or simply a joke. Why are they going always to the same casino? Because it represents all casinos, and Larry Fishburne is a symbol for all security guards: the filmmakers chose an arena for the struggle, and a character to be the antagonist. Why are their gestures so obvious? In the first place because they are being clearly shown... of course, it's a film. And also because Jill is very, very sexy crossing her arms like that (and we also expect some ""glamour"" in a film that happens to happen in Las Vegas). If the director had chosen to tell with painstaking detail all the shifts from one casino to another, from one gesture to another, then instead of plot-hole hunters we would have the other kind of people who always complain about films being confusing. Film narrative should be clear. If your attention span is high, then you can entertain yourself catching the tiny little bits of information that the filmmakers let there for us between one scene and the following. And the board discussion about the first and last scene reminds me a similar one about ""The Bourne ultimatum"". Please! Cinema is a symbolic art. So: those discussions are pointless. Of course they were the same scene, in spite of the obvious differences in clothing, etc., because they were the same at a symbolic level, and that's what counts. The book is just the inspiration for an atmospheric thriller with a sexy bias, which is in fact the kind of film we all love, and ""21"" is a nice, stylish and well conceived one. If you are interested in the mathematics of BlackJack, or want precise instructions to beat a casino, look elsewhere."

He has the right attitude of 'I know it all though I may appear stupid and dumb'.<br/><br/>When you're young, you do stupid things - like taking on a massive gambling organisation in Las Vegas. But one presumes neither the film's director nor the professor-protagonist who trains his students into reckless and criminal gambling are young and stupid.<br/><br/>So what makes the film's sassy premise - gambling your way to doom - such a good idea? There's no tangible explanation why a noble profession like teaching should be turned into a blackjack game. """" is the college-campus version of ""Ocean's 11"". Here, however, the glamour of gambling is much reduced since the protagonists with the cards are confused teenagers who should know better. There's a callow hero and a shallow mentor and the twain never meet as individuals.<br/><br/>The other members of the blackjack team are woefully hazy in their depiction, as though the director didn't want to invest too much time and energy getting into the fringe players' lives.<br/><br/>There are some expertly done shots of the casino's compulsions spilling into colourful chips in a splendid tumble. But that's it. """" is more about the hype and hip than the plot and script. There're no surprises in the way the maths team subverts its art into a Zen of vice.<br/><br/>You really can't like these guys, let alone feel connected with them. Not when the young hero sells out his guru to the casino goons in return for his own freedom. He walks free. So do we. But after two hours of wondering which side we are on."
"johnnycandle","4","0","1","31 July 2008"," What a waste..
","This stands out as an illustration of just how difficult it is to make a good film.<br/><br/>Here we have a talented cast, a superb location and a script based on a successful (and true) story. It should be great, but it isn't even close. Why? Well, there's nothing amazing or even surprising about the central ""scam"" itself. Perhaps it was simplified for the movie, but you certainly do not need to be a maths genius to do what the MIT students do. This of course is fine in itself, but the whole movie is shot as if it's some amazing Oceans 11 style plot complete with slow motion shots of the gang exiting the casino. It just doesn't gel at all with what is a down to earth, old as the hills, easily understood method of increasing your chances of winning at Black Jack.<br/><br/>The biggest problem however, is the characters. The film could have stood the stereotypes of the gamblers gang if the leads were developed (including surprisingly, Spacey), but they're not. Jill (Kate Bosworth) is the romantic interest and starts off as a slightly mysterious seductress that sucks our hero, Ben, into the world of Vegas gambling. However, part way into the movie, she completely changes into Ben's sensible girlfriend, and no longer seems like a person who would even be attracted by the high risks and bright lights of their Vegas plan.<br/><br/>Even that would be OK if our hero kept our interest going, but, after joining up with the team of gamblers, Ben goes from sympathetic nerd to obnoxious tosser. And he stays that way. The ending suggests that we were supposed to like, or at least be impressed by him, but he does nothing whatsoever to encourage that.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a massively disappointing movie."

","I'm not going to pretend that I am some sort of movie professor or something like that, but am I the only one who expects more from movies? I don't understand how this movie has a rating of about 7. Before watching the movie I could have told anyone who would listen the exact plot line up until the last 7-10 minutes of the movie where they finally decide to add a slight twist to the plot. Other then those few minutes this is just your typical Hollywood movie these days with a cookie cutter script. The difference in quality of this movie compared to real movies is just incredible, because everyone who was a part of this movie just decided that they wanted to make some stupid popcorn flick movie for some teens and people who think they can learn to count cards from this movie. Everything about this movie reeks with mediocrity, apart from maybe Kevin Spacey and Laurence Fishbourne who I think play their parts well. This is just another typical movie made in a time when it is better just to pump out crap rather than take a chance and try to make something that 1. makes people think 2. makes people feel something. I hate movies like this but they are becoming more and more common. I mean movies are made to entertain, but seeing the same cookie cutter plot in 50 different movies each year is not entertaining. This movie is not good and its not bad. If I were to make a recommendation I would say not to waste your time watching it, because even if you haven't seen this movie you've seen this plot before."

","Hot off ""Across the Universe"", Jim Sturgess plays another good role in ""21"". He plays an MIT student who joins a special math class: the teacher (Kevin Spacey) uses cards to show them all sorts of tricks, and even takes them to Las Vegas. In the casinos, they use various hand tricks and key words to help each other win money. But all is not what it seems...<br/><br/>It was hard to say what my favorite part was. So much of the movie was so impressive that I had to remember to concentrate on the movie and not get caught up in the math tricks. While it's true that Spacey plays pretty much the same role here that he plays in most of his films, I still recommend the movie. I don't think that I could do it justice by trying to describe it; this is one that you have to see to understand. Also starring Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne."
"paul2001sw-1","4","0","1","23 July 2008"," By the numbers thriller
","There have been many great movies about casinos, but '21' is sadly not one of them. Heavy handed, unsubtle and obvious, it's a film about a maths professor who gathers a team of elite students to pull of a gambling scam. But every point is clumsily made: the hero is a genius who just wants to pay his fees for Harvard Medical School; his friends are geeks but this fellow gamblers are all glamorous; the direction of the plot is highly signalled and even the twists are well-signposted; someone turns out to be utterly (and arguably incoherently) villainous, and so on. What makes this so bad is the fact that the film attempts to disguise its ordinariness behind a veneer of pseudo-cleverness: for example, the hero proves his brilliance to us (and his tutor) by solving a probability problem that is in fact well known outside mathematical circles and which he is posed in the middle of a lecture that is nothing to do with probability theory; while the basics of the scam are laid out on the table for the audience, but it's details remain obscure and unexplained. It's a shame, as if the film didn't labour its points so badly, it could still have been entertaining. As it is, it's by the numbers stuff which, in the words of a line uttered in it by Kevin Spacey's character, won't tell you anything you didn't already know."

","This movie is a great thrill ride. It grabs your interest right from the beginning and really picks up speed once the group gets to Vegas. Even if you don't care much about gambling, this film will grab hold of you and never let go (there are some great plot surprises as well.) The colorful way Vegas is portrayed really makes you want to go there yourself. Of course the acting also deserves lots of praise. There isn't a bad actor in the bunch, but Kevin Spacey really shines. It's a little bit like a more realistic version of Ocean's Eleven - more relevant for the college crowd. I will definitely buy this on DVD when it comes out July 22nd."

"DICK STEEL","7","0","1","29 June 2008"," A Nutshell Review: 21
","While Las Vegas is Sin City personified, having been there in person actually stripped away much of the glitz and glamour that comes courtesy of various movies and television series. Maybe because I'm not a high roller (or even a simple punter to begin with) that I don't get to enjoy the sexiness that comes with attention lavished at their well-known, well-paying customers. But in any case, the mathematics of it is that the house always win, and it is not a zero sum game, always in favour of the house. A bus driver in Vagas once told me that it's simple logic - look at the hotel above the casino. The larger it is, the higher the overheads, and guess where their revenue is coming from? You guessed it.<br/><br/>Based on a true story about a group of MIT students who utilized their smarts from what the textbook never taught them, you can trust Hollywood to sex it all up, especially with a professor in the mould of Kevin Spacey, and teammates who look like they jumped right out of glamour magazines. Being naturally smart and the cream of the crop, they get seduced by Spacey's Professor Micky Rosa, who rationalizes that they aren't cheating, but beating the system on their own numbers game through card counting. That means back to basics probability and statistics, together with some tools of the trade such as disguises, fake IDs and a whole elaborate rouse of communication using secret words and sign language.<br/><br/>And here's the flaw of the movie, perhaps to dumb it down for an audience because it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that signs and codewords should change each time you hit a different casino so that you won't be caught repeating the same trick over and over again to the eyes in the skies, which provided a separate sub plot dealing with the threat of security personnel being outsourced and downsized by technology, and therein making old school folks like Laurence Fishburne's Cole Williams obsolete.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess is slowly getting his profile raised, last seen in these parts with Across the Universe. Here, his Ben Campbell is the A student who's just like every other A student trying their best to get to Harvard Medical School, and that sole scholarship up for grabs will be awarded to just one fella with the most impressive resume. Knowing that his chance is slim, he has to figure out how to cough up US$300K just to get himself into his dream institution, so as the tale would have it, that rationale and figure required became his excuse to take up gambling as a means to his end.<br/><br/>Joined by fellow students Jill (Kate Bosworth), Choi (Aaron Yoo), Kianna (Liza Lapira) and Jimmy (Jacob Pitts) under Prof Mickey's tutelage, they hone their mathematical and social engineering skills in an expected montage, before hitting the gaming floors of Vegas to rake in the dough. And in between they will find time for romance, and constantly battle the urge of easy money, emotions running high, and all the trappings from the lifestyles of the rich. However, don't expect a lot from the supporting characters, as Kate just got to preen around looking like a pretty vase, while the token Asians get caricature roles, like a kleptomaniac.<br/><br/>While Spacey is his usual chilling self and Sturgess managed the pretty boy charismatic presence well, 21 still found it necessary to explain everything, from detailing every bit of plot development including laying out all necessary twists and turns out on the table neatly, and how the mathematical rouse actually worked. However, don't expect to pick up a tip or two from the movie, because it actually requires a step one for you to be a mathematical genius for mental gymnastics to be performed at the top of your head. Otherwise, you can just forget it, and just pick up a lottery ticket and hope for the best.<br/><br/>But what I enjoyed from the movie, is all the wink-winks with regards to the corruption that permeates through the education system, be it getting grades from your tutors, or admissions requiring exorbitant amounts of cash. Granted that the tuition fees are not cheap because of rising salaries and cost of maintaining the school, sometimes these can be contributed in nice ways which are quite above the board, in cases of having to scratch your back and having you scratch mine back.<br/><br/>Still, 21 made for an enjoyable heist/gambling type of movie, sans those comedic ones which HK used to put out continuously at one point in time. It has a decent, Hollywood-hyped up story to tell, with the usual message that crime does not pay, and to use your smarts wisely in the right direction."

","MIT professor Kevin Spacey recruits a whole host of mathematical prodigies (led by the economically-strapped Jim Sturgess and the super-hot Kate Bosworth) to count cards playing Blackjack in fabulous Las Vegas with the opportunity to win hundreds of thousands of dollars. Naturally though cheating casinos out of big bucks is never easy, not even in the cinema as security expert Laurence Fishburne attempts to stop the youngsters from obtaining the riches they desire. Surprisingly well-paced and thought-provoking production which uses its assets well. Spacey and Fishburne are guaranteed performers, while Sturgess seems to be the perfect actor to play the lead, and Bosworth slowly continues to get better with experience and age. An interesting little film which has statistical and mathematical applications aplenty for those of us fascinated by these academic sciences and their roles in potential real-life scenarios. Based loosely on actual events depicted in the novel ""Bringing Down the House."" 4 stars out of 5."

","If you want an evening of light entertainment this would be good bet. There are some huge plot holes and unlikely situations, but it's still fun. And the movie would have fared much better if it had came out a few years ago, since there's a lot in it that we've now seen in the Ocean's 11 movies and the TV series Vegas. However I still enjoyed it. Laurence Fishburne is great and provided gravity and genuine menace.<br/><br/>I admit I was frustrated at times by not understanding some of the characters actions. As an example, the main character, Ben, was hiding his winnings, hundreds of thousands of dollars, in the ceiling of his dorm room! Why? Forget the stupidity of it, I just didn't understand why he couldn't put it in the bank. They weren't doing anything illegal, so I didn't get that at all!<br/><br/>But if you can turn your brain off, you'll likely enjoy the fun!"

","'m not really a fan of the game Blackjack or any of those card games (with the exception of poker) so I had some problems going into this film. Will I understand the film with all the Blackjack thing going on? Add to that the card counting and stuff? Well, it turns out it wasn't a problem after all. They somehow managed to explain the card counting bit but no worries because you can still understand the film even if you don't know Blackjack.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess, an up and coming young star, stars as MIT student Ben Campbell. He is persuaded by his teacher Micky Rosa (Spacey) to join a team of card-counting MIT misfits so he can pay off his Harvard Med plans. Kate Bosworth and Laurence Fishburne co-stars.<br/><br/>The script, directing, acting, cinematography, editing, the casino scenes, the laugh-out-loud scenes, the Kevin Spacey scenes: its all good. Laurence Fishburne as an old-school Vegas thug was so badass, he will go down in the ""2008's Badass in Films"" list."

","Seriously enjoyed this film. Having seen the documentary regarding the MIT students who used their exceptional mathematics skills to card count in Vegas, I was interested to see what Hollywood did to it. 'Hollywood it' they certainly did - predictably the characters are all beautiful,there is a love affair that was not part of the original story and a revenge/power struggle that I do not believe was true to life.However,spurious as it is in parts and despite it's glitzy dressing, it holdsattention, is fantastically acted and beautifully shot. All in all a great film. In my opinion it still doesn't beat Casino's exceptional cinematography, but it is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Watch this film."

It was not too slow- moving, and the twist at the end was particularly clever. The lead actor and the supporting cast are really good and hold the film together effectively. What I especially liked about it was the fact that it kept you interested throughout, as well as not having too much of a complicated plot. Additionally,the film really makes you think, instead of solely consisting of a narrative and plot. I would recommend this film to both males and females alike,as it would definitely appeal to both and is certainly worth seeing."

","21 tells the story of several students from MIT who go to Vegas and make a killing through counting cards which is legal. Anybody who is strapped for cash and is a bit of a wheeler-dealer should check this movie out. Right from the start 21 wastes no time with getting straight into the action , it sets the scene in a great way which makes you really feel for main characters and their reasons for doing this. The laughs were plenty and the movie rolled enough at a fast enough pace for you to catch up on everything. My only problem was that it felt like a typical Hollywood movie put together with glitz and light and had a typical formula ending but having said that it made up for it with its high on entertainment value. Another thing which I find a little offensive to a degree was that the real MIT was actually a group of Asian students and really made me wonder how actuate the story truly was although it was inspired by true events. To conclude 21 , was a highly entertaining flick which gave us a brief insight into how to the game of cards and also told a highly entertaining story , defiantly worth checking out.<br/><br/>21 - 8.3 OUT OF 10<br/><br/>WINNER WINNER..CHICKEN DINNER !!"
"Ozzy2000","9","0","2","18 May 2008"," Unreal but entertaining.
","Having been to Las Vegas and also loving table games I found the film entertaining and mildly nostalgic even though my trip was only a couple of years ago.<br/><br/>The film is very loosely based on a bunch of MIT students who used card counting rather laboriously to win around $60,000 each with a couple of exceptions over a long period in various Casinos around the USA. They were eventually banned from casinos and could have legally challenged the casinos for their rights to play there but instead pursued their studies and careers.<br/><br/>The film however takes us on a silly fantasy tour in which the players win extraordinary amounts and being caught means a violent exit from the casinos. The film is not only unrealistic but totally misleading. It was up to about a decade ago that some casinos used a three deck shoe for Black Jack but now as with Australia there are five deck shoes which makes card counting almost impossible as well as automatic shufflers which totally make it card counting useless.<br/><br/>Kevin Spacey again performs well as the lecturer who runs the team of recruited card counters. The idea that you have to be some sort of genius or A grade grad student is a fallacy you just need to highly motivated well trained and have a reasonable memory and several months experience at Black Jack.<br/><br/>The other ridiculous aspect of the film is that if you wanted to play really big and win big in a few sessions at any of the major casinos you could go to the high roller or premium rooms. Another strange thing about the film is that they are supposed to be playing at various casinos and the Casino Investigator who is tracking them Cole Williams ( Laurence Fishburne) appears to work at all the casinos at the same time which is really silly.<br/><br/>I guess most people not only miss my observations but wouldn't really care and just enjoy the action and bright lights of Vegas and above all the fantasy.<br/><br/>So for fantasy and entertainment I give the film three stars."

But Young Folks by Peter, Bjorn and John, You Can't Always Get What You Want by The Rolling Stones (Re-Mixed), and L.S.F. (Lost Souls Forever) by Mark Ronson featuring Kasabian definitely add to the overall appeal of 21, along with other amazing tracks.<br/><br/>Jim Sturgess (Across the Universe) is terrific as MIT geek Ben Campbell desperate for a Harvard Med scholarship. He gets chosen to join the underground elite team of blackjack-playing smarties after impressing his non-linear equations prof Micky Rosa (Kevin Spacey). Beauty and brains Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth) can't help but fall for Ben, who is not only achingly cute, but can also impressively do the math. Trouble ensues when casino consultant Cole Williams (Laurence Fishburne) gets suspicious.<br/><br/>Directed by Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde), 21 is said to deviate a lot from the book Bringing Down the House on which it is based, but effectively tells a proper story nonetheless. Aside from another white guy, the rest of the crew is Asian American (Korean and Filipino). However, the real Ben Campbell is Jeffrey Ma (who has a bit part as Planet Hollywood Dealer Jeff), and the rest of the real characters are mostly of Asian descent, too. But this is still a Hollywood flick, after all, so this product must be sold in the way producers (which includes Spacey) see fit."
