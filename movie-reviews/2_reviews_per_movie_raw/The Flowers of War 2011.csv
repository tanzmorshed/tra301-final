"sonia-0111","10","350","394","20 December 2011"," Good Movie is Like a Mirror
","I watched the movie in Beijing, twice. The second time I liked it more. This has to be one of the best Chinese films yet, if not the best. Some scenes are pretty brutal, but really worth watching, to say the least. <br/><br/>The director Zhang YiMou told a powerful, touching and beautiful story, while delivering stunning visual effects as always. All actors from different countries did an amazing job in making so many strong characters in 3 languages, not just the American 'priest', but also those prostitutes, the boy George, all the children, Japanese officers, and the Chinese 'traitor'. <br/><br/>Good movie is like a mirror, some people might get upset watching it, while others see love for others, respect for life, and the human spirit of fighting for peace out of tragedy. Each audience's reaction more or less reflects his/her personal value. The storytelling is objective so you can judge for yourself. In front of a masterpiece like this, people who ranked it very low deliberately because of stereotypes against China or whatever twisted reason (I KNOW YOU EXSIT ON THIS SITE), you need to sit down and think what's wrong with yourself, no matter how open-minded you claim you are. <br/><br/>Some say it is a propaganda production. I have to disagree here. Almost everything in this movie is based on real history, including how Japanese tortured Chinese war victims, how prostitutes stood up to protect other women during the Rape of NanJing, as well as how some westerners resided in China at the time helped local Chinese. Anyone who can pick up a few books or do a bit of research on internet knows it. <br/><br/>English is not my mother language so I can't write an review with big words like those professional critics do. However, this is the first time I feel so moved by a movie that I'd write an English review online to recommend it to viewers outside of China. Simply too good to miss. <br/><br/>If any Chinese simply walked out of the cinema cursing Japanese, I'd say the movie failed big time. However, both times I saw people left quietly, some still sobbing, and heard them saying how lucky they are to be born in this era and how precious peace is. For that reason, I applaud this film. <br/><br/>It is what it is. Horrible things happened in history. Hate and anger won't do any good today. Make peace with yourself and move on. Just like what George said in the movie, life is precious, it is not ours to throw away."
"gjqxe","10","302","354","19 December 2011"," a movie definitely worth seeing
","Honestly,I am not the kind of people easily being touched so deeply as to cry, and I didn't cry much during the movie indeed. I just walked out the movie theater,took a bus,got off the bus,bought a piece of bread, walked home while eating the bread,then all of sudden burst into tears.<br/><br/>Till now I still haven't walked out of it. There is so much to say, yet you don't know what to say nor how to say it. My only advice: you walk into the movie theater, forget whatever people said on the Internet, and just watch it with your own heart.<br/><br/>It is a great movie."
"dodo-bratz","9","39","43","16 January 2012"," The Best of 2011
","I thought The Flowers of War was one of the best foreign films I have ever seen. Ignore all bad reviews, movies are not suppose to be perfect, there was a point of view, a story and a plot that were all displayed understandably. I have read a few reviews on this film and I have noticed most people saying ''Its too graphic'', it is a war film and the graphic effect was a great way of showing the audience the true form of war and the violence the soldiers/people experienced.<br/><br/>The cast was wonderful, I was amazed by the outstanding performance of the young Chinese actresses, I had goosebumps when they started crying or displaying any form of drama. Christian Bale was wonderful, I have always loved his acting and I still do, he portrayed John Miller's character the way I imagined it. He was capable of making me believe that he was an American without any doubt. Ni Ni (Yu Mo) was an amazing character and actress, I have knowledge that it is her first picture and she had shown amazing talent along with all the other Chinese actresses.<br/><br/>Over all I suggest you should watch the film, it is great and inspirational and extremely entertaining to watch."
"kahtreenah","10","65","75","17 January 2012"," A glimpse of WWII in China through one fallen city, Nanking
","Please watch this movie to get a glimpse of what it was like during World War II in China. My grandparents were in a different part of China that also got occupied where similar tragedies occurred. Though much much worse. Babies would be thrown in the air and caught on the bayonets as a game. There were killing games. My grandma can never tell her story without crying. The Japanese government deny this ever happened, they never apologized, and payed for their war crimes. They do not even have it written in their history books. All my grandparents want is for their story to be recognized as well as a formal apology. Thanks for reading."
"msmith5484","9","123","147","21 December 2011"," Don't miss. This deserves your attention.
","Zhang Yimou has crafted a beautifully shot and compelling story set inside horrific events. About all I knew of this movie was it was set in 1937 China and starred Christian Bale. Not knowing much allowed me to be completely open to the journey of the characters. This is an emotionally powerful story about people caught in circumstances for which there seems no hope of survival. The Japanese soldiers are shown as barbaric, but we do meet an officer who attempts to remain honorable though he must do his duty to his superiors. The violence in the movie is brutal, but not graphic or gratuitous. The choices and sacrifices made by the characters never seemed contrived. The arc of Christian Bale's character may seem 'predictable', but it is never false or 'convenient' to the story. All actors are excellent. Because they're foreign to me I had no idea who they are or their other work. At the screening I attended we were introduced to Ni Ni, who said this was her first film. She is both beautiful and compelling. I wish her a long career. Yimou, through his daughter, told us about his journey to make this movie - based on a novel, based on real events. He has told an amazing story that will stay with me for a long time."
"feiben","10","152","186","20 December 2011"," Great movie, highly recommended
","It's a great movie, very touching. The background is Nanking Massacre, at that cruel and desperate history moment, the director finds a special perspective to show us goodness, hope, sacrifice and humanity. Although I've seen so many war movies before, this one is different. I could not help crying through the whole movie, even I told myself ""This is just another war movie, you should control your tears"" But the movie has nothing to do with intendedly giving audience slushy emotional scenes. Even at some dark and sad moments, there is no background music.<br/><br/>All the actors and actresses give a stellar performance. Good story, good acting, beautiful scene. My teacher once said ""Audience never cry for tragedy，but they will cry for good things.""<br/><br/>Anyway, it's a powerful movie, highly recommended. <br/><br/>PS: All the victims in Nanking Massacre deserve a serious apology from Japanese."
"pinopino","8","84","101","19 December 2011"," It is a touching movie
","I am about 40 and have been watching movies for 25 years. I must say I am no a professional except knowing what movie moves me keeply. This movie comes from a huge and heavy background. My history teacher cried sadly when she gave me the class about the darkest time in Chinese Modern history. For those who give cold comments about the movie, I confessed I tried hard to hold my tears next to my wife in the movie theatre.<br/><br/>But the moment ""little George"" said: ""there is no other way!"" My salty tears kept rolling out! I hope people respect those victims and stopped saying this piece of history does not exist. There were brave American medicals and priests who risked their lives at that time to keep journals and photo about the crimes.<br/><br/>Apart from prejudice, I consider that this movie is very controlled in a lot of ways. For many educated Chinese, we all read a lot of documents/short films and photo that were amazingly made by the Japanese soldiers themselves for showing off and promoting a sense of fears at that time. <br/><br/>I am glad such scene is made in a very controlled yet enlighting manner. For a Chinese viewer, the burden to watch this movie is extremely heavy, especially before X'mas. <br/><br/>I am glad this story is told in a small angle that reflects part of the whole picture. Apart from the history, it is a good film. Those characters are not as complex as the original novel. But as a whole it shows how a normal/powerless person could choose to do in one of the worst moments in modern history. No one is born hero. In war time,life may not worth more than a bullet, regardless which social class one is in. This movie tells a good story and I appreciate the making of such a touching film. One buddhish came to my mind: ""a split of thoughts determine heaven or hell. "" I would give a 8 because the film is solid and touching. However, it certainly is not an entertaining film for X'mas! I also appreciate those Japanese actors in the film. I knew from TV that they returned to the film making without delay after taking care of their families in earthquake!"
"iris-bee-81","8","104","129","18 December 2011"," Zhang's best work In 10 years
","Someone wrote and I quote : ""there was never a moment of this movie that will bring tears in someone's eyes"". Whomever wrote this is not Chinese for sure! I started crying right after 15 minutes in the cinema .This whole movie's dialog is in Nan Jing Hua (local accent mandarin ). Sounds funny at beginning , but it's more easy to bring audience into the story with characters . Zhangyimou's movie are famous for bright colors and nice view since he use to be cameraman. But this movie is so much more than the visual! Color still pretty though, the paper shop, those QiPao, girls make-up , everything is pretty . I guess to ruin the beautiful things defines the tragedy. My friend who watched it before told me do not watched it in the morning , because it will upset you whole day. So I went to cinema in the afternoon, and I could sleep until 5 am this morning. Comparing to Zhang Yi Mou's earlier work like "" hero"", this is definitely his best work in 10years!"
"tom-240-475761","9","156","210","16 December 2011"," Where does the comedy stop and the drama begin?
","Watched this movie last night in a packed Beijing cinema on its opening night. First off, I would like to say that Christian Bale traces perfectly the path of enlightenment that follows Wild-West style bandit obsessed with money becoming priest and father-figure in all but religious training. The film is in roughly 50% English, 35% Chinese and 15% Japanese, so there is a real assimilation of different languages and cultures coming together. However, this unfortunately leads to some moments which seem disconcertingly humorous. For example, there is one point where a Japanese general confesses to priest-figure Bale that he likes music; the triviality of such statement in the midst of mass-murder seems absurd enough, but it is also delivered in a dead-pan way with broken English. I could not help but burst out laughing, even though none of the Chinese in the cinema saw any form of humour in it. Indeed, I think that as a Westerner watching this film, my emotional response is not as visceral as it would be to a Chinese person. That is only natural, but it leads to a completely different interpretation of the movie. Some of the murder scenes are brutally horrific to a Chinese person, so much so that the wonderful filmography which permeates throughout the movie may not be fully appreciated. The hues are brown and green, earthy, rugged and militaristic for the most part. Yet there are occasionally beautiful trims of colour, the church's stained-glass window, the clothes on the washing line left out to dry. A sign, no doubt, of the beauty of humanity in the midst of dreadful war. It has been suggested this movie is propaganda. I don't know if I entirely agree with that. There is no positive way to spin what was a shameful event in Japan's history, and for what it's worth I think that Zhang Yimou delineates well the soldiers occasional insecurity, homesickness, and humanisation brought on by paranoia and pressure from above. A movie well-worth watching, and which I would like to watch for a second time to re- establish which moment are intentionally humorous, which moments are unintentionally humorous, and which moments are tragic. Kudos for Zhang Yimou for tackling such a visited topic (That of the Nanjing massacre) which a freshness, and even more kudos to Christian Bale for stepping up to the plate and giving in a great performance."

","I loved it, adored it.. too bad this movie was not well publicized but still Zhang Yimou could never go wrong, I have seen all his movies and keeps amazing us one after another. Every single cast is brilliant, the story, the plot and definitely a great choice for Christian Bale, you can laugh and cry at the same time and connect with every single person. This movie touched me a lot and it has been a long time we haven't seen such great movies, if you are expecting martial arts coming from Zhang Yimou well you will be disappointed but once the movie starts you can't take your eyes out of it.. I would rate 20 if there was .. you should go see this movie .. my favorite of 2011"
"akira-hideyo","10","71","93","31 December 2011"," Extremely Affecting !
","This is like the Asian Holocaust under the evils of the Japanese during the Sino-Jap war. It will grip your heart, makes it ache and will show you why monstrosity knows no limits when certain elitist races or people (hello Hitler Germany) think they are above mankind. The more shocking and repulsive aspect is, till today, the Jap government has denied the atrocities committed in Nanking and attempted several times to rewrite their school history text books; failing only due to the constant protest of the Chinese government and the integrity of its own purist historians.<br/><br/>An amazing movie with a brilliant Chinese cast, under the usual exceptional insightful direction of Zhang Yimou. The acting is so genuine that it's not possible not to be greatly affected by his powerful epic, unless you're a zombie. Then consider that it will be haunting too. Be warned!"
"shang_libin","8","78","105","18 December 2011"," best Zhang Yimou film in the past several years
","Watched ""The flowers of war"" on Dec 19, 2011, the 2nd day this film was released in mainland China. The movie theater is fully packed. This is the best film directed by Zhang Yimou after ""Hero"" in 2002. This is not a surprise because in my opinion all his films after ""Hero"" have very awful/terrible screen scripts, while this one is based on a well composed novel. The story is about how a dozen of prostitutes saved girl students from uncivilized Japanese soldiers during the Nanjing(Nanking) massacre period (starting from Dec. 13, 1937, lasted for two weeks, 300,000 murdered, 80,000 raped). To Chinese, this is the saddest and most humiliated moment in the 20th century. The script is not based on true stories, painfully the true stories are much worse, because there wasn't a savior, there's only constant desperation. The characters themselves are well described. The logic flow and mentality transition in this film are not delineated very well. I still gave it 8 out 10 because I think it's due to the limitation of the film's length. As always, Mr. Bale is good at acting in this film, but definitely not his best character such as those in ""American Psycho"" or ""The Prestige"". The two leading actresses are both new face. They'll become very famous in China after this film, but I don't think their performances are as impressive as Gong Li, who collaborated with Zhang Yimou in many of his early works. Last but not the least, there is a 1-minute romance scene which I think is the worst part in this film, because under such a tragic circumstance it's very unnatural to practice love, and it dampens the character build-up in many ways."
"MalcolmJTaylor","8","26","32","28 February 2012"," A film of exquisite beauty
","Exquisite. Easily one of the most beautiful films ever made.<br/><br/>Moving, riveting, poetic, visually stunning, and dramatically gut wrenching.<br/><br/>Absolutely everything you could ever want a movie to be.<br/><br/>Poignant, poetic, full of beauty and life.<br/><br/>Not without moments of sentimentality, perhaps even, briefly, bordering on the saccharine. Still only those hardest of heart would be unmoved by this visual and emotional banquet.<br/><br/>If you are not moved by this film. You quite possibly may not be human.<br/><br/>An incredible mix of beauty and tension. Eye-dropping cinematography, heart pounding action. Yet full of life, humour and folly. Plays directly to your heart strings and plucks every chord with virtuosity.<br/><br/>In a just world this kind of film would be breaking box office records. But alas we prefer on mass to fix our eyes of adolescent spectacle. Consider how big the box office returns will be when Bale dons a bat suit this summer.<br/><br/>It's funny how a human interest story recreating events in history can be of so little interest to so many humans, the very ones who create history. It seems we would much rather gaze in wonder at our fantasies than contemplate our actions.<br/><br/>I urge anyone who loves cinema to see this film. It is a work of masterful craftsmanship."
"Cortland259","10","63","88","5 January 2012"," A Great Movie
","It's a tearful experience. So 1937 was such a terror in that Eastern city, the capital of the Asian country. Lives were being destroyed and bodies piled high everywhere. People were in hiding from the Japanese soldiers and here were two groups of people, a group of school girls and a group of prostitutes, vying for a safe hiding place, when they were found by the Japanese invaders, it's death that awaits them... <br/><br/>One wonders why they had to do this? Why? --because there was a war! Then why did Japan start the war? For what? This film made me think. It's obvious starting war is a shortcut to the destruction of humanity. The Japanese government has been denying there were 300,000 people killed during the Nanking massacre (well , they are not alone, similarly there are also those of holocaust denial). With that as a contemporary reality, it is a right thing to do to be reminded of this event with movies like this one, the Flowers of War, so that we could do all we can to prevent another war from coming."

"3xHCCH","8","14","17","12 January 2012"," Heroism Borne Out of Brutality
","I am not really familiar with the details of the Rape of Nanking in the late 1930s. However, people from this side of the globe are very familiar with the suffering brought about by the brutal Japanese Imperial Army throughout Asia. In our country, many movies have shown Japanese brutality during the World War II. I thought I would be ready for this movie.<br/><br/>""The Flowers of War"" tells the story of a roguish American mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) who was sent to a Catholic church/convent in Nanking to prepare the body of the priest for burial, who was then under siege by the Japanese. When he gets there, he found he also needed to take care of a group of convent girls led by the spirited Shu, a young caretaker boy George, and later, a gaggle of exotic prostitutes led by the classy beauty Yu Mo (Ni Ni). Everyone will go through a touching life-changing story arc that will show how even the most unlikely of people can become heroes in extreme adversity.<br/><br/>Director Zhang Jimou returns to form in this movie. He was relentless in the first half we are taken through a continuous barbaric carnage perpetrated by the Japanese soldiers. These parts are reminiscent of the frankly violent blood-spurting ""Saving Private Ryan"" beach scene. The terror is very palpable. While the scenes of soldiers being shot and killed were hard to watch, the several minutes of violence to children was even harder to bear! <br/><br/>The second half is more dramatic with a some contrived cheesy moments. The character of the kind-hearted Japanese officer Hasegawa was a nice counter-balance to their other heinous acts of atrocity. I also felt the long sequence when a couple of prostitutes sneaking out to retrieve trivial things in their brothel was a rather unnecessary long detour. There will even be a scene that will remind you of Gwyneth Paltrow's body wrap scene in ""Shakespeare in Love."" However, when the film reaches its climax, everything falls back into place and the noble message is delivered on point. This movie may be difficult to watch because of the scenes of violence, but this is worth watching because the story of heroism and redemption was very good, well-told and well-executed."

"lee_eisenberg","8","10","12","12 August 2012"," Christian Bale in Japanese-occupied China again
","I don't know whether or not you've heard about the Rape of Nanking, but everyone should know about it. Having captured the Chinese city, Japanese forces committed a near genocide against the population and devastated the city. Zhang Yimou's ""Jīnlíng Shísān Chāi"" (""The Flowers of War"" in English) focuses on a Nanking church where an American (Christian Bale) takes up residence and then must protect the inhabitants from the occupying forces. The inhabitants are the schoolgirls, and also a group of prostitutes. Eventually, everyone faces a moral dilemma.<br/><br/>There are some very ugly scenes of the occupation. The Japanese occupation of China and Korea has never gotten the attention that the Nazi occupation of Europe has, but it was equally brutal (as was the Italian occupation of Ethiopia). The main focus here is on the events inside the church, but there is ample focus on the atrocities committed by the Japanese. The movie does a very good job in every way. It is always important to tell these stories so that they never happen again. I very much recommend the movie.<br/><br/>PS: Bale had previously starred in Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"", about a boy who gets separated from his parents in Japanese-occupied China. I also recommend that one."

","A visually stunning war epic from Chinese director Yimou Zhang, this film tackles the infamous rape of Nanking by the Japanese in 1937. Christian Bale is a mortician who arrives in the besieged city at the height of the battle; his mission is to bury the newly deceased Father Ingleman. He ends up taking shelter in a Catholic Church, which is a neutral zone during the war. A group of schoolgirls is already living there. Within a short period of time, several prostitutes arrive at the church to hide from the rampaging soldiers.<br/><br/>Bale is great in the lead, as always, as commanding a presence as any actor working today and his female counterpart, newcomer Ni Ni, is someone to watch out for, she is beautiful and has a star quality that is undeniable.

"dgg321982","9","17","23","3 January 2012"," Go see it
","I am a Chinese. But I have to admit that I am neither a big fan of Zhang nor of the Chinese cinematography. Except for few excellent works, I found the recent Chinese film industry willingly or unwillingly distances itself from the audience, by making Hollywood-style, big budget, all-star cast, but empty-content and cliché-plot movies. Where are the Chinese movie makers' ideas? Why did they give up finding stories in Chinese history and instead they chase some intangible sci-fis to burn some money? Nan Jing is always a sad place to visit and its history during the sino-jp war is forever a scar in the Chinese. For Jp, an industrialized great power that even beat Russia once, must realize that a fast complete annexation of China is nearly impossible, the huge resistance and a large area of territory that China possessed was way out of Jp capacity. The astronomical Chinese manpower would outrun every Jp technological advantage and eventually turn the table. So the Jp did one thing they could think of - instill fear and horror in the Chinese and wear their resistance down. War crimes - killing, looting and raping could do that and the Jp wanted double of it to get the effect. It is imaginable that the Jp army on one hand would officially blame such behaviors (because of their culture of being respectful and polite) and on the other hand closed one eye for them, perhaps even promoted and encouraged them.<br/><br/>That was Jp. Chinese, they were victims. Period.<br/><br/>An American in China at that time kind of enjoyed immunity from the brutality and had a neutral status.<br/><br/>So these summarized the positions of all people in the film. I can speak for myself, even though I tried to contain my reaction during the viewing I still have been hit head-on by the emotion. It is Chinese Schindler's list. In this case however, those women were more the ""Schindlers"" than Bale's John don't you think, although John also did a great humanitarian deed.<br/><br/>Pros of the film. I think first is the story itself. A moving story of those women and girls, a realistic account of the jp war crime and a faithful reflection of the fear during the war. True, some of the elements in the plot are predictable, but not the ending of it. At the end of the day, this work is a movie, and a movie needs something unpredictable out of cliché or Hollywood.<br/><br/>Also, the structure of the film is very ideal. Enough time is given to elaborate on the sub-stories, although in my opinion, the ending bit can still be more elaborate.<br/><br/>The characters are also very ""human"". They were quite free of the stereotype Chinese film mindset here, which I think is the second good thing about this film. To name two things about that ""free of stereotype"", they showed self-preservation, the girls, the women, Mr Meng and more importantly, John all have it. You know, self-preservation is generally considered as selfishness and one of the personality weakness according to the modern Chinese ideology, which promote the collective greater good is above individual well-being. Being self-preserved at that time is frequently associated with being traitor. And you can expect, self-preservation is rarely seen in Chinese films about sino-jp war. That, in my opinion, is one of the distances I mentioned earlier that the Chinese movie makers created in their ""patriotically educational"" movies. That is simply not very ""human"". But I can find it here and that adds up to the credibility of the account.<br/><br/>The second one was the women group itself. They are, because of their profession, always depicted as no soul, no feeling, full of vanity and selfish in Chinese culture, and more, they were non-political. This story also quoted one of the mostly quoted Chinese poems in the end to remind us of that last point. The catch of this film is to challenge that opinion. Like in the La Dame aux camélias, they have emotions, human feelings like you and me, ""they love and hate"". It is overkill to discuss whether they should be patriotic and do something about the war. Simply being themselves (OK, in the film, acting like ones), they can convince the rest of us already.<br/><br/>Second, the acting. Christian Bale, in my opinion, is getting better and better since his Batman the Legend begins. True, Liam Neeson is still THE Schindler. But Bale has his shot. John's submission in front of the Jp is very well portrayed by Bale's hard but meanwhile sad face. And Bale also has the eyes to tell those stories when he tried to cover up those women's imminent ""going to hell"" event before the girls. In comparison to the similar looking Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who also associates himself with sino-culture, I think I prefer Bale's a little darker and sadder presence.<br/><br/>The women, they deserved three hurra both for their characters and for their acting. A piece of information, the Chinese generally considers women from the vicinity of Shanghai are ""mean"". I am not saying this is true, but it adds to their characters when I looked at them. They were really mean sometimes weren't they? If you think so too, you should realize what these 12 actress have done to you : ) <br/><br/>OK, some minor cons. Yes, the girls and women played their parts well when the horror kicks in. But remember those scenes from Schindler's list? The trembling teeth of the Jewish youth, the little girl in the s* hole, those widely open eyes in the shower room. Few can convey fear in films like Spielberg. Zhang here is on the right track in the right direction, but not yet close.<br/><br/>Also, the young actors and actresses are promising, but still have room to perfect their skill. The depiction of fear, again, still showed some artificiality.<br/><br/>Go see it!"

","The Flowers of War is a gritty and well-made film with a story set in a ""protected area"" of Nanking during the worst atrocity to occur anywhere in the Pacific war. <br/><br/>With sensitivity to a squeamish audience used to the fake horror of B movies, you'll see the slaughter of many unarmed civilians and the very brutal rape of the schoolgirls hiding in the Safety Zone but broken into anyway by Japanese soldiers. You'll see gang rapes followed by the immediate and pointless murder of the victims. You will see a supposedly ""nice"" Japanese officer who loves music et cetera but will later enslave all 13 schoolgirls for gang rape at a Japanese celebration.<br/><br/>What you will NOT see is the true depiction of the horrors inflicted on the civilians of Nanking by the Japanese. No depiction of pregnant girls being raped then cut open and having the fetus stabbed, no rapes of little children, cut open if that was necessary to effect the rape. No, it's all cleaned up, or nobody would watch it. (Will this account even survive the IMDb review?)<br/><br/>Witnesses to the Rape of Nanking are/were numerous and diverse. Lots of foreign nationals witnessed the crimes. There is even actual movies taken of the crimes -- at the time they were happening.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not anti-Japanese. World War II was a long time ago and the leadership of Douglas NacArthur following the war changed the Japanese forever. I've visited Japan as a tourist and purchased five Japanese cars. But history is history. The Flowers of War is well worth your time; but keep in mind this is the cleaned-up version of true and prolonged horror."
"phd_travel","10","9","11","3 April 2012"," Unforgettable and unexpected story - a must watch
","A lot of things about this movie are quite different from what I expected.<br/><br/>First of all it isn't a docu-drama with too many characters that squeezes every incident about the atrocity into a few hours. Instead it is actually an intimate story about relatively few people which makes a more effective if less informative movie than some of the recent grand productions from China.<br/><br/>Secondly it isn't graphically violent. There are battles, shootings and rape but it doesn't have Saving Private Ryan type close ups. It would be too depressing and morbid if it had.<br/><br/>Thridly, a good portion of it is in English and the subtitles are clear so it's suitable for an international audience.<br/><br/>Fourthly, this movie is actually driven by an unexpectedly fascinating and bizarre story. It is about an American mortician (Bale), a group of convent girls and a group of prostitutes all hiding in a church in the middle of war torn Nanking during the Massacre. Some parts of the plot have fantasy elements eg the part where 1 Chinese soldier fights a whole group of Japanese soldiers/rapists. Brought to mind Inglorious Basterds. There are some very tense and scary moments like the first invasion of the Japanese into the Cathedral and the 2 prostitutes in the city later on. The romance isn't a big part. There are some lighter moments of humor eg the makeover which is kind of astonishing. There are some touching and not over sentimental moments. The horror of the Massacre is shown but in a more intimate scale.<br/><br/>Christian Bale does an earnest interpretation even though he has some silly parts in the beginning. Actress Ni Ni is quite beguiling as a courtesan with a heart of gold. Their relationship is a bit clichéd with a white man and a Chinese prostitute.<br/><br/>The sets and productions are top notch and have an authentic and well photographed feel and look.<br/><br/>Overall this movie is far more watchable and uniquely fascinating than expected. Don't miss it."

"swz2002","9","16","23","2 January 2012"," A Beautiful Albeit Light Portrayal of The Most Brutal Atrocity in WWII
","Zhang YiMou, through The Flowers of War, made more people aware of a shameful moment in our history. I am surprised at how a gruesome subject was done so beautifully. If anything, Zhang's movie respected well-documented historical facts. But I agree with New York Times critic Mike Hale that Zhang danced around too light, somewhat trivializing the actual gruesomeness. Perhaps Zhang is taking into consideration that average movie goers unfamiliar with that part of history may be too disturbed by the actual level of brutality far worse than what's portrayed in the movie. His worries seem well justified as a good segment of the audience thought even Zhang's light-touched portrayal was too gruesome to be real, therefore a piece of propaganda.<br/><br/>Some people went as far as quoting very low post-massacre rape pregnancy/birth rate (vs. Nazi data) as evidence that the Rape of Nanking didn't happen, oblivious of the fact that the civilian population of Nanking was WIPED out by the Japanese. The women who were raped were then killed, with very few lucky exceptions. Dead women can't confirm pregnancy or give birth. The low post-rape birth number shows the Japanese brutality well-surpassed Nazi's.<br/><br/>Even as the Japanese WWII veterans went to Nanking to kneel in public for days, repenting for atrocities committed, there are plenty outsiders who simply want or need to deny Nanking Massacre despite clear historical evidence. The Japanese government went as far as rewriting/white-wash WWII history with regard to its brutal invasion and occupation of Asian nations. <br/><br/>If German government acted anything like the Japanese in denying history, then the Holocaust NEVER happened. <br/><br/>If you dislike China, its communist government, or this movie, if you simply love Japan, that's all fine. But please have the decency to respect facts and history. For making a part of history come to our awareness in such an artistic way, I applaud Zhang YiMou."
"sundar_p","10","8","10","8 August 2012"," A story about the enduring nature of the human spirit!
","Director Yimou Zhang scores a perfect 10! For someone who is known for the action- choreography in his movies (such as ""Hero"" and ""House of Flying Daggers""), Zhang keeps the viewer riveted to the seat through the first 30 minutes or so when Japanese forces run through Chinese the city of Nanking, unleashing mayhem and violence.<br/><br/>The framing and editing work in tandem to create stunning visuals that convey both the widespread destruction due to the heavy artillery, as well as the intense pain and angst of those hit. I could not help but get reminded of movies like Full Metal Jacket (1987), Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line (1998).<br/><br/>The scene where young Chinese soldiers run in an ""in-line"" formation towards an advancing Japanese tank, with the hope that the last man in the formation, who is a human-bomb, will get close enough to the tank and immobilize it, is outstanding. This perhaps captures the essence of the story - which is displayed through out the movie by many of its characters - the enduring nature of the human spirit. The lone surviving Chinese soldier forsaking the safety offered by a convent of nuns and going back to take on the well-armed invaders; the decision of the prostitutes to stand-in for the young and adolescent nuns who are called into the Japanese garrison for a ""performance"" at a celebration party and the young errand-boy at the nunnery making the choice to step in as a substitute to make up for the count for the choir are some great moments.<br/><br/>Zhang gets Christian Bale to show his slow but complete transformation from being a drunken mortician with hedonistic leanings to a determined man who sees the protection of the innocent victims (nuns, prostitutes and the young boy) as his calling.<br/><br/>The violence and gore notwithstanding, this movie is one emotional roller-coaster that is sure to make you take a pause and think about the casualties of war and the power of keeping up hope when in despair."
"sinatrakennedy","9","8","10","11 July 2012"," Not easy to stomach but a must see
","One of my favorite directors does it again... He creates an emotional roller-coaster that leaves you in shambles when it's over. Beautifully horrific. <br/><br/>I want to point out a very interesting thing and the reason I'm writing these comments. I just read Roger Eberts review and I must say that it offended me. Mr. Ebert used to be the the very best at what he did. The one to go to for determining if you did or didn't want to see a movie. I respected his opinions. Yet... Recently, he's lost it. Yes he's been through a lot with his current health and I wish him all the best with this. Regardless, his perception of film has obviously slipped away. Firstly, for this film he missed the fact that Christian Bales character is NOT a priest. He is a MORTICIAN. This is IMPORTANT! A mortician and a man of god are two totally different things and this is critical in understanding the path his character takes (spiritually). He also mentions over and over that a ""westerner"" is wasted on the story and that a Chinese priest would have been more appropriate. DID HE WATCH THE MOVIE??? It's the fact that he's a westerner that keeps the Japanese from killing him in the very beginning! If he were Chinese, he would be the ENEMY! Just like the previous priest. <br/><br/>I'm done preaching from my soap box. Forgive me, but when critics are hard on movies and miss the boat, it frustrates me. <br/><br/>This is a truly disturbing film and at the same time, it's beautiful. Give it a chance, and trust the storyteller. Your in good hands."
"moviexclusive","8","6","7","28 March 2012"," Quietly stirring and immensely poignant drama of unlikely heroism and self-sacrificial love
","Because foreign commentators have not accorded the appropriate significance to the subject of the Japanese occupation of Nanking, there is a certain amount of righteous indignation whenever it is raised amongst the Chinese, whose ancestors had suffered at the hands of the Nippon invaders way back in 1937. <br/><br/>It is therefore quite impossible to expect objectivity from any Chinese treatment on the subject- even if it is from internationally acclaimed director and the once-infant terrible of Chinese cinema Zhang Yimou- so the best one can hope for is subtlety, with Lu Chuan's earlier box- office hit 'City of Life and Death' being an excellent example. Fortunately therefore, though Zhang Yimou's take begins on an overtly jingoistic slant, it eventually settles for a nuanced approach that exudes the very humanity at the heart of Yan Geling's story, becoming a moving and poignant account of heroism and self-sacrifice.<br/><br/>Opening with the first of just two battle sequences throughout the whole film, Yimou starts off emphasising the heroism of the Chinese soldiers who were outnumbered and outgunned by the invading Japanese troops. Amidst the blatant chest-thumping is a pair of convent girls trying to get back to the safety of their Catholic church, as well as an American mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) sent to attend to the last rites of the recently deceased parish priest. While the church's boy warden George (Huang Tianyuan) and the dozen schoolgirls under his care think that Miller could be their way out of the city, he turns out to be anything but- well at least in the beginning.<br/><br/>Content to remain nonchalant to the plight of the girls, Miller instead binges on the communion wine supply in the church's basement and ransacks the church for any money left as payment for his services. Better still, when some 13 ladies from the local brothels seek shelter at the church, he welcomes them as if elated at the prospect of his own personal harem. But transformation is at the heart of Yimou's tale, and even though you know that by the end of the story Miller will rise to the occasion to save the girls, the path to that dramatic character turn is still deeply affecting.<br/><br/>Kudos to Liu Heng's elegant screen writing, whose collaboration with Yimou goes as far back as the latter's 'Ju Dou', for crafting a moving character arc for Miller- beginning with an act of admirable courage when Miller puts on the priestly robes one day in a bid to stymie the Japanese from forcing themselves on the underage schoolgirls. Ever so delicately, the movie charts his change of heart from a once self- centred opportunist to a Fatherly figure looking after both the convent girls and the courtesans and eventually turning into a saviour for the former.<br/><br/>Just as skilfully, Yimou also charts the transformation of both groups of ladies. At the crux of it is a truly outstanding act of self- sacrifice on the part of the courtesans, as their egocentricity slowly but surely gives way to empathy and culminates in an extraordinary gesture of courage. We won't spoil this plot point for you- suffice to say that Yimou handles it with beautiful restraint, and what could easily have been maudlin melodrama is instead cast as an uplifting testament of the common bonds of humanity that unite us all despite our social backgrounds.<br/><br/>Yimou's adroit storytelling is complemented with the stirring performances of a top-notch cast. Christian Bale is perfectly cast, his usual understated but no less powerful acting creating a compelling character in Miller. It also enables him to blend in nicely with the rest of the massive ensemble, despite being the lone Westerner in a cast of Asians. Refusing to monopolise attention on himself or his character, he too strikes up great chemistry with his co-stars Tianyuan and newcomer Ni Ni- the latter of which steals the show with her luminous portrayal of Yu Mo, the pseudo-leader of the courtesans whose radiant beauty masks an equally sharp mind.<br/><br/>Evocative too is d.p. Zhao Xiaoding's cinematography, which avidly captures both the sobering horrors of war as well as the cautious moments of quiet optimism between the girls. In particular,mXiaoding also uses the convent's stained glass as a nice recurring motif to signal the omnipresence of God despite the atrocities and bleakness. And despite boasting none of the gaudy excesses of Yimou's previous big- budget extravaganzas (a la 'Curse of the Golden Flower'), production designer Yohei Tanada deserves credit for the visually intricate designs of both the cathedral as well as the war-torn streets of Nanking.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, what will likely resonate most at the end of the day are the film's twin messages of courage in the face of fear and humanity in the face of atrocity. Yimou's confident direction also makes for a multi-faceted movie that offers various perspectives on the war through its myriad characters, while placing Miller, Yu Mo and a thirteen-year old convent girl Shu (Zhang Xinyi) at the heart of it. Don't be deterred by its grim subject matter, or its partiality to the matter- just as its title suggests, there is beauty to be found in the unlikeliest of places, and in spite of the inevitable scenes of heartbreak and despair, it is a quietly stirring and deeply poignant drama of self-sacrificial love, especially meaningful with the impending occasion of Good Friday as a reminder of this highest form of love.<br/><br/><ul><li>www.moviexclusive.com</li></ul>"

"adrenalynn_xo","10","10","14","14 May 2012"," Excellent depiction of the horrors of humanity, war and brutality!
","This is a masterful portrayal of wartime horrors, told through the eyes of a young girl (for the most part). The images and story shown in the movie are beautifully haunting as I found myself thinking about it even two days after my initial viewing. <br/><br/>This story chronicles the lives and actions of a number of people over what appeared to be less than a week: a young commander of the last group of Chinese soldiers left in Nanjing after Japanese occupation, a drifter American mortician, a group of school girls living in a Catholic convent, a Catholic alter boy who was left in charge of the girls, one of the girl's father, a group of prostitutes, a Japanese commander, and Japanese soldiers.<br/><br/>Unlike what a lot of critics believe, this story does not have a real protagonist nor a single hero. Rather, the survival of a few is due to the actions of many. This is what set the movie apart from its contemporaries. <br/><br/>Aside from the beautiful footages, I have to say the acting in this movie was SUPERB. The writing and direction is also excellent. It is very rare that the English dialogue in a Chinese movie sound believable. This is one such rare case. Christian Bale is excellent as usual, as a conflicted man with a conscience who is stuck in an awful situation (which is, like how he said once in the film, ""a terrible joke""). The depiction of humanity and despair by the child actors were beautifully done. The dedication, courage and determination of the soldiers and of George the altar boy was nothing short of inspiring, and I could not help but to cry for their hopeless situation. Finally, the prostitutes were beautiful, sassy and human; I found myself thinking about them like Shu did at the end and wondering what had happened to them. <br/><br/>It's hard to believe that for most of the Chinese actors, this is their one of their first acting job.<br/><br/>A few things struck me as refreshing and intriguing: - The homesick Japanese commander who played a folk song (to which his second in command hummed along outside). It was said by the director that this was added intentionally to add dimension to the Japanese characters. This was very nicely done as it's rare for war films to depict enemies to embody any sympathetic qualities (exception: Letters from Iwo Jima). During the war, some Japanese soldiers were discouraged from feeling homesick by being encouraged to rape, pillage and murder. - The fleeting love between John and Mo was heartbreaking. - The very bittersweet ending. We could hope for the best but a google search on ""comfort women"" says otherwise. - I really like that this movie has little to no loopholes and that all the characters, saved for a few, had redeeming qualities that made them human. <br/><br/>Also, two things to note: - Nanjing, as the ancient capital of China, was home to many universities, expats and missionaries in the 1930's. Many people in Nanjing who were exposed to these places and people were capable of conversational English. This was explained in the movie so I found it believable because only the children (e.g., Shu, George, Mo, Shu's dad – who's a translator) who grew up in convents knew English but those who did not (e.g., Major Li, the rest of the prostitutes and the Japanese soldiers). - Roger Ebert was upset that John was a Caucasian priest whereas a Chinese priest should have been casted. Yeah, thanks Roger Ebert, try opening a history book next time. At that time, missionaries from the West were very common in China and westerner was given special treatment by the Japanese (who more or less saw all Chinese people as beneath them). There were many instances of Westerners using their status to help the Chinese people. This is a fact.<br/><br/>The rape and carnage depicted in this story is horrific. But sadly, it is actually just a small example of what actually happened in December, 1937 in Nanjing (if you are interested, Google Image: Nanjing 1937. Caution: very graphic images.). I suspect most of the critics of this movie have never heard of the horrendous brutality of the Nanjing (Nanking) Massacre. It's a shame because up to 300,000 people died in Nanjing during the events depicted in this movie."
"cywang-283-79901","10","10","14","4 February 2012"," Profoundly powerful epic for human virtues versus evils, and the unsung heroes and heroines
","I am not an expert in Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare. But in my opinion, the profound power of this tragic drama should at least rival those of the classics. In most of Greek Tragedy or Shakespeare, the tears originate from human jealousy and greed that went out of control. This movie leaves the audience with shaken hearts that drips not just tears, but blood. Why? Because against the ghastly backdrop of the most savage violence and despicable evils in the history of war crimes, emerged divinely pristine virtues of human courage, compassion, altruism, and sacrifice.<br/><br/>John, the American ""priest"", was not actually a true priest to begin with. Having worked as a mortician for 5 years, he was trying to deliver something to the reverend of a church in Nanjing, but got stuck in the hellish crossfire of the chaotic street battle. After wading through stretches of rubble and and piles of dead bodies of civilians, many of whom naked women mangled after gang raping, John ended up a refugee in the church. Having learned that the reverend had passed away, he was forced to play along as the reverend in charge to avoid Japanese suspicion, and to protect a bunch innocent teenage girl students seeking asylum there.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, fourteen local prostitutes forced their way into the church to seek asylum, too. They occupied the basement, depriving the girl students a crucial hideout. The two incompatible groups scorned at and bickered with each other, until the church was raided by the Japanese soldiers one day, resulting in the death of one girl student who fell off the balcony during a chase. Just as the prostitutes started to feel guilty about their occupancy of the basement, and held sympathy for the girl students, something worse happened: the Japanese commander issued an ""invitation"" for the girls to attend their celebration party for capturing Nanjing. A ""no"" reply was not an option. And everybody knew the real destiny for the girl students was sex slavery in military brothel euphemized as ""comfort women"", or worse beyond imagination. <br/><br/>When the girl students lined up to commit group suicide by jumping off the bell tower of the church prior to the date to be taken away from the church, the prostitutes could not suppress their conscience any more. In a desperate attempt to persuade the girls to back down from the edges, the prostitutes offered to disguise themselves as the students and volunteered to substitute them for the dooming invitation. The night before the departure was most touching. It was a bit metaphoric to The Last Supper before the crucifixion of Christ. The prostitutes performed singing and dance to the girls as if for them to remember their elder sisters who will be giving up their own lives to redeem them. Then the tearful hugging with whispering farewells, such as, ""You live a good life for me"", reminding the viewer of what captain Miller whispered to private Ryan before passing away: ""Earn it"" in the movie Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>The love scene between the lead prostitute and John was not as contemptuous to Christianity, or insulting in the solemn context of Rape of Nanjing, as some critics might have suggested. Upon closer scrutiny, the viewer can easily tell it had nothing to do with carnal desire and sensual satisfaction. Rather, it was a genuine thirst for one last taste of human affections as part of the last wish by the lead prostitute. From psychological perspective, John simply served as a substitute for her real old flame. Nonetheless, this ritual brought a closure for her unfulfilled love, before facing her dooming destiny with dignity and serenity. Such substitution can also be found, for example, in the movie The Summer of 1942.<br/><br/>The final ritual late in the night before departure was hair cutting and makeover to disguise the prostitutes as teenage students. Here came an opportunity for John to use his mortician skills. Yet the way he did it was spooky -- he made the prostitutes lie down in a row like the dead bodies he used to work on. It was as ominous as The Schindler's List, in which the Jewish women were shaved off their hairs to get ready for the gas chambers. But the director created this eerie scene for another unique purpose: to project a strong symbol that these women, although biologically existed, were about to be deprived of their souls.<br/><br/>But these brave prostitutes did not submit to their fates without putting up a final fight. Each of them made a dagger out of broken mirrors, wrapped it up with cloths, and hid it inside their robes, readying for the final showdown and martyrdom.<br/><br/>This is a tremendously powerful movie that transforms an extraordinary war crime story into a heroic epic with religious metaphors about human virtues and redemption. It deserves a place in the movies' hall of fame, side by side with masterpieces such as The Bridge on the River Kwai."
"DICK STEEL","10","7","9","1 April 2012"," A Nutshell Review: The Flowers of War
","The lead is of course Christian Bale, starring in what would be his first Chinese production, and a major one at that, that both sides can claim a coup, one in having a major Hollywood star be at the centre of one of the most tumultuous times in Chinese history, and the other getting involved in a production that brings him back in touch with his Empire of the Sun days in telling a tale set during World War II. Nanking has always been at the centre of controversy for the Japanese's refusal to admit to the atrocities committed and to downplay the number of casualties involved, and this has led to numerous films from documentaries to Lu Chuan's excellent City of Life and Death to have dealt with the pain and suffering by the Chinese during the Japanese invasion and occupation thereafter.<br/><br/>The central character to Zhang Yimou's Nanking tale happens to be a young schoolgirl by the name of Shujuan (Zhang Xinyi), escaping from the soldiers who have come to occupy the city, and seeking refuge at their own church and convent school. She narrates the entire tale as seen through her eyes and experience, and naturally she, and her teenage friends, are targets of the soldiers in their lust, pillage and plunder. But the priest of her church had died, and in his place is a fellow teenage caretaker (Huang Tianyuan) entrusted to protect the schoolgirls, who would have been at wits end if not for the timely arrival of mortician John Miller (Bale), caught up in the city and refusing to leave unless being paid for his trip and unwanted services. <br/><br/>Hiding in the same convent happen to be a group of prostitutes from a famed brothel in Nanking, who were promised safe passage and a hiding place within the confines of the church since it's owned by Westerners, and this forces a faction of sorts to emerge amongst John, who sees impersonating a priest to his advantage, the group of working girls, and the convent girls who see the former group as immoral and undeserving to be sharing their hiding place and scarce resources. If anything, this also becomes John's story in keeping things harmonious amongst the groups, and finding it within himself to hold the key to everyone's survival as much as he can, given he's a foreigner and by and large having whatever little influence to keep the Japanese at bay, which is right outside the gated courtyard.<br/><br/>Nanking atrocities have been told countless of times through various mediums and through film, and Zhang had probably decided not to overdo, or overly place a focus on the atrocities committed by soldiers, which becomes tempting to focus on the plenty of blood, gore and of course the much talked about sexual violence against the womenfolk in the city, whatever their age. Rather it's a very distinct three separate acts he adopts that provided different focus each, and that had worked while keeping the narrative keenly on target to dwell on the titular characters. Since the tale started with the invasion of the city, Zhang Yimou sees opportunity in presenting a mini war action film, that deals with one small squad's, and then one Captain's, relentless fight against impossible odds to keep the convent girls safe from harm.<br/><br/>Then it became John's story-arc in his transformation from uncaring drunkard with his skirt- chasing ways, to a man finally woken to the harsh realities of war, and the atrocities that are being committed from right under his nose should he choose to be passive, stand around and watch, or better yet, escape when being presented a chance to do so. And knowing that their prolonged stay at the church isn't a long term plan, his responsibility laid in getting an unused truck working again for their collective escape, as well as to figure out a way to save the young girls from their summons to the Japanese Imperial Army HQ where a cruel, expected fate awaits, giving rise to the notion that there's no such thing as a free lunch / freedom, but a peace enjoyed that had to be repaid many times over. Bale got to exercise his Mandarin again, which is nothing new to the actor, although here his attempts were confined and limited to keywords rather than phrases, communicating with the schoolgirls, and Yu Mo (Ni Ni) the prettiest amongst the working girls, using English since they have been schooled in a convent.<br/><br/>Unlike most Nanking films, Zhang Yimou's film, based upon the novel by Yan Geling, chooses to focus on what would be a great escape, and a singular primary challenge that everyone had to overcome through sheer wit with death as a possible outcome, that makes the film really moving when it broaches the theme about sacrifice. The director's works are commercial fare and accessible compared to his earlier works, and The Flowers of War prove to be no different in offering a big budgeted tale about one of humankind's darkest period in our history. A recommended must watch, although not in the same vein as City of Life and Death which had a more holistic view of the initial days of the Nanking invasion."
"lomax82003","9","7","9","4 February 2012"," Heartbracking experience
","I admit it took me 3 or 4 times to go watch this movie but I tell you it was worth every penny. I kind of misjudge it because I thought that a drama/thriller about the Japanese invasion over China together with a priest from USA would only show how good are the Americans and how can they save everyday. But it was definitely not like this. Although Bale looks to be the main actor I definitely think that Ni Ni ( Yu Mo ) - this Chinese new actress - on top judging her splendid performance. Regarding the story I think it is flawless and this movie can easily be considered an epic one. The colors of war, the drama of the innocent children, the sacrifice of the ""big sisters"", the cruelty and the low honor of the Japanese soldiers are so intense that it keeps your heart beating as if you were running for an Olympic medal. There is no honor in war, what the Japanese did to the Chinese, in my opinion, it easily tops Hitler or Stalin's behavior towards Lewis people and Russians. Their goal was not only to conquer and to make the enemy capitulate but also to rape every single women soul regarding age and I think that should be one of the things that separate us from the animals; even some animals are smarter than that. On the other hand Bale is playing a perfect role of an undecided man. I mean he's definitely not the hero figure, he's not the ""Bruce Willis"" kind of character or even Oscar Schindler ( remember the one who saved Jews from extermination with his factory ). He has to choose between what's better for him or what's better for some strangers and his decision together with Ni Ni's perfect play as an escort lady adds the perfect dose of romanticism in times of desperation and lack of self confidence.

","At first,I think this film is not bed.In the view of mine it's the best works of director Zhang. It is therefore quite impossible to expect objectivity from any Chinese treatment on the subject- even if it is from internationally acclaimed director and the once-infant terrible of Chinese cinema Zhang Yimou- so the best one can hope for is subtlety, with Lu Chuan's earlier box-office hit 'City of Life and Death' being an excellent example. Fortunately therefore, though Zhang Yimou's take begins on an overtly jingoistic slant, it eventually settles for a nuanced approach that exudes the very humanity at the heart of Yan Geling's story, becoming a moving and poignant account of heroism and self-sacrifice."

","In 1937, the cynical mortician John Miller (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic Church in Nanjing that is under protection of the Red Cross to bury the local priest during the Japanese attack to the Capital of China. He finds only student girls and one young boy in the convent and he decides to spend the night in the church and travel on the next day. Soon a group of prostitutes from the local brothel by the river breaks in the church seeking a sanctuary and they hide in the basement.<br/><br/>On the next morning, a Japanese platoon breaks in the Church and when the soldiers see the girls, they try to rape them. John wears the priest costume and poses like a priest to the invaders. He tries unsuccessfully to stop the Japanese, but the Chinese Major Li (Dawei Tong), who is the only survivor of his troop, prepares traps using bombs and destroys the whole platoon. Now John needs to decide whether he leaves Nanjing in the last ship or stays in the church protecting the naive girls.<br/><br/>""Jin líng shí san chai"" is an unrealistic view of the Rape of Nanking in 1937. The plot has the usual exaggeration of blockbusters that spoils the film. John Miller is a cynical mercenary that refuses to escape with his compatriot in the last ship to stay with the Chinese girls in an unbelievable redemption of a character. The two prostitutes leave the shelter to bring a pair of rings and a string for her liuqin is also a ridiculous situation. The attitude of the prostitutes switching places with the student girls is also hard to believe. The best film about this shameful invasion is ""Nanjing 1937"".

"eddie_baggins","2","14","25","10 December 2013"," A major misfire from both Bale and Zhang
","Famed Asian director Yimou Zhang's big budget version of the Japanese invasion of China in 1937 is one of the most baffling and tonally uneven films you ever likely to lay witness to. What we have here is a film that at one moment will be laughably comical and the next deadly serious (and rightfully so for events that occurred during this occupation were truly horrendous). It's also a movie that revels in frequent unbelievably bad character decisions and acts as a showcase for one of famed British thespian Christian Bale's worst screen performances.<br/><br/>In a film filled with downright atrocious acting qualities and annoying character attributes Bale comes off worse in his role as unlikeable American John Miller. John is a man that whilst eventually doing good has a journey that is just unable to engage on a level that feels realistic. It's a thankless type of role for Bale but one senses that this was a real showy piece that failed to eventuate into anything outside of the Chinese market. The hardest thing to fathom about this picture is the fact that it should have been so ripe for a heart string pulling look at history.<br/><br/>Much of the films failings must be befallen to director Zhang who seems more interested in framing a shot in slo-mo or have one of his character's stand near a multi-coloured glass mosaic for pretty lighting effects than actually focussing on the war that rages around them. It can't be overlooked in analysis also that for a film costing north of 90 million American dollars it's a slight event picture that rarely ventures out from the church in which the survivors of the invasion hold out in, which seems a wasted opportunity considering the stories just waiting to be told outside the churches gates.<br/><br/>Obviously striking a chord in its country of origin (where it's one of China's highest grossing films of all time), viewers (who rate it a staggeringly high 7.5 on IMDb) and some industry experts (the film was nominated for Golden Globe) Flowers of War feels like a mighty misstep of a film upon watching now. Much time has passed since Flowers of War was on our big screens and judging by its barely there reputation now it's not hard to argue as to why many have forgotten about it entirely.<br/><br/>1 impromptu wig out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","""The Flowers of War"", a film by an acclaimed Chinese Director, Zhang YiMou. Although I have not seen much of his films, but I have learned from some of his movies that they are visually captivating. This movie is no exception. But it offers more than just that.<br/><br/>It tells of a story during the Sino-Japanese war, where the Japanese took over Nanking. A group of convent girl students took shelter in the church after failing to leave the city. And later joined by a group of women from the brothel. It is a story of their survival. <br/><br/>Christian Bale starred as John, a mortician, who came to the church intending to prepare a burial for the church's priest. Acted like a jerk in the beginning, John was later caught in the situation and realized that he could not afford to just leave the church, the girls and the women behind. <br/><br/>The movie brilliantly captured the emotions of the people, of them trying to escape from the Japanese soldiers. The feeling of fear grabbed us through the heart, their fear of being captured, being raped, and being killed. And all they could do was run and hide.<br/><br/>It also blatantly showed us the strong contrast of cruelty and humanity. On the brink of a situation, you could either be downright heartless, or you could show the human side of you. After all it is inside everyone of us. We would have found ours if we sympathized the characters and if we stood by justice. But yet the story slapped the truth right in our face that there are still bad apples in this world. People who would brutally do whatever they like to fulfill their desires.<br/><br/>The acting throughout the movie was beyond amazing. The director must have pushed the actors (especially the young ones) to a point that they were showing true feelings, so believable, and every detail of their acting and emotion was accounted for. I was truly impressed, especially by the little girls. <br/><br/>This is a truly amazing film. And an important one. Reminding us about the unforgettable event taken place in Nanking. And reminding us to cherish and to love. And there is a human in everyone of us. Easily one of the best films of the year!<br/><br/>My Rating: 10/10 Status: Extremely Highly Recommended"

","The Flowers of War is a 2011 Historical drama war directed by directed by Zhang Yimou, starring Christian Bale, Ni Ni, Zhang Xinyi, Tong Dawei, Atsuro Watabe, Shigeo Kobayashi and Cao Kefan. It is set in 1937, Nanjing, China, during the ""Rape of Nanjing"", at the time of the Second Sino-Japanese War. A group of escapees, finding sanctuary in a church compound, try to survive the plight and persecution brought on by the violent invasion of the city It was named the top-grossing Chinese film of 2011. It was selected as the Chinese entry for Best Foreign Language Film at the 84th Academy Awards, but did not make the final shortlist. It also received a nomination for the 69th Golden Globe Awards. The 6th Asian Film Awards presented The Flowers of War with several individual nominations, including Best Film and one will understand why all the hype and the nominations. This is the best historical drama that doesn't take sides of the war, who is far or who isn't, who started what and who didn't like any other war dramas we have seen. It doesn't try to justify it but it shows the evil and the results of war. This was a tearful experience both from an older kind (the prostitutes in the movie) as well as the children (the kids in the movie). This makes you ask the question on the subject of war, Japanese and Chinese war in this case or any other war you have heard of: One wonders why they had to do this? Why did Japan start the war? For what? Its obvious starting war is a shortcut to the destruction of humanity. The Japanese government has been denying there were 300,000 people killed during the Nanking massacre (well, they are not alone, similarly there are also those of holocaust denial). The Flowers of War does a great deal in reminding is of these events so that we could do all we can to prevent another war from coming. The actors and the actresses were great and I applaud Christian Bale for his role, yet again he proves he is undisputed in the way he takes his roles and make them comes to life. The graphics awesome and characters superb, script well executed to such an extent you can hardly draw a line or separate the comedy and drama in it. Go hire this it is worth your time and it is a masterpiece."

","... but hopefully also inspired by what you have seen.
I am definitely not a Christian Bale fan, as I dislike most of his characterisations, but he can rise to the heights sometimes (as in ""The Big Short""). Here he starts out in typical American capitalist mode, seeking to take advantage from the situation he finds himself in.
But war has an interesting effect on people. It tends to bring out the best and worst in us. And although we see plenty of the worst, mainly from the Japanese invaders, this film is mainly about the best, often deriving from unlikely sources.
The pivot is a group of terrified young girls at a Nanking religious school who have been left (by the death of the priest) under the care of an equally young and scared orphan boy who takes his responsibility extremely seriously (a wonderful performance by Kefan Cao).
They are joined by a group of young prostitutes from a local brothel who suspect what their fate will be if the Japanese find them (borne out later when 2 girls unwisely return to the brothel to pick up a couple of items). There is a standout performance from their leading figure (played by Ni Ni), who understandably captivates the Christian Bale character. 
I won't spoil it by giving more details, but the desire to save the children leads everyone to risk their lives, in the knowledge that if they die they will do so with dignity and in a good cause.
PS: the fact that a German nazi party member (John Rabe) became a Chinese hero through his efforts to prevent Japanese attrocities in China tells you just how bad it got and the time is really long overdue for Japan to follow the German path to redemption by recognising the horrors committed, seeking forgiveness and ceasing to pay homage to the leaders who led them down that awful path. There is no honour in refusing to admit that one's compatriots can be monsters too and such a stance is totally incompatible with Japan's civilized attitude in so many other areas. Indeed it is the one obstacle preventing worldwide admiration of the Japanese for the qualities they possess."

"dmuel","6","20","46","17 December 2011"," Emotionally charged film on historic massacre
","This film tells the story of a group of Nanjing prostitutes, a group of young Chinese Catholic Nuns, and a dissolute American, Christian Bale, who take refuge at a Catholic church during the Japanese massacre at Nanjing. Chinese director Zhang Yimou directs this sometimes engrossing, sometimes melodramatic movie. The film begins with a sort of ""Saving Private Ryan"" battle scene between Japanese troops and Chinese Nationalist forces, with the later efforts of a single Chinese soldier who survives this first encounter straining credulity in single-handed combat with a regiment of Japanese soldiers. <br/><br/>The film strongly focuses on the self-sacrifice of the prostitutes who wish to save the young teenage Chinese nuns. Bale's character, John Miller, also finds redemption in his efforts to help the young girls survive, and in his own self-sacrifice when he forgoes an opportunity to escape Nanjing. Miller also finds love with one of the prostitutes, but the physical consummation of his love seems out of place in a city filled with death and rape. The film actually manages a few hard-to- believe developments in its story, but it will undoubtedly succeed in pulling more than a few Western movie-goer's heart strings. <br/><br/>There have been early accusations that Zhang has made a piece of propaganda filming for China's leaders. The portrayal of Japanese soldiers has been described as one-dimensional, but I don't think the film is any worse than several Western film's depictions of German Nazis, such as in The Pianist, Schindler's List and others. Besides, the most conservative estimates assert tens of thousands of Chinese women were raped by the Japanese during the Nanjing Massacre, and many tens of thousands of Chinese were butchered, so this is not a movie about a routine city siege of the Second World War. Having said that, it does not seem as though Chinese government financial support for another in a string of recent films about the Nanjing Massacre is the best possible method for improving Sino-Japanese relations."

","This is a war movie that will stick with you and leave a impact. There is so many depressing and sorrowful moments in this movie. The audiences is going to have a difficult time holding back their tears for this one. The main reason I decided to watch this movie is because it has Christian Bale in it cause I might have passed on this one if it didn't feature him in this. But I am glad I didn't let this movie just pass by. This movie takes place in 1937 and revolves around WW2 and Japanese invasion of China with the Nanking Massacre. Although the Japanese government might be trying to cover up a horrifying past and war crimes they have committed in the past. Can you imagine something very terrible done to you and your family and the culprit just denies because of reputation sake? This movie shows the brutality and pain of war, especially when it has invaders that doesn't have a conscience. The Japanese were barbaric and despicable during their invasion, they didn't just shoot people they tortured and raped their victims continuously. And this movie shows a vivid portrayal of so much pain and emotion that a bunch of Chinese women and girls had to go through. That even within the chaos there are people willing to love and sacrifice. In fact this movie has more to do with the emotional part during the invasion over showing a lot of the atrocities committed during the Rape of Nanking. Now Christian Bale was okay in this, he could have done better though in my opinion since I know he has some good acting chops by watching his past movies. He plays a man that may seem like just a stupid drunk at first but deep down he has compassion and morals. He becomes a guardian protector for the weak and oppressed...And no he is not Batman. The plot is basically about a man a mortician pretending to be a priest to protect the female Chinese students and prostitutes. The relationship that builds between the students and prostitutes is touching. Some may look down on prostitutes but the background of some of the prostitutes in this movie, it just hits right at the core of the heart. It's a simple story told in a emotional and powerful way and realistically, none of that Hollywood stuff. Although the production for this movie is really good. By the time this movie and ends and the credits roll I could not forget about this film, it stuck with me for quite a while. I had a difficult time sleeping as well. Overall this is a traumatic and powerful movie that needs to be watched at least once.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The opening ten minutes is an amazing sequence that draws you into the streets of Nanking circa 1937. It's clear we are in the hands of a master director, with all the right elements in place, particularly the cinematography. The Chinese have been doing that part at least, better than anyone else for the past decade. <br/><br/>So it's quite a surprise to see Christian Bale pop up, speaking English. He's a fine actor and one of the film's strengths though his dialog at times is a little too modern. His character is the centerpiece to the story and it's easy to see why he took the role. It's a solid story set in a maelstrom, most of the drama taking place inside a church, being the literal calm inside the tornado. There are a number of dilemmas which drive the action, the same as all films, yet the incidents that initiate several of these dilemmas feel forced and a little trite. To give more information would require a spoiler and I don't want to give anything away. It's a shame as the situations themselves are dramatically effective and with so many of the right elements in place, they let the film down. It's essentially sloppy writing. It feels lazy which lessens your empathy with certain characters. I'd give it an 8 if it weren't for that.<br/><br/>Everything else works very well, the cast, the cinematography and direction as mentioned are the standouts, as well as some glorious sets. Some dialog scenes are too long and Bale's character transformation is a little too sudden and dramatic but the film will stay with you, hopefully encouraging you to research the background to the horror story that was the Nanking Massacre, its effects which still linger today."

","Well, where to start on this one. What an execrable mess. This story loosely concerns an American neer-do-well who is inexplicably rambling around Nanking looking for a Church. This guy is apparently a mortician, but where he came from (has he turned up on the wrong film set?) and why he has chosen the middle of the rape and pillage of Nanking to do this is unclear. Inexplicably he seems unconcerned about the several hundred thousand other bodies lying around Nanking, he is fixated on attending to the body of a priest at this church. Given the movie later goes to great pains to show what a dirty rotten scoundrel he is, why he seems honour or duty bound to do this is unclear. It seems he is only doing it for the money but unless the pay for attending to a dead priest is several million dollars you would think he would have been better off staying in his hotel room. While Chinese civilians are being slaughtered left and right our hero is luckily found by the only Japanese soldier that does not shoot people. And luckily, for no apparent reason, a wall falls on this soldier. And luckily, out of the half million people in Nanking he could meet, he comes across 2 girls from the very church he wants to go to. What a guy. Meanwhile a group of girls are fleeing from something - apparently they were out having a picnic when the Japanese inconsiderately decided to attack. A young Chinese man insists on counting them every 10 seconds. Also meanwhile a certain General Li is out there with his men, in the way that Generals always are, right? A soldier says to him something like ""General, we must go, everyone else has gone"" but our heroic general is made of sterner stuff. Another group of civilians is being pursued by Japanese troops, but inexplicably, the Japanese don't shoot at them. We see ridiculous CGI shots of bullets tearing through people, an overhead shot of a ridiculously unreal exploding tank....and on, and on and on.<br/><br/>All of this in the first 3 minutes, by which time I was shaking my head in disbelief and started reading a book. I lasted through about 20 minutes before I switched it off. Kudos to those that can sit through more of this debacle.<br/><br/>I don't suppose you can blame Christian Bale. I guess he used the script he was given and ""acted"" the way he was told to. I guess he was made an offer he couldn't refuse, took the money and ran.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that the Rape of Nanking was a horrific event that everyone should know about and remember.

"SteveMierzejewski","3","12","26","19 June 2012"," Dull and contrived
","I'm not sure any film could ever capture the extent of the brutality that occurred during the Rape of Nanking. Only a documentary could do this. This film only touched on some of what was going on. The rest of the movie was a feeble attempt to build a story around an American expat trying to save some girls from a convent. Toss in some unrealistically attractive prostitutes for visual effect, a few action scenes, and you have yourself a movie, not a very good movie, but a movie. Every scene drags on longer than it should. The movie starts off fairly well and then declines to the point where you really aren't interested in what happens next. The acting is weak. Christian Bale goes through the motions, though I did enjoy the stereotypical way he tried to speak English to the Japanese soldiers who had no idea what he was talking about. Actually, the movie is filled with stereotypes and seemed to be made with Western viewers in mind, giving them the stereotypes they feel most comfortable with. The word, pandering, comes to mind. The only scene that matches accounts given at the time is that in which the church is invaded by Japanese soldiers. You can't, and should not, try to build a heartwarming film around incidents such as that.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I really didn't much care what happened to anyone. The characters acted in their own shells. No rapport was built between any of them. There are some bloody scenes and some scenes that are hard to watch. Troubling as they are, they do keep the film anchored in the reality of the time. It is just that they are not integrated well enough with the rest of the story. I think that is where the problem with the film arises. The immensity of the time, the psychological trauma of it, could not be addressed with these characters and with this plot. The end result is a series of disconnected scenes with nothing to hold them together well enough to make for a satisfying film."

","This review contains what I consider to be minor spoilers - references to two scenes that do not go into details.<br/><br/>First I must say that although this film has its drawbacks, Qigang Chen's extraordinary score does not, and is worthy of Oscar nomination. I guess that will never happen, since so few Academy members will have seen this movie. The music is achingly beautiful, and daringly against type.<br/><br/>This is a powerful movie, expertly crafted by Zhang Yimou and his team. There are moments of extreme horror and tragedy, and moments of great humanity within the horror.<br/><br/>The major flaws for me were story beats, basically. Halfway through the movie, there is an extremely on-the-nose scene between Christian Bale's character and another Westerner (Paul Schneider, I guess). It was jarringly contrived and obvious, compared to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The other nonsensical scene involved a woman escaping the church's sanctuary simply to retrieve a pair of ear rings. With almost guaranteed death outside, this was also very contrived, and somewhat mystifying, considering that the Japanese are making sure no one goes in or out of the church.<br/><br/>But that aside, it is definitely a film worth seeing. Cinematography and editing were excellent."

"user-449-22244","3","9","21","14 August 2012"," Over-rated
","I've seen nothing but positive reviews for this film, so I checked it out. Well, you may have noticed my opinion is not so supportive. <br/><br/>The brutality of the Nanking Massacre has been considerably saturated in recent years, particularly by Chinese cinema. Frankly, this massively fails in contrast to 'The City of Life and Death', which presented a much fairer perspective and made a whole-hearted effort to be comprehensive in its representation of all sides. 'Flowers' is not so objective, nor does it attempt to be. Its purpose is to pull your heart- strings, and seems to have succeeded with the majority of the audiences that watched it; albeit, it achieves this through a relatively skewed and subjective presentation. <br/><br/>The combat, for instance, is arguably a case in point. Historically, the battle for Nanking was marked by an overwhelming failure of leadership on the part of the Chinese command; and indiscipline and understandable cowardice on the part of the Chinese soldiery. Thousands of Chinese soldiers deserted their posts and donned civilian attire, helping to create the conditions that partially sparked the massacre in the first place. Chinese soldiery was largely composed of poorly-trained, illiterate peasants who had little or no stomach for the kind of warfare they were thrown into, and understandably ran. The aforementioned 'City of Life and Death' went to considerable lengths to demonstrate the plight of the Chinese soldier. 'Flowers' represents the entirety of the battle (yes, it was a massive battle!) with what appears to be an overly-equipped platoon of the German-trained 88th division,which certainly does not represent the majority of combatants in Nanking. Even notwithstanding, The heroism portrayed is flawed because the film almost reduces it to almost cartoon, comical proportions. <br/><br/>Of course, 'Flowers' does not profess to be an objective portrayal of the events of the massacre, but a human story set against the backdrop of these historical events. But the need to incorporate (admittedly well-executed) action elements into an already charged human drama detracts from the emotion of the film. Frankly, the battle scenes, while juvenile and reminiscent of 'Commando' comic books, were some of the best parts of the film, and felt like they belonged in another movie.<br/><br/>The cartoon-like parameters of the films character portrayals do not end with its portrayal of violence. Overall, the acting is taut and crisp, but the decision to portray the atrocity almost entirely through the eyes of a group of school-girls arguably leaves a lot to be desired. The image of almost saintly feminine faces against a backdrop of evil only serves to present a glossy fantasy and in my opinion does nothing to fairly represent the true humanity of the event. Furthermore, while Christian Bale is on traditional form, the need to tell the story through the eyes of a westerner is arguably a marketing ploy ( I appreciate that the film is a literary adaptation). The overall need to categorically contrast innocence versus evil detracts from the true horror of the event.<br/><br/>Perhaps I should not have seen any other movies depicting the tragedy of Nanking before seeing 'Flowers'; and if this is your first cinematic experience of the subject matter, you may well find it deeply provocative. My advice is to do yourself a favour, and watch 'City of Life and Death' first, and then see this if you still care to. frankly, and unlike most other reviewers, I was simply left mildly entertained. I shed no tears, because the characters never became more than caricatures."

","Historically inaccurate, baffles the mind in how awfully senseless it is. Stomach-churning war sentimentality combined with trauma-porn: goes great together like opera and brutal rape. Let's all celebrate Christian Bale's white heroism for saving vestal virgins. This movie has the most whorephobic depiction of sex workers ever: it's the worst kind of whorephobia that masquerades as compassion for prostitutes, all the while pissing all over them.<br/><br/>The hookers must wake up extra-early every morning to put on all that makeup and iron their hair into perfect curls, IN THE MIDDLE OF A WAR - because naturally, hookers all just wake up looking like porcelain dolls, and would actually need the help of a MORTICIAN to restore a plain-faced innocence: the just-prayed, nunnery look that all hookers secretly crave.<br/><br/>Right before they sacrifice themselves - that's when hookers are most sympathetic: when they're about to die. The only thing I learned from this movie is that rape is the only heroic redemption for being a sex worker. All the courtesans are portrayed as dumb, selfish, greedy, cowardly bitches, except for the trafficking victim who was raped at age 13. She's good because she was ""never meant to be that kind of a girl."" And because she reads. Whoa! Imagine a hooker who reads. Blows my mind.<br/><br/>I can't think of a worse movie I've ever seen in my life, and I've seen a lot of movies."
"maximkong","5","5","11","18 November 2012"," Touching moments failed to save the lack of realistic elements
","First of all, amongst the many Zhang Yimou films I have seen in recent years, those of which were heavily formulated with stereotypical Chinese-style overacting drama/action and bombastic soap opera emotions, or governed by mundane slow pace which did not quite fit into the scenes realistically, Flowers of War is surprisingly free of most of that and I enjoyed the distinctly more natural acting performances here.<br/><br/>However, what disappointed me was that the director chose to splash too much on the melodrama but fail to amend several obvious flaws that seriously defy the logic of some of these characters' actions. For instance (SPOILER ALERT), unless he intends to be a thief belongings of the dead, I don't see why a foreigner who obviously has no attachments to Nanking (judging from his poor command of Chinese) would choose to go all the way at the start of the movie for a job which any sensible man would know that its not worth taking. And why, if they plan to sneak out to avoid the soldiers, would they dress up in noticeable cheongsam? Do they not value their lives over the joy of making loud noises on a childish girl fight that will easily make the soldiers notice? What is with 'educated' Japanese high ranking officers who bothered to play some random piano and never question whatever that has happened to his befallen soldiers? Survival issues on lack of food, water, hygiene and the paranoid feeling that affects the group morality, were nonexistent and that to me is another serious flaw.<br/><br/>There are several other flaws i am not going to mention, just disappointed that the Chinese themselves have ample opportunities to make something personal to the nation but the work was sub-par standard in the end."

","The Flowers of War (2011) was a film Christian Bale squeezed into the space of The Fighter and The Dark Knight Rises, but have no doubt, this film comes close in terms of quality.<br/><br/>The Flowers of war is a beautiful but harrowing tale of a Westerner who finds refuge with a group of women in a church during Japan's rape of Nanking in 1937. Posing as a priest, he attempts to lead the women to safety. During the 2 hours this film displays the horrors that were evident during Japan's rule of Nanking, and the fear and sadness it spread amongst the Chinese.<br/><br/>Christian Bale plays a good performance and develops as a character from the start as a money directed man who has no intention of helping others without compensation. As John Miller (Bale) tries his best to direct the students to safety, he cannot stop the force of the Japanese.<br/><br/>Yimou Zhang's direction in Flowers of War is 'spielbergian' in it's action scenes, and captures the scale of battle at a realistic level. The script for this film was mind blowingly good with fantastic dialogue that was true and heart draining at times. Without a doubt the dialogue is what makes this film so true and authentic. Flowers of War mixes action and character focus perfectly throughout the film without it getting corny. The audience slowly begins to side with John and believes in him, he's a hero, a saviour, some may say a man sent from God himself."
"TxMike","Null","2","3","17 August 2012"," Based on the 1937 rape of the China city Nanking by the Japanese.
","Christian Bale is one of the actors I like, I find that he always creates a memorable character. In this movie he is John Miller, an American undertaker arriving in war-torn 1937 Nanking to give a recently deceased Catholic priest a proper burial.<br/><br/>As he is making his way to the walled-in church and convent compound he has to dodge bullets and finds himself in a large flour bin, and arrives at the gates covered in white powder. This becomes important later as he needs new clothes and finds the deceased priest's vestments fit him. So he spends much of the rest of the movie dressed as a priest, and the Japanese soldiers think he is a priest.<br/><br/>The core of the story involves two groups of approximately 12 to 14 females. One group are the 12 to 14 year old children, students that live at the school and convent. The other are the 20-something prostitutes that managed to climb over the fence and seek shelter in the basement of the compound.<br/><br/>Over the development of the story John Miller starts out as a simple, money-grubbing man who wants to get paid for his services. He cares about no one but himself. By the end he has come to care for all the girls, young and old, plus George the young boy who helps in the convent. The movie is inspired by real events, but I don't know if the core of this story is real or not.<br/><br/>Anyway it is a superb movie, slow-moving but meaningful. It does not sugar-coat the hardships of war. It was a very expensive movie to make, the whole compound and devastated city was a set built on a large parcel of land.<br/><br/>The DVD extras are very interesting, showing the process to select actors, almost all unknown and inexperienced. And the interaction between them and Bale, the only ""name"" actor in the movie. It was touching to see how many of them were crying as filming ended, because going their separate ways was like breaking up a family.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the end John realized that a Japanese invitation for the girls to attend a party and sing was really a death knell for them. The prostitutes sacrificed themselves for the girls, allowing John to straighten their hair and make them up to look more like children, so they could go instead. Meanwhile John managed to repair an old truck and, hiding the children under some crates, managed to sneak them out of Nanking to safety."

","Asian film market is known for their epic films, but not with A-list American stars attached. In The Flowers of War, Christian Bale jumps into the starring role of a film that is anything but American. Filled with various languages including English, Chinese, and Japanese this film attempts to do something very rare and bring these two cultures of filmmaking together in hopes to create something truly special, through a painful time in history.<br/><br/>The Flowers of War follows a mortician who arrives at a Catholic church to prepare the priest for burial, but is thrust into the middle of the Sino-Japanese war, among the convent girl students and prostitutes of a nearby brothel. Now as the unplanned protector of them all, must find a way to help them survive the horrors of the Japanese army. This seemed like it was going to be one of those movies that were more interesting in idea instead of actual execution, but it ended up delivering so much more than you would think. This film takes on some sensitive subject matter and doesn't hold too many punches delivering. Bale gives a great performance, once again thrusting him into something you wouldn't expect. You would never think that an actor with the wide variety of parts he has played with such dedication is the same guy who just finished playing Batman. Here he is forced to carry most of the film as the virtually the only American here in a sea of Asian performers. The rest of the cast delivers some great and powerful performances that are both touching at times and painful. This is one of those stories that doesn't sugar coat the horror of war and delivers some sequences that are a bit hard to take in. While most of the film is more of a drama, there are plenty of action war sequences that are not only important to the story, but also help to break up the slow pace of this heavy story.<br/><br/>This is a film that is not only a success in a unique culture mash-up in film, but also one that will pull out an emotional response of some kind. This emotionally charged dark film is way heavier than you may think going in, but is one that deserves to be seen. If you're not a big fan of the foreign film world, this is a perfect film to give a try and discover not only a great film, but the greatness of Asian cinema.<br/><br/>http://www.examiner.com/movie-in-dallas/bobby-blakey"

","The gruesome realities of the Japanese invasion and conquering of the city of Nanking, China in 1937 have been brought to the screen on a regular basis: In The Name of the Emperor form Christine Choi and Nancy Tang in 1998, Nanking form Bill Gutentag and Dan Sturman in 2007, City of Life and Death form Chuan Lee in 2009 and John Rabe from Florian Gallenburger in 2009, and now come THE FLOWERS OF WAR from Yimou Zhang in 2011. Though the story is based on facts, the various movie versions vary considerably on what really happened. THE FLOWERS OF WAR is based on Geling Yan's novel '13 Flowers of Nanjing,' the story gathers an improbable collection of people -- Bale's freelance American mortician, a group of convent schoolgirls and the women from a local brothel -- in the nominal refuge of a Catholic cathedral as the capital falls to Japan's Imperial Army. There are so many sidebar stories and characters introduced that the enormous impact the other films created is somewhat diluted here despite some quality direction from Yimou Zhang. As the LA Times critic stated, 'The Flowers of War has broken new ground for China's movie industry: It's among the first domestically financed films to star a high-profile Hollywood actor (Christian Bale), and its reported budget of close to $100 million makes it the country's priciest production to date. But when it comes to storytelling, Zhang Yimou's 19th feature is decidedly backward-looking: A lavish period weepie set against the atrocities of the Nanking Massacre, ""Flowers"" abounds with well-worn movie archetypes and slathers on schmaltz.'<br/><br/>Briefly stated, in 1937 China, during the second Sino-Japanese war, a mortician, John (Christian Bale) arrives at a Catholic church in Nanjing to prepare a priest for burial. Upon arrival he finds himself the lone adult among a group of convent girl students and prostitutes from a nearby brothel. When he finds himself in the unwanted position of protector of both groups from the horrors of the invading Japanese army, he discovers the meaning of sacrifice and honor. Innocence-vs. -experience is an undeniably strong theme. The girls' tender adolescence heightens its impact, especially given the historical facts. The Nanking Massacre is also known as the Rape of Nanking, and it's more than a figurative description: The Japanese invaders committed horrendous sexual assaults against the female population. In ""Flowers,"" the girls' safety becomes the paramount concern of the survivors holed up in the cathedral.<br/><br/>Christian Bale seems to struggle with this character and his performance is not particularly convincing or moving. The aspect of this film that overcomes the over-production qualities (hiring Joshua Bell to provide a violin solo seems a bit much, etc) is the story itself, a bit of history that cannot be replayed often enough to again remind us how war alters man - and that survival, no matter the method, is the laudatory aspect of human caring. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

If only the movie had made a little bit of effort to appear even vaguely even-handed in its contrast between selfless Chinese Heros who can single handedly destroy a battalion of stupid nasty Japanese and Japanese soldiers who on the whole spend their time running around leering and hunched over cackling like monkeys as they chase girls around and around. I have read many accounts and the Nanking Massacre is undoubtedly one of the worst in history. If only they had toned down the stereotyping then this film may have been a credible introduction to the topic for people and opened real discussion.

","I watched this movie with some expectations, however end up with great disappointment. <br/><br/>The movie plot is not touching at all,because the plot made me feel so fake. The details such as conversions between people are very unnatural and their behavior also did not fit in the environment,such as some of the women are showing really naive and silly behavior which do not make sense for an adult person.<br/><br/>The idea of the director is probably to contrast the beauty and naive of these women with the cruelty of Japanese. However, he failed to delivery this feeling by this badly-made film, and failed to show the complexity of human nature, especially during the war. Instead, you can only see simplified character such as purely naive girls and cruel soldiers. I would not recommend it."
"chu-james-278-87439","6","7","19","29 January 2012"," The Need of Bale
","Despite the fact that I'm Chinese, I would only give my humble review on the Movie and leave its related history out of this. <br/><br/>Cons Without doubt, Christian Bale is one the greatest actors whilst his acting has been proved in movies such as The Fighter, American Psycho. However, as usual, a movie that has a great actor like him would allocate more weight/time for his performance. This being said, I wouldn't say this is the right call when this Movie is about the sacrifice of 12 prostitutes (plus one boy) for 12 innocent convent students. Zhang has mistakenly put too much emphasis on Bale and perhaps between Bale's character, Miller and the prostitute, Yu Mo. For this reason, Zhang failed to give the prostitutes and the convent student girls enough opportunities to make a real impact in this already draggy movie. <br/><br/>Due to the lack of Enough delivery of the emotional relationship between the prostitute and the little soldier (who died in the movie), and the convent girl. The moving scenes therefore did not give me the right amount of sentimental dosage for my tears.<br/><br/>Secondly, the acting of some of the juniors was somewhat disappointing; for an example, the boy (headed out with the prostitutes in the end) at his best, did not carry his character fully. The father (whose daughter is among the students) did not show enough concern of his daughter in some of the scenes. <br/><br/>Pros Zhang is indeed a master in scenes creation. I reckon the battle scene, Bale's spreading of the red cross scene, and the convent students suicide attempt scene have showed me great colour contrast selection, sensational motions capturing, and good angle and timing directing. Some of us should have experienced those in his older movies such as Curse of the Golden Flower, Hero, etc..<br/><br/>To wrap up, the Flowers of War does show us that many great professionals have put in much hard work in its production, however film allocation of the characters fails to give viewers a supposedly tears running experience."

","The Chinese don't like the Japanese very much . In fact one of the few public demonstrations allowed in China is protests outside the Japanese embassy which are very frequent . The cause of this animosity if you didn't know was down to Japan's war of aggression against China in the 1930s and 40s which involved the same type of brutality the Nazis inflicted upon Eastern Europe . Take "" The Rape Of Nanking "" in 1937 which saw wholesale butchery and a death toll similar to the death rate seen in present day Iraq . Except this fatality rate in Iraq happened in eleven years of civil war while in Nanking this happened in six weeks and in one city . Multiply this by several thousand times and you can just fathom the hatred the Chinese still hold for the Japanese , not helped by a mainstream denial in Japan that none of this happened<br/><br/>One thing THE FLOWERS OF WAR does do well is showing the brutality of the Japanese and the fear the Chinese civilian population have of their conquerers . The unfortunate thing is it doesn't do anything else very well . Watching it you get the feeling there is several artistic agendas going on such as <br/><br/>War porn that'll appeal to war film junkies<br/><br/>Art house cinema especially to those people who don't like war porn <br/><br/>A Chinese version SCHINDLER'S LIST where a flawed human being saves the innocent from evil <br/><br/>People who enjoyed the BATMAN reboot down to Christian Bale <br/><br/>All these aspects seem to get in the way of one another and cancel each other out which makes for a relatively unsatisfying epic movie .

"Leofwine_draca","8","2","4","27 November 2012"," Great-looking movie
","Another great movie from Zhang Yimou, who seems to go from strength to strength as time goes on. THE FLOWERS OF WAR feels like it should be a true story, a kind of Chinese version of SCHINDLER'S LIST if you will, but despite the fictional nature of this production it proves to be a heartwarming and moving tale of courage and bravery in the face of oppression.<br/><br/>We're back in Nanking and the invasion of the Japanese in 1937. The film starts out on a strong footing as a traditional war movie, with some excellent action sequences taking place in the ruins of the bombed-out city. Yimou is able to capture the nature of modern warfare just as well as the more stylised and fantastic historical combat of, say, CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER. Soon, though, the film veers off on a tangent and instead introduces to a cast including a gang of prostitutes, a female choir and, most unlikely of all, an American mortician.<br/><br/>Christian Bale headlines the cast, and he's a revelation. I've got used to him being good, but not this good: it's one of the finest performances I've seen him give yet, and he displays a remarkable talent for comedy that was previously only seen in flashes of American PSYCHO. The rest of the cast equal him, and despite the lengthy running time the film never stalls or feels dull. Yimou tells an interesting, engaging tale and one that will keep you watching until the hard-hitting ending. I was caught up in it from the start, enjoyed the way it deliberately avoided cliché, and had a ball with it."

","I haven't seen many Chinese movies before but had to see this due to Bale's presence and I am glad that I saw. Great movie on the summation of beautiful photography, neat(but sometimes over the top) acting and few good war set-pieces. Christian Bale shows why he won the Oscar with a performance that shows transformation from a filthy persona to a responsible one. His facial expressions are a treat to watch particularly when he tries to conceal the truth with the Chinese girls. If you are a CB fan, you have to like the ending of the movie just because of the signature look on his face while driving away the truck. Ni Ni, the female lead is beautiful and does her part well. I thought the buildup of romance between Bale and Ni Ni was very well done, reminiscent of the traditional Asian way in which a male has to win over the heart of a female to make love. The pace of the movie is not tearaway and it moves at its own pace and I think its justified with the emotions in play with the characters. Direction is top notch on the strong base of a lavish production. Overall, I would recommend this movie to war film enthusiasts and also others."

","It's an incredibly moving story of human perseverance and redemption, set in one of the darkest moments in human history. The cinematography is great. The characters are compelling. The acting is superb, not just the leads Christian Bale and Ni Ni, but I was particularly impressed by Huang Tianyuan, who gave an incredible performance as the deceased priest's adopted son.<br/><br/>This movie had every reason to go down in history as an all-time great, but Zhang Yimou pulled his punches in two major ways:<br/><br/>First: he did not force the emotional impact of the Nanjing Massacre. There were some sad scenes to be certain, but it's not until later in the movie and the impact is softened by some immediate karmic justice inflicted on some of the perpetrators. The near-superhuman feats of Major Li to defend the girls further distract from the brutality of the Japanese occupation, and the hopeless plight of the Chinese. As a result, the emotional impact of the situation is dampened. For those unaware of the actual history, the film may not leave a real impression.<br/><br/>Secondly (Potential spoilers ahead): The sex scene between Yu Mo and John Miller takes a lot of the impact out of both of their character arcs (not to mention, given this film's subject matter, it certainly seems inappropriate for it to devolve into a romance). It is not out of character, per se, but distracts from the otherwise profound development that both of them go through as characters. For Yu Mo, it does not directly detract from the bravery of her actions, but narratively speaking, it transforms her role in the story into simply a reward for John Miller doing the right thing. Her character arc seems to be her evolution from a prostitute and sex object into a heroine who bravely sacrifices herself to save the innocent. But the film still treats her as a sex object anyway. For Miller, his character arc involves him transforming from a selfish man motivated only by money, booze, and sex, into a man who is willing to sacrifice himself to risk his own safety to give even a slim chance of salvation for the schoolgirls. However, turning his relationship with Yu Mo into a romantic one, it seems to portray his transformation from a man motivated by money, booze, and sex, into a man motivated by sex. Hardly compelling. Long story short, this is one of the worst instances of the trope ""the hot male and female leads have to hook up during the movie."""

It is a story which shows how the least of us become heroes.<br/><br/>Much of the movie is in English, the rest has subtitles. There is some first person narration by one of the students. I thought the oriental actors did a better job than Christian Bale who reminded me too much of Jeff Bridges. Chinese actress Ni Ni as Yu Mo gave us a good performance.<br/><br/>There are war scenes, killing, and a few rape scenes, although this is not a grindhouse exploitation film.

","Director Zhang YiMou, has delivered a powerful film in Flowers of War that touches on very prominent themes in Chinese culture. Zhang is able to weave an intricate web of characters with contradicting intentions, who ultimately change these intentions to serve a far better cause. The directing talent of one of China's most well regarded directors is on full display, as he balances themes of redemption, self-sacrificing, and the flawed hero. The aforementioned themes on the surface are typical universal themes in literature and film, however as the plot unfolds, they take on a specifically Chinese distinction, and remind us all of the beautifully intimate complexity of Chinese society and culture. In the beginning of the film we see the unlikely mingling, of Chinese prostitutes and catholic school girls. The film represents the prostitutes as typical stereotypes of that profession. Scantily clad women, who are loud, obnoxious, rude, and self-serving. Their demeanor and appearance contrast the young Catholic school girls in every way imaginable. These two sides come to resent each other rather quickly as they are forced to share in the sanctuary of the church in the midst of Japanese occupation. Even Mo, the de-facto leader of the prostitutes wants to use her skills as a prostitute to convince John, to get her and her friends, not the school girls, out of Nanking. However, this selfishness theme and resentment that the two groups have for one another will be turned on its head later in the film. Another universal theme that takes on a Chinese characteristic is that of the flawed hero. John on the surface seems to portray this theme perfectly. At the beginning of the film he is a drunkard who is solely interested in money and the services of the prostitutes he conveniently meets in a church of all places. However towards the end of the film he becomes the hero as he courageously protects the girls from harm, and ultimately leads them to safety. Yet his transformation pales in comparison to that of the prostitutes. The prostitutes will contradict the typical stereotypes of self-serving prostitutes to that of martyr like heroines. Chinese literature has a unique and intriguing fascination with blooming flowers and fruit. The title of the film Flowers of War also explores the connection between flowers and some heavy handed themes. What did Zhang want to represent with the flowers? This can be one of two things. The flowers could represent the sexual exploitation of women by Japanese soldiers. Hence flowers of war could represent spoils of war for the Japanese soldiers. However, the blooming of the flower could symbolize the ultimate sacrifice the women make in order to save the girls. A flower blooms at the apex of its beauty. This beauty shows through the women at the moment of their ultimate sacrifice. Shortly after the flower blooms the petals fall off and die, we also assume that the women die, shortly after the beauty in their character ""blooms"". However the dying petals make way for blooming of new fruit. This represents the renewed chance of life for the catholic school girls. Their lives are saved literally and figuratively. Literally from the murderous Japanese soldiers, and figuratively from the soul crushing cruelty of rape. So what's the point of this film? What is director Zhang trying to tell us? In order to answer this question, we need to go back and examine that idea of beautifully intimate complexity. Unfortunately in Asian countries, and particularly in China, the plight of women in oppressive male centric societies, is an all too common reality. From the casual adherence to forced prostitution, to the lifelong crippling anguish of foot binding. To say Chinese women have suffered, is a dramatic understatement. Yet there is an odd silver lining to all this suffering that this film and Chinese literature in general has shown. Chinese women show amazing capacity of self-sacrifice. Chinese literature is full of stories about women who give up so much, so that others may benefit. Whether it's a daughter who gouges out her own eyes so that her father can be cured, or it's a woman spy condemning herself to die so that her lover may live, Chinese woman consistently make these sacrifices. Whether it's because of their devalued sense of worth, or because years of oppression has strengthen their sense of empathy, we will never know for sure. But this is the wonderfully complicated beauty of Chines culture, which something so righteous can come from something so cruel. Towards the end of the Movie, Mo reveals that she was once like the school girls, and she states that, ""her story is just another misfortune"", just another child forced into prostitution, and there is no way she will let that happen to the school girls. Under no circumstances will she allow them to suffer the same fate as her. Jon also echoes this sentiment about the prostitutes when he states that, ""They (the prostitutes) love and hate like all of us and perhaps they know more about suffering than any of us"". Perhaps they do, but not just the prostitutes, all Chinese women know what it is to suffer, and through centuries of oppression, Chinese women have become the quintessential symbols of self-sacrificing women so that others may survive. In conclusion, I must say that this has become one of my favorite films. It teaches us not to judge too quickly someone that society has deemed to be of a lower stature. The women in this film has contradicted that notion that prostitutes are incapable of altruism and that they should be seen as lowly individuals. The fact is, they like any group that has been so cruelly oppressed for so long, are capable of extraordinary sacrifices. Within the backdrop of a vicious war, the inner beauty of these women's souls has fully bloomed into a beautiful flower."

","The Flowers of War tells a tale of survival, war time brutality, sacrifice and hope shining from within even the most unlikely source. It tells the tale of John Miller (Christian Bale) and the girls and women he helped to protect and hide during the Japanese attack on Nanking in 1937. Loosely based on real events, it's a movie that's sure to elicit some emotions.<br/><br/>First of all, to the movie's credit, it at least attempts to rise above taking sides. It shows that there exists good in both sides, but it also doesn't shy away from the atrocities committed by both of them. Ultimately it's a tale one's willingness to do the right thing even at the expense of one's own life and safety.<br/><br/>The film's directed by Zhang Yimou, of House of Flying Daggers and Curse of the Golden Flower fame, so you can bet that the production values are top notch. The actors are also very talented, and not just Bale. Ni Ni, playing the role of a prostitute Yu Mo, received a lot of praise for her performance, and deservedly so.<br/><br/>In the end it's hard to say more without spoiling the experience.

However, the filmmaker's alleged effort to meet the expectations from the audience at home or abroad seems to be too much, as the 'eroticism'- related scenes are not so compatible or even contradict with the atrocity and cruelty of war and the destructive harm on those innocent souls in the film. Nevertheless, the film is still incredibly powerful.

","The flowers of war is a heart wrenching film set in 1937 in the southern city of Nanjing, China. The director Zhang Yi Mou tells the story of an American mortician, a group of young girls raised in the catholic convent and a gaggle of prostitutes all trying to survive in the war torn city of Nanjing that has been overtaken by the Japanese. Zhang Yi Mou, one of China's fifth generation film makers, well known for his early films known as the red trilogy, masterfully captures the emotion, despair, and desperation of war through the eyes of a young girl named Shu. The film is narrated by Shu, a young girl who has grown up in the catholic convent where she and a group of young girls have learned the ways of Catholicism and have learned to speak English from the late resident priest, father Ingleman. Shu in this film is a symbol of innocence and virtue liken unto the mother of Jesus, the virgin Mary. Shu manages to survive a few near misses throughout the film. In the opening scene she is running and hiding from Japanese soldiers she remains undetected and is unintentionally saved by the charismatic John Miller (Christian Bale). Another time where Shu is spared this time of her virginity at the hands of Japanese soldiers is when two soldiers begin to tear her clothes from her body the two soldiers are shot in the back of the head by a Chinese sniper, the last of his platoon. She is saved once again when Shu and the other girls decide to jump from the cathedral's highest tower to preserve their virtue being taken by the Japanese. This time it is the films heroine Zhu Mo who pleads them not to jump and instead presents a plan of salvation where the prostitutes would take their place when the soldiers returned to collect them. John Miller an American mortician is trying desperately to avoid danger and death at the hands of the Japanese army. And he somehow finds himself the father and saviour like figure for the young girls and the group of prostitutes. He begins the film with a beard and looking quite rugged. His appearance resembles Jesus. All the characters in the film have found refuge in a cathedral the only place in Nanjing that hasn't been affected by the war. John goes through a significant change in his film from being a self-concerned mortician to a man of the cloth. John first puts on the robes of the late father Ingleman as a joke but through the film develops into the role of father figure and is referred to in the film as father John. He assumes the role of father to all that have found refuge in the Cathedral. The shaving of his beard portrays this change from selfish to selfless. With the hair gone and a clean-shaven face John begins his selfless journey where every decision he makes affects the lives of those who are now in his stewardship. <br/><br/>Our other main character, the heroine and the love interest to John is Yu Mo. The relationship develops between John and Yu Mo from a client service provider type relationship to a mutual respect and sincere love for one another. If John is the father then Yu Mo assumes the role as mother in this film. Yu Mo is like the older sister and considered the leader to the group of ladies from the Huai Xin river district. She sees a younger version of herself in Shu, because she also can speak English and spent 6 years in a convent. When she was thirteen she was raped by her stepfather. It was Yu Mo's plan to take the place of the young girls in order to preserve something that was taken from her her innocence and virtue. The ladies from the red light district in their selfless act of sacrifice are given a makeover to look young and innocent to trick the Japanese. This honourable sacrifice seems to outweigh the dishonourable lives they have lived as prostitutes. After their makeover they say to one another comments like ""if my mother could see me now, she would be so proud"". Referring to their fresh faced innocent look, like they did in their youth. Zhang Yi Mou uses some interesting symbolism in this film. I think red is a symbolic colour in this film which may characteristic of an Yi Mou film. Red represents death, beauty, safety and virtue in this film. Yu Mo has red lipstick and a red Qi pao (traditional Chinese dress) representing beauty and desire. A huge red cross on a cloth outside the cathedral that represented safety, peace and refuge. Red is the colour of blood and violence. We see red blood sprayed across a white sheet as Dou one of the prostitutes is violently stabbed by a Japanese soldier after being raped. This can be compared with the Japanese flag. It has a white background with a red sun splatterd across it. One other symbolic feature in this film is the stain glass windows of the cathedral. Shu first sees the group of prostitutes through the windows and this image stays in her mind. When she is saved from being raped it took place under the huge windows. When the soldiers were killed by a sniper Shu was left with one of the soldiers blood sprayed across her face staring up at the windows with the sun shinning through reflecting the colours of the window onto Shu's face, another memory that we assume will remain with her for the rest of her life. The symbolism in this film along with a renowned director, great actors and a heart wrenching and well told story really made watching this film an enjoyable experience."
"isaac-niven","7","0","0","17 May 2014"," General analysis of Zhang's Flowers of War **Spoiler alert**
","The movie 'Flowers of War' tells a story of heroism in the face of adversity. It also reinforces the widespread Chinese sense of pain arising from the Japanese occupation. The director Zhang Yimou uses graphic violence together with instances of depraved behaviour and values to portray the invading Japanese force as lacking in any human qualities. This may explain the reason for using a high profile western actor with Hollywood fame in one of the principal roles. The movie is set in the city of Nanking in 1937 as the last remaining Chinese troops fall and the Japanese took complete control. The story is predominantly told from the perspective of one of the survivors, a convent girl. John Miller (the actor Christian Bale) is a mortician and he was in Nanking to assist with the burial of a priest of the Catholic Church. Finding that his services are no longer needed, he looks around the church to salvage anything of value as payment for his troubles. Shortly after his arrival a group of Qing Huai River prostitutes arrive looking for Gu the cook. Despite attempts to exclude them, they scale the wall and make themselves at home in the cellar. Seeing a white person in the convent, they attempt to seduce him in the hope that he can assist them in escaping Nanking. The film opens with a scene of deep fog, in the midst of which three convent girls scramble to find a hiding place from the Japanese troops trying to capture or kill them. This scene immediately introduces the audience to the cruelty, senselessness and waste of war which is reinforced by graphic violence and depraved behaviour. The Japanese are portrayed as men who have lost their humanity. They are undeterred from their quest to rape the convent girls. At one point, Miller flys a flag of truce and appeals to their humanity, however they are undeterred. In contrast the Chinese soldiers, in the face of certain death, tried to protect the girls even going so far as to return one of the girl's shoes that had been lost on the battlefield. Miller transforms from a selfish drunkard, dressing up in priest's robes to impress Yu Mo, the head prostitute. In the end, Miller took on the mantle of the priest and became a selfless hero. The storyline focuses attention on the saving of a small group of convent girls from the evil intent of the Japanese soldiers, which seems to be the central theme of the movie. The girls are initially saved by Miller, then by a group of Chinese soldiers, by a lone Chinese soldier later on, by Miller again, by the prostitutes and by George Chen a 12 year old boy placed in charge after the death of the old priest. They are finally saved by the 'traitorous' father of one of the girl's. Each of these saviours effectively redeem themselves through their devotion and selflessness. Thus the movie is a device to portray salvation, selflessness and loyalty of the Chinese and Western characters within the mire of depravity, perpetrated by the invading Japanese. The Chinese soldier's struggle against huge odds, is well illustrated. They face a Japanese invading army which is well equipped with tanks and machine guns. The Chinese soldiers use desperate tactics to gain advantage, mounting suicide missions as human shields to allow one of their fellow soldiers at the rear of the formation to get close enough to the tanks to blow them up. Though they realise that the Japanese will win the battle, they stay and fight. Even the last Chinese soldier is portrayed as superior to the Japanese, wiping out a Japanese platoon in his last act of defiance. Many scenes went on for longer periods than they needed to, to underline certain situations. For example, the Japanese commander defended the behaviours of his troops, despite the callousness shown towards innocent civilians. Bodies litter the streets highlighting the massacre of innocent citizens and the lack of respect for human dignity displayed by the Japanese. During the film, there is a constant background sound of gunfire and mortar shells occurring to highlight that the environment is highly dangerous. The film uses many devices to encourage the audience to emotionally buy into the story and its underlying themes. For example, violin music was used effectively during emotional scenes to touch the audiences' sense of compassion and concern. A convent girl falls from the second floor landing on her head after being abused by Japanese soldiers. One of the prostitutes sneaks out of the church to return to the brothel to retrieve some strings for her instrument to play for a dying boy. There is a beautiful sense of poignancy and uselessness of this mission as the girl dies on the excursion while the boy has already died. The Japanese officer plays his melody of home reminiscences and reveals one of the few humane snapshots of the Japanese occupying force. This abruptly ended when he slavishly followed his orders from his commanders, knowing that they would result in harm to innocent young girls. The movie ends with a clichéd scene of the hero driving off into the sunset with the girls that he saved. The use of graphic violence with many gruesome depictions of killings, particularly by gunshot, is contrasted with scenes containing humanity, humour and romance. Zhang is using the eternal theme of good triumphing over evil as well as over emphasising the callousness of a despised invader."

","THE FLOWERS of WAR is a disturbing yet touching film that truly captures the horrors of the Japanese occupation of Nanking, 1937. Long, graphically realistic scenes of war violence and carnage, as well as the numerous rapes which often ended in murder. Though the transformation in his character from totally selfish to completely selfless is a little sudden, Christian Bale gives a strong performance as John Miller. Virtually all of the Chinese ladies--both the Winchester Cathedral girls and the courtesans--are similarly well-portrayed. The beautifully peaceful singing by the choir girls provides a believable contrast to the horrors going on all around them. Special mention should also be given to Dawei Tong as Major Li.<br/><br/>While THE FLOWERS of WAR puts no blankets over the brutality of this event, it also shows both sides of the Japanese coin. Even at their most barbaric, the marauding soldiers still come across as eminently human. Humans, of course, can be pretty terrible, but regardless, I know of very few western films that succeed so well in portraying the WWII-era Japanese as something other than just faceless, sinister, bestial monsters. The ending is unexpected, heart-rending, but similarly believable."
"cherold","8","0","0","7 February 2014"," I understand the objections, but still find this powerful and well filmed
","The movies I've seen by the brilliant Yimou Zhang tend to fall roughly into two categories; big epics like Hero or smaller dramas like The Road Home. Flowers of War is an attempt to straddle these two styles, with a mix of bravura action and small, intense dramatic moments. It's difficult to pull off, and I wouldn't say it always works, but for the most part, this is a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>Flowers of War has received a lot of ""The Color Purple""-style criticism along the lines of, ""some things are too ugly to be made so beautiful."" And while I disagreed with that analysis of Purple, I do, to some extent, agree here.<br/><br/>The movie immediately shows typical Zhang flourishes, like a small but marvelous moment where a cart full of fleeing people cuts the strings of a musical instrument as Japanese soldiers are hunting down and killing Chinese civilians in the famous Rape of Nanking.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are intense and disturbing. I had no familiarity with the Nanking massacre, and I would have thought it was exaggerated if I didn't spend a couple of hours reading about it. It represents the heights of human depravity. Imagine the horrific events of the movie repeated hundreds of thousands of times over a six-week period.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on a white mortician who comes to a girl's school which also winds up being sanctuary for some prostitutes. This leads to a lot of conflict and, in spite of the horrors, a certain amount of humor. There is also a thread running through of the last of the city's Chinese soldiers vainly attempting to stop the Japanese.<br/><br/>There is something disconcerting about Zhang's bravura filmmaking in the context of the horrors of this massacre. A rape scene centered around the school's gorgeous stained-glass window is electrifying, but one's enthusiasm for its stylistic grace conflicts with the grim horrors of the scene. <br/><br/>There is also a wonderful scene with the final soldier, played brilliantly by Dawei Tong, taking out a slew of enemy soldiers. It's an exciting action sequence full of intense moments, but it feels a little unrealistic and out of place, as though it belongs in a different film altogether.<br/><br/>So yes, it's often unrealistic, leans too much on clichés, and is filmed in a way that often seems more about the art of filmmaking than about the content of the movie. <br/><br/>On the other hand, there is much to recommend it. First off, the filmmaking really is incredible. Even if you object that it's the wrong style for the subject, there are a lot of moments where you have to be in awe of the artistic vision.<br/><br/>The movie also has some terrific performances. Besides Tong's tight- lipped soldier, Christian Bale is excellent, bringing a mix of macho obnoxiousness and genuine feeling to the clichéd role of a cynic finding his soul. Above all is Ni Ni as prostitute Yu Mo, a mix of brains, beauty, bravery, and flirtatious mastery that made me think of Lauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not.<br/><br/>The movie is touching, and funny, and stylish, and thoroughly absorbing, for all its flaws.<br/><br/>It's also painful to watch. I know there are movies that are said to handle the Nanking Massacre better than this one, but it's such an overwhelmingly grim subject that I just cannot bear to delve into it again."

"rogerdarlington","Null","0","0","30 September 2013"," Not the best film on the topic but well worth viewing
","In the winter of 1936-37, the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, then the capital of China, was so unspeakably brutal that it was dubbed the rape of Nanjing. Most people in the West have never heard of the event but, in China, it is still an intensely raw issue. In recent years, two Chinese films have been made about the occupation. In 2009, there was ""City Of Life And Death"" directed by Lu Chuan. Then, in 2001, we had ""Flowers Of War"" directed by Zhang Yimou.<br/><br/>""City Of Life And Death"", which is unquestionably the far superior work, made little effort to appeal to a Western audience, although it did have a European character - the real-life John Rabe, known as the German Schindler - as a key character. ""The Flowers Of War"", however, was deliberately pitched at a Western audience: the chosen director had achieved considerable acclaim (and rightly so) for films like ""Hero"" and ""House Of Flying Daggers""; the central character is a (fictional) American mortician played by Christian Bale (echoes of his much earlier role in ""Empire Of The Sun""); almost half its dialogue is in English; and it was accorded a massive budget of some $100M from the Chinese Government and state-backed banks. At the domestic (Chinese) box office, it proved to be the highest-grossing Chinese production of all time but, in the United States, it was a total flop.<br/><br/>The story - drawn from a novel - is actually a powerful one: convent girls and prostitutes, with seemingly nothing in common, thrown together as they take refuge from the marauding Japanese inside a Catholic church where the priest is dead and their only hope is a drunken Westerner. While it is an invented tale, the context in which it is told was all too real and nothing that is shown or hinted at comes near the horror of what actually happened. So ""The Flowers Of War"" does not have the strengths of the more realistic ""City Of Life And Death"" but it is well worth viewing and would be instructive to Americans who think the Second World War started with Pearl Harbor."

","Very touching, well-done film. Several very graphic/disturbing scenes, but likely necessary to capture the feel of the time. A piece of history I knew virtually nothing about, so glad to have received my education in this manner.<br/><br/>Might have been nice to have sub-titles, though without speaking a word of Chinese or Japanese I could almost always get the essence of the many conversations that took place in other-than-English. I agree with another reviewer who commented that a romantic scene amidst all the carnage and atrocities in the movie seemed somewhat out-of-place. I think I'd have given more points if the screen-writer had seen fit to figure out a reasonable way to avoid going the obvious route in that scene. Kudos in particular to the girl (can't recall her name), who felt her father was a traitor. Outstanding performance from beginning to end!<br/><br/>The movie is quite long and I felt it could have been shortened a bit by culling some of the war footage in the early part of the movie. As a result, it took us a bit longer to ""commit"" to the movie. Overall, an excellent movie."

","Yimou Zhang (The House of the Flying Daggers, Hero) gets away of Chinese traditional heroes to approach a more serious topic: the Nanking rape massacre, set in 1937 during the Japanese invasion of the Chinese city of Nanking. Christian Bale is cast as an American grave digger that ends up posing as a priest to save a group of prostitutes and a group of former student young girls on a monastery. The camera and photography are very strong, with the mood set in a very sober fashion. Almost no soundtrack accompanies Flowers of War's powerful scenes, belonging to the amazing actors the responsibility of delivering emotions to the audience. The Flowers of War is not a traditional war movie as it focuses on the characters and their specific situation and not the war itself. This is the other side of war, the civilian side. Great performances and once again a stellar Christian Bale make you care for this amazing story that does not try to cheat you with a fake quality seal. The dialog is mainly Chinese spoken, only with Bale left with some room for English, making the Flowers of War very believable and immersive.

","The Flowers of War is a Chinese film by famous director Yimou Zhang, and it issued on December 15, 2011. Why this film can achieved a very good results, it not only because the director Yimou Zhang plan four-year but also the film has a strong background story. As a fifth-generation director, Yimou Zhang's movie is different from the past this time, he invited the famous Hollywood star and special effects team to complete this film, and he uses his own passion promote the Chinese films to the world.<br/><br/>The Flowers of War tell us a story of some female students and the prostitutes of Qinhuai River in order to avoid the Japanese, they came to the church, where they met an American John. When Japanese find these female students, they asked them celebration for the successful occupation of Nanjing. At last, these prostitutes want to save these students, they decided to go to the war. Although the story is not so complicated, it contains a profound meaning and dedication. So I think this film is not just a war or a history film, it also a drama film. After I watch this film, I have a lot of feelings, because it shocked to me. First of all, there are a lot of contrasts in this film. It not only has contrast between the characters but also contrast between the colors. In the aspects of characters, the contrast is between the prostitutes of Qinhuai River and female students. The female students are very innocent and they afraid of the Japanese, they do not understand anything. But these prostitutes smell and talk to each other with many bad words, it looks very different from the female students at all. At the end of the film, these prostitutes in order to the students to sacrifice himself. This plot make me has impressed. Because at that moment, these looked timid but in fact useful patriotism let the audience feel they are brave. For example, there is a woman who named Yumo in the film, she live in the brothel because of her bad family, but she still does not give up, and used her true and courage to impress for audience. There is also has Americans in the movie who named John. At the beginning of the movie, the director he shaped into a greedy and lustful character to him, but when he saw a female student killed by the Japanese, he think he wants to save these students. I think this is the real feel in his heart. The transformation of these characters make the film becomes more interested and attractive. In the aspect of the color, it also has a lot of contrast in this film. Like a war scene in the beginning of the film, the director uses the colors of black and white to highlight the relentless and darkness of the war. But when Yumo and others women show up, they are dressed in brightly colored costumes, and with the colorful windows of the church, it like entering another world, and let the audience have a different feel. Yimou Zhang uses these particular aesthetics let audience have different visual effects.<br/><br/>In this movie, we can see a lot of Chinese elements. We can find that dub of this film is not Mandarin. It is the Nanjing which is a dialect of Chinese. I think this is can reflect the characteristics of China better. Also, the women in the movie wearing the cheongsam, playing the zither, and singing the songs of the Chinese style, these are all the typical oriental elements and a kind of self-Oriental. The director wanted to use his lens to let the world know China and Chinese film, and maybe this is also the goal of the fifth generation directors.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this film is has very deep meaning, it use a Chinese real war as a background, and a distinctive character to describes the content of the movie. So I have complex senses which are complex and depressing. I feel sad for the dead soldiers and feel helpless of damage by the war, I also feel more proud of Yumo. I think the film is to tell the audience a story, if this story makes you have space to think that meaning a successful film. In this film, the strong Chinese characteristics and cruel historical truth let the whole world to understand China. The director uses the meticulous shooting style and some strong characters to let everyone know the progress of Chinese movies. So, I think this is a good film."

","""The Flowers Of War"" (2011)(Wikipedia, 2013), another piece of work from director Yimou Zhang. A well known fifth generation film maker in the Chinese film industry. The Flower of War is a name full of contrast and contradiction. The story is based in Nanjing during the Japanese invasion during the second World War. A movie that gives our judgmental minds a shake up, a contrast between the holly and the impure and what they all mean when tested by life threatening situations. A group of students from the convent and a group of prostitutes find themselves seeking shelter in the same church. The mortician John who is also at the church to pick up the dead body of the resident priest finds himself tangled in the mess when he finds himself feeling sympathetic for the children after the Japanese soldiers stormed into the church and killed two of the students. The setting of the films is a war scene, rubbles everywhere, half collapsed building and smoke everywhere from the explosions, the whole picture give the viewers a sense of sorrow and doom. Everything you see is covered in thick grey dusts from the building debris. Humanity is the core element of the film emphasized in all the major sections of the film, starting from the beginning where the Chinese soldiers had a chance to retreat to safety but instead they sacrificed their lives in order to safe the girl students from the pursuing Japanese soldiers; John the mortician who had little concerns for anyone other than himself at least it seems ended up risking his life to stay and help the children; the prostitutes that even the girls despised at the beginning so much they would not share a bathroom with, ended up making the grand sacrifice to take the children's place of what seem to be certain ill fate. The director uses bright colors throughout the film to reinforce the theme of humanity is like a beam of light in darkness and a rainbow in the grey sky. The sense where the prostitutes arriving at the church, a total contrasting irony reinforced by the colorful clothing the prostitute were wearing; The bullet shattering the church's colorful glass windows; the explosion where the last Chinese gave his life to save the people in the church where brightly colored clothes were blown out of the building. These were emphasized by using slow motion technique to make the screen shot outstanding and memorable. Perhaps humanity is not determined by occupations and social status, more often than not, people that have lower social status or people in occupations that society despises are not there by choice, many have a story behind it and dose not make these people evil or heartless, in times of need people that we least expect can prevail and surprise many by showing who they are. The prostitutes did just that, as society despises them and they themselves to a certain degree accept. They were not prostitutes by choice and they all had their untold stories that has led them to where they ended up. Despite all that, when the humanity in these women were called upon, they bloomed like the most beautiful flower in the world and what they did for a living suddenly became meaningless as they will forever remembered for their bravery and their sacrifice to maintain the purity and innocence of the children. The scene where they did their final performance to show the children their famous song, they were illustrated as shining stars with glorious color and aura. Discovery and revelation of humanity in this film was quite well illustrated. Take John for example, at the beginning he was selfish and only cares for his greed and lust. During this phase his screen image was scruffy, dirty and covered in dust; the transition period where he debates with himself what his heart wants him to do, he was little bit cleaner but still rough round the edges; finally when he decided to let the humanity prevail, his image became clean shaven and quite a few shots with sunlight shinning on him like an angel and a savior. Attitude in life is as important as important as your life skills. John on various occasions used a little humour to ease the tension and make the situation easier for the children to cope, good example is when he told the children, 'if you are scared of someone, imagine that person sitting butt-naked on the toilet then it won't be so scary anymore. A great film in my view but I can already see the emotional reaction and the two-sidedness of opinion between the international and the national point of view as it tried to depict war and the use of the prostitute is surely to kick up a fuss amongst the Chinese audiences with strong cultural opinions and beliefs."

","Before I analysis The Flowers of War, one thing for sure, there is no doubt that a classic film made by Yimou Zhang. The continuation of the fifth generation director makes traditional creative mode and express the individual suffering and choice in the history circumstance. Yimou Zhang shows a story of the thirteen fortitude women in The Flowers of War. In addition, every an important contemporary director has its own process visual images of a gimmick, Yimou Zhnag's unique is that photography and color, it has highlight expression in this film. If The Flowers of War made by others directors to shoot, it must be another appearance and the color might be black or dark. But, Yimou Zhang was brave who picked out the gaudy color under the background of a brutal war. Also, he selected script from active demand novelist Geling Yan's work. The story expresses to the audience, in 1937, the rape of Nanjing, Simultaneously, this fictitious drama about convent students and whores are hiding together in the church. Thus, whole film is shooting around the church. <br/><br/>Therefore, ever since their appearance, these whores have become the focus of this film. In the slow camera, they had heavy made-up, wore different jewel and Chi-Pao as well as leather overcoats. Instructor Lee saw them through sighting telescope. He once focused on Yu mo; Shujuan, a student girl, kept her sight on them, especially Yumo, the most outstanding one. When John, a rascal foreigner, saw them, he couldn't help admiring them. It's certain that, up to now, all these were Yimou Zhang's true skills. He regained his skills in creating female characters. However, this time, the background was set to the Nanjing City during the period of the Republic of China rather than rural areas. By the other hand, the interpersonal relationships between some groups of characters stood careful reading. Firstly, it's the relationship between Shujuan and her traitor father, and it took a significant part of the movie. Secondly, it's the relationship between Yumo and his evil step father who uncover his step-daughter secrete. They were daughters who had fathers but encountered misery and death. The setting of Shujuan and Yumo were internally related from their names to their character. Things changed unexpectedly but were internally correlated. The music tone in this film began with the Japanese folk music of Hometown followed by girl student's choir chants and ended with the Qinghuai jing by whores. They were beautiful but were of completely different senses under different circumstances. <br/><br/>It is generally recognized, the film much more fulfilling than fiction. For example, the glass of church actually played an important visual effect in the film. Also, the main actress; Yumo's Chi-Pao each piece looks like an exquisite embroidery. Those things are reflects the unique aesthetic of Yimou Zhang. However, a number of criticisms around this film, like obvious lack of dramatic climax and using too much colors to express the harrowing story. But, I think since want to show the war from the perspective of women that color, costume, make-up and dialogue style would be stand out women's peculiarity. While, The Flowers of War is a dejected and ungainly piece of storyline, exaggerative and grotesque visual effects are delivered with startling conviction. Therefore, compared to the same kind of patriotic films that this style of precious. <br/><br/>In this film, the soundtrack play an important role, it is attract to audience's eyes the other approach. There are three diverse music go through whole film. Also, are respectively three different means. The first one is Qin huai jing; it is stand for beautiful scenery of Nanjing. The second one is convent poetry that delivers to peace and belief. And the last soundtrack is harrowing, might symbol of the second war and China lost Nanjing at the time. As we know Qigang Cheng's score is effective but goes a bit heavy on the violins. <br/><br/>In conclusion, I think too much moves by The Flowers of War. The director used different individual's angle to display Chinese's patriotism. Such as; whores, students, foreigners and army. At the same time, the writer changed fiction made scenarios more vibrant added Yimou Zhang's aesthetics taste was lends his film unique."

","This film review is about <<13 flowers of war>> by Yimou Zhang in 2011. It is a movie based on the Nanking Massacre with a story around soldiers, girls, singing women, a boy and a fake father fighting the enemy in their own way.<br/><br/>The movie is 146 minutes long and I cried for 140 minutes. I was touched by those ordinary but great people, those warm and honorable souls. It does not like other movies about war, which are depressive and heavy with lots of national heroes and unforgivable enemies. This movie has many colorful scenes and focus on a special group of victims. The storyline is very clear and attractive.<br/><br/>The 13 flowers is not the real 13 women, it is 12 women and a boy. The main character is Yumo, who is the leader and the most popular one in those singing girls. They are also living as whores. But they are not like others; they are pretty, lovely and have elegant looking. Yumo used to be a student of church like the girls do; she could have another kind of life if she was not raped by her stepfather and forced her to entertain the guests. Their body and human dignity are been violated, their job is been spurned. The culture defined their characters. But in the end, the ""humble"" women save 12 lives and sacrifice themselves gratefully. The shine of humanity is pretty dazzling on them. Especially when one of them wants to play a complete song to that injured soldier before he died. She said the young soldier looked so similar to her brother. She went out under the dangerous guarding to find her string in her working place. On her way back, she was found by the enemy and they took her. Because of the beauty she had, she was raped by all of them. How cruel the war is. It is strongly compared with the nicely humanity. The humanity is dramatically performing in this movie. Those people who were supposed to be humble expressed gracious; who were supposed to be nobody expressed like a hero. With no doubt, the gracious people were selfless and kind, the real heroes were brave and sacrificial.<br/><br/>As the part of cinematographic style, there are many scenes I fascinated. There is a huge colorful window on the top floor of church; it is so different with the whole background color. The girl who narrated the story in movie always looked out through the window. The beautiful light irradiated on her face and body, it gives me a pure and peaceful feeling. Through the window, she saw the soldier who saved their lives; she saw the enemies who were guarding them; she saw those singing women forcing to come into the church with reckless laugh. Every time her emotion has fluctuated, she must stand in front of the window. Her attitude changed about those women from contempt to dependent, which also reflect the women's gracious humanity. Another great scene is when the enemies coming into the church and wanted to rape the girls, the fake father overcome his cowardice and bravely stand in front of the colorful window with a huge red cross flag and a full of righteous speech as a real father to save the girls. The whole picture is surrounding by a holy light, without national boundaries, without religion, just the compassion, justice and morality in the deep humanity. The other scene is about when the girl was almost raped by the enemy, there was a bullet from the soldier accurately shooting through the window and pierced on his head. The girl was saved. The shot was performed more slowly than the average when the bullet is pierced the window. It seems like the bullet was carrying a strongly power to come to save them, just like God was coming to save them.<br/><br/>The ending does not clearly describe the experiences and the future that those women and the boy have. It leaves us a space for imagine. They know what they will face when they get there and they persuade themselves that it is their daily job, if they can hold they may keep alive, but the girls cannot if they go. I was so touched by their action.<br/><br/>This film is transferring a spirit, not record of actual events like other movies about Nanking Massacre. This film is also a brilliant gift of tenacious and resilient women with a unique angle of a story in Nanking Massacre. The audience emerges with a sense of varied and gracious humanity in war."

The colorful ceiling,the overacted raping and bloody killing scene are really floating half way there and exaggeratedly unappropriated. plus the church has nothing to do with Chinese traditions, The God father acted like a bastard and soon conscious calls up amazingly! On the other hand the story is true or not remains to be seen anyways. when it ended you will still have no idea what is it trying to say, you feel nothing but angry and unpleasant. After all this is a cheap patriotism ""snack"" for me. This movie might be one of the worst movie that YIMOU have ever made for me."

","The whole story could be told in the maximum of 7 minutes: everything else is a terrible waste of time. It's not only highly predictable, but it hangs the whole narrative on a series of superficial clichés. The gender stereotypes are just an example of it.<br/><br/>At a certain time, when we're about to sleep with the lack of story, we watch the screenplay turn into a desperate attempt to quickly develop the characters, by adding some psychological depth.

It makes me uncomfortable that he (or original novel author) tried to have butt-wiggling hookers involved in with such a humanity tragedy in such a unmanly style. I heard this movie was nominated for this year's Oscar Best Foreign Language movie. I don't care it will win or not. Even if it wins, it is still nothing to me but a sick movie made by a director with who-know-what-he-is-thinking mind. I remembered I watched this director's another movie To Live, which is pretty good. That's actually the reason why I watched this movie, but it turned out very disappointing!

","highly expected but then it turned out just flat and boring. we, my  wife and i, never got connected with this pathetically written and  directed movie. for those who played in this movie, i couldn't blame  them did poor jobs since the screenplay, the dialog, the directing  failed to get them connected with the emotion and sentiment that should  be there in this worthless story written by a Chinese female author who  lives in America. there were moments that we all felt the dialog in  this film sounded like translated Chinese. from the very beginning, the  plot already showed its shallowness and contrite of the formulaic way  how the Chinese would make the battle scenes against the marching  winning Japanese military force. there were typical formatted dialog  and scenes that the Chinese communist party would use as a MUST to  describe the kmt party and its army were not enthusiastic to fight  against the Japanese, that's so typical way to fool their own people by  claiming the communist insurgents were the only Chinese who loved their  country, their people and they were the only party that fought the  Japanese. yet the truth was already widely known to the world outside  china, the communist insurgent force rarely engaged to fight the  Japanese but only ambushed the kmt national army whenever they could.  they were just fighting gorilla war against their own people and let  the kmt led army to fight the war. it's just so contrive and disgusting  to hear the similar dialog in every movie out of communinit china that  they were the only people who cared about china's future, they were the  liberator of china, the only hope for the Chinese people. but in the  meantime, soldiers who stayed and sacrificed their lives in this movie  were those from the kmt army, they were the only people who stayed and  fought in vain to stop the Japanese invasion forces.  by mentioning this historical fact, it also reminded me that the  governing Chinese communist party just announced to ban most of the  historical genre dramas related to any former dynasty, because those  dramas only mirror imaged and embarrassed the current regime, not just  on a par with all the corruptions in Chinese history but surpassed them  thousand times.  the other thing that made me feel that in this film, the Chinese women,  young female catholic students or the Chinese prostitutes, they were  just so pathetic in this movie. their country was in turmoil and their  country people were killed by the Japanese, but these women were still  so ridiculously looked down upon each other, they fought their own  worthless social class turf war in a church surrounded by the invasion  Japanese force, even the usage of a toilet got a social taboo.   director zhang seemed to be non-exist in this film, just let the  lifeless storyline to pan out without any personal touch. by signing  c.b. and asked him to play a role in this movie also proved to be  meaningless but wasted a lot money.  from the very beginning of this movie, i never got a chance to get  connected with any character in this pathetic movie. what i got were:  boring storyline, boring scenario, boring characters, boring historical  background, boring directing. there was nothing like watching similar  movies about Jewish people were massacred by the Nazis, absolutely  nothing worthwhile to watching. there was absolutely no emotional or  sentimental sadness this movie ever touched us."

","This movie sends a very acute message into the heads of any viewer and that is, why hasn't this movie been shown to everybody?!? This movie shows a tragedy that has scared humanity in such a sophisticated way that it is disturbingly captivating.The cast gives this movie a depth that without them would of been another cheesy action gore movie. The young girls show emotion and sadness in a way that seems to penetrate the heart in such a bold way. I have seen many movies of Nanking and they have all been great, but this movie does it in a way that leaves the viewer with a sense of hope and awe. I am not saying this movie does not have flaws, but it is hard to find any. The women and Bale at the beginning of this movie are unlikable (excluding Ni Ni), but quickly grow on you. This movie has depth, balance, and scary realism. Nothing about this movie is over or under-blown. If a person wants to watch a movie about Nanking and not throw up/cry at every scene, that doesn't just leave you at the end of the movie feeling like humanity is lost or just leave you numb,watch this. It is perfectly balanced in presentation, taste, and will not leave you wanting therapy."
"kluseba","8","1","2","24 October 2012"," Acting with true emotions
","This is one of the more interesting movies about the infamous rape of Nanking during the Japanese invasion. In comparison to many other contemporary Chinese history flicks, this one is gladly not so much overloaded with patriotic propaganda aspects apart of a lonesome Chinese solider who easily kills dozens of Japanese soldiers in one scene.<br/><br/>The movie focuses much more on stunning costumes, epic graphics and a great camera work. Zhang Yimou is definitely one of the best directors world wide in this category and just this aspect is worth experiencing this film.<br/><br/>The film also has a very strong character development. Christian Bale really shines in his role as alcoholic mortician and goes through quite some changes. Another amazing acting comes from the young and highly talented Ni Ni who is not only one of the most beautiful women in modern cinema but also a convincing actress in her role as a tough prostitute with a breakable heart. The acting of Huang Tianyuan as desperate but energizing assistant and protégé of the deceased head father of the convent is also stunning and I hope to see more movies with him in the future.<br/><br/>The characters all get some depth and have a quite good chemistry that grows over the movie and makes the heroic sacrifice of the prostitutes for the convent schoolgirls credible in the end. This is where the drama gets really human and touching and you may have a little tear in your eyes by watching the final moments of this film. Despite the dark and desperate historic context and many tension filled moments, this film also some humorous moments that light up the atmosphere and where Christian Bale really shines. Let's also mention that some of the Japanese and especially Colonel Hasegawa who is portrayed by the strong Atsuro Watabe get some depth through this film and are not only represented as brutal killing machines but as cultivated and intellectual characters with a slightly sadistic core which makes them more realistic.<br/><br/>Even though this movie has a few lengths, it's strong enough to convince thanks to a very great acting with true emotions. The ending is a little bit too open in my humble opinion and I would have liked something more concrete but this only shows how much one gets to adore all these characters in a little bit less than two hours and a half of running time. Any fan of contemporary Chinese cinema should definitely check this very detailed, passionate and visual movie out."

It also left me fearfully pondering on the capability of humans to inflict unthinkably gruesome acts on their fellow man. <br/><br/>Brilliant cinematography, spectacular effects, commendable acting and excellent casting.<br/><br/>Please watch this film - it makes you terribly uncomfortable, which can only mean that it succeeded in delivering its message."

Most of the war movies are about brutalities, killings, winning or losing, heroic acts but what I liked about this movie is that it is focused on the sufferings, responsibilities, innocence, dominance and above all sacrifice. It also throws light on the human instinct that dominates with gaining power or by getting under influence of your enemy. Although this movie is not that popular as some funky hiphop action movies are but still it is a piece of art. All the team members behind this movie have done a great job."

After a group of prostitutes show up he only wants one thing. After drinking all night he wakes up in a priest's clothes and witnesses an unspeakable horror that forever changes his way of thinking. This is an extremely emotional movie that deserves to be seen be a bigger audience then it will get. Christian Bale gives another Oscar worthy performance in a man who goes from selfish to selfless after witnessing how Japanese soldiers treat the young children that are staying at a church. Many parts of this movie are difficult to watch but this is also a movie that deserves to be seen. The movie will draw out many emotions in you ranging from anger to horror, but at it's core it is a very heartfelt journey of one man trying to save many. ""Life Is Beautiful"" meets ""Defiance"" with a little ""Schindlers List"" thrown in. I recommend this, if you can handle it. Overall, a little slow moving but a movie that deserves to be seen.

"sunspire33","5","20","141","15 December 2011"," Inspired To Warn Others About This Film
","I watched this movie in Beijing on the 15th (day before the official release). I have never written a negative review of a film, but this movie inspires me to do so. <br/><br/>There is never a moment in this movie that will bring tears to your eyes. There is no romance except one extremely brief non-nude pseudo-sex scene with Christian Bale that maybe lasted 1 minute (could be a Disney scene almost). The character interaction consists of one liners with a quirky but entertaining performance by Christian Bale. Part of the reason why this movie fails is that there is no other stars in this film. There is Christian Bale and then there are 12 prostitutes taking refuge in the church, 12 young innocent choir girls and 1 boy. Then there are the visitors to the church in the form of Chinese or Japanese soldiers. That's the entire movie. (not a spoiler is it?)<br/><br/>The 90% of the movie takes place inside a Catholic church, making this more similar to a play, in my opinion, then a movie. The other 10% of the movie is action scenes on the war torn streets of Nanking. <br/><br/>This movie tries to be a grand spectacle Oscar-worthy effort, but fails on all fronts. The direction and cinematography is very sub-par. Action scenes do not flow; there are almost no establishing shots. Character development is non-existent in that the film does not give you reason to care about the characters in this film. Yes there are rape scenes with no nudity that depict girls that we are not given an opportunity to become emotionally attached to. Christian Bale's performance was about the only watchable aspect to this movie, but even that was no where near the caliber of The Dark Night (which shows how much a director can bring out the best or worst in an actor).<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a movie that tries to be something that will create emotion in the audience, which you can't do with comic-book movie style shallow character development. Action scenes are not memorable. Honestly, this has to be the worst movie I've seen Christian Bale appear in. The movie did not provoke any emotion in me or my Chinese companion. The first thing she told me when the movie ended that the movie is ""not good"". I agree with her."

But seriously, with all due respects, details are so overdone and it's too beautiful on the Chinese side to be any true. To be honest, every one looks ugly in the wars. Wars are always wrong so there's no point in showing one beautiful side and the other is ugly. The Japanese can look ugly in this film if you want to, but all the heroic details of the Chinese side are so not true with the actuality that is going on now outside in the real world... One Chinese soldier against the whole well-equipped Japanese troop?

He spends much of the film crying, which is understandable given the circumstances. The female lead's acting is very wooden.

","The only thing I have to say for those of you who like the film is that you people need to watch more movies, other than the special effects, this movie has no highlight. I believe this is Zhang Yimou's first film with mediocre success. The movie is based on a book written by an Chinese American author, which you might even catch it from the religious symbols, sentimental Japanese officer, there is a reason behind every detail.<br/><br/>And to answer the Bei Jing girl, yes foreigners did save some Chinese, but for more purposes than just benevolent risk taking. There are Japanese who have saved more Chinese for that matter, they offered citizenship and safety to stronger Chinese and Koreans before and during the invasion. If this movie is touchy for you, sorry you only get this much exposure to rationalized fictions, you will find many of these type of stories on American shelves.<br/><br/>I love how every time China makes a film or series on Imperial Japan, white people are instantly presumed as allies. The truth was, nobody was on our side, the only few people that got saved got documented and given credit to all foreigners. Lets not forget that it was the British and French that first launched war against us, and set up ""temporary"" colonization in China. IMO, Japan wanted a stronger Asian race, that they took that idea in the wrong way and scarred the inner struggle between all Asians for all history."

When a group of prostitutes from a nearby brothel arrive, he becomes the unwilling protector of both groups.<br/><br/>This is fully a Chinese film staring Christian Bale. Given the subject matter, I'd hope that they make the action more realistic. It certainly had the potential and the scale of a great movie.

","Producing a movie about sensitive historic conflicts is always difficult, since views on the events are usually written from the point of view of the winners of the war or conflict. In this case, the Chinese victims of the horrible massacre at Nanking of 1937. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the losing party (the Japanese in this case) might have difficulties admitting the brutalities and bestialities that happened. Coming to terms with the past is something rarely achieved by movies. Compare this with movies on the Holocaust: there are many, but very few of them capture the real horror. La Vita è Bella is just one example. Same for this movie.<br/><br/>In this view, it is already an achievement to bring a ""Hollywood-style"" movie in cinemas about this topic. The horrors that happened are largely unknown to the greater public.<br/><br/>However, the movie in itself was a bit of a disappointment. The dialogues were not well worked out. The multiple languages used in the movie (English, Japanese and Chinese) did not interact well, making the chemistry between the actors difficult. <br/><br/>The actors did make an effort, although Christian Bale could have done a little more. The Japanese soldiers seemed like caricatures with little character development. <br/><br/>The lack of chemistry affected the connection with the viewer. Many clues and scenes were just too obvious and overly predictable, and you never really feel like you're standing in Nanking.<br/><br/>However, one good point is the use of light throughout the movie. Also, some scenes were surprisingly good, the battle scene in the beginning is just one example. <br/><br/>So this movie is a nice one to watch if you like historical movies, but don't expect to be amazed."

","This is an engrossing, beautiful, and at the same time horrific film, a vignette into the infamous 1937 Japanese Rape of Nanking. Taken apart from its historical context, it is a movie about redemption and sacrifice.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a battle scene, Japanese troops randomly and brutally gunning down anyone in their path. Among the innocents caught in the literal crossfire are John Miller, an American mortician in Nanking to handle the burial of a deceased Christian priest, and a group of schoolgirls who happen to be studying at the same school the deceased priest led. All take refuge in the church grounds, ostensibly safe from Japanese aggression.<br/><br/>Miller is a dissolute sort, rather unlikeable at the start, though later on he gives a hint as to why he might have become that way, as well as to why he is able to transform himself into a more heroic figure as the film develops. As the last remaining male adult on the church grounds, Miller becomes the unintentional leader of the flock. He and the girls, who share the grounds with a young male acolyte named George, are soon joined by a group of fleeing Chinese prostitutes, who believe the church might be a safe zone in the carnage of Nanking. That proves to be only partly true.<br/><br/>Before Miller's transformation, he views the church merely as his safe zone, albeit full of the temptations the church no doubt preaches against. When Japanese soldiers do what Japanese soldiers did in Nanking during the 1937 massacre, the inner moral fiber and paternal instincts of Miller begins to surface and as a faux priest he tries to protect the young girls. He is only partially successful.<br/><br/>Like Miller, most of the prostitutes begin their stay in the church by behaving crudely and selfishly. A young wounded victim of the fighting, dropped off at the church by one of the last remaining Chinese soldiers, serves as the canvass on which the women's compassion begins to express itself. Their transformation, too, has begun.<br/><br/>Eventually not even the church walls can keep out the Japanese brutality and evil, and Japanese command---who are unaware the prostitutes are hiding beneath the church---announce they will take the girls away, ostensibly for a celebration of their savagery in Nanking. Miller tries to sugar coat the girls' fate, but his own emotionalism betrays the horrible truth: that the children will be used as sex slaves and then butchered.<br/><br/>The girls decide suicide is preferable to enslavement, and they plan to jump from the church steeple and end their lives. Miller and the women talk them out of it. One of the women offers to trade places with one of the girls, and tries to convince her colleagues to do the same. She argues that a lifetime of shame can be wiped away, and the image of the women changed for all time, if they offer their bodies as a sacrifice on behalf of the girls. Slowly the other women come around and agree to do the same, while Miller's role---as a practicing mortician---is to modify the women's appearance through make-up to make them appear younger than they are and be able to fool the Japanese.<br/><br/>When the group falls one short, George argues that he can be made to appear as a young girl and can replace the last of the schoolchildren.<br/><br/>The drama of the film peaks at this point of supreme sacrifice, and the eventual removal of the reconfigured women, plus the escape of Miller and the children once the Japanese guards are gone, are essentially epilogue.<br/><br/>The film is at once brutal and horrific, but also inspirational and uplifting as it showcases the absolute worst and best humanity can offer. While many might argue it is propaganda, it is undeniable, except perhaps in Japanese textbooks, that such brutality took place. This movie also reminds the viewer that in such circumstances there is also courage of a type few can imagine and sacrifice that should shame the Japanese into finally coming to terms with their horrific past. The film follows Zhang's characteristic style, and some may feel that this may have taken some of the edge off of the violence, lending it a perverse beauty and diminishing the full extent of the horror. Perhaps it was used to soften the blow of the abject savagery that was the reality of Japan's aggression, make the movie slightly more palatable, and not detract from the central message which was about redemption and sacrifice. Even with the effects, however, there is violence that is often shocking.<br/><br/>The acting across the board is superb, with standouts being George (Huang Tianyuan), Shu (Xinyi Zhang) and Miller (Christian Bale). Ni Ni (as Yu Mo) may well have turned in a great performance, but her character is so lovely, physically and emotionally, that I am probably biased. Some argue that Bale performed below his usual norm, but I disagree. He was reserved, rather than over the top as someone like Sean Penn would have been, and he used a lot of subtlety in conveying, via facial expression, his bucking up to meet the challenge and his often failed attempts to rein in his emotions so that neither the girls nor the women would notice. Some also say his delivery was stilted owing to the written dialog, but again I disagree and feel both the dialog and the delivery are consistent with the time. People did speak differently in 1937, and people do speak differently when they are addressing others whose first language is not English, at least those with a good deal of cross cultural experience.<br/><br/>Movies and stories are going to strike everyone differently, but I would guess many who view this one will be moved, and shaken, and inspired as much as they have viewing any film. This one stays with you, in ways both good and bad."

","A fabulous film which should have been up there in the top ten...beautifully acted...funny in places but also very sad...a tribute to the people over the world who gave up so much for war...don't miss this Have read some bad reviews but don't agree with any of them..this film truly moved me and my daughter.. Based on a true story of the Japanese occupation of China...it portrays a harrowing tale of the cruelty bestowed on the people. The film leaves you with thoughts of what happened, rather than showing it in detail. I actually found this more disturbing but yet wanted to know what really happen in the end... This is a brilliant film...DON'T MISS"

","The Flowers of War is like a thief in the night; it sneaks up on you. The first half of this drama seems like many other war stories you've seen. People struggling to survive in a seemingly impossible situation. Then something changes, and you are truly amazed by the transformation! This is the story of how ordinary, selfish, bickering people are suddenly motivated to do extraordinary acts of unselfish devotion, and it is emotionally shattering to behold. I could no longer control my emotions once the reality of the situation was revealed. Don't be fooled; this film is much, much better than a 7.5! It goes in my top 10 of all time! A masterpiece of sacrificial grace! Don't miss it!"

","What I can say about it, a heart touching story, incredible cast, Awesome performances, splendid direction and the marvelous movie, Personally I watched this movie just because of Christian Bale as huge Fan of him, and I can say with proud that He worth it. Ni Ni as a Newcomer she gave a very nice and great performance. Her charms and Beauty shows the real colours of Asia. I don't know much about the Director but he did a great job. Suspense End makes it more memorable For me. This movie at least worth a nomination in Oscar. It was really a Oscar material. I would recommend this movie to any adult. Just try it You will be happy to watch it and of course sad also."

","First off I'm not familiar with Chinese history especially before WWII, so I had no idea the Japanese invaded the country in the 1930's. This story is about an American mortician John Miller played by Christian Bale who finds himself at a convent in the middle of a bombed out town surrounded by the Japanese. When he first arrives he is the only adult because the Priest died and the staff has fled. He just wants to get paid and leave before he is killed. Then some prostitutes from the local brothel seek refuge in the church. I loved the interplay between the young girls and the pro's. then there is the change in John as he goes from heartless and jaded to the ""hero"" for lack of a better word. I don't want to give any spoilers so I'll stop there. This movie will make you cry for loss and personal sacrifice. It could be a little hard to follow. Half the dialog you need subtitles for which seemed to go fast even for me who is a fast reader. but it is an amazing story that should be told and even if I never watch it again am glad I found this amazing tale."

","How can I describe ""THe Flowers Of War""? I watched it today,and there is a bit of tear in my eyes every time i felt their pain,i have watched tons of movies based on war but this has really shaken me. Christian Bale is at his best,the background music is very wonderful,the set the screenplay is beyond ordinary but the greatest feature of this film is its storytelling,it gives you a whole lot of idea about the human nature,how brutal and how wonderful it can be. If you haven't watch it yet,watch it now my friend,wherever in the world you are right now,whichever country you belong you will love it. This is a story how a mortician became a father,how a lone boy save innocents giving his life,this is a story of human nature. 10/10. A must watch..."
"happycatpaws","8","0","1","19 July 2012"," Serious, interesting movie all the way through!
","I was drawn to see the DVD seeing that Christian Bale was starring in it, but had never even heard of it before. After watching it, I am thinking it should be in the Academy awards top movies category. It follows a very creative storyline of an American mortician finding himself in the position of defending the safety of a group of Chinese schoolgirls in a convent as China is being invaded by Japan. Adding to the improbability, a group of prostitutes seek to take haven in the convent and this is where the storyline proceeds. A contrast of lives of innocence versus lives which have been tainted by exploitation, a jaded man who mocks the church at the onset finds himself in the position of protecting the lives and the honor of the young girls and becoming the father figure and man of virtue himself as he leads them to safety, the atrocities of war in contrast with the humanity of soldiers trying to save lives as their duties are to destroy them. These are a few complexities of the movie. It shows the atrocities of war and the innocence and destruction of those who are caught in circumstances beyond their control. This movie reminds us of the evils of war and the common humanity, desires and emotions that we all share. It was interesting to watch throughout the entire movie. While perhaps, not ""entertaining"" in the sense that it left you with a happy feeling at the end, it was memorable in the sense that it captured the seriousness and importance of war and it's effects on us all, whatever our roles in life may be. I recommend it for viewing for adults, although it may not be appropriate for young children to view due to the violence and serious subject matter."
"manendra-lodhi","8","0","2","14 June 2012"," A nice one to watch once.
","I like war films. And any war film can impress me. And this one was a film on a different subject and kind of like the cold mountain in which also there was a different subject. Christian bale is a fine actor. I liked him in most of his movies. The battle scenes are nice and visually appealing. I found myself not bored at any time, but sometimes I did found myself irritated with the thirteen girls. May it was the Chinese accent or whatever but otherwise the film is a mix of a lot of things including sex, action, story etc. Overall the film is good for a one time watch. But not that important to watch.<br/><br/>""A recommended onetime watch."""
"vinsond21","7","0","2","25 April 2012"," A tale of tragedy, sacrifice and hope
","This Zhang Yimou movie on the Rape of Nanking starts off unevenly, but thankfully, everything begins to fall into place by the halfway mark. At first, it is hard to care about the characters, as they are not introduced properly. However, we get to know each of them as the story slowly unfolds and, towards the end, one might even be choking back some tears. The acting is superb throughout. Christian Bale's casting is meaningful because his first movie was Empire of the Sun, which was also about the Japanese invasion of China. In the space of 25 years, we see him at the beginning of his career in master-director Spielberg's Empire, and as a seasoned actor in master-director Zhang's Flowers. The film is beautifully shot, and the music score also features solos by Joshua Bell. Suffice to say, production values are top notch."
