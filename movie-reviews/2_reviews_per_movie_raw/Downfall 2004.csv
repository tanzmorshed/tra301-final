"wforstchen","10","287","299","21 August 2005"," This Historian is awed by the effort for accuracy
","I teach a college course on WWII, in graduate school studied under several experts on the subject and have interviewed numerous survivors on both sides. This film comes out on top, perhaps the finest ever made on the subject of the war (though the Belorussian ""Come and See"" & ""Schindler's List"" are darn close as well).<br/><br/>I had the remarkable experience of watching this film last night with two veterans, one a GI who fought from Omaha to Czechoslovakia. . .and a German infantry officer, a veteran of four years on the Eastern Front. The German, who met Hitler several times, within minutes was exclaiming over the historical accuracy, right down to ""Hitler's"" lower class Munich accent. . .something an American audience would never pick up on. My German friend, who at the end of the war was in East Prussia, in the debacle of attempting to evacuate over a million civilians ahead of the Russians, was profoundly shaken by the film. . .saying the horror, the hospital scenes, the utter chaos, the lynchings, the sight of 12 year old children fighting. . .all of it was real. And an interesting observation by him. . .he had no idea Berlin, at the end, had been as bad as what he witnessed along the Baltic coast and is still haunted by. It truly was ""Gotterdammerung"" for an entire nation and this film brings it frightfully close to you. If you are a parent of small children, the terrifying ending for the Goebbel's children is an absolutely searing nightmare.<br/><br/>I think the most important point of the film was the portrayal of Hitler. . .not as the stereotyped raving madman, usually overplayed like a bad performance of King Richard, but far more subtle. I've talked with many who knew Hitler, including a childhood playmate of Helga, Goebbel's oldest child, and all will tell you that Hitler could be absolutely charming, focused on you, even courtly when with women. The terror is, that even as the actor shows us that ""human"" side, in his soft voice he is dictating orders, observations, and comments of absolute evil. The true form of evil rarely looks evil on the surface, it seduces us with a fair face as it leads, sometimes an entire nation, into damnation. THis film captured that evil.<br/><br/>My German friend's comment at the end of the movie. . .""I still can not believe we fought for that monster for six years."" <br/><br/>A history professor at Montreat College"
"nosiesnetnieuws","10","759","831","24 November 2004"," Impressive achievement, realistic and shocking
","This film definitely is a must-see because of the incomparable degree of realism displayed in it. Direction, camera and acting are of an unparalleled level and make you, as the viewer, feel as if you are actually in Berlin, 1945, and in the FÃ¼hrer's bunker. The film does not provide any commentary or judgment, it just shows facts.<br/><br/>The film is criticized because it gives the Nazi's a human face, but this is exactly it's strongest point: the Nazi's were not extraterrestrial monsters, they were as human as you and I. The image of Hitler crying of sorrow because all is lost, is still burned on my retina.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is a film that should be shown in schools to illustrate the Second World War with. It is probably impossible to provide a more realistic account, without *any* form of judgment.<br/><br/>A major achievement, even for Germany as a whole. It is very brave to create such a realistic film about one's own past."
"claudio_carvalho","10","249","277","19 January 2006"," The Most Impressive, Depressive and Realistic Dramatic Movie about the World War II
","""Der Untergang"" is certainly the most impressive, depressive and realistic dramatic movie about the World War II ever made. I have never seen a film picturing the insanity of Hitler in his very last days in a bunker in Berlin with his high command, and how the German people were hypnotized by him like in this film. Last year, I saw the deceptive, boring, pretentious and overrated ""Molokh"", showing a caricature of Hitler and Eva Braun in Bavaria. But ""Der Untergang"" is awesome and comparable to ""Apocalypse Now!"", my favorite movie of war.<br/><br/>Two years ago, I saw the powerful ""Das Experiment"" and I was impressed with the work of Oliver Hirschbiegel. With ""Der Untergang"", this director is certainly included in my list of favorite directors. It is difficult to highlight one actor or actress in this constellation of stars, but I was impressed with the performance of Bruno Ganz and his ""human"" Hitler, totally different from the stereotypes usual in other movies. The cinematography and the battles are stunning, and the scenario of Berlin completely destroyed recalled the neo-realistic movie of Roberto Rossellini ""Germania Anno Zero"".<br/><br/>For those who know Germany and German people, it is amazing to see how this wonderful country survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. For those who might have believed in Hitler and his Nazi Party, it is impressive to see how people is forgotten and treated without compassion by their leader in his last hours. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. My vote is ten.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""A Queda! As Últimas Horas de Hitler"" (""The Fall! The Last Hours of Hitler"")"
"hermes-10","9","508","574","12 November 2004"," Amazing realism
","Der Untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war. Bruno Ganz's interpretation of Adolf Hitler is worthy of an Oscar. He is completely believable. Also the rest of the cast performs admirably. You feel transported to Berlin as it was bombarded by the Russians. You get a very clear insight (or an impression?) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war. The movie balances well between large-scale effects of bombs exploding in ruined streets and depictions of different persons going though the experience  from Hitler and his staff in the well-protected bunkers to the principal military commanders torn between reason and loyalty and German civilians trapped in an inferno. The movie is neither pro-Nazi nor does it depict all Nazis as mindless monsters. It gives an impression of utter realism. Go see it in a good cinema  your seat will tremble as the bombs explode. A nine out of ten."
"ilovedolby","10","118","131","5 June 2005"," A deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end.
","In recent years, war films have given a new exposure to the sheer nature of war. In ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Black Hawk Down"" and ""Born on the Fourth of July,"" we were exposed to the realities that a soldier endures not only on the battlefield, but what they take with them long after the battles end. However, ""Downfall,"" a German film nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 Oscars, brings a unique perspective to the table. It is about the last days of Hitler and the Third Reich and the ultimate demise of both. More so than a war movie, this feature exposes the insanity of Hitler and the blind faith of his followers at the end. It is a deeply disturbing, intimate portrait of the cruelty that he inflicted not only upon 6 million Jews, but ultimately on his own countryman at the end.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest, ""Downfall"" is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cultso many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, ""In a war as such there are no civilians."" <br/><br/>Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. <br/><br/>Surprisingly enough, Thomas Kretschmann, who played the Nazi captain that gave Wladyslaw Szpilman a coat and food in ""The Pianist"" is seen here as Fegelein. I first noticed Kretschmann as a German U-Boat commander in 2000s, ""U-571."" He is a remarkable actor who brings with him a demanding presence on the screen through his stern looks and ultimate resolve. <br/><br/>Unfortunately my knowledge of Eva Braun other than Hitler's mistress is limited. So it was refreshing to see a film that revealed her. Based on ""Downfall's"" depiction, Braun, portrayed by Juliane Kohler, was either one of the shallowest individuals I have ever seen, or she was so blinded by her faith in Hitler that she disregarded almost any sense of reality. For example, during Berlin's first days of bombardment, she becomes bored with being in the bunker and orders a party in an above ball roomnot surprisingly during that party a shell lands nearby and blows out windows in the room. Secondly, during later heavy bombardment, realizing that she will commit suicide with Hitler, she writes a letter to a relative where she states what jewelry she will leave behind. She is simply detached from reality and lost in the fanatical jargon of the Fuhrer. <br/><br/>Certainly the film's most disturbing instances occur when Magda and Joseph Goebbels poison their children in the name of the Fatherland. One of their children, a girl probably about 10 years old, has a dim understanding of what is happening and refuses to take the drink given. She is then forced to drink it by her mother and a guard. Later on, Magda would come into her children's room while they were asleep and would give them the final capsule to eliminate them. <br/><br/>""Downfall"" is certainly one of the most powerful film's I have ever seen. As stated above, Hitler and his followers played out their existence as if they were in a cult. The blind faith of his followers and the insanity of the man are so well realized by director Oliver Herschbiegel, that it changes one's perception from that of simply being history to that of realism. <br/><br/>These events happened less than a century ago and although most have learned to forgive Germany's past, no one will ever forget it. It is the stigma that haunts this generation of German youth because many of their grandparents or great-grandparents were a part of one of history's most infamous armies. But the fact that this film is German was surprising to me. I would have guessed that no one in Germany would have wanted to dig up their past in this way. However, if one looks at this film as closure to Germany's transgressions, then maybe this new generation of German youth can learn to have a sense of national identity without the horrors of the past seen in their shadows. **** out of ****"
"jotix100","10","230","269","19 March 2005"," The last days at the bunker
","This magnificent film goes where no one else dared to go to show us the last days of Adolf Hitler. The director, Oliver Hirshbiegel, working with a big cast, brings to life the madness of the last days of the monster, as observed by a young and impressionable secretary who witnessed most of the crisis.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the film we watch as five young women are brought to be interviewed by Hitler for a job as his personal secretary. Young Traudl Junge is selected. She is a pretty woman who is naive in many ways and probably had no inkling about the trip she was going to embark.<br/><br/>The film captures the tragic figure of Hitler as everything is caving in on him and his grand plans for victory. We watch a man at the beginning of the film that is still thinking he is in command of the German forces, but his authority has eroded, as it becomes clear to the people under him the war is lost and it will be a matter of time before they are defeated.<br/><br/>We watch the life of privilege the higher ups led inside the bunker. It was a fortification in which all comforts the regular Germans could not imagine existed. We get to know the people in Hitler's inner circle. The Goebbels, both Joseph and Magda, supporters of the regime, maintain the loyalty to the Fuhrer until the end. The scene where Magda Goebbels murders her children is hard to take and we keep sinking in our seats, as we can't believe such cruelty existed. In her narrow view of things, Magda must take her family with her to a death these children didn't deserve.<br/><br/>The film is totally dominated by Bruno Ganz. As Hitler, he makes us see this man as he probably was in real life. Mr. Ganz's uncanny resemblance with Hitler is what makes the film works the way it does. At times, Mr. Ganz is totally irrational, and at times, he is presented as a lost man who can't see what he has done to Germany and to Europe and the world.<br/><br/>As Traudl Junge, the young secretary, Alexandra Maria Lara gives a subtle performance. She saw plenty inside the bunker and lived to tell it to the world. The other excellent performance is given by Corinna Harfouch, who as Mrs. Goebbels makes us cringe in horror because of what she is capable of doing. Juliane Kohler, as Eva Braun, is an enigma. At times, she is presented as a carefree young woman who might have loved Hitler. Yet, we don't ever know what made this Eva Braun tick. Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer are equally effective playing these two men.<br/><br/>The director and his team have to be congratulated for taking us on a voyage to see the last moments of the Third Reich."
"adammezei","Null","296","349","15 September 2004"," A truer rendition of Hitler I've never seen...
","Not since perhaps Rod Steiger's portrayal of Benito Mussolini in Moustapha Akkad's LION OF THE DESERT (1980) have I seen a notorious dictator more realistically acted than Bruno Ganz's stunning display as ""Der Fuerer"" in The Downfall (2004).<br/><br/>Sitting amongst a full-house of patrons here at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival's 2004 edition, Ganz captivated the local audience with the scariest Hitler I've ever seen up on the silver screen -- better than Noah Taylor's English Hitler in MAX just a couple of years back.<br/><br/>Audience members get a glimpse into the final days of Hitler's rule from the bunker deep beneath the Reich Chancellery in Nazi Berlin's dying days. The defeated spirit of the Nazis -- covered extensively in the history books -- has seldomly been more penetratingly shown on the Big Screen. Bravo to director Oliver Hirschbiegel for doing this the right (German) way -- for intrepidly tackling a period piece few German producers might.<br/><br/>I'd had a chance to chat with the actors post-screening, with lead actress Alexandra Maria Lara (playing Traudl Junge) candidly admitting the sheer amount of work she'd diligently invested in bringing her character to life -- doubtless complicated by the death of Frau Junge in 2002. Her research, however, was clearly impeccable and left no stone unturned. Corinna Harfouch wasn't on hand -- as Magda Goebbels. Pity because in many respects, she convincingly stole the show. <br/><br/>So rarely do we see Hitler on screen in modern days to allow us a glimpse into the horrifying nature of a madman bent on global domination. We all know the end of this story, but seldom does a film so masterfully suspend your disbelief than does The Downfall in making you wonder just how the Third Reich might end. Historical fiction might never be the same."
"duret-1","Null","441","531","14 December 2004"," The Best WWII movie ever.
","'Der Untergang' is probably the only WW2 movie I've ever seen, which only deals with facts and is utterly deprived of any form of commercialism whatsoever. Bruno Ganz is truly excellent in his role as Adolf Hitler, a tired man who sees his ""Reich"" fall, but cannot accept it. Overall (type)casting is very good; all the actors chosen to portray a famous/notorious character look a lot like the real deal, especially Goebbels. Although I'm not a fan of long war movies, these 2,5 hours passed very quickly due to excellent acting, great sets, FX and storyline. Somehow, every scene is dripping with underlying tension that never really explodes; a kind of unsettling unbelieved grips you when you see seemingly ordinary people commit astonishing atrocities and sins towards mankind, just for their faith and loyalty to one man, Hitler, who himself walks the edge of reason.<br/><br/>Great movie : 10/10 without a doubt."
"Shc-Shc","10","384","467","28 February 2005"," This movie has physically touched me! ....wow.
","I don't know what to say about this film. I am almost speechless.<br/><br/>First of all, this is almost PERFECT cinema, beautifully shot, acted, lit, staged and on and on. BUt it is also the only film in recent memory that had an almost physical impact on me. I left feeling disoriented and very disquieted, a feeling that lasted for several hours.<br/><br/>What we have here is an exercise in patience. A film that allows us to watch the disintegration of the largest empire in modern history, from the inside out. Beginning after the start of the siege of Berlin, the bulk of the film takes place in the cramped bunkers below the city, where Hitler and his officers are trapped like rats on a sinking ship, aware of their fate, but not smart enough, not willing enough, or maybe incapable of escaping the fates they created for themselves.<br/><br/>This is a daring, brilliant film with a virtuoso performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He shows us that beneath the genocidal, world changing shell of hatred that the globe knew, Hitler was still that petty, hatefilled, failed art-student that he was before becoming the greatest villain in history.<br/><br/>awesome, awesome, awesome movie."
"bs3dc","Null","33","36","24 March 2007"," Brilliant Depiction Of The Effects Of War
","Downfall is the gripping depiction of the last few days of the Second World War in Europe, as the Russians advance into Berlin and approach ever nearer the bunker of Adolf Hitler who still believes their advance can be stopped...<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz turns in a terrific performance as Hitler, paying great attention to detail (including the regional accent and the effects of Parkinson's disease) that really make him into a believable person which is a lot more frightening to watch than the usual two-dimensional characterisations that are usually seen on screen. Ganz manages to dominate the screen with the same effectiveness that allowed Hitler to get followers of such devotion that despite his atrocities and the horror of the situation many are prepared to stay with him and fight to the death while the possibility of escape or surrender remains open to them. He is almost schizophrenic - at some moments he is almost gentle, such as some of the scenes with his secretary, then shortly afterwards he is practically foaming at the mouth in his contempt for the civilian population of Berlin who he will not raise a finger to try to save by surrendering to the Allies.<br/><br/>The other actors are not very well known - at least on the international arena, but this added greatly to the authentic feel. Some of the senior Nazi leaders are hardly more sympathetic than their Fuhrer - Himmler in particular shows only personal ambition while pretending loyalty. Other characters such as the caring SS doctor who finds elderly patients simply abandoned in a hospital or the father who desperately tries to persuade his son who must be around 12-14 not to get involved and perish in a hopeless cause are succinctly realised.<br/><br/>The film is expertly shot, with the unreal atmosphere in the bunker captured perfectly where Hitler raves about army units that barely or cease to exist coming to the rescue of the Reich and orders oilfields re-captured for 'long distance missions' when the Russian troops are barely a few hundred metres away.<br/><br/>There is no glory shown in the battle scenes as the outcome is always a foregone conclusion making the resulting deaths even more moving. Watching young children and old men trying to hold off the Russian advance with inadequate weaponry is tragic in the knowledge that they are dying for no real purpose other than the whims of a handful of madmen.<br/><br/>Very few films have depicted the tragic waste of life that war provokes better than Downfall and this turns out to be one of the best movies concerning the conflict that claimed over 50 million lives."
"The_Void","8","37","41","21 April 2005"," A magnificent piece of cinema. Spectacular in every respect
","Truly great movies are few and far between these days; but Der Untergang most definitely represents one of those rare occasions. Oliver Hirschbiegel, who brought us the wonderful 'Das Experiment' has produced a film that is very nearly perfect. Depicting the final ten days of Hitler and the National Socialist regime, Der Untergang or 'The Downfall' to give it it's English title is an expose of failure and the way that a madman can bend a whole nation into doing his bidding. The film is very realistic, and an excellent ensemble cast breathe life and believability into the roles of the various members of the Nazi party and because every performance is picture perfect, the whole thing comes together brilliantly as one whole piece. Bruno Ganz gives the central performance as the Fuhrer himself and it is one of the greatest performances I've ever seen in a film. His portrayal of Hitler in the middle of his downfall is absolutely perfect, and Ganz excellently portrays the man's every emotion. It must be difficult to play such a notorious character as Hitler himself, but Ganz rises to the occasion and gives it his all.<br/><br/>It is not the acting or the realism that is Der Untergang's main claim to greatness, however - it's the double meaning behind every scene. Each one is perfectly composed, and all the time you're watching you can not only see what's happening on screen but also take note of the implications surrounding it. Through every scene, there's always the notion that a nation is falling. That's another thing that's great about this movie - the way that it manipulates the audience into an awkward situation. On the one hand, we know that Hitler and the Nazi regime were unspeakably evil; but while we're watching this almost great nation crumble around it's leader, it is hard to watch without feeling some sympathy for the country, in spite of the ideals that were preached. I thought it would be impossible to generate feelings for the Nazi's; but Der Untergang has managed even that. 'The Downfall' is an apt title for this movie, as aside from depicting an important event in history; the film is fundamentally about failure. The entire movie focuses on one man's huge downfall, and it is both a heartbreaking and powerful cinematic experience. Der Untergang is not to be missed."
"Coventry","10","62","72","18 January 2005"," A mesmerizing experience and one that will hopefully remind people all over the world that history may never repeat itself!
","All I can say about ""Der Untergang"" is: WOW! This is one of those rare films that prove that the darkest pages in our world history easily surpass the fiction tales of the most imaginative fantasist. This soon-to-be landmark in cinema portrays the final ten days of Hitler's reign at the well hidden bunker in Berlin. In the opening sequences, we see how the Führer hires Traudl Junge (flawless performance by Alexandra Maria Lara) as his personal secretary and we largely witness the rest of the story from her viewpoint. Recent documentary footage with the real Junge is showed to audience at the end of the movie, stressing even more that this is a very intelligent and carefully elaborated production. A form of criticism I often encountered stated that Hitler was portrayed too ""human"" by the Swiss actor Bruno Ganz. Let me tell you that people who claim this haven't got the slightest clue what they're talking about! It's true that Hitler sometimes strokes his dogor even gives a compliment to his servant for cooking him such a lovely dinner! But only moments after, you're exposed to the real Hitler again! Alternately a mad-raving dictator, a disillusioned conqueror or simply a pathetic old man. But perhaps the most astonishing scenes in ""Der Untergang"" are the ones in which the persons close to Hitler  either professional or amicable  remain unconditionally loyal to him! It is deeply disturbing to behold how so many people blindly swear by the unworldly beliefs of a madman, even prepared to follow him into death. This accurate portrait results in a series of brilliant sequences with the severely shocking fate of the Goebbels family as an absolute highlight.<br/><br/>Purely talking in terms of cinema, ""Der Untergang"" comes dangerously close to perfection as well. The largest part of this film exists out of interior shots, more specifically the bunker-network where Hitler lasted his final days and eventually committed suicide. And the atmosphere inside this bunker is reflected on the movie-screen as genuine as humanly possible. You can nearly smell the fear of the lower-ranked officers! You can almost feel the shivering of the petrified secretaries! I really hate using a cliché sentence like this butit's trueit's like you are there yourself! And you don't want to be there! Even the totally demolished streets of Berlin looks look more appealing than the claustrophobic Nazi bunker. This despicable chapter in history deserves an accurate and well-budgeted cinema version, if only just for passing on the inglorious stories of WWII to younger generations. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel terrifically turned Joachim Fest's novel into a mesmerizing film experience. Perhaps the most praiseworthy aspect about it all is that ""Der Untergang"" simply is a reconstruction of the facts! No lame and amateurish attempts to blame Hitler's actions on miserable childhoods or traumatizing experiences. Simply put: this is fundamental viewing!"
"WChewIII","10","49","57","6 February 2005"," An excellent rendition reflecting historiographical trends of the past years.
","""Der Untergang"" (""The Downfall"") portrays life inside (and to an extent outside) the ""Führerbunker"" in Berlin during the last few weeks prior to Hitler's suicide in April, 1945. The screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger, who has had previous experience with the adaptation of historical material for cinema, and done a commendable job in the process. I am, of course, referring to his screen version of Umberto Ecco's historical novel ""The Name of the Rose (1986). Some of Eichinger's other credits include ""Body of Evidence"" (1993, which he co-produced) and ""The NeverEnding Story"" (1984, as producer).<br/><br/>Few movies have stirred up as much controversy even before their release, as has ""Der Untergang."" So what was all the fuss about, and was it warranted? After all, how many films have been made about Hitler already, including several about Hitler in his Berlin bunker. There is nothing especially controversial about the subject matter per se. What is more, Hirschbiegel and Eichinger appear to have done their homework, basing the film extensively on German historian Joachim Fest's acclaimed book of the same name (2003). Events are portrayed largely through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary from 1943when the film opens with a flashback sequence to her job interview and appointmentto his death. Her memoirs, and interviews conducted before her death, constitute a further source for the film. The Führer himself is played magisterially by Bruno Ganz, who clearly spent countless hours studying Hitler's public speeches, as well as rare footage of the private man, not to mention recordings of his voice. For a historian like myself, who has viewed and listened to much of the material myself, it is uncanny how right Ganz gets it. Inflection, tonality, accentthey are all there. As are gestures and body language. This film has to be seen in the original, even if you don't understand German.<br/><br/>So if there is little in the way of subject matter, preparation, historical consulting, and prime acting to fault, why then the controversy? The approach and interpretation were at the root of the hullabaloo. Interviewed while the film was in the making, Eichinger explained that he would portray Hitler ""as a man, as a human"" (""wie ein Mensch."") This was revolutionary in cinema, where renditions of the Nazi leader havepre-Eichingerstill not gone far beyond the ""evil-dictator"" approach. You might reasonably query what is wrong with the ""evil dictator"" approach, given the accepted fact that he was, indeed, evil. From a historian's perspective, everything is wrong with that approach, and Eichinger had the courage to transcend it for the broad public.<br/><br/>The first two decades of post-World War II historians pretty much demonized Hitler, as did all movies before ""Der Untergang."" This was understandable, at the time. Wounds were still fresh, denazification was under way, Germans were seeking a new democratic identity aligned with the West, and the issue of ""collective guilt"" was touchy. Solid, balanced biographies of Hitler had not yet been written, and historical understanding of how it was possible that a highly cultured people such as the Germans could have been led astray was only just beginning to take shape. But with the 1964 revision of Lord Alan Bullock's ""A Study in Tyranny"" (1st ed. 1952) and Joachim Fest's ""Hitler: Eine Biographie"" (1973) professional historians started putting demonetization to rest and instead began to explain. And this meant accepting the perhaps distasteful tenet that Hitler was, after all, a man, and not some kind of deranged satanic figure from hell. Sir Ian Kershaw, Professor of Modern History at the University of Sheffield, has taken things even further, in his highly accessible two-volume (2000 page!) magnum opus which has now become the standard biography (published 1998-2000). For Kershaw has not only reconciled the internationalist (or ""Hitler-centric"") approach, which focuses on Hitler as linchpin and leader of the Third Reich, without whom World War II and the Holocaust are unthinkable; with the structuralist approach, which links Hitler and his ""enabling"" to social, political and cultural structures in Weimar Germany. Kershaw has also gone a long way towards meeting the desideratum of German historian Martin Broszat, uttered as far back as the 1970s, for the ""historicization"" of Third Reich history, meaning its firm embedding in overall German, European, and indeed World History, rather than its artificial isolation as an ""aberration"" or a ""German special path"" (""deutscher Sonderweg."") This, then, is the proper historiographical context of ""Der Untergang."" In effect, the film almost belatedly follows trends in scholarship that have been developing for some time now. Of course, the general public is hardly aware of such developments. So in a sense, the film is something of a vulgarization, a kind of dramatization informed by the best scholarship. The film does not explain, for it is, after all, not a documentary with the voice-over of a historical consultant cum narrator. That is not its purpose. What it does, however, is provide an excellent sense of Hitler in his declining days, increasingly delusional if perhaps not outright insane, but still ablealmost to the bitter endto maintain a hold on his closest followers. Not to mention the unreality of life in the sheltered bunker, while outside the Russians are advancing through Berlin suburbs, held back only by a pathetic hodge-podge of Hitler youth and tired old men drafted into service in the Volkswehr. From all accounts I have read, from the pens of scholars English, American and German, I can say with a high degree of certitude that this film provides a reasonably authentic recreation of what it must have been like. Or in the words of Leopold von Ranke, ""wie es eigentlich gewesen."" What higher acclaim can a historian provide?"
"SithApprentice","10","303","385","12 November 2004"," Impressive
","Considering the fact how hard it is to make an adequate movie about the  Third Rich and especially Hitler himself, ""Der Untergang"" is a superb  portrayal of the last days of Hitler, his minions and the Third Rich.  First of all, Bruno Ganz' performance is magnificent, brilliant,  perfect. You're beginning to think he IS the Fuehrer, his look, his  mannerism, his sick philosophy of life and his downfall are absolutely convincing. After seeing him you can finally understand why  so many people back then were attracted by his charisma, but thanks to  Ganz' performance you do not forget about the terrible crimes he  committed by his followers and about the evil inside the sick soul of  this man. His minions weren't that important in this movie, except for  Joseph Goebbels and his family. Heinrich Himmler, the ReichsfuehrerSS,  was portrayed as the man he was: an idiotic coward, who was in great  part responsible for the Holocaust and still believed in a peace  agreement with the allied forces, although this idea was completely out  of place. Albert Speer as one of the less criminal national socialists  was also quite good interpreted. Martin Bormann, Alfred Jodl and  Wilhelm Keitel, 3 other important Nazis, got too few screen time, and  Hermann Goering didn't even show up, he was just mentioned. I think  Goebbels wasn't portrayed that authentic as he could have, due to the  fact he was the most intelligent of Hitler's inner circle, but in some  scenes he seemed like someone who could just repeat his own slogans.  The part about Traudl Junge and the boy from the Volkssturm, Peter, was  also quite good, but it was clearly overshadowed by the Hitler/ minion  part. There are also some surprisingly well done battle- sequences  taking place in Berlin, in which you can also see a part of the pretty  high amount of blood and violence, for example when a soldier gets shot  through his head, some officers are committing suicide or the killing  of the Goebbels children, a scene which gave me the chills. Due to it's  high authenticity, great actors and an important message, this movie  could become as important as Schindler's List already is, in order to  show today's youth the insanity of Hitler and the whole Third Rich and  to make them avoid racist and extreme right wing organisations. All in  all, this is one of the best German flicks I've ever seen - although  there isn't such a huge number of good German movies. 10/10"

","Few films have dared to touch WWII objectively from a German point of view; most use the Germans as great villains and Allied forces as great heroes... Movies like ""Patton"" show brief sights into German military thinking while ""The Pianist"" finds a good cultured German officer in a nightmare scenario <br/><br/>""Downfall"" tells the story of the Führer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole the city <br/><br/>Mostly through the eyes of his young Bavarian secretary, Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) we see the ailing and obviously delusional Führer allowing no negotiation with the Allied forces, raving about how his generals betrayed him, ordering the movement of troops that do not exist, screaming that the German people do not deserve to survive for their apparent treachery and cowardice<br/><br/>But what has come under criticism is the film's attempt at giving Hitlerwhose face has become symbolic for the epitome of evila compassionate side He's ""Uncle Hitler"" to the children of Josef Goebbles who happily sings for him, so loving for his blonde wife Eva Brown, so kind to his pet dog Blondi, so caring when he awards a young boy (who showed great bravery in the face of the enemy) with a medal and pinches his cheek, and so gentle when he pins a medal on Magda Goebbels for being the 'bravest mother in the Reich'.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why the film was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Film Category It takes you inside the minds of Hitler's faithful, showing you how it was that one infamous man could be so charismatic and magnetic Although his closest advisors, the remaining dedicated members of the Nazi government, know that there is no hope, no one was seen willing to challenge his orders or attempt to seize power And many opted for suicide after living out their final hours in obscene denial, singing and dancing champagne glass in hand<br/><br/>But Hitler's dark side is also shown when the film depicts his hate and antipathy for the Jews; when one of the more ""rational"" members of the Nazi hierarchy, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), stated gently but bluntly to him that the war was lost and he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities; also when he becomes convinced that Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) has betrayed him and must be executed; and when Eva Braun pleads him for her brother-in-law's life, the tormented Hermann Fegelin (Thomas Kretschmann), and he furiously rejected her request<br/><br/>One of the most horrifying sequences that is unforgettable was that of Magda Goebbles played by Corinna Harfouch It is astonishing to witness how an unstoppable steely mother, with no hesitation or remorse, is capable of such atrocities for a blind and irrational loyalty to a 'charming' monster<br/><br/>Ganz's character is equally psychotic and human, capable of shooting even his most loyal followers and utterly believable as Uncle Hitler<br/><br/>Juliane Köhler complements Ganz's exceptional performance with her own chillingly fine one as the ultimate blind follower whose loyalty to her Führer never flagged Köhler shows us how she can be drunkenly carefree dancing to swing as bombs and artillery shake the walls of the bunker one day, and in another day applying a fresh coat of red lipstick to her fleshy lips before she takes one cyanide tablet for the man she preferred not to live without<br/><br/>""Downfall"" may be considered powerful and historically significant It is a must for history buffs"
"wbhome","10","32","37","4 December 2005"," A Masterpiece
","I have been fascinated not only by the movie (I have watched this now 10 times) but the divergence of opinion - with some Germans saying it was terrible. This I don't understand. <br/><br/>In the West from the time of Charlie Chaplin Hitler was portrayed as a raving lunatic - but to me that does not explain his rise to power. A lunatic could not nearly conquer and enslave half the world. In his early rise to power, he was ridiculed in the West. <br/><br/>The fact that this movie gives him some human qualities makes him all the more chilling. There is a dialog between the Junge character and the Braun character that perfectly summarizes Hitler. They talked of the great gulf between the private man and the public man. The Braun character said that she had known the man for 15 years - and yet she knew nothing of him. <br/><br/>I believe to truly understand the movie one must also watch the movie with the director's commentary. Everything about this movie - with the exception of 2 things mentioned by the director - (which having just read the spoiler agreement I will refrain from mentioning - everything was based on fact, which makes the movie all the more dramatic. And the movie characters make some minor statements - based on fact - that would be lost on the audience without outside knowledge of those historical facts.<br/><br/>Small case in point: The Eva Braun character is telling the Traudl Junge character that she ""so looked forward to coming to Berlin"" with the inference (to me) that she hadn't seen Hitler for awhile. Then I read elsewhere that she was in Obersaltzburg for 6 months away from Hitler prior to coming to Berlin. The director stated that he wanted this movie to be treated not only as a drama - but a documentary. He succeeded in both. <br/><br/>I suppose this movie is controversial - a local reviewer said it tried to make Hitler sympathetic by giving him some human qualities but as someone else said this makes him all the more evil. It is these human qualities that make him a believable entity - kind to many individuals, indifferent and murderous to millions. And with the end he was indifferent to the fate of his own people, who were dying for him. <br/><br/>Watching this movie made me think that the German people's initial support of Hitler followed a plot from Goethe - that a Mephistopheles - a demon in disguise - promises the recipient all that he wants in return for his soul. This of course is a theme that has subsequently replayed countlessly in western literature since Goethe's Faustus. <br/><br/>This movie is based not only on Junge's book and Fest's book, but interviews with some of the survivors of the bunker.<br/><br/>I would recommend not only the movie but then watch it with commentary from the director a second time. It is all the more haunting when you realize that virtually everything was based on fact during Berlin's last days.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz - as all the cast - turned in an excellent performance. Watching Ganz in this performance was watching Hitler. You will feel as if you too are a witness in the Bunker. <br/><br/>The beginning and end statements by the real secretary Traudl Junge make the movie even more powerful. This movie was so moving for me that I have bought Traudl Junge's book, ""Until the Last Hour"". <br/><br/>In the US on the DVD it is said it was nominated for ""best foreign picture"" - if it didn't win, it should have."
"sjcsiba","9","266","350","21 December 2004"," this is the best....
","Who better to make a WWII film than the Germans themselves? This is possibly the best WWII film I have seen yet. It is a very intense movie about the final days of Adolf Hitler (a SUPERB roll played by Bruno Ganz, he should get at least one Oscar for this...) which had me coming back to see the movie a second and even a third time (I saw T3 only twice, he he). And not only Bruno Ganz has done a great performance, the entire cast gives it all their best. Very good film indeed.<br/><br/>As I said, it's a film about Adolf Hitlers final days, trapped in a bunker in Berlin, while the Russians are slowly moving closer. Hitler losing his faith in a 'good' outcome, the final bullet, everything is has happened for real. But when I left the cinema I had the idea I had just been watching a fictional story. A perfect script, made in real life 59 years ago. Not much to say about anything else. If you are interested in WWII stuff, go see it in the cinema, it's worth every penny."
"engelst","7","442","599","12 November 2004"," Distanced and sober view of Hitler's last days
","The first 15 minutes made me doubt the qualities of this movie. The situations were a bit forced and the cuts were strange. But after the uncomfortable beginning the movie took momentum and kept it until the end.<br/><br/>I think the choice of depicting Hitler as a human being with a dispassionate and modest direction was excellent. The film never tries to force viewers into an opinion. Everybody can form his own opinion. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters. Perfectly normal human beings can be cruel and merciless if they are blinded (by hate for example), which should never be forgotten.<br/><br/>In a way, a human Hitler to me is more guilty than a raving monster. He had the choice and he chose to do wrong. He could choose life and he chose murder and destruction. A human being lost respect for the life of other human beings and led a country into genocide. Ultimately he loses respect for all life and starts sacrificing his own soldiers at random. This is what I value this film for, making the idea of a human Hitler tangible.<br/><br/>It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure."
"philip_vanderveken","10","35","44","15 February 2005"," It's amazing and unbelievably realistic... Go see it people, NOW!!!
","Having a huge interest in both World Wars and all that happened during the time period 1910-1950, I've seen a lot of movies and read even more books on the subject. Name me a more or less realistic war movie and I've probably seen it, so when ""Der Untergang"" was first released in Germany, I already knew I wanted to watch it as soon as it would be released over here. The commotion that it caused, the good critics that it got, all made me look forward to the day that I would see it, but really nothing could prepare me for what I saw... It was amazing, it was great, it was jaw-dropping...<br/><br/>The main criticism that many people had on this movie was that Hitler and the other Nazi party members looked too human. I know, some people expect that the leaders of the Third Reich are only shown as real monsters, as people who didn't have any human feelings... But that's not the truth. The truth is that, no matter how horrible the things they did, they still were human and (most of the time) acted like normal human beings (for instance Hitler who really loved his German shepherd or who had one of Goebbels' children sitting on his lap while they were singing a song for him...). And let's be honest: do you think a leader who doesn't care for his people's destiny after the war, who doesn't want to see the truth that the war is lost, who knows all too well that he sends young children into battle (he even decorates them personally), but doesn't care, a man who can be so kind and sweet one moment and than be furious and outraged the other moment, really looks like a kind, sweet grandfather??? I don't think so. The makers of this movie never intended to make him look like a nice or a bad man, they intended to show him the way he really was and they did an amazing job.<br/><br/>I've seen many documentaries about Hitler and read a lot of books about the man, so I think I can say I know quite well how he acted and reacted. Seeing Bruno Ganz as Hitler was a shock. He doesn't just look like Hitler, he IS Hitler in this movie!!! His performance was absolutely amazing and seeing him in this film really made shivers going down my spine. Hitler seemed to be alive again! If you've read so many books about the man as I did, you can only conclude that the resemblance is more than just remarkable, it is perfect.<br/><br/>But of course there were more actors in the movie than Bruno Ganz (an actor who I admire since I saw ""Pane e Tulipani"" or ""Bread and Tulips"" for the first time). Even though I have to admit that I don't really know any of them, I must say that they all did an excellent job. Juliane Köhler as Eva Brown, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels,... They all must have studied there characters for many hours, because they were all excellent.<br/><br/>As the horror and reality of the movie have only just ended and burned themselves on your retina for the rest of your life (By the end of the movie, you'll have seen many officers commit suicide, Hitler and Eva Brown being burned behind the bunker, the Goebbels murdering their children, people being hanged on a lantern for stupid reasons, young children dying as they try to defend Berlin...), you think you've had it all, but than the real Traudl Junge gives away a last testimony, looking back on her life with Hitler ... blowing you away even more. I can't remember that I've ever been so quiet after seeing a movie and apparently I wasn't the only one. Really no-one spoke a word during the first minutes after the lights went on again. I don't think many movies have ever touched the audience in such a deep way as this one did.<br/><br/>Because of its historical value and realism, this movie should be seen by everybody and especially by young people at school. Forget those history books for once, this will get through to them at least ten times better. I'm sure that everybody will admit that this movie is a true masterpiece. People who don't know anything about the subject will be able to learn a lot about it and people who already thought they knew it all will still find some new things and will admit that this is exactly the way it must have been 60 years ago. I think there can be only one appropriate score for this movie and that is a full 10/10. Go see it people, NOW!!!"

","Seriously, I wasn't expecting much, but this was one of the best movies period. The actors and acting was terrific, the sets were incredible (St. Petersburg, Russia), the emotions... I felt like I was in Berlin during the last few days, I felt like I was in the bunker with Hitler. It is the most realistic depiction of the situation I had ever seen, and I almost felt a tear in my eye. And that is something, coming from a 40 year old Army veteran. The last 5 minutes, I was on the edge of my seat, when the Russians showed up. Anyway, this movie is totally recommended by me, but brush up on your Nazi history first, or you won't know who is who.<br/><br/>I also liked it because it showed Hitler as a real human, and not the usual Anthony Hopkins/Alec Guiness ""nutbag"" Hitler, or the stereotypical ""demon"" Hitler. It showed him as he was, a broken down egomaniac. I will totally buy this movie and add it to my collection, which is rare for me to do these days."
"snowboarderbo","10","19","23","1 October 2006"," I wish I could vote higher than 10 out of 10 for this film
","This film is an absolutely stupendous achievement. Every aspect of this production is perfect. Brilliantly photographed, keenly written & directed, and filled with stellar performances led by Bruno Ganz, Der Untergang piqued my curiosity and made my skin crawl.<br/><br/>I was aghast at the insanity and the horror that was the final days of the Third Reich. And leading the crazed was the Fuhrer himself, a miserable, twisted, twitching wretch of a man. Bruno Ganz is amazing as he lets us see all aspects of the man's personality, from kindly father to deranged psychopath. We see Hitler as a polite, well-mannered diner. We see Hitler as a screaming lunatic, ordering his generals to marshal forces which no longer exist. We see him as a devoted dog lover and vegetarian. We see him as a man who has no mercy for the brother of his longtime mistress (and soon-to-be wife). Mr. Ganz is worth 10 stars alone, even if you saw & heard nothing else in this film.<br/><br/>I would be remiss were I not to also sing the praises of Alexandra Maria Lara, who portrays Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries. The film is told primarily from her point of view, and Ms. Lara's performance was compelling. I have no idea how you prepare for a role like this; portraying the hopelessness of being trapped with lunatics while bombs destroy everything except your locale cannot be easy, but Ms. Lara made me feel it every time she was on the screen. (It doesn't hurt that she is breathtakingly beautiful, either.)<br/><br/>The script (by producer Bernd Eichinger) is excellent, covering a lot of ground succintly and elegantly. The direction is top-notch, providing us with the grit of real battles and the surreal atmosphere of Hitler's bunker. Locations, costumes, lighting, sets... every technical aspect of this film is perfect. It is as if they were able to somehow film the past.<br/><br/>The horrors of Nazi Germany are well documented and publicized, as we strive to prevent that particular piece of history from repeating itself. Der Untergang's greatest achievement is that it is able to so perfectly place us in the middle of 10 of the worst days in the lives of some of the worst people ever to walk the planet. To see them as human beings, and not caricatures, is amazing. I tell you, I was unable to stop myself at times from simply muttering ""that's crazy! Madness!"" How can human's become so twisted, so deranged?<br/><br/>Film is an inherently powerful medium, bombarding our senses like no other form of entertainment. As such, viewing this film in the larger context of the desirability of promulgating and maintaining a warlike culture may have a lasting impact on the viewer.<br/><br/>A masterful achievement. All involved should be proud."
"JulianMHall","10","19","23","31 May 2006"," The Truth Is Chilling
","I had the DVD of this film for my birthday, and quite by chance also bought The Name Of The Rose (also produced by Bernd Eichinger) so I had the experience of watching two movies by this superb producer in two days, filmed 20 years apart.<br/><br/>To save anyone who doesn't want to read further: I have over 200 DVDs in my collection and have no hesitation in placing this as #1.<br/><br/>Now for the review: I'm not sure it is possible to write a 'spoiler' for historic events (not counting the people who came out of Titanic crying because 'the ship sank'<??>). We know Hitler died, we know the Allies won WWII.<br/><br/>I came to this movie having read the book ""The Last Days Of Hitler"" by Hugh Trevor-Roper, who was the officer British Intelligence charged with finding out the truth, in September 1945. Obviously I was curious to see how Downfall compared.<br/><br/>The main difference is in focus. While the book looks from the top (leadership) down, the film looks from the bottom (Traudl Junge - a secretary) up. The difference in perception is fascinating.<br/><br/>Hitler: Our first view of him is somehow of a kindly man who stops dictating, looks at Traudl and says ""Let's try again"" when she fails to keep up with him. The duality of this, his private character is incredible and makes one think bipolar or schizophrenia as it seems impossible to believe that the raging monster who says that the German people do not deserve to survive is the same one who orders Junge and Christian to leave the bunker. If in his eyes the German people do not deserve life, why does he show concern for them? Is it because among his inner circle they are one of the vanishing number who have never betrayed him?<br/><br/>Eva Braun: Blind loyalty is the only description I can find for her. Her devotion to Hitler is total, even when pleading for the life of Fegelein she bows unquestioningly to his decision.<br/><br/>Traudl Junge: I can't say more than the lady herself, who in the DVD starts and ends the film with her judgment on herself. Her very simple stance (paraphrased) was ""Ignorance is no excuse. Youth is no excuse. I could have asked. I didn't want to know.""<br/><br/>Josef Goebbels: Frightening. A true sociopath in every sense of the word. Hitler may have had the 'excuse' of mental illness towards the end, but Goebbels' actions were those of a rational thinking man who just did not see anything wrong in his actions. The ranting of a clearly unhinged mind is one thing, but save us all from the man who calmly considers his actions and rationalises such atrocities as those explained away by Goebbels.<br/><br/>However, again like Hitler, his portrayal showed a stark duality to his character. One moment singing 'Happy Birthday' to Hitler with his children, with a warm smile and sparkling eyes; the next telling Traudl Junge very calmly that the German people quite rightly deserved the fate that was being visited on them.<br/><br/>Magda Goebbels: As with other reviewers here, I found her almost the most chilling, second only to her husband. How any mother could deliberately and calmly bring about the deaths of her own children is something a rational mind cannot comprehend.<br/><br/>Every single performance in the movie was captivating. I was glued to the screen from beginning to end. Bruno Ganz et al were perfect in their roles and brought every person back to life; as noted above sometimes to chilling effect. Talking to a friend on the phone about the film he thought I meant that the characters were stereotypical 'nasty Germans', but this is *not* the case.<br/><br/>I've mentioned the duality of the main characters, but there were others, Prof. Dr. Ernst-Günter Schenck, Prof. Dr. Werner Haase, SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to name but a few who showed that not all Germans were rabid Nazis, and that those who were, were very much in the minority. The Army in particular just wanted to get the war over with the minimum of casualties; a wish shared I think by every military commander throughout history.<br/><br/>The look of the film was authentic and very atmospheric; whether in the cramped bunker (apparently built more as an authentic replica than a film-set) where the shots were mostly taken hand held as there was no space for a mounted camera; to the outdoor shots filmed in St Petersburg. It is rivaled in this respect only by Enemy At The Gates for capturing the full horror and idiocy of war.<br/><br/>For true historians of the war - a must see.<br/><br/>For all modern history students - a must see.<br/><br/>For all who have never lived through war (I myself am 36 so I have not)<br/><br/>Lest We Forget.<br/><br/>A Must See."
"Marx_Bros_Fan86","10","21","26","10 February 2009"," Probably the most accurate WW II movie I have ever seen
","A lot of war movies have a sense of patriotism or commercialism, but Der Untergang feels like it is just giving you the cold hard facts of the last ten days of the Third Reich. I have to commend the filmmakers for not using black and white or filtering the color, like many other WW II movies today. It is becoming a cliché. The film is based on Traudl Junge's recollections of the last ten days she spent in Hitler's Bunker. It takes place entirely in the Bunker, which gives the film a very claustrophobic feel. As the outcome of the war becomes clearer, the Bunker becomes a cesspool of drunkenness, denial, and even death.<br/><br/>Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge has a strange relationship with him. She stays with him out of sympathy and loyalty, but she is often horrified by his cruelty and inhumanity. This might be difficult to understand but I believe this makes the movie all the more realistic. She can recognize cruelty when she sees it but Hitler is the Fuhrer, a man who is practically worshiped. Hitler is shown to have elements of humanity. He despises smoking, loves his dog Blondi, and genuinely seems to care for his secretaries and Dr. Goebbel's children. We can feel his sorrow as the Russians advance toward Berlin. His dream of a German Empire had been lost and it breaks his soul. One of my favorite shots in the film is that of Hitler staring silently at a picture of Frederick the Great, seemingly thinking about his failures.<br/><br/>This is not to say Der Untergang is pro Nazi. I believe that by portraying Hitler's humanity the film makes his crimes all the more terrible. If he was just a one dimensional monster that would be his excuse. The inhumanity of the Third Reich does emerge throughout the film. Hitler blames the German people for the defeat of the military, calling them cowards and saying they deserve their fate. Joseph Goebbels expresses similar sentiments. Magda Goebbels says she cannot live in a world without National Socialism, and poisons her children before committing suicide with her husband.<br/><br/>The film perfectly captures an aura of hopelessness and denial. Eva Braun throws a party in the middle of the Russian bombing, trying to get her mind off Germany's impending defeat. She does anything and everything to keep her mind off the war. Hitler orders his Generals to move Tank divisions that do not exist or are too crippled to be of any use. He blames his Generals for Germany's defeat and not himself, which he usually did in real life. People around Hitler are aware that the situation is hopeless and betray him to save their own skin. <br/><br/>In the midst of all the madness, some people have retained their sanity. Professor Schenck, a German Doctor, tries to help the wounded soldiers and civilians when his own government abandons them. Berlin is in ruins and people are left to fend for themselves. An old man tries to convince soldiers who are no more than thirteen that there is no point in fighting, but to no avail. Eva Braun's brother-in-law Fegelein tries to convince Braun to leave Berlin, but she cannot leave the Fuhrer. We sympathize with these people, and they only show how insane the Third Reich was. People commit suicide out of devotion to the Fuhrer. <br/><br/>Corinna Harfouch plays a chilling Magda Goebbels; the scene where she pleads with Hitler not to kill himself was outstanding. The star of this movie though, is Bruno Ganz. His performance as Hitler feels so authentic it is frightening. If I ever had to recommend a movie just to see one performance, this would be one of them. Hitler has been played by great actors like Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guinness, but Ganz has received the most praise. I will seek out more of Ganz's movies based on this performance. <br/><br/>At the end of the film, an excerpt from an interview with the real Traudl Junge is shown. She says that at the time of the Nuremberg trials she was shocked by what had happened in the Concentration Camps but did not consider herself responsible. Now she admits that she had no excuse. I would imagine this is how many Germans from her generation feel. I highly recommend Der Untergang to anyone who is interested in The Third Reich or anyone who appreciates good film making."
"Monte-Cristo","10","25","32","27 February 2005"," Important for our understanding of How It All Could Happen
","This is an important film and absolutely a must for anyone who has ever pondered how WWII, the Holocaust and all that was at all possible.<br/><br/>Der Untergang has sometimes been criticized for making Hitler and the Nazis look sympathetic and human. I saw it like this: the most horrifying thing about Hitler and Nazis is that they WERE humans, not some caricature monsters of hell. The movie displays this very well, without sympathizing or underlining the evil of these human beings.<br/><br/>If you're a human being equipped with normal feelings, you ARE right in feeling slightly compassionate towards a crying Hitler. But at the same time, if you're a normal person, your compassion vanishes when you remember why he's crying. He's not regretting his inhuman deeds. He's not feeling remorse for the suffering of other people. He's crying because his horrible plans have failed, because he thinks the German people have failed him.<br/><br/>I also think Der Untergang points out an important thing about the Nazi ideology. It was and is evil because it is based on intense hate and the conscious rejection of compassion. People blinded by this kind of ideology are also blinded by hatred, and as we know this phenomenon is unfortunately alive and well in today's world, in the East and the West as well. Movies like Der Untergang give us an important lesson in understanding this dangerous way of thought and the utter madness and vanity of war. Go see this if you can."
"theantigaz","9","14","17","22 April 2005"," The End
","Now here is a novel idea, making a movie from the ""enemy's"" point of view, attaching a human face to probably the most notorious institute of evil in human history. Before watching this film, I had reservations over how much I would enjoy it and what I might gain from it. I was concerned that the film may be an attempt to show the human side of the Nazi party, to make us sympathetic not to their cause, but to their human nature. I had to think to myself, do I really want to attach a human element to people who history has painted as monsters? The film begins with Hitler recruiting Traudl Junge as a new secretary in 1942, from this point onwards the film is predominantly (but not entirely) seen through her eyes. This key scene at the beginning of the film shows how people reacted to their leader with fanatical loyalty, holding him high in reverence. This gives us a brief insight into the belief of his followers that what they were doing would lead them to a golden utopia, a better world. All to often in films concerning Nazi's, they are portrayed as evil personified, killing for killing's sake, being evil for the sake of being evil. What we get throughout this film is a more realistic viewpoint of people's attitudes. The people who followed Hitler may have no entirely agreed with everything he said, may have not hung on his every word, but believed that he would lead them to a greater future, as such they followed.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz, does a magnificent job of playing one of history's most notorious and documented individuals. He plays the role as, what I feel, accurately and realistically as possible. He resists the temptation to play Hitler as an uber-evil super-villain, disregarding all life who opposes him and wiping out humans at a whim. He plays the roles as an ageing leader, loosing grip on his health, his sanity and his conquest. A man who was kind, considerate and caring to children, his dog and his civilian staff, but who also attempted to wipe out an entire race of people and was proud of himself for doing it. It shows a man willing to send young children into the street to resist enemy advancement, it shows a man who believes that the civilian population would not be evacuated, as it was their chance to rise up (women and children, the old and sick, un armed) and prove they deserved victory. This film raises the question, was Hitler an evil man who practised evil deeds through his beliefs? or were his evil deeds a result of his absolute pursuit of his beliefs? Watching Ganz's performance, you get the feeling all Hitler had left before he took his life, was his ideals (not that this is anything to be proud of). He had lost the war, he had lost the respect of several of his commanding officers and he had lost his grip on reality.<br/><br/>The film also shows Hitler's closest officers and staff, it shows how they react to the downfall. Some have blind and fanatical faith that Hitler will act as their saviour and devise a scheme to turn the battle around. Some accept that their leader has lost his grip, but follow with blind devotion anyway. Some are not so sure and see the cracks in the beliefs they were fighting for. The film shows these often horrifying moments and realisations in all to realistic detail.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Downfall shows the human and personal element of the end of the war for Hitler and the Nazis. It shows how real people, people who tell jokes, drink, socialise, listen to songs and dance, also followed national socialism with a devotion that drove them to do the terrible things they did. It shows how they did not believe what they were doing was wrong, in their minds they were paving the way for their glorious future. It also shows their fanatical devotion and blind faith in their goal, led to their downfall, both as a movement and as human beings.<br/><br/>Downfall is an amazing and powerful film, documenting an unseen side of a major historical event. The film ends with video footage of the real Traudl Junge talking about her feelings towards the war and he involvement with the Nazis. She says that when she first became involved with the Nazis, she was in awe of their power and beliefs, she may have not agreed with everything they did, but what difference would her being involved or not make? She was ignorant to their deeds and as such held a clean conscience. Then she says has realised over time she had the power not to be ignorant to their deeds, that she should have stayed away from them, realising them for the evil that they were. I felt she was warning what ignorance can lead to, that no matter how tiny one person is in the scheme of things, it is no excuse to contribute towards the wrong cause.<br/><br/>Excellent historical film, highly recommended."

Deep in his bunker, Hitler continues to rule with his group of generals, families and Traudl, his secretary. Awaiting armies that no longer exist and making plans that his generals are too scared to tell him are impossible, Hitler refuses to surrender as the streets and citizens of Berlin suffer between the remaining defending forces and the advancing Russian army. Gradually, as it becomes obvious that all is lost, the dream collapses and all that is left is death.<br/><br/>A few months ago, a fellow user on this site asked me if I thought if Der Untergang was going to get nominated for an Oscar or not; I must admit that at the time I had not heard of it, but decided to see it if I got the chance. Of course it took me a few weeks to be in the mood for a long war movie that I knew was not going to have a good ending for anyone. When I went to see this film, the woman selling me my tickets asked if I knew it was a German film, I asked why it mattered and she said that they had had quite a few people leave the screening complaining about the fact it wasn't in English; doubtless these people then went into the next available screening of Be Cool (or whatever) and turned off their hearts and minds and just talked their way through the movie. Anyway, enough of my multiplex complaining, in fairness I did join a surprisingly full screening of this film and immediately got into it. The focus of the story was the bunker and it is compelling in its portrayal, with the cold emotion, the cruel sentiments and the utter pointlessness of the whole thing.<br/><br/>The characters are not that well developed; they were never really people to me but they did enough to fit their roles within this story. That said, the whole story is compelling and it didn't matter that I didn't care for the characters as people because they were gripping to watch nonetheless. The film works well to paint the inanity of the whole thing but also cut in moments that are so cold that they almost made me shiver  for example, when Hitler is told of the loss of all the young officers, he simply replies ""that is what the young are for"". The film does not forget the people above ground and the scenes of destruction of Berlin are impacting  those who say that the civilians deserved it should see this and try to understand what they would have done in the situation; I am part of a country that went to war with Iraq, by that logic I deserve to have that country retaliate against me, even though I opposed the manner in which we did it.<br/><br/>The acting is classy even though the characters are quite thin at times. Ganz is a great Hitler and gets it spot on throughout the film; however he does well not to dominate the film  his death (no spoiler there) doesn't stop the film because he was not what the film was all about. Lara is good although a bit too wide-eyed to convince; her real confessions at the end of the film are a bit too forgiving of her as a person but it does serve as a fair ending to the film. Harfouch and Matthes are cold and effective as the Goebbels' while the rest of the support cast all fit their roles well, with a good mix of opinions and approaches across the generals facing Hitler.<br/><br/>Overall this is a good film although it is not an easy one to watch. The bunker scenes are cold and compelling even if the characters are broad historical reference points rather than people, meanwhile the attacks on Berlin are brutal and difficult to just watch without being moved. The manner in which the film ends is just as you'd expect, with nothing achieved but destruction by all of German's years before and during the war. The end credits remind us that 50 million people died during the war, including 6 million Jews and ethnic minorities systematically murdered  having seen the men who organised all this taking their own lives the main thing I felt was just how pointless and wasteful the whole thing had been and I left the film having ""enjoyed"" the quality film but being utterly depressed by the world in which we live."
"nirvana_serendipity","10","11","13","3 January 2006"," The best movie seen so far
","I am not very much into history events, so cant be sure about any historical goof in the movie but I have to admit that I have never seen such a FLAWLESS movie before. screenplay and direction is simply awesome, and what makes the movie a 'classic' is the acting. Bruno Ganz, Alexandra Maria Lara and Juliane Köhler have given one of the best performances ever. They have lived through the characters, simply irresistible. This movie has actuated me to explore more movies from the director and the actors. I would have enjoyed movie more if I knew German as I had to ping pong between subtitles and the movie. Personally, I would rate this movie higher than Godfather or any other movie."
"the_green_bowl","10","11","13","11 December 2005"," Outstanding
","The outstanding qualities of this film have already been discussed at length, I want to address some of the criticisms levelled against this film by 'the experts' (critics and historians).<br/><br/>Why are they so outraged by a film that portrays the nazi leadership as human beings? The actions and mannerisms shown in this film are entirely consistent with how those people acted in real life. Yes, Hitler was a genocidal leader, but he was just a man, not a demon. He was capable of great cruelty but was it is often remarked that he was capable of decent conversation with people and was generally amiable but patronising in his dealings with subordinates. These attributes, I feel, were accurately portrayed in the film.<br/><br/>What about the film portraying war criminals (eg, keitel, jodl, speer) in a positive light, as brave and honourable men? This film made it clear that it was a representation of the final days and hours of the nazi regime. the death camps have been liberated by the advancing allies, the victories of 1939-41 a distant memory. Yes, these people were guilty of war crimes but that doesn't mean they would act like in a cowardly or dishonourable way when their homeland was under siege.<br/><br/>Take a look at any good film, book or just at humanity in general, you will see that ALL people are capable of cruelty but also of honour, bravery and loyalty.<br/><br/>Why is it controversial to portray the nazi leadership in such a way? I think the film displays well the internal tug-of-war - loyalty to their leader against reality and self-preservation - taking place in each persons head while they deal with the inevitable capitulation.<br/><br/>Finally, where are these critics when Hollywood produces some awful pap that portrays historical events emerges? Whether they re-write history (eg. braveheart or mel gibsons patriot) or try and play 13th century characters with 21st century liberal emotions (eg. kingdom of heaven) these films escape the large scale criticisms levelled at der untergang.<br/><br/>Why does Hollywood produce this nonsense? Is the true story of what happened (the American revolution, the crusades, ww2) not interesting enough for cinema viewing? I think it is and the accurate, human portrayal of Hitler and the German people in der untergang proves this."

","The film deals with the history of Hitler's last days in underground bunker , it's the true story of the historic downfall and death (at age 55 in 1945) of the infamous Nazi dictator's culprit of death of 50 million people during second war world and killing of 6 million Jewish in concentration camps . The Fuhrer's last few tortured days in his underground bunker against a Berlin background . Hitler had height five feet , seven inches , eyes black , hair black , shaggy locks hung over forehead , complexion sallow , wide mustache , various hairs on each side ; besides he had marked devotion to brown shirts and old trench-coat and always surrounded by armed thugs and expert gunmen . He had demented gaze with tendency to become hysterical on slight provocation with delusions , particularly upon his place in history and his powers over vast numbers of people and addicted to public hysteria on race purity , and known to throw himself on the floor and gnaw rugs, guttural voice apt to rise to shrill tones when excited or thwarted . He was a congenital liar suffering from dreams of persecution . Almost all these physical descriptions and particulars of Hitler are perfectly incarnated by Bruno Ganz who even studied Parkinson's disease patients in a Swiss hospital to prepare for his role . Thus , he magnificently plays him as a sadistic , malicious , dangerous , vengeful, mystical and maniacal man .<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz's portrayal is the perfection in the Hitler role one would expect at least on the surface , he gives insight to his madness and with persuasive qualities of his interpretation . A flawless casting with excellent German actors such as Alexandra Maria Lara (personal secretary Traudl Junge and the picture is based on his book) as co-protagonist , Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun) and distinguished players as Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbles) , Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbles) and Thomas Kretschman . Besides , a nice support cast who play to famous characters as Martin Borman , Alber Speer , General Keitel , General Jodl and Hermann Goering and specially Heimrich Himmler who will betray to Hitler deciding along with the count Bernardotte to agree peace with the Allies , originating his hysteria splendidly reflected in the movie . In spite of Berlin is surrounded and meanwhile the bloody war with enormous bombing fall about the survivors and last defending , Hitler prepares the sad farewell very well narrated by the director Oliver Hirschbiegel and superbly captured the atmosphere by the cameras . The motion picture is one of the best war movies ever made , on pair with ¨Das Boot (also German movie and directed by Wolfgang Petersen) and ¨Saving private Ryan¨ (Steven Spielberg) . The flick will appeal to historical cinema enthusiasts and warlike genre fans. Rating : Above average and astounding , being interesting and thoughtful ."
"cowboykalira","10","10","12","21 June 2012"," Just to set the record straight
","I feel the praise of this movie has been sung many times already on this site, so I will not go into all that it does right. However, after reading some of the reviews that are rightfully in the back pages here, I do think there is an issue that needs to be addressed here.<br/><br/>Apparently some people think we are all ignorant children, who need to be spoon-fed a message about how ""inhuman"" the Nazis were. I have even seen reviews that called this movie dangerous, because it sympathized with Hitler.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film yet, don't get fooled by these misguided comments. If this movie is dangerous, it is dangerous to people who wish to believe that Adolf Hitler was Satan incarnate, and that all who followed him were bloodthirsty demons who fed on baby corpses. I can hardly believe this fact offends people but: he wasn't, and they weren't. Both Hitler and his followers were human beings, who did things human beings do. They were friendly to each other, they cared for the people close to them, while at the same time plotting to kill millions of innocent people. They enjoyed cake and embraced their lovers, and then decided to send twelve year old boys to sacrifice their lives to keep off the Russian army for a couple of hours more.<br/><br/>This is what Der Untergang shows, and why it was hailed with so much praise. It actually moved beyond the cardboard cut-out cliché of movie Nazis. Just show a man utterly devoid of any humanity, a death machine, and stick him in a nazi uniform, and hey presto, an accurate depiction of a nazi. That has all been done thousands of times, and it makes us feel safe, because we can identify them as bad guys from a mile away, and we can then morally judge the idiots that fell for the whole nazi movement. We would never fall for anyone that evil. This movie chooses selfconsciously not to go for that approach, but instead show us the true insanity of the nazi-regime. That they actually believed that what they were doing was for the good of the German people.<br/><br/>If people see Der Untergang as a campaign to show the Nazis as the good guys, let them explain the scene in which Frau Goebbels killed her own children, the scene in which Hitler condemns the German people for being weaklings who deserve death, or the scene where Joseph Goebbels tells an army officer that the German people brought their destruction on themselves, with a smirk on his face, showing he enjoys this consequence of his decision (or, for that matter, one of the many other scenes which show the cruelty of the Nazis). Do you really believe this movie will make anyone believe the Nazis were just idealistic dreamers who should be sympathized with for not achieving their goals?"
"johnmartin323","Null","10","12","29 August 2007"," A landmark performance
","I would give this an 7.5 or 8, if it were not for Bruno Ganz. In fact, I will dare say that the biggest crime surrounding this film is that Ganz was not lauded with every single acting award available. Never before has such dimensionality and care been applied to a performance of, quite possibly, the most vile human who ever lived (with the exception, perhaps, of his cohort Himmler). It's a confusing, sharp yet tender mix of sorrow, pity, anger, and ultimately, frustration. <br/><br/>Initially, I figured this would be a very low budget chamber piece. But it is as epic in scope as a Spielberg war film, with effects to match. A real surprise. But don't be fooled by eye candy. Der Untergang is a human story. It is an amazing built film. And it is unreal. A must-see."
"Galina_movie_fan","9","10","12","24 August 2005"," ""You have to feel that Hitler was a human being; only then he is a real horror.""
","The first internationally released German production to feature Hitler as a central figure, ""Downfall"" (2004) takes place in the dismal gloomy Berlin during April - May 1945 in anticipation of the inevitable German defeat. The film shows the last days of Hitler and those close to him through the eyes of his young secretary, Traudl Junge.<br/><br/>Oliver Hirschbiegel's film has been criticized by some circles as presenting a ""too sympathetic"" portrait of the Fuhrer. I don't believe anything in the film suggests that its creators sympathize with the Nazi regime and those who had orchestrated it.<br/><br/>Showing Hitler as a human being (amazing performance by Bruno Ganz), a man who loved his dog, was a vegetarian and could display some moments of tenderness did not undermine the overall image of a lonely, domineering, conscienceless, and hateful man who believed that his people, his compatriots, women and children deserve to die because they are no longer deserve to live and because ""in a war as such there are no civilians"".<br/><br/>Did those who think that that the film ""humanized"" Hitler forget the most chilling scene in the movie, the one that shows Frau Goebbels crush the ampoules with cyanide between her children's teeth, after they had been dosed with a sleeping draught? She did it not because she was scared of what would happen to them after the war, no, her reason was, ""The country without National Socialism and its party is not worth living in"". How dangerous Hitler was if he could induce such a blind devotion that could convince a mother of six to murder her children in cold blood.<br/><br/>Bernd Eichinger, the producer and scriptwriter of ""Downfall"" emphasized, the greatest danger he saw in making a film about Hitler was the temptation to show him as a psychopath or madman: ""Hitler possessed an enormous criminal and destructive energy, and he was a barbarian in the most fundamental sense of the term... But I am convinced that he was totally of sound mind until the very end, which is why leadership never slipped from his hands."" <br/><br/>The film's director Oliver Hirschbiege says that, in the same way it was evil of Hitler to see Jews as less than human beings - i.e. as ""insects"" - it would be equally wrong to portray Hitler as a madman, because that would excuse him of culpability: ""I think the biggest mistake is to have an image of Hitler as insane - that he was not a human being but a monster. The most important point to realize is that Hitler was not a madman, not a psychopath or someone on drugs, which implies that he wasn't responsible for what he was doing. Of course he was responsible! ""For me, (this film is) paying homage to and truly honoring the victims, because we fall short if we explain the Holocaust by stating that they were all out of their minds. They knew what they were doing!"" <br/><br/>I believe that the result of their work, the film I saw last night is absolutely unforgettable - honest, powerful and devastating. It is a masterwork of film-making and a very important in its objectivity historical document.<br/><br/>9.5/10"
"Tachikoma-2","10","16","21","17 December 2008"," Death Of an Empire
","World War 2 is to a large extent a myth. It is a video game. It is the never ending virtual battle of Normandy. It is a teenager called ""killer-x"" online fragging n00bs. World War 2 is when the glorious, noble west defeated the Great Satan. World War 2 lasted six years and yet it never ended. We in the west keep finding new Hitlers to kill, new evils to fight. Yet, the World War II is filled with uncomfortable facts. I should know. For my country was allied with the Nazi Germany fighting Soviet Union. And It was the cold Russian winters that broke the Nazi war machine.<br/><br/>That's why I don't watch WW2 movies. Only Das Boot has managed to capture the madness and the futility of war properly. It is only when you have lost everything, that you are forced to come to terms with what you have done.<br/><br/>Der Untergang is the finest war movie I have ever seen in my entire life.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is simply mesmerizing as Adolf Hitler. Hitler is the Roman Emperor watching his once mighty Empire come to a bitter end, refusing to accept it. Sanity has been abandoned long time a go. Hitler is moving imaginary armies on a map. Coming up with plans to outflank the Soviet beast that is fast approaching the new Rome, Berlin. Sometimes the devil is overcome with fartherly love towards his flawed little children, who can't perform even the simplest of tasks in his powerful presence. He understands their shortcomings and shows patience. He charms the people and minutes later curses his Generals for betraying him. ""The best Germans died long a go! I am surrounded with weaklings!"" He yells. <br/><br/>Eva Brauns refusal to come to terms with what is happening (The Empire is ending), is a true testament to human madness. Bombs go off just meters away but she'll be damned before that stops her from dancing and throwing a party. ""Why are people so depressing? Let's have some fun!"" For a few minutes we see the young ladies go outside the bunker to have a cigarette. We learn that life actually does go on. Bombs go off again and we descend back into the madhouse. Back into the bunker. Mass suicides, decadence of the human soul continue inside Hitlers house of insanity. At least Eva has the love of her life beside her now. Now at the end Hitler is hers. <br/><br/>The reasons why the Nazi regime fought till the bitter end, was because of the allied policy of Unconditional surrender, Morgenthau Plan and World War 1. Not because of some insane loyalty towards a brutal dictator. People rarely like dictators. Der Untergang shows no love towards the dictator either, but for the first time the Dictator is human. And that is the big lesson. The Great Devils are in fact human. They represent the ultimate failure of the human spirit."
"sherwelthlangley","10","12","15","15 January 2009"," One of the best WWII films ever made, brilliantly depicting the turmoil of the Third Reich's last days.
","I admit that I only heard of this movie through watching Youtube spoofs of Hitler's tirade scene, but the film interested me so much that I had to see for myself. I only EVER give reviews to movies which I feel are either terrible or extraordinary. This movie was the latter. It is by far one of the best WWII films ever made, and the best made in the 21st century.<br/><br/>I was blown away when I finished the film, stunned by its visual effect quality, precise acting, and near perfect play-out of the plot. The film shows the tumultuous and rocky end of the Reich's last 12 days, as you witness the end of Hitler's empire in his very bunker. The screenplay gives marvelous insight into the inner conflict that the Fuhrer himself suffers as well as the conflict with his most loyal commanders and generals. Seeing the story from the eyes of Traudl Junge (played by the beautiful and talented Alexandra Maria Lara)is another special treat, as you see her own struggle between loyalty to the Reich and personal conscience.<br/><br/>The film is by far superior to many of its ""end-of-the-Reich"" predecessors. For its brilliant screenplay, superb acting, and intense storytelling, it gets a 10 from me."
"shelob302001","10","12","15","22 December 2005"," A rewarding experience!
","While I didn't see Downfall in theaters, I had heard the great word of mouth that it had received and quickly picked it up on DVD. The movie totally took me by surprise and not only amazed, but also shocked and, in an unanticipated turn of events, saddened me. It is something that I did not expect from a picture about the death of Adolf Hitler. Downfall tells the tragic tale of a madman, a person who, while still very human, is the ultimate victim of the sins that man, in his very nature, embodies.<br/><br/>The film is based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), who was Hitler's appointed secretary. The plot also uses Inside Hitler's Bunker by Joachim Fest in order to keep the plot as historically accurate as possible. Hitler (player to a T by the remarkable Bruno Ganz) is always the main focus of the movie, and even when he is not on camera his shadow on the events that happen on screen is always felt. Minor grave endeavors are shown throughout the movie and director Oliver Hirschbiegel does a good job of connecting them to the main problem  the Nazi Party. These happenings range from instances of violence on the streets, to a shocking scene in which a mother poisons her own children as instructed by the Fuhrer himself.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part of the film is not the realistic reproduction of a bombed city, or the amazing acting by all involved, although these things are startling and deserve awards. No, the best part is definitely the way Hitler is illustrated. During his last ten days, he didn't have control over anything, not the country, not the army, and not even the Nazi party itself. While the movie depicts those things really well, it goes even deeper and acknowledges that the Fuhrer couldn't even control himself. It was something not even he realized until those final moments in that dark bunker, where he shot himself.<br/><br/>The movie looks great thanks to the cinematography of Rainer Klausmann, with battle scenes and aftermaths colored in strikingly cheerless tones. Credit also has to go to director Hirschbiegel for the choices he made as far as what to film and where in the movie to put it. It is also to his credit, the way he directs the actors. Bruno Ganz practically embodies Hitler, portraying both his flaws, and few positive traits. All the actors around him, while turning in great performances are simply sidekicks, remarkably mirroring the roles their characters played in Hitler's real life.<br/><br/>So in this film you get not only an enormously accurate picture of World War II itself, but also an accurate portrait of the life of the most important and flawed man in arguably all of human history. Downfall is an endlessly rewarding motion picture and one of the best of the year. So if you don't mind the German language and having to read subtitles, you will be able to acknowledge the importance of Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, and its way of delving deep beneath the skin of its main character."
"joachimokeefe","10","14","18","29 June 2008"," 'Saving Private Ryan' without the schmaltzy overtones.
","You couldn't really expect to make a 'typical' movie out of the story of last days of the archetypal fascist dictator. 'Untergang' seeks to illustrate the situation of 'sane' people under the control of a madman; that and the impending arrival of the Red Army is the only dramatic jeopardy available - no romantic interlude, nothing to achieve, no sentimental buddy rescue shtick. We witness the reactions of people like you and me (and don't be silly enough to imagine I include Goebbels, etc. - I mean people doing their jobs under impending calamity) who happened to be in the wrongest place at the wrongest time. If this dilemma doesn't absorb you, it's a fault of your imagination, not of the utterly brilliant recreation of something very few people survived to bear witness to. 'Untergang' doesn't seek to make a judgment of Hitler because it doesn't need to: all you need to appreciate is his increasing detachment from reality and the way that this divides the people stuck with him. If there's any sort of judgment, it's of the herd mentality of people as a whole. The film becomes a series of stunning docu-vignettes of the various levels of humanity involved, each one posing the question 'What would YOU have done?'. This film is thought-provoking, and that naturally makes many denizens of the internet uncomfortable."
"DoctorKay","8","15","20","3 July 2006"," A German opinion....
","First of all, because I think it matters, I am from Germany.<br/><br/>Almost everyday in our lives, we young German people are still confronted with what happened 60 years ago. Sometimes, we still have to be careful what we say about strangers, about people of foreign countries, about people of a different religion. 60 years after our grandparents made a few terrible mistakes. So far, so good. My generation has no idea, what it has meant to live in the 3rd Reich, how people could follow a sick man like Hitler, follow his pervert ideas, obey anything this mentally insane man. But still we have to carry our heritage, every day we have to remember what happened 60 years ago. We have to. And films like Downfall, Schindlers List or The Pianist let us not forget, let us learn and remember. And that's why movies like Downfall are necessary, are important. Especially, if they of such great quality as this one. Only in one point this film is dangerous: It creates a picture of Hitler as a man, not as a monster. A sick man, a man with pervert ideas attitudes, okay, but a man who can also be polite and regarding. A human being. It is no question, that this is an almost perfect personification of Hitler, Bruno Ganz is amazing and the scriptwriters were brilliantly informed about the Fuehrer as a person. But as I said, some people who still have these radical ideas and see Hitler as a God-like figure (and they exist, not only in Germany!) might misunderstand this personification. ""Der Untergang""is a masterpiece of German cinema, but it is nothing for a narrow-minded audience...."
"perica-43151","9","7","8","20 July 2018"," There is more than just memes
","This ultimate meme generator is one great, seriously made movie. Its authenticity is its best asset, as it shows the last days of the fallen German regime as it was. The downfall is of interest to anyone wanting to learn about history, and history is the best teacher of life. The most famous son of Austria is not portrayed entirely as a monster, which is a plus given the authenticity is the goal. But it is the crumbling empire and the atmosphere of utter despair, as the Ruskies come to deliver some well deserved come uponce and tough justice to the country that get a bit over themselves one time too many. NATo and Americans, take note. This is where arrogance and criminality on world stage has ended in history and not once, but EVERY time. Take a good, fresh look what happened to Germany, and then take a good fresh look in the mirror, and perhaps ponder a bit about fate, before making next mindless meme out of some of the many rants of the favorite son of the German nation of the times. Perspective can change, it might take a few well placed bombs from the ever unforgiving Russians, but you can get there eventually."
"cinelyze","10","11","14","24 December 2006"," ""Downfall""of a Monster
","""I was not an enthusiastic Nazi,"" a woman's voice-over tells us at the opening of ""Downfall,"" as if to underscore her lack of complicity in Germany's actions in the second World War, or perhaps to convince herself. It is 1943 when director Oliver Hirschbiegel's film about the last tormented days of Adolph Hitler begins, and that voice belongs to the real Traudl Junge (played here by Alexandra Maria Lara), one of several young women smuggled into the Führer's headquarters in East Prussia to interview for a position as his private secretary. When she messes up the first go-round at dictation, Traudl, whose curiosity about Hitler is the catalyst for her adventure, is moved by the dictator's gentleness and generosity. A moment later she is jumping for joy to land such a prestigious position.<br/><br/>Two and a half years later, things are considerably different. The German military has suffered severe losses, Berlin is under artillery attack by the advancing Russians, the great experiment in National Socialism is crumbling like the city, and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and his key commandants have retreated to the leader's private bunker. But the megalomaniacal Hitler, who irrationally still believes he can produce a Third Reich that is a German ""treasure house of art and culture"" comparable to that of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, not only refuses to give up, but also shouts at his minions that a new military strategy is in effect that will help them win the war. How delusional! <br/><br/>Despite their resolute faith in the Führer, even some of the elite members of the SS have come to mistrust his judgment. Albert Speer (Heino Ferch), the famed architect of the Third Reich, looks askance at Hitler over a table top model of the cultural structures he planned to create for the master race. Field marshall Hermann Göring cannot (or will not) obey orders. Nazi doctors refuse to let civilians and young men die without some attempt at medical attention. When Hitler is told that ""fifteen to twenty thousand"" of those young men were lost in an effort to fight off the Russians, his heartlessly-spewed response is: ""that's what they're for."" But he will go out onto the street during a lull in the shelling to honor youngsters as heroes who ""history will take note of,"" and pinch the cheek of one particularly innocent- looking lad.<br/><br/>The bipolarity of a man who himself has gone down in history as one of its greatest monsters is at the heart of ""Downfall,"" the screenplay (by Bernd Eichinger) for which is based on historian Joachim Fest's book (The Downfall: Inside Hitler's Bunker, The Last Days of the Third Reich) and on the memoir of the real Traudl Junge (Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary). The film does not ask us to sympathize with this madman (given his actions, how could it?), but it does present a profile of a man who, despite his obvious dementia, still managed to hold sway over those who earlier pledged their loyalty to him and were determined to maintain it to the bitter end. And is it ever bitter.<br/><br/>The claustrophobic confines of the elaborately designed bunker (by Production Designer Bernd Lepel) are reminiscent of the submarine in the German film ""Das Boot."" We can practically smell its fetid air and feel the walls closing in on us as the Russians close in on the city. Given these circumstances, we can understand how Eva Braun (""Nowhere in Africa's"" Juliane Köhler in another terrific performance) can say to Traudl, ""The shelling has stopped, let's go for a walk,"" even if the suggestion is as insane as staying with Hitler. <br/><br/>But like the others who stick it out and who, in many instances, make inhuman, incomprehensible sacrifices to do so, both women descend yet again to that labyrinth of madness.<br/><br/>Aside from the exploration of Hitler's increasingly fragile grip on reality, what is most fascinating about how he is depicted is his appeal, particularly to women. In addition to Traudl and Eva Braun, the short, mustachioed man with the thinning comb-over mesmerized such otherwise strong-willed women as pilot Hanna Reitsch (Anna Thalbach), and Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch), wife of Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes). As such, ""Downfall's"" strength is greatest when it sticks to these human dynamics rather than when it sidetracks to subplots outside the bunker that have little or nothing to do with the story that unfolds in that enclosed world.<br/><br/>War is the ugliest, or among the ugliest of human actions, and ""Downfall"" does not glamorize it. On the contrary, despite its technically superb cinematography (by Rainer Klausmann, who also shot ""Head On""), there are a number of graphic sequences that underscore the horrors of war, as if we needed reminding. Then again, perhaps we do. <br/><br/>""Downfall"" does not necessarily present new information on those last twelve days of Hitler's life, but it does present it in a worthwhile way. In a time of war, such as the one we are currently living in, it is important to remember that monsters are made, not born, and that they lurk beneath the surface of some otherwise very ordinary humans."
"rmax304823","8","11","14","28 March 2006"," Unforgettable
","I tuned in late to this film, not expected very much, because we have all I suppose seen so many documentaries of Hitler's last days in the bunker, and a reconstruction with Alec Guiness thrown in for good measure. Many of these presentations depend on interviews with Trudl Junge, Hitler's secretary at the time. Her descriptions of the goings on during the final days are cool, precise, and dispassionate. First Hitler said this, then Eva Braun said that, and then they went up into the garden. A human surveillance camera who seems to have no personal mechanism for judgments.<br/><br/>She was, however, quite human after all. The last shot of the film is from an interview with her before her death in 2002. She explains to us that, young as she was, she had always put aside any feeling of guilt for her involvement in the Third Reich, negligible as it was. But then, one day, she passed a monument to Sophie Scholl who sacrificed herself in the course of resisting Naziism, and Frau Junge tells the camera -- and the rest of the world -- that she realized at that moment that youth and naiveté could no longer serve as her excuse.<br/><br/>I missed the first half hour or so, but I stayed for the rest. This is an extremely powerful movie. The events in the bunker are keenly observed. There is virtually nothing in the way of sentiment or dramatic displays. If the director, Hirschbiegel, wants two officers to commit suicide he may have them walk into a room and close the door behind them, then allow us to hear two shots a bit later.<br/><br/>No one talks about despair. Instead, the officers and some of the ladies sit around a table in one of the bunker's rooms and get drunk as skunks.<br/><br/>This is a tragic ending to an insane war, and it is all enacted by human beings, not demons. Goebbels and his wife have 5 beautiful young children, a boy and four girls. They deliberately give them knockout drops, then Frau Goebbels puts a capsule of fast-acting poison in each of their mouths, one after another, and crunches the capsule by pressing each child's teeth together. Then, wordlessly, Goebbels and his wife walk up into the open where, still wordlessly, he shoots her and then himself -- off camera. The soldiers who have been waiting impatiently for this ritual to end, then scurry forward with cans of gasoline to dispose of the bodies.<br/><br/>The episode is impossible to watch without being moved. What have Goebbels and his wife died for? What did their children, who knew nothing of war or racism, die for? And, implicitly, the film asks, what did some 50 million people die for between 1939 and 1945? I am grateful to the director and the actors for keeping things so matter of fact. Preparations for a predictable death are pretty gruesome even with the most tasteful intentions, and too often executions and suicides seem to have the filmmakers' attention lavished on them for not much reason other than to pander to a morbid interest in watching someone else die, a kind of arousal jag.<br/><br/>How easy it would have been for a trashy sensibility to give us the death of Hitler's German shepherd, Blondi, in all its horror. A DOG yet! Those of us who might have cheered at Hitler's death would now have a chance to weep over Blondi's. Instead, except for a few instructive inserts, Blondi's poisoning is only glimpsed in a clumsy shot through an open doorway.<br/><br/>Congratulations to everyone involved in this production. They've given us a well-executed film, made for adults. They come along so rarely."

","I am just laughing to the comment I've just read: ""terribly boring, full of clichés"". I can't believe that Kill Bill and similar movies entered top 250. Who the hell voted for Kill Bill?! I guess movies with Will Smith and Meg Ryan take big money because people like this. This movie has great aspect of view on WWII. Every time I watch good movie about WWII I change my mood in depressive or something like that. After watching it I spent few hours thinking about that maybe most important period in history. But this is the best movie on that topic. Definitely better than Saving Private Ryan, that is, I would say a bit pro American ( I mean, American were not the only victims of WWII), though I never watched Cross of Iron."

","I'm not normally one to go for historic movies but, being of German origin and born 10 years after the end of the 2nd World War, I thought I'd have a look at it. And boy, did it knock my socks off! Having always been a dedicated anti-fascist with a left-wing past, I never imagined that I could be moved by the events and problems within the factions of Hitler's cronies, military personnel or ministers. But moved I was and I found it almost impossible to watch the last scene with Goebbels' children... The performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler is awesome and would've deserved an Oscar in my opinion and the atmosphere created in the movie is haunting. No other movie has made such an impression on me in the last couple of decades. Highly recommended."
"Danusha_Goska","10","12","16","20 March 2005"," Yes, You *Should* See ""Downfall""
","You may have reservations about seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe, as some critics have implied, the movie ""humanizes"" Hitler and Nazis.<br/><br/>Maybe it would be creepy to watch a movie where most of the action takes place in an underground bunker.<br/><br/>Maybe you just don't want to go to a foreign language film.<br/><br/>Forget your reservations. You need to see this movie, on a big screen, with an audience. It is a masterpiece. I'd rank it with ""Gone with the Wind,"" ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" and ""Saving Private Ryan."" ""Downfall"" depicts events of world historical importance through the eyes of complex characters and it does so masterfully. ""Downfall"" raises important questions, and it also presents the viewer with a compelling visual epic.<br/><br/>Performances are first-rate. Costume design, the recreation of bombed-out Berlin, of air raids, are so realistic that you feel plunged into another world.<br/><br/>From the first scene, I was completely immersed in the world of ""Downfall."" I was moved; at times I cried. On screen characters make unintentionally funny comments, for example, about how they will negotiate with the Americans after the war. More than once, everyone in the theater where I saw the movie laughed out loud.<br/><br/>And, I raged.<br/><br/>I don't know when I've reacted so strongly to a movie. I'm sure you've seen the press conference where American military show film footage of the newly captured Saddam Hussein to Iraqi journalists. The Iraqis in the audience, seeing the film footage of Hussein, began to curse and shout and shake their fists at the screen. That's how I wanted to react to this movie.<br/><br/>Like most people interested in history, I've seen archival film footage of Hitler's speeches, and productions like ""Triumph of the Will."" That film footage did not prepare me for ""Downfall""'s painstaking recreation of Nazism. There they are: Himmler, Goering, Goebbels, Speer, and Hitler himself, chatting, eating, planning, going about their day-to-day activities.<br/><br/>Their painfully realistic images on screen filled me with rage.<br/><br/>Another reviewer here commented on her strong reaction to watching Magda Goebbels murdering her own children so that they don't have to live in a world without National Socialism. That viewer said she wanted to scream at the screen. I felt that way throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Are these Nazis human? Yes. Are they sympathetic? I'd be hard pressed to imagine a normal person feeling sympathy for these Nazis. They murder their own children. Hitler is plainly depicted as a twitching failure and a pathetic narcissist who sees even his beloved German people as mere pawns who exist solely to provide greater glory for him.<br/><br/>I can't help but compare ""Downfall"" to the ""big"" epic-wanna-be American movies of 2004, from ""The Aviator"" to ""Alexander."" There is just no comparison. Hollywood, watch out.<br/><br/>During, and certainly after, the movie my mind raced. Without being at all preachy, this movie invites you to -- no, demands that you -- think about the hero worship that surrounded Hitler. Why did a nation drop to its knees for this lunatic? Why, during Berlin's final hours, didn't more people read the writing on the wall? By extension, the film invites critique of any national psychosis and hero worship. Why did these people surrender themselves to Hitler? Is there any comparison between the events on the screen and contemporary life? In a brief coda, the real Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, attempts to acquit herself by saying, paraphrase, ""Gosh, I was a young, pretty girl, what did I know or care about politics?"" But then she interrogates that stance. ""I could have informed myself. I could have learned something. Being young is no excuse."" I left the theater thinking not just about fifty years ago, but about today, about my country's involvement in Iraq, and America's largely passive response to that war."
"Theo Robertson","8","24","36","6 January 2008"," Compelling But With One Serious Flaw
","Watching DER UNTERGANG is something of a unique experience for me . It's not often I'd go out of my way to watch a foreign film , far less one that is often talkative and where the outcome is in no doubt . Even more remarkable is the fact that I sometimes rewatch this movie from start to end unable to take my eyes off screen . The reason ? It's one of the few films where the acting is truly compelling <br/><br/>I heard a lot of controversy about DER UNTERGANG as soon as Bruno Ganz had been cast and together with director Oliver Hirschbiegel they both decided to make a film where every minor detail about Hitler's last days should be totally accurate . They succeeded and that's not only my opinion because every professional historian has remarked that Ganz interpretation is the only truly accurate portrayal of Adolph Hitler . You find yourself unable to take your eyes off screen every time Hitler appears . Also of worthy note is Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbles . Note how often Matthes appears on screen where he doesn't have to say a word , his burning presence is enough to hold the audience attention and radiates great evil . It's almost as if the audience have jumped into a time machine and landed in Hitler's bunker in the spring of 1945 . It's so convincing it's almost enough to give you nightmares <br/><br/>I would have happily given DER UNTERGANG 10 out of 10 but it loses a couple of points because of a serious problem and that is the way it somehow tries to make out the people of Nazi Germany are also victims of the Nazi regime . Notice the speech by Goebbles where he sneers he's not interested in the suffering of the German civilian population because "" They voted for us and now their throats will be slit "". If you have little knowledge of European history 1939-45 ( I'm afraid such people are becoming more and more numerous as the years pass ) then you'll find yourself asking why don't the Germans just surrender ? It's easily explained by the fact that the Nazi regime murdered million upon millions of people in Eastern Europe and it's payback time as the red army advances into the heart of the Nazi regime . It's also interesting to note that we never see Soviet soldiers raping German women in their thousands . Again if someone with no knowledge of the period would ask why are the Soviets doing that ? And again the answer is simple - Revenge against a country /regime that was responsible for the deaths of almost 15% of the Soviet population . Don't you get the feeling the film wants to avoid awkward questions ? <br/><br/>This type of controversy seems to be responsible for Ganz , Matthes , Hirschbiegel and the film itself being very under rewarded at international film festivals which while being slightly understandable does seem wrong . There is no doubt in my mind that Ganz deserved the Oscar for best actor that year since it's the best performance I've ever seen by a non English speaking actor in a movie . If no one discovers time travel then this will be the closest we'll find out what it was like in the days leading up to the death of history's most hated figure"
"ccthemovieman-1","8","15","21","18 September 2007"," 'Grim' Look At The Nazis' Final Hours
","Wow, what a grim movie. How I stuck with this for 155 minutes, I don't know, but it's a fairly involving story once you get into it and you want to see how it's all played out.<br/><br/>A main reason I use the word ""grim"" is that there are more scenes with people committing suicide in this movie than all the movies (thousands) I've seen put together. <br/><br/>This German movie deals with the last days Of Hitler and the Nazis in Berlin in April of 1945. In the end, most of the people in the film either kill themselves, as mentioned, or execute their loved ones in order to avoid capture by the Russians, who overtook the city. This includes poisoning a group of young children.<br/><br/>While not overly gory, some of the scenes are shocking, ones I suspect would linger in anyone's memory..<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler was intriguing, to say the least. As an American, I can recall very few, if any, films in which Hitler was shown to this degree with this much dialog. Being such a famous figure in history, it was one of the reasons, frankly, I stayed with the film. I never this man portrayed on film.<br/><br/>Alexandra Maria Lara as ""Traudl Junge"" was the bright spot in this dismal story, a beautiful and wholesome-looking woman with an expressive face. She was the only character in the film that I cared about. Everyone else is pretty cold. Junge ""won"" the job as a secretary for Hitler and is pictured as sweet and naive woman...and just one more of the millions of victims of World War II. Victims can be survivors, too, as the story concludes, if for nothing else, for suffering with a guilty conscience for decades.<br/><br/>This war movie definitely can be classified as ""different"" and memorable. I doubt if I'd ever watch this again, but it was worth the one viewing, that's for sure."
"Quinoa1984","10","21","32","9 March 2005"," One of the best foreign films of the year
","Quite simply, the story of Downfall is of the final days of the third Reich, held up in a bunker in the center of Berlin, as Adolf Hitler and his closest minions go deeper into the hole they've dug for themselves (told through the perspective, for the most part, of Hitler's last secretary Traudl Junge). I'm not sure if it is a great film or not on a first viewing, as it is a highly emotional experience along with it being intellectual at times. It's a complex film with a specific look, and the documentary-style that borders sometimes on being too much (depending on the viewer).<br/><br/>One aspect of the film right off that fascinated me was the look. Director Hirschbiegel and DP Rainer Klaussman give scenes (I'm not certain all of them) a certain yellow-greenish tint. Perhaps this world we are seeing is meant to look like a sort of death, in a sickly kind of hue inside and outside the bunker. Or, this is just part of the style of the camera, which is often hand-held, and meant to have a Saving Private Ryan approach to the horrors of warfare. The details of most of the victims (many of which not innocent) of battle wounds or suicides are not sugar-coated with any kind of hyper-kinetic style. It's very straightforward, and all the more shocking. When Hirschbiegel shoots a pan across people (sometimes Children) that are already dead, it's certainly far more jarring than could be expected. Spielberg may try for the gritty, 'no-holds-barred' direction of the horrors of war and Nazism, a filmmaker from the country of its origin has a certain advantage.<br/><br/>The story that unfolds in Downfall is of course a doomed one at the start (doomed for everyone in the story, the Nazis and the un-seen millions of victims of Europe included). It would be one thing for the filmmakers to punch up the story of Hitler's demise with melodrama, however an aspect to the film that doesn't cheat the audience (German, American, or otherwise) is that the story is somehow objective on one level, and on another tries to find someone to connect with. Hitler (played by Wim Wenders regular Bruno Ganz) is the key character to the story, but by making the protagonist the secretary the story does have something of a portal for a viewer amid the lot of crazed, trapped characters.<br/><br/>Hitler is certainly the cold-blooded, Nietzsche-influenced Fuhrer of the lot, and others such as Eva Braun and the Goebbels are proof that what Hitler had in him was infectious not just with his nation at the outset, but also with his closest followers. His generals argue over what to do. The Russians are closing in. Eva throws a birthday party like it's nobody's business, despite bombs coming through the windows. Nazi commanders turn their backs on the Fuhrer one by one, adding to Hitler's ultimate hypocrisy. One brief exchange between two soldiers that caught my attention went as such, ""Where should we go?"" ""I don't know; some place where we're needed."" <br/><br/>Speaking of content, I must come to the point of the performances. While some actors in the soldier roles and female parts were well-cast and notable - Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl is not too forced, though one may not always find her as sympathetic as the film tries to represent - if Downfall lacked a proper actor for Hitler, it could almost slip into farce (and not the classic kind found in Chaplin or the Three Stooges). Bruno Ganz does what I see only on occasion in based-on-life dramas: he goes so deep into character that one figures that no one else could have been this person in this film. Much like with his followers, when he is in the room in a scene, the attention is all on him, as if he was that most wretched of school-teachers who gained attention through the reptilian parts of your brain. Ganz is never over-doing it when the Fuhrer flips out, and he never makes him seem too unbelievable. In other words every look that gets accentuated in a close-up or in the darkness of a room adds to the tension and horror of the whole situation.<br/><br/>When one sees the film upon a first viewing, the story of the Goebbles is likely the most disturbing for any viewer. While Mr. and Mrs. Goebbles' fates are well-documented along with the other monsters, their children's fates make for scenes that bring full circle the insanity of Hitler's own messages- the collapse of compassion, the facade of loyalty and honor, the un-stoppable hatred of Jews and anyone not of 'their' creed, all wrapped together in the climax of the picture.<br/><br/>I really was not sure what to expect from a film like this. I wasn't sure if the filmmakers would try and make Hitler seem the least bit sympathetic. They did not. I left the theater with a hatred that possibly spread further, as I take umbrage to his perversion of Nietzsche, and his ironic taste in food (vegetarian dictator, who knew). And one flaw I saw in the film was that even with being open-minded for the aspect of the 'other', from the German's perspective, there were some people and characters presented that I could not find acceptable under the writing and direction (in other words, in a few bits, the stark realism vanished). If there is anything worthy to find in the film though is it's brutally honest about the nature of fascism, and the outcome of the effects it has on a war machine like the one that unfolded with WW2. History may or may not be fogged as to what precisely happened in that bunker, but in a dramatic style not too far of a stretch from Rossellini's own Germany Year-Zero, it's definitely worth a viewing (that is, in the right frame of mind)."
"snow0r","7","11","15","3 March 2006"," Powerful Stuff
","Downfall seeks to chart the final days of the Third Reich as both Germany and Adolf Hitler stand on the brink of collapse, as the Russians advance to the heart of Berlin.<br/><br/>It is difficult to gauge whether or not Downfall is a great film or not. It seems that any film offering alternative insight to the Second World War is generally well received as either outstanding (Das Boot, 1981) or at worst, thought provoking and slightly unnerving (Max, 2002), and Downfall is a combination of all these factors.<br/><br/>To a certain extent, it's well acted. Bruno Ganz puts in an intense performance as Hitler, his mood swaying from quiet mourning to the brutal ruthlessness we all know him for, as he visibly degenerates as the war takes its toll on his sanity. What is important is that he remains unlikeable. Ganz makes him a bit more human, without engaging the audience on terms of empathy. He isn't seeking sympathy for the Devil, but is creating an accurate portrait of a man with history watching his every move. I know very little about history and the films accuracy, making the other characters simple types for me. They do an effective job but I've got nothing to base them on.<br/><br/>Downfall doesn't shy away from the more harrowing scenes of war either, focusing largely on the children drawn into it. Audiences are used to seeing soldiers and civilians die, largely thanks to Steven Spielberg, but seeing Nazi Youth soldiers executed by their superiors before they're killed by the Russians is more than what we're used to. The scene in which Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) poisons all of her children is the best (not quite the right word) example of this and is obviously chilling, as the innocents are punished for the crimes of their parents, in their sleep, no less. I was very relieved none of them woke up.<br/><br/>However, there is no one to root for here. We all know how it ends (although not exactly how) and Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is perhaps too simple a character to really engage with. For this reason, Downfall is second best to character based efforts such as Spielberg's Schindler's List (1993) and Polanski's The Pianist (2002).<br/><br/>While it is heavy stuff, and more than a little though provoking, there isn't enough emotional connection here for it to be a classic."
"Dr_Kruger","10","9","12","24 April 2008"," Astounding
","What an amazing film. I'm at a loss for words.<br/><br/>First of all, this project which took two years of director Oliver Hirschbiegel's life was an incredibly brave thing to tackle, seeing as there hasn't been a film chronicling Hitlers last days for 30+ years.<br/><br/>The attention to detail is there to see as well and as far as I can tell, is factually as accurate as it possibly can be. There is debate as to some of the possible events such as how exactly Hitler's body was disposed but it also seems in order Chronologically. On top of that it also feels very frank and honest and without compromise. Bruno Ganz is simply awesome as Hitler. His detailed research and analysis of Hitler and his mannerisms pays off spectacularly. It really feels like it could be him, and to pull that off in a much copied and more importantly, parodied figure is truly genius. Some of the scenes such as his various rants at his officers and generals, where Speer tells him of his betrayals had me in awe of this mans performance.<br/><br/>There were some incredibly shocking scenes also like where the German officer kills his family for not being able to leave Berlin.<br/><br/>Akin to 'The Pianist' this is simple, but honest film-making at it's best, which demands the utmost from cast and crew in order to succeed, typified by the final scene with the Goebbels children and the Goebbels themselves. I must say, I thought the casting for Goebbels was tremendous.<br/><br/>Put simply, this is a film that, like 'All quiet on the Western Front', will be remembered in 100 years time"

I've also been particularly fascinated about what had gone on in the bunker during those last days. This movie which is supposed to be very close to reality gives a remarkable depiction of what actually went on in there.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","10","14","8 April 2005"," A chillingly accurate portrayal of Der Führer and the fall of The Third Reich
","Adolf Hitler. The very name is enough to send a chill down your spine. Not because of what it is or was, but because of what it stands for, what we involuntarily and immediately think of when we are reminded of him. The deaths of so many people and the cause of so much evil. Now, almost sixty years after his death, we finally get a chance to see his downfall, his last hours and days... and this turns out to be a very revealing portrayal. Oliver Hirschbiegel takes what so many people have tried to turn into a monster and makes it human again, makes us believe that this man actually existed and was a man, not a beast. We see Hitler's frustration at defeat, his kindness to his employees, his refusal to accept the truth. The plot is very good, and almost completely authentic. I could only find two historical inaccuracies in the film, and that is incredible, compared to the amount of stuff that was as if taken directly from the history book or another equally reliable source. The pacing is great. I was hardly bored at any point during the film, despite it being quite long and the language spoken was one I couldn't understand(thank god for subtitles). With that said, I have to applaud this film's realism and authenticity. Every single German character in the film speaks German. There are a few scenes with Russian characters as well... and they naturally speak Russian. Not English with a poorly faked accent, like we generally see in Hollywood films. In fact, there is not really any Hollywood in the film. Just gritty, hard realism. No heroic acts that are rewarded. No 'fireball' explosions. No holding back on injuries, even when it comes to 'our heroes'. Actually, that's probably what impressed me the most(when it comes to non-Hollywood stuff in this film); there are no heroes. No one is raised above the rest, no one is pure, good and true *all the time*... no one is a hero. Everyone is a human being. The acting is flawless. Bruno Ganz is a perfect choice for Adolf Hitler. No, scratch that; THE perfect choice. You forget that you're watching an actor. You're completely absorbed by his performance. The casting was mostly spot-on, with most of the historical characters looking and acting just like they did in real life. The details are another thing that raises this film to a new level. The tiniest little things in these people's lives, the most human and typical things are presented as they are or were, in the film. Hitler's Parkinson's disease, Goebbels' slight limp, etc. Smaller details include a soldier quickly rubbing his eyes of soot and gunpowder before looking through binoculars and a brief dialog showing Hitler and his promises' effect on many Germans, even children. This is just so talented directing, it's hard to say anything negative. The editing is sharp and the cinematography is perfect. Not one shot lasts too long or ends too early. A few things were changed(from the historical record of what happened) for dramatical reasons, but it didn't bother me and probably won't be a deal-breaker for anyone else(it really shouldn't, anyway, except maybe for historians who go for nothing but authenticity and accuracy). The one thing I will say is that no one should go see this movie unless they are absolutely certain of what they're in for, when it comes to violence and realism. This is gratuitous and detailed, no holding back. Not for the faint of heart. Definitely not. Also, you will need somewhat extensive knowledge of Hitler and the people around him in that time, or you won't really understand what is going on. Read up on him or watch a Discovery Channel special first, then watch the film. I recommend this to just about anyone who can tolerate the language(I don't know if there is a dubbed version of this film, but in my honest opinion, you should stay away from any other version than the original) and the violence, and, most importantly, the idea that Hitler was a human being, not some supernatural, cold-hearted monster. 10/10"
"DarthVoorhees","10","7","9","21 June 2008"," One of the great modern epics and one of the most haunting films ever made
","Downfall is a film not without it's flaws but I feel it is one of the most important films I've ever seen. It is so accurate and so unbiased in it's portrayal of Hitler and the final days of his Reich that we get to see the man behind the monster and the people who have sold their soul to him. Nazis weren't beacons of pure evil, they were human beings and Downfall takes this to heart. I remember the film received some criticism upon it's release for being ""sympathetic"" to the Third Reich, sympathy is not the emotion Oliver Hirschbiegel is trying to inset in his audience, I felt he wanted them to develop a sense of understanding.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is haunting and mesmerizing as Hitler, but the dictator is not the main focus of the film. It is largely an ensemble piece about the fall of Berlin to the Russian army through various perspectives. We see the efforts of an SS Doctor named Ernst Gunther Schneck as he tries to look out for the interests of his fellow Germans and we see that he is most troubled by the SS' indifference to the suffering. There is a very well done subplot about a group of Hitler youth being called into battle because there simply isn't anyone else left. The group of children have been brainwashed and believe that they must fight to the death, and they do despite the pleas of a boy's broken father. To say this is simply a film about Nazi' would be an understatement, it's a film about Germany and the uncertainty of her future.<br/><br/>We have little time to catch our breath as we are thrust into the Bunker where the Fuhrer will sit through the destruction of his empire and have to endure a hellish demise. And go through Hell he will, the fortunes of the war shift dramatically for the worse. Hitler sits in his war room moving troops across it which don't exist anymore. His Generals and followers don't know what to think anymore. Some want to continue to place complete faith in Hitler and some believe it is time to end the war. Hitler himself clings onto the slimmest chances that he can lead Germany to victory. He continues to plan for the building of a new model Berlin and seldom does he show his true intentions or thoughts. Only when his closest followers abandon him does Hitler realize that he has no chance of winning the war. We are unsure of what Hitler wants to hang onto, he makes it very clear that he doesn't care about the citizens of Berlin. He sees them as weak and as traitors to their own cause even though they continue to fight to the last man for him. In many ways the Bunker is a surreal area void of reality. In it's walls, Hitler is still a powerful leader and not a weak old man drained by war. The occupants know their fate but they never admit it or bring it up. Eva Braun plans a huge party with dancing and drinking but it is interrupted by powerless due to the firing of Russian artillery, when the power returns Eva doesn't ask if anyone is all right she orders that the music be put back on. Hitler makes a big deal about his killing himself, he is clear that this is the last and only option. When he parts with his secretaries and staff we see Hitler's trademark theatricality. He doesn't speak to any of his followers except for Magda Goebbels, whom he gives his official seal to praising her as the bravest mother in the Reich. Magda later comes to the realization that she would rather kill her young children rather than let them live in a world without their Uncle Adolf and Aunt Eva and National Socialism.<br/><br/>In the end the influence of the Third Reich only extended from the mind of a madman to a group of uncertain people buried below the rubble.<br/><br/>If Downfall has a main character it is Traudi Junge, Hitler's secretary, played by the beautiful actress Alexandra Maria Lara. This character is the most compelling in the film. She is young and by her own admission she sought a career with the Nazis because she saw an opportunity for advancement. The best scene is when the two central characters are introduced in the beginning of the film, Traudi is applying to be Hitler's secretary. Hitler's introduction into the picture is filmed relatively simply but Ganz' presence is huge and rather Traudi looks like she is looking into the eyes of God. Hitler brings the girl to his office to test her typing skills and he makes small talk about his beloved German Shepard Blondi. Ganz makes him appear like a father figure to the girl, patient and understanding. It is one of the best scenes of the film. The relationship between Traudi and Hitler is handled with utmost care. Traudi is never sure what to think about Hitler, he both repulses and fascinates her. She convinces herself that she sees something past the hate filled rants, she tries to find Hitler's soul. And the audience is brought along on this search. The thought of Hitler having a soul is a tough conundrum to think about, but past the hate,the racism, and the evil was a man who was gentle and understanding with Traudi and who loved his dear old dog Blondi.<br/><br/>Showing Hitler and his Third Reich as humans is the best way to respect the sheer evil of the Holocaust. If we think of Hitler as nothing put pure evil we lessen the tragedy and the enormity of humanity's darkest hour. A human being is capable of error and Downfall is about flawed people who allowed themselves to be taken in by a crazy man and how they and the nation of Germany had to pay for their sins"
"Buddy-51","8","7","9","24 July 2006"," grimly fascinating film
","Ever since his death in a Berlin bunker at the end of World War II, there has been endless speculation and conjecture surrounding the final days of Adolph Hitler and his long time mistress Eva Braun. A few years back, a documentary entitled ""Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary"" interviewed one of the few people who claimed to be an eyewitness to those events, a young woman hired to take dictation for Der Fuehrer for the last two and a half years of his life. ""Downfall"" is a dramatized account of what she saw.<br/><br/>Indeed, this new film begins and ends with clips from that earlier work, in which a now aged Traudl Junge attempts to explain why she allowed herself to become a devotee of both Hitler and the Nazi party (she chalks it up, basically, to ""curiosity""). After that brief preamble, ""Downfall"" plunges us immediately into that hellish time when the world lay in ruins and The Third Reich was breathing its long overdue final gasp.<br/><br/>The beauty of ""Downfall"" is not merely that it affords us a glimpse into one of the most fascinating bits of 20th Century history, but that it opens up aspects of human nature that we may not always wish to acknowledge. It shows Hitler as a man accustomed to being able to control events and the people around him suddenly rendered impotent in the face of a force - in this case the Russian army battering away at Germany's capital city - greater than himself. As events spiral more and more out of control, the dictator becomes ever more paranoid and divorced from reality (by the end he's issuing orders to an army that , quite literally, no longer exists). For him, the world suddenly divides itself up into those who will remain loyal and faithful to the bitter end and those who will become traitors both to him and to the ""glorious cause"" that defined their lives for so many years. For one thing the movie is clear to acknowledge is that, even in his final moments, Hitler remains unrepentant and convinced that not only was he right in what he did, but that future generations would come to recognize that rightness and honor him for it. In many ways, this is the story of any failed dictator whose dreams of worldwide domination end in the smoldering ruins of his own hubris.<br/><br/>But it is not merely Hitler who exhibits bizarre behavior in the face of onrushing doom. Even though most of the people who have chosen to remain in the bunker with their leader are fully aware of the fate that awaits them, they maintain many of the rituals and accoutrements of ""civilized,"" ""gracious"" living: they hold dances, sing patriotic songs, drink champagne from crystal glasses, read magazines, all the while calmly discussing the ideal way to kill themselves. Despite their fear, they are so caught up in the vision and the man to whom they have sworn allegiance that they are willing to die - and take their children with them into death - rather than live in a world without their beloved Fuehrer.<br/><br/>The makers of ""Downfall"" run the risk common to any work that attempts to provide a three-dimensional portrait of Hitler: the accusation that they are trying to ""humanize"" a man whose epic disregard for human life puts him in the category of the greatest monsters who ever lived. And, indeed, the movie does show Hitler displaying moments of warmth and tenderness, mainly aimed towards the women in his life (and, of course, his dog). Yet, who among us really believes that Hitler NEVER showed affection to those who were close to him? It was the fact that he COULD treat the people he loved in this way yet was unable to extend that same sense of empathy and concern to the faceless, nameless millions he slaughtered that made him the true incarnation of evil on earth.<br/><br/>The film also does a great job showing the varied reaction of Hitler's military commanders as they argue back and forth over whether to level with him about the hopelessness of the situation and thereby risk incurring his wrath or to continue to feed his delusions and let him go out thinking he was still master of his fate.<br/><br/>The performances are all first rate, but I would like to single out especially the lively and vivacious Juliane Kohler who manages to make Eva Braun's blind devotion to a murderous madman and fearlessness in the face of death touching, understandable, and - dare I say it? - strangely heroic. As Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara shrewdly portrays a woman whose own devotion to the man and the cause is tempered by a certain degree of rationality and fear, to the point where she can ask, in a moment of candor, how Hitler can be so kind on a personal level, yet so brutal in his comments and actions. And, of course, Bruno Ganz gives a bravura performance as Hitler, running the gamut from full-throttle mania to tender solicitude while never losing sight of the man at the core.<br/><br/>Despite being set in the past, ""Downfall"" has a great deal of relevance to our own time. To see Magda Goebbels methodically and systematically poisoning each one of her own children before having herself killed is to understand a little better how family men can fly planes filled with innocent men, women and children into skyscrapers. It's a scary and sobering sight indeed. Now if only we as a species could learn some of the lessons put forth by this film."

","This film should be shown in schools. I think that the Nazi party has always been something that is difficult for children to grasp, to horrific to be real. This film gives them a humanity that had been long overdue, and, in doing so, makes you realise how lucky we are that they were defeated. Bruno Ganz and Thomas Kretschmann put in the best performances for me, all though there was no member of the cast that I could find fault with. Schindlers List is an excellent film, but the Nazi's in that are inhumane monsters. In this film (as in The Pianist, again with Thomas Kretschmann), the humanity makes the drama all the more gripping and truthful. This world should never forget the Second World War, and i hope that this film will still be shown to all in many years time. A masterpiece"

","It may not be entertaining, Leo Di Caprio may not be in it, there may be no no melodrama, no fake emotions, no Hollywoodisation of History for American audiences, but Der Untergang is certainly one of the best period films ever. Hitler, the most odious figure in History, is portrayed not in a sympathetic way but as he was: a man, persuaded that he was doing the right thing; with painstaking realism, and aided by one of the most riveting performances ever, the film shows us that there is a monster inside every one of us, living side by side with more gentle traits.

"aeowen-03398","10","3","3","24 April 2019"," Strong and intense!!
","I have seen many films about both world wars, some were good and some bad...but Downfall seems to me, in my opinion, the most intense, deepest, and strongest movie about the demise of Hitler and the end of the European theatre.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler as if he were Hitler himself. The gestures, mannerisms, even the look would literally give an intense fright to anyone if he walked into a room where no one knew who Ganz was. So much of the story follows the real story of life in the bunker, in and around Berlin, April 1945. The film grips you with clutches of paranoia, fear, and the unknown. It is truly one of those movies that you have to truly appreciate history to understand the complexity of Germany at the final end. It is not an ordinary ""ding dong the Führer's dead"" movie; it's a compelling and to-the-point one you never want to get up and go pee kind.<br/><br/>Very sharp, deep, and intense. Definitely a buy and keep for any military or history nostalgia buff."

"PWNYCNY","10","8","11","30 March 2008"," Great movie.
","This movie probably provides the best dramatic treatment of Adolf Hitler. Unlike other movies that tend to present Hitler as a caricature, this movie opts to portray Hitler as a historical person and not as a clown. Although it is easy to reduce Hitler to a subject for mockery, this movie avoids that temptation and instead presents an Adolf Hitler the person whose actions are made even more sinister, baffling and amazing by the sheer banality of his existence. In this movie Hitler is shown not as a hysteric, not as the bombastic political actor, leader and rabble rouser familiar in all too many documentaries, but as a frail, broken, disillusioned man whose dreams have been shattered and whose closest advisers have all but abandoned him. Yet, even as Hitler himself realizes that his demise is all but inevitable, the movie shows how the cohort of secretaries, clerks and party flunkies who formed Hitler's personal staff refused to leave him and opted to stay with the Fuhrer to the bitter end. This level of devotion to a failed and doomed head of state is perhaps unprecedented in history. While the Third Reich was crumbling they stayed with the man who was responsible for the destruction of their country. Yet the same man who was capable of ordering the conquest of entire countries and the extermination of entire peoples was also capable of individual acts of kindness that makes his career all the more baffling to the audience. Can the personality and career of Adolf Hitler ever be fully explained? Maybe not, but this excellent movie at least provides a plausible glimpse of what Hitler may have been about and how his dreams of new world order came crashing down.<br/><br/>Also, special mention must be made of Bruno Ganz's uncanny resemblance to Adolf Hitler. Mr. Ganz gives what has to be the most outstanding cinematic portrayal of Adolf Hitlee. Mr. Ganz succeeds in portraying Hitler as a caricature and instead provides a credible and even-handed portrayal of a person whose actions have been the cause for the kind of scorn and mockery that obscures who Hitler was as a man."
"The Mogul","10","8","11","6 February 2006"," As brutally authentic as a film gets: there is no entertainment to be found here.
","As Downfall begins, World War Two and Berlin are already hopelessly lost, but yet Hitler issues orders to imaginary armies, and his cadre of generals never does more than tactfully disagree as millions of civilian lives are deliberately jeopardised to no meaningful end. Downfall shines a hard light into Berlin's bunkers, and illuminates a politics both repugnant, and scary in its proximity to politics we know.<br/><br/>The film follows one of Hitler's secretaries, a high-ranking army doctor, Goebbel's wife, a twelve-year old panzer killer, a general encouraging withdrawal from Berlin, and the general defending it. Their stories play out in Berlin's command bunker and through what is left of its streets and buildings. When all of their doings and meetings are put together, one arrives at a rich picture of Berlin's lasts gasps.<br/><br/>We see snatches of the ordinary Berliner's war, of the embattled soldier's war, but mostly we look in upon the actions of Hitler's officers, companions, and civilian attachés. We see them execute erratic orders; variously urge or resist a withdrawal from Berlin; prepare to slip away themselves; write last testaments; sit listless; whore; drink and carouse; labour with the wounded; or prepare for their suicide, and perhaps the murder of their family. What emerges is a compelling interrogation of fanaticism.<br/><br/>The mind boggles at the naïvety of some of the film's acquaintances, but is most disturbed by the actions of its officer class, who know Hitler's behaviour to be entirely irrational yet observe his orders all the same. Many of his generals value their duty to a madman resolved upon death above the lives of millions; the overwhelming concern of others is self-preservation. Why was their no coup in these last days? That is the question which this film will have your mind screaming.<br/><br/>Downfall feels like a fly-on-the-wall documentary, the shots are too well composed and the crew too invisible, but it feels that authentic. The dull grey-green film stock familiar from Saving Private Ryan et. al. helps, but it is the film's remarkable performances, production design, and effects, which really carry the day.<br/><br/>In appearance the film is every bit as convincing as Private Ryan, but it is made still more verisimilar by the absence of any sentimental narrative concessions. Downfall doggedly, dispassionately shows the callousness of the war and its key prosecutors. In the bunker one encounters a menagerie of moralities just as distorted as Hitler's. A few of Downfall's scenes are of the most disturbing nature.<br/><br/>Hitler is not amongst the characters that the camera loosely follows through the film. His centrality to the action probably wins him the most screen time, but our experience of him includes waiting in anterooms and peering down corridors. Thus, cunningly, the power relations around him are revealed; and we get to listen in to both back room and front room politics.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz's performance is excellent; his Hitler is delusional, tyrannical, and monumentally immoral, but still he conjures some of the charisma and personal kindness that must have seduced those around him. Incredibly, when released in Oz, film critics talked about Downfall's sympathetic portrayal of Hitler: they must have been watching a different film! Ganz is truly repellent; to take his character further would only make it a caricature. His moments of humanity, and his tired physique, only make the whole man more terrible. His portrayal rings true because we can perceive something of how he came to power.<br/><br/>Juliane Köhler also makes a powerful impression as a flighty, selfish, unhinged Eva Braun. You might just hate fanatical ice woman Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) more than her husband before the film's end. But her fanaticism is no more amazing than the determined naivety of secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara); a snippet of the real person talking in interview caps the film. What she says is what most German war survivors now say about their culpability; however, after what you've just seen, one's disbelief at such systematic ignorance is more acute than ever.<br/><br/>Downfall is flawlessly executed; the feelings it elicits are intense. It is well deserving of a ten, but one would never call this film entertainment."
"s_patterson","9","8","11","1 May 2005"," Astonishing film puts a human face on inhuman horror.
","For those unfamiliar with the film, Downfall portrays the last two weeks of the Nazi government flitting from the bunker beneath the Chancellery to the civilian bomb shelters to the embattled streets of the ruined capital.<br/><br/>It's astonishing achievement is to put a human face to some of the most infamous figures in history; it strips away the stereotypes and hyperbole and absurd dramatics to let you see the people behind the caricatures without diminishing the horrors they wrought. It brings home the meaning of Hannah Arendt's chilling phrase, ""the banality of evil"". Yet the film never descends into banality for more than a few minutes, and always to contrast it with the chaos and brutality that evil engenders.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is brilliant in his portrayal of Hitler; you can see the charm and charisma that won people to him and the monster that dwelt within. Unlike earlier portrayals which dwelt on the injections and sera he used, Ganz shows a palsied dictator with full command of his intellect (if not his emotions) right to the end. This is more horrifying than seeing a drug-addled psychopath as has become stereotypical in movies on the Third Reich... though sometimes the horror takes time to settle in, as it did for many who met the dictator in person. Ganz's Hitler is not mad but deeply in denial of the consequences of his actions and so wed to his doctrine of the fuererprincip that he is incapable of understanding defeat. His chilling switches between compassion for those in his immediate surroundings and utter ruthlessness towards everyone else are made all the more terrifying as a result, as is his repeated refusal to shoulder any blame for the disasters and desertions around him.<br/><br/>As is entirely appropriate, the film focuses on Hitler; however, it does so mainly through the eyes of his private secretary Traudl Junge (played by Alexandra Maria Lara). The film begins and ends with a voice-over by the real-life Junge (not to be missed) and the action starts by showing, as a prologue, the young Junge's application and interview for the job in 1942. We see in her the unthinking loyalty shown to her leader, often against her better judgment; though she plainly wishes to leave the bunker, she finds herself unable to do so until after the dictator's suicide. Lara's performance is overshadowed by Ganz's but this is no reflection upon her skills; and once we see her leave the Bunker we get a much clearer demonstration in her acting ability as she navigates the ruins to safety.<br/><br/>We see the horrors of the final battle primarily through the character of Peter Krantz (Donevan Gunia), a twelve-year-old awarded with the Iron Cross in Hitler's last birthday review of the troops for destroying two Soviet tanks. Krantz's desperate eagerness to strike at the enemy gives way, after a final and horrible defeat, to a child-like retreat to home and family only to see it torn apart; the irony is that it's not at the hands of vengeful Russian troops, but by Nazi vigilantes punishing ""desertion"" and disloyalty.<br/><br/>Juliane Kohler's Eva Braun shows just how shallow and banal people in high places can get. A party girl trapped in a holocaust, we see her cling to alcohol and music and routine distractions to shut out the horror. More horribly, she succeeds... her stunning (and yet entirely believable) reversal from weeping petitioner when her brother-in-law is about to be shot for desertion to obedient bride of Hitler takes the breath away. Kohler doesn't let us see much of what's inside Braun simply because there's so little there in the character; Braun is an empty shell who fills herself with the attention of others, a mere veneer of vivacity around a human void as shown by her chatty final testament (narrated over a sequence of soldiers and civilians dying brutally in the rubble above).<br/><br/>Diametrically opposed, yet in strange harmony, is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Gobbels. She is coldly intelligent and powerful yet entirely subservient to her fuehrer. Her poisoning of the children to ""save"" them from a world without Nazism is gut-churningly impossible to shut out; her shrugging off of a comforting touch by husband Joseph Gobbels (Ulrich Matthes) afterward followed by a studious application to a game of solitaire is just as wrenching, as is her pathetic final plea to a suicidal Hitler to flee the city. Matthes' doctrinaire yet emotional portrayal of the Propaganda Minister is also chilling, as is his strange helplessness and inability to face the deaths of family and leader.<br/><br/>The other performances in the film are all excellent; I only avoid mentioning further details to keep the length of this review manageable. See the film to see the dedication of the doctors within and the bizarre mix of power and powerlessness, courage and poltroonery, and insight and vapidity in the assembled generals.<br/><br/>The set dressing is thorough and good; militaria enthusiasts will see great attention to detail shown in the costuming, though alas there are some minor deficits in equipment that admittedly only those who have studied the period closely will notice. The sound is superbly authentic.<br/><br/>I'll wind this down by saying that the movie succeeds in its goal of bringing home the human face of an inhuman tragedy. I won't forget this film."

","""Downfall"" is a fascinating and compelling look at the mindset of the German people at the end of WWII, inspired mostly by the firsthand account of one of Hitler's secretaries who survived the madness that was his bunker in those last days. Here we have an excellent performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler, who shows the man's insanity, inhumanity, and his cunning way with people in his intimate circle that allowed him to seduce those around him and the German population at large. Even as everything was falling apart he still had both men and women falling at his knees begging for his next proclamation and willing to follow any order her decreed. In the end, the crushing defeat of his grand ideals, coupled with his irrational hatred for Jewish people that is actually a projection of his own inner hatred for himself and Germany (""The Germans seal their own fate. I have no sympathy for the so-called civilians,"" he says towards the end of days), lead him into paranoid despair and eventual suicide. Likewise, we get a searing performance from Julian Kohler (a fantastic actress best known for her lead in ""Nowhere in Africa"") as Eva Braun, representing perfectly the German elite seduced by the promises of a Utopian Third Reich, and who are in utter and complete denial of the horrors around them right up to the last minute as everything they fought for comes spiraling down into their own self-made hell.<br/><br/>One of the few flaws of the film is that it can't decide at times whether to be a straightforward docu-drama (there are often too many of Hitler's inner circle to keep track of) or a soaring WWII epic (there's some compelling subplots revolving around Hitler's youth movement added for dramatic effect). While it may not reach the sublime artistic ideals of ""The Pianist"" or have the emotional heft of ""Schindler's List"" or ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Downfall"" deserves a place next to those films for it's unique perspective, for better or worse, on one of the most influential men of the last hundred years and the defining moments of the 20th century."

","It has been months since Der Untergang first premiered. For one reason or another, I kept postponing it, month after month, country after country. Luck dictated I should see it on May 9th 2005, in Hannover, Germany. The 60th anniversary of the Armistice in Europe. The day we celebrate an united Europe (that same Europe that Robert Schumman kicked-off in the 50s and still works in preventing further wars). To make it clear: I am not German. Yet, for more than a few reasons, the history of the Second World War always touched me in a particular way. Not that it was any different from so many other wars. Except for the numbers. Never did human cruelty climbed to such levels. Never did we realize as then, how easy can society mutate into a monster. This was a highly intense movie to watch. Bruno Ganz will for ever be remembered as the magisterial actor that played Hitler - as Ben Kingsley is remembered for Gandhi. We see him in this film as a madman. There is no other way to describe it. He was insane. An insane man led the world to collapse, brought Humanity to its knees, and did so unquestioned. Der Untergang is full of strong imagery - it shouldn't matter if those in the streets were German or not. The human misery is total. I could not contain my tears in many occasions (not titanic tears, rather those that come from the depth, those that imply something beyond the screen. tears of History). In others, I simply had to close or cover my eyes, so brutal were the scenes. And as we come to an end, I am, as viewer, left with a sense of emptiness. The credits came, ran for 10 minutes, and I just sat there, crying compulsively for 10 minutes. Not due to the film, but to all that is behind it.<br/><br/>As I exited the theatre, I noticed a few other people drying their faces. Outside, the cold had returned.

","I have a friend that does something she calls ""art therapy."" So calls it art because it uses the same material artists do and produces similar artifacts. When other people do this, I accept it as art, meaning that I allow it to penetrate all of my inner selves it can and make whatever changes it may. After all, aren't all artists engaged with their work in messy, tearful, dangerous ways?<br/><br/>But with my friend, it is different. I know how she is damaged. I know why and a bit of how she produced her paintings. The artifact comes to me with that context. Her relationship to it is embossed on my relation to it, so it cannot dissolve into my soul. It only knows the pores of her soul. I suppose if I wanted to somehow re-enact her life it would be useful, but in truth, her stuff is useless to me. More than useless, because I can make art out of neutral found items, but hers aren't neutral.<br/><br/>One could say that I might see her demons, but I defy anyone to examine that closely and believe it true. It is not the nature of therapy to serve things for others.<br/><br/>I thought of my sad friend all throughout this film. Yes, it is skillfully produced in many ways. Yes, if you pull out this performance or that, you can admire decisions the actors have made. But films are not performances, they are narratives that resonate or not.<br/><br/>This is one of the grand therapeutic gestures the Germans are making to resolve the past and distance themselves from it. The twists of character, certain embellishments of phrase, placement of the designated watcher all got in the way for me. I knew that this was a dialog Germans were having with themselves that I was eavesdropping on and grasping for a reason why.<br/><br/>But having invested in it, both in time and emotional exercise, it does give me some value.<br/><br/>Hitler intuited the role of ceremonial theater, of defining the narrative for a people. He only allowed choreographed films and photos, and never in private moments when he wasn't performing. His most important adviser was Speer, a dramatist who found and designed the stage for the superman. Speer was the most effective dramatist in history, measured by immediate deaths at least. Speer and Reifenstahl created the first effective political propaganda film, a masterpiece by any measure.<br/><br/>Until the end, Speer as stage manager orchestrated the drama. He enters this story at the beginning, telling his man that he needs to be ""on the stage when the curtain comes down."" Later, when it really is, he visits his actor and tells him to spare the German people (which is denied as much as Hitler can). I get the feeling that this movie was as much directed by Speer to save the people as anything else he did. <br/><br/>So within the drama, we have the director, the designated watcher (our doubly seen stenographer), and historical characters playing not so much those characters but well established German stereotypes. All in all, the construction is clever, and the execution slick. <br/><br/>But it is therapeutic art. And we know it, and why it exists, and the specific damage associated with it. So even though it looks like art, it cannot be. It cannot change us.<br/><br/>See ""Conspiracy"" for something from this era that perhaps could. Shucks, I see my comment for that has been deleted.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching. <br/><br/>The film."

"DeeNine-2","9","7","10","8 July 2007"," Fascinating and uncompromising look at the final days
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>It was agreeable to see Hitler reduced to a bent, defeated, raving madman, and there is no question that Bruno Ganz looked the part. The endearments he gave to the children and to his bunker mates contrasted horrifically with his plan for them and his ""love"" for the German people. In a sense the way the final days are presented in this film reminded me of what the victims of the Nazis suffered, and that was also apropos and agreeable. Still most people do not like to see human suffering even to those who may, by all that is right, have it coming; and so it was essentially a depressing experience to watch this film.<br/><br/>Alexandria Maria Lara, who played Hitler's last personal secretary, Traudl Junge, provided the only bright spot in this necessarily grim picture. She is a fine actress, but somehow she seemed too normal, too smart actually to be the sort of worshipful underling that she must have been. Incidentally, it is from the book by the real Traudl Junge, Biz sur letzten Stunde, and from Joachim Fest's Der Untergang that this movie was adapted. The fine screenplay was written by Bernd Eichinger. Junge appears at the beginning of the film from an interview in 2001, a year before her death, to say a few words and at the end where she explains that she is essentially not that naive young person she once was who should have looked further than the fuhrer's face to see what was really going on. But she was with Hitler for three years and knew his philosophy well. Truth is she was so pleased to be his secretary that she turned a deaf ear to the truth that was in front of her.<br/><br/>Of course she was hardly the only one. An entire nation was seduced and led down the path to genocide, humiliation, starvation, near-starvation, and ignominious defeat. One thing the film does to help us understand how this could have happened is to show the blind loyalty that even some of the highest ranking officers felt toward Hitler regardless of his bumbling, his stupidity and his blatant disregard for the feelings and lives of anyone who got in his way--his essential immorality. Some say there was something in the German character that accounts for this blind obedience to authority regardless of how corrupted and evil that authority might be. Maybe in a more pluralistic and multicultural society something like this could not happen. There might be something to that, but I doubt it. Too many monsters have grown in too many different soils and in so many different cultures, I am persuaded it could happen anywhere, but perhaps not as easily and as completely as it happened in Germany.<br/><br/>It is interesting that Oliver Hirshbiegel, who directed, did not show the Red Army atrocities as they stormed into Berlin. I don't think he wanted to dilute the sense of the moral culpability of the German people.<br/><br/>I was also struck by Hitler's obsession with loyalty. This is how all dictators, warlords and, unfortunately, some respected heads of state operate: they demand unquestioned loyalty, and they ruthlessly eliminate anyone they suspect of anything but that unquestioned loyalty while rewarding the loyal. And so in such governments the head of state becomes surrounded by sycophants and toadies who tell him what he wants to hear and who live in fear of their own lives should they somehow be seen as disloyal. Indeed they sneak around trying to undermine others in other to protect themselves. They live in secrecy amid lies, intrigue and murder.<br/><br/>The film is long, 155 minutes, the bunker is dreary and most of the characters are sickies of the worse sort. We as an audience are reduced to those who see inside a cave, the floor covered with bat guano crawling with despicable creatures who feed off of one another. The stench is overwhelming. We watch transfixed for a while at the ugly, unsavory spectacle and then we turn away.<br/><br/>Can it happen again? Can it happen here? Let's hope not, but that freedom that the right assures us is not free requires more than loyalty. It requires vigilance and a willingness to speak out, the kind of vigilance that can see the danger when the government begins to deal almost exclusively in lies and misinformation, that invades other countries for dubious gain, deals in propaganda and points fingers at perceived enemies and promotes only those loyal to the leader instead of those most qualified.<br/><br/>(I said I would write this review without mentioning a certain personage, and I did, but the allusions are probably more than obvious.) See this for veteran Swiss-German actor Bruno Ganz who gave a fine performance as Hitler."

"JamesHitchcock","9","7","10","12 March 2006"," Menschlich, Allzu Menschlich
","It has sometimes been said that because men no longer believed in the Devil, God created Adolf Hitler to serve as a symbol of absolute evil. This film, which tells the story of the last few days of World War II in Europe, largely seen from the perspective of Hitler and members of his inner circle as the victorious Russian army approaches the gates of Berlin, avoids that concept and tries to show us Hitler the man rather than Hitler the devil. It has been criticised in some circles for that approach, but in my opinion the criticism is not a valid one. Hitler was precisely that- a man, no less human for also being evil. We will never succeed in understanding the crimes of the Nazis if we persist in trying to see Hitler as the spawn of Satan or as some bizarre, inhuman alien being. He was, in Nietzsche's words, menschlich, allzu menschlich. (Human, all too human).<br/><br/>To make someone seem human is not necessarily to make them seem sympathetic, but we must remember that Hitler had succeeded in obtaining more than 40% of the vote in free elections, had won the fanatical loyalty of millions of Germans and had succeeded in retaining the loyalty of many of them even when it seemed obvious that his cause was lost. (We see some of that loyalty reflected in the film, especially among the fanatical young soldiers prepared to fight to the death). If he had been an obviously evil psychopath he would never have done any of those things, but would have remained the leader of a tiny movement on the lunatic fringe of German politics, winning the loyalty of only a small fraternity of kindred spirits. He could not have succeeded without possessing immense reserves of charm and charisma.<br/><br/>This film tries to show some of the characteristics which helped Hitler in his rise to power. We see him being kind to his secretary, Traudl Junge, on whose memoirs the film was partly based, affable and friendly to the young soldiers he decorates for their desperate acts of bravery, affectionate to his dog Blondi and loving to his mistress Eva Braun. (We like to think that, sexually, Hitler must have been either abnormally perverted or abnormally repressed because we do not like the idea that so monstrous an individual had a fairly mundane sex life, a monogamous heterosexual relationship with an attractive blonde girlfriend).<br/><br/>We do, of course, see far more of the opposite side of his character. By the end of the war Hitler had lost all contact with reality, and when we first see him he is unrealistically optimistic, believing that the German army will still succeed in driving the Allies back, issuing commands to non-existent fighting units and even congratulating himself on his strategic skill which has led the enemy into a trap. Later, when even he cannot deny the imminence of defeat, he falls into self-pity, raging against the cruelty of fate or against the German people who have proved unworthy of him. We see that he was not only brutal towards his own enemies but also completely callous towards his own people, refusing to surrender and not caring how many more lives might be lost. The role of Hitler must be one of the most difficult that any actor could be called on to play, but Bruno Ganz meets the challenge magnificently. He meets the physical demands of the role, bringing out Hitler's strong Austrian accent and the paralysed arm tucked behind his back. (Hitler had been injured in a failed assassination attempt the previous year). More importantly, he also rises to its emotional demands, showing the mixture of reckless optimism and despair, impotent rage, hatred and and self-pity which characterised the Fuehrer in his last days. The one thing, however, that Hitler never does is to express any sort of contrition for his crimes, which means that although he is human he is never pitiable.<br/><br/>We also see the moral blindness of the rest of Hitler's circle. The most chilling is Corinna Harfouch's portrayal of Magda Goebbels, wife of the infamous propaganda minister, who calmly poisons her own children because she does not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism. Himmler, as deluded as his leader, vainly hopes that he can negotiate a separate peace with the Western powers that will leave him in power. Albert Speer, more realistic, sees that the war is lost and tries in vain to persuade Hitler to surrender, but he too fails to realise that it is the crimes of the Nazis, in which he played his part, that have brought this disaster upon Germany. Some relief is provided by Alexandra Maria Lara as the naive young Traudl; we also see excerpts from interviews with the real Traudl Junge towards the end of her life, when she confesses that neither her youth nor her naivety can excuse her failure to realise the true nature of the regime she served.<br/><br/>This is a bleak, grim film, set against scenes of a ruined city, with an ever-present sense of death and destruction. It is, however, a brave and powerful film which should be seen not only by anyone with an interest in the history of the Second World War but also by anyone who wants to understand the roots of human evil. No-one who has really watched it could make the mistake of considering it pro-Nazi. Oliver Hirschbiegel is to be congratulated for confronting this dark chapter in his nation's history with such courage and honesty. Congratulations are also due to Channel 4 for flying in the face of the British public's normal disdain for foreign-language films when they recently showed this important film at peak evening viewing time. 9/10"
"CSM126-1","10","7","10","17 August 2005"," The Last Days of Hitler and the Fall of the Third Reich
","'Please, retain your faith in the final victory! If you lead us, we will follow!' By the time these words are spoken to Adolf Hitler it is far too late for him to be able to reassure the hysteric woman who said them. He knows, as all his Generals know, that World War II is over. And Germany has lost. However, as his mental stability declines Hitler will forget this and try, once again, to win. Moving forces that exist only on his map and calling in strikes by planes that were destroyed months earlier, Hitler fights until his last to protect the crumbled remains of what was once his evil empire. He pores over models that represent the new cities he believes he will build, and no one has the courage to tell him that his Aryan Xanadu will never exist as anything but these models.<br/><br/>This is ""Der Untergang (The Downfall)"". The film is inspired by the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary and oblivious follower. Traudl stands at the Fuhrer's side and refuses to move despite lacking all knowledge of him, even his Holocaust. The confused young woman watches in horror as Hitler's Generals turn their backs on him, and she weeps when she finds the remains of her leader's brains scattered across a wall following a fateful gun shot.<br/><br/>""Downfall"" has a tricky goal: to show the human side of Hitler. No, it's not about making you sympathize with him. It's about showing that he wasn't some superhuman. Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler, one of the towering performances in cinema history, exposes faults in the Fuhrer. Physically, his hands twitch uncontrollably and his back is hunched as if burdened with a massive load of shame and humiliation. Mentally, he rants about wanting to speak to soldiers he knows are dead and he fabricate stories about Nazi forces hiding in Prussia, waiting to rush in and save Germany from encroaching Russian armies. As he tells these stories to his friends and confidants, you can see he is telling them to reassure himself, and not his friends.<br/><br/>Then comes the final collapse. Hitler shoots his wife, Eva Braun, and then himself so as to prevent being captured and forced to face the music. Magda Goebells poisons her children, and then sits down to a game of solitaire before facing her own death. Joseph Goebells tries to salvage the German army, but finally gives in and shoots his wife and himself. Slowly but surely, every one of the Nazi officers in Hitler's bunker commits suicide.<br/><br/>Traudl finally accepts that it is over, and joins the German army as it moves to the front lines to surrender. Finally, she passes through the Russian front. While she may have lived in freedom physically, it is doubtful she ever escaped the mental image of what she saw, and the horrible truth she learned about her Fuhrer's crimes.<br/><br/>While we may have heard many ex-Nazi's and Nazi sympathizers claim to be oblivious to Hitler's true evil, Traudl Junge is the only one I'd ever believe. When the real Traudl appeared on screen at the end of the film and said she never knew of the Holocaust until the war ended, I felt sympathy for her and I understood the power Hitler had to blind young people and lead them astray.<br/><br/>""Downfall"" has been surrounded by controversy since it debuted at the Toronto film festival last year. Critics said it sympathized too much with Hitler, which is obviously not true when you watch it. Others said it goes too far in it's depiction of Hitler's last days. Perhaps some people can not handle the sight of exploding heads and severed limbs, but to say this film goes too far is insane. How should this film depict it's subject? With sunshine and lollipops? World War II was brutal and, as such, so should any film depicting it be. Some people won't be able to handle it, but that's why we humans have discretion. We can decide what is okay for ourselves, and we can say no to whatever we think is bad for us. You don't have to watch this film.<br/><br/>""Downfall"" is a vivid, graphic, firsthand reminder of the depth of Hitler's evil. It's makers are simply spreading the message that trying to forget evil will not change it's affect on us. Why shouldn't we depict Hitler in art the way ""Downfall""'s makers have? It might be easier to live without thinking of him and seeing his human traits, but it wouldn't be any better to live that way.<br/><br/>This film should become required viewing for history classes."
"DragonflyDM","9","7","10","4 August 2005"," The Passion of the Anti-Christ
","I call this the ""Passion of the Anti-Christ"" because there are, although strained, similarities in how this movie effect me.<br/><br/>This movie is about a character from history that is larger than history. Hitler has become a symbol of evil, and certainly I am not the first person to place Adolf Hitler as the ultimate nemesis anti-Christ. But this is the surface of this movie.<br/><br/>Underneath, this movie is about the German people. The ability of one man to take advantage of the post-WWI trauma of a culture and manipulate it until the lines of compassion and inhumanity become blurred. Conformity and hypocrisy were not the only traits of the German people.<br/><br/>I have always been unable to create a scenario in which I could see how anyone could justify Hilter's world as a good thing. Even with the fear of the power of the Nazi party, the end of war should have given those with fear of the government should have been emboldened.<br/><br/>But this portrayal creates a very real world. There were those in Hitler's inner circle who were fanatical followers, but that was not true of everyone. What we do see is a culture who in its last days floundered to grasp onto any hope-- hope to keep out the Russians, hope to keep the national pride that Hitler brought them from the ashes of a great depression, and the hope that the continued blind faith they gave to the ""Fuhrer"" would take them through.<br/><br/>It was amazing that even in the last hours of Hitler's life the power he commanded. Even in his seemingly ""normal"" understated life those closest to him worshiped him.<br/><br/>In his ""work life,"" generals would bicker and plead with their leader on the last moments to end the insanity, but never once disobeyed an order, even when it was to submit themselves to be shot.<br/><br/>Just like ""the Passion,"" there is a message there that is important to us as humans. It is a warning about the tragedy of man and our ability to give our free will up in exchange for group think. It is also a message that evil is only the face of the movement, and that the people behind the mask are just like you and me.<br/><br/>The fact that anyone has the potential to be evil. Even worse, that we can all delude ourselves that the horror within can easily be confused for passion, loyalty, and good.<br/><br/>It is a hard movie to watch, because it is so well done that it is easy to look past the iconic mustache, swastikas and clicking heels and look at a people much like ourselves and think ""There but by the grace of God go I."""
"maxhert","10","7","10","3 June 2005"," The madness, the propaganda, the glamour
","I just saw this film yesterday, after listening to violent reactions on the radio. Here in Argentina there's a big Jewish community and it had a big impact. One of the presenters of a radio program was very offended by the fact that there were a lot of deaths depicted in the film but the actual moment when Hitler shoots himself wasn't. The man wanted to see it, needed it for his own satisfaction! That's disturbing, knowing there's so much hate going around, and in persons too young to ever have had direct contact with the facts in question. That implies that someone older took a lot of work in implanting that hate. That's frightening. On the film, I think the great thing about this film is you can see a person or persons who have undergone a process of dehumanization and indoctrination that at the time point of the movie is completely irreversible, and they acknowledge they have no future in a project different than theirs. Hitler makes clear at several points that he chose to construct himself as such a person, and in the end he is nearly delusional, unable to separate the fatherland from his own personna, but remaining a human being when he's not concerned with matters of state. That makes his craziness much more believable, almost schizophrenic. On the whole, you see masses brainwashed by propaganda, some of them wanting blindly to be brainwashed, some accepting it warmly because of a sense of security. That is the story of Junge, as most of the others. I think that's the fatherland concept, you know you can relax and enjoy your country because there's a hard guy in the government that cares for you, and if you support him without asking too much, things will be great for you and the likes of you. I think it's good to see that in a global context. The moral for me is that when in a tragic national situation people look for comfort, they'd rather accept propaganda that makes them feel secure and positive rather than question from their own points of view. So blocks of power are formed on stereotypes and propaganda, and measures taken in the end that no ordinary person would avail in a day to day basis, but the death of individual unbiased thinking ends up like that."
"terrors89","10","8","12","11 May 2005"," One of the best performances ever!
","I absolutely love this movie. The audience is thrown into the final days of the war in Europe and is forced to accept a person who history has declared a monster and must realize that he was a human with all of those emotions. The writing, directing, and the acting especially by Bruno Ganz were incredible. Adolf Hitler was a human who not only made the appalling decisions that wiped out millions of people, but he also was a man who cared enough about his secretary to make sure she was out of Berlin to avoid Communist rule with the Soviets. In my opinion, ""Downfall"" is a must see movie for everyone and one of the best movies of all time as well as probably the best acting performance of all time. <br/><br/>The story is about the final days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker as the Soviet Army is encircling what is left of the city of Berlin. It is shown through the eyes of one of Hitler's personal secretaries, Traudl Junge, played by Alexandra Maria Lara (TV-Doctor Zhivago,) who is completely loyal to Hitler. Junge is staying loyal even though Hitler's closet allies are abandoning him. Hitler, played masterfully by Bruno Ganz (The Manchurian Candidate,) is almost bi-polar in the final days. One moment, he is the historical monster the audience as grown to know as we watch he tell his generals that there are large German armies outside of Berlin who are going to rescue him, then screaming at them when they don't. Then you see a Hitler that is concerned about his friends and the people who have worked for him, telling people to leave Berlin because the war is lost. I am not aware of another movie that has shown that kind of a Hitler. After Hitler commits suicide, the rest of the story focuses on Joseph Goebbels short command of Germany, the murder or his own children, his death, and Junge's escape out of Berlin. Quite possibly the greatest performance by an actor, Bruno Ganz delivers us an Adolf Hitler that society is not ready to embrace. Ganz acting decisions to show us a human Hitler with emotions of kindness, compassion, and love, is completely different than the Hitler history has showed us. There are two scenes that show the greatness of his performance. The first scene is when Hitler is being told by the his architect, Albert Speer, that he had not obeyed Hitler's orders for quite sometime even though his personal loyalty never wavered. Hitler was furious but all he did was break his pencil, refused to shake his hand, and shed a tear. To show a monster with emotions is a powerful statement, especially the emotion of sadness, not just betrayal. Another scene that was powerful to me was when Junge walked into Hitler's room and he was sitting there with very little light looking at a painting of Otto Von Bismarck. The scene was almost spiritual in that he was sitting there and looking for answers in a calm and still fashion. It is Impossible to imagine the Hitler in history books that was this peaceful, but that is exactly how he was portrayed, at peace. Ganz makes many risks on this character and succeeds on ever one. Not since George C. Scott's portrayal of Patton have I seen an actor become the character he was portraying, Bruno Ganz was Adolf Hitler. <br/><br/>Director Oliver Hirschbiegel did not make a wrong choice. While inside the bunker, you felt Closter phobic and never safe from the artillery shells bouncing of the ground, outside you weren't safe and you knew that the longer you stayed outside, the sooner you would become causality. His action scenes were intense, say a step below Saving Private Ryan. Two great scenes that he shot involved the young children defending the city. At the beginning of the film the children were receiving medals from Hitler for their bravery. When the kids were manning an AA gun, a parent came up and told them to leave because they would die, and they would have none of it. They were prepared to die for Hitler. Towards the end of the movie when the defenses were failing one of he children, a young girl, asked another older kid to kill her, and he did. He then turned the gun on himself. This scene was done without words and was again very intense and outstanding. I could go on and on and get into some of the political philosophies of this movie and what they mean but I wont. This is an amazing movie and IF you can handle the fact that by the end of the movie, you may question your beliefs of what Hitler was, a man not a monster, then you should watch this movie, if you can't then stay away. Because this movie gives a convincing argument that not all evil men are heartless monsters, but human beings with a belief that what they are doing is right. *This review and others can be seen at www.bbmc.dockratent.com*"

","I saw the movie last week in an overcrowded cinema and was surprised about the outstanding actors (Bruno Ganz and Corinna Harfouch) , the perfect screenplay (Bernd Eichinger) and the work of director Oliver Hirschbiegel.<br/><br/>What happened on the screen gave the closest insight into the darkest part of German history and the darkest corners of human nature.<br/><br/>The movie shows the human being Hitler as that monster and mad man he was. And no one else as he himself destroys and demystifies his 'legend'. Based strictly on historical facts and dialogs the movie shows, why The Downfall (Der Untergang) had to happen.<br/><br/>One of the most harrowing scene is, when Magda Goebels kills her six children cold blooded. The camera does not turn away and shows the details of cruelty to make clear, what this kind of blind fanaticism leads to. Many scenes are really hard to bear but they are necessary to tell the story.<br/><br/>There are many discussions around the world right now and many ask, if Hitler should be shown as a human being and if Germany should look back on its past that way. I am convinced, that after you have seen the movie, the answer will be yes. The characters on the screen are no role models for Nazis of today. No one of the perpetrators become victims. The screenplay describes but it never explains. What happens on the screen explains itself. <br/><br/>I am sure 'The Downfall' is of international interest and will be an international success. <br/><br/>A must to see.<br/><br/>Greetings from Dirk, Munich, Germany"
"jamesobrien","Null","9","14","11 May 2005"," This is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen.
","This is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen. Although ostensibly the film deals with the decline, fall and suicide of Adolf Hitler, it's about much more than that. Indeed, Hitler's suicide occurs at about two thirds to three quarters of the way through the film, with the remainder concerned with the downfall (and perhaps redemption) of other characters.<br/><br/>I thought Bruno Ganz, who played Hitler, was terrific. Aside from the occasional hand movement which I thought bordered on parody, I really got a sense of a complete individual from his characterization. Those moments of tenderness and personality that are often shown, particularly when Hitler was in Bavaria. Those moments of rage and hysteria, evident in the stadium-style documentary footage of Hitler's speech-making. But there are other elements too... the shaking of his hand, for example, which I thought was meant to suggest Hitler had Parkinson's Disease and the matter of fact way in which he described how to commit a ""successful suicide"". I thought Ganz portrayed both the sanity and insanity of Hitler effectively.<br/><br/>People are constantly dying in this film, at their own hands or at the hands of others. I know this sounds odd, but after a while the death, destruction and suicide become the norm. I'm not saying it becomes acceptable, but I think through repetition, one is really given a sense of what it must have been like to have been there at the end. In contrast to the well known footage of Hitler making speeches in stadiums, it's a shambles. The army can't fight anymore. A time when half the soldiers are either drunk, deserting Hitler, or committing suicide. A time when life, seemingly, had little value, where death didn't seem to matter.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most distressing of the deaths, however, are those of Goebbels' children, as we're shown their mother giving them their lethal dose of something or other. Cyanide? But it's not gratuitous, their portrayal has a purpose. It, perhaps, gives an insight into why people were there until the very end... why Hitler commanded whatever he did even after his death. What is it that would allow someone to kill their own children for an ideal? Or was it because there was, seemingly, no other option? The film doesn't answer these questions, it just poses them.<br/><br/>Some of the reviews have described the film as sympathetic towards Hitler. Yes, Hitler is described as a character with more than one dimension, but it could hardly be described as sympathetic as he declares that, despite everything, he was proud of the Jewish slaughter. He also declares the remainder of the German people were idiots and weak. And Goebbels, I think it was, declares the people deserving of everything they got when asked to consider the need to protect the civilians because ""they chose their destiny"".<br/><br/>As for other central characters? Eva Braun comes across as a total idiot, totally unfeeling, except for the farewell letter she writes to her sister... but even then it's full of trivialities. This is not really a film, though, about Hitler, or even the people like Goebbels, Himler and Braun, it's about the people on the fringes around him and I think many reviews have missed the point about who the central character of the film actually is.<br/><br/>As it turns out, the central character is actually a young secretary employed by Hitler two and a half years before the end of the war. A young woman who probably falls in love with Hitler and who is, seemingly, chosen because of her beauty and not her skills as a stenographer or typist. Much of the plot line is about how she deals with the realization of what is occurring around her.<br/><br/>Another central character is a young Aryan-boy... blonde, blue eyes... who fights the war on Hitler's behalf as a member of Hitler Youth... but who also, somehow, survives which in some ways was a little distressing. Six million Jews died, but the young Aryan boy survives. A point to ponder.<br/><br/>For me, however, the most distressing part of the movie was the end which features the stock-standard ""what happened to"" feature of so many historical dramas. It amazed me that so many people had lived so long with the memories of the war and of the events portrayed in the film. And then, just when you think, that's about it, one of the central characters, the young secretary, is shown in documentary footage in her 70s or 80s, reflecting on her life. She tells the story of how, throughout the Nuremberg Trials, she was surprised at the extent of the Jewish extermination. And then, in a truly remarkable moment, she mentions how, in a moment of self-revelation, she recognized she could have known more, she, perhaps could have done something.<br/><br/>As such, this is a really important movie for just about everyone to see."

","Not since the 1981 release of ""Das Boot"" has a German film had such an impact on audiences witnessing, from a German point of view, the perception, judgement,interpretation and opinion on its own history. ""Downfall"" tells the true story of the last days of the third Reich (April 1945), from within Hitlers secret underground bunker situated in the heart of Berlin. <br/><br/>3/4 of the film is set inside the scope of the claustrophobic and confined concrete bunker world of Adolf Hitler during his last weeks alive. The film also show a glimpse of central Berlin in its besieged and confused state during the Soviet onslaught. Inside the bunker we see Hitler's decay, he goes from calmness to rage, from understanding to paranoia, from irrational to total deluded. He gives his generals and field commandos ( there was no grand admirals present in the bunker at this time of the war) orders that are not compatible with reality or fact. He tries to control armies that do not exist anymore or order companies to counter-attack that only featuring on a map. A large majority of his high ranking commanding officers sense, and have done for 8-months, the war is lost on the side of Germany. However, some still believe in final victory in idealistic faculties. This is played out on screen with nervous tension. In addition, the few scenes set outside the bunker bring across a population confused, scarred, exhausted. Some however are continuing to display courage in valiantly defending the city and show continuously hopeless resistance in the face of the advancing red army (1st Belarussian army)bought on by years of Nazi propaganda.<br/><br/>The film magnificently achieves to bring to screen the combination of Traudi Junges ( Hitlers private secretary) memoirs, Nazi officials memoirs, German war archives and the documentary ""blind spot"" to a conclusion on screen.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz brings the fuhrer to life in his exceptionally good performance. Alexandria Maria Lara plays the role of Traudi Junge has a young confused,aroused and obsolete to the truth citizen of the third Reich. All the members of the cast gives excellently rehearsed and researched performances to life. Ulrich Noether was a perfect likeness to Himmler.<br/><br/>""Downfall"" is a remarkable history lesson on the second world war in Europe. It holds the attention of the audience through out. The film never side tracking away for long enough, in which it sets the sense of calmness, peace and normality, to lose sight of the unbearable reality of the situation."

","If anything was horrifying, it must have been the years in which Hitler reigned over Germany, especially during World War II. Nothing has been more commented on, almost everybody knows what happened during his reign. So when people decided that movies ought to be made to show us the hows, whens and whats, these were made. Unfortunately, Nazi-Germans spoke English, as they were played by Americans and Englishmen. It was very easy to qualify the German people as 'evil'. Now, after 60 years, we see the story from the inside. Little by little we understand that the German people suffered as much as anybody suffered from the terror used by the Nazi-regime. Bruno Ganz may well have played the role of his life, I have never seen an actor playing Hitler so realistically, showing him being normal, frightening, aggressive and mad. This movie, showing the WWII from a non-allied point of view, is a must for all those who easily speak of Germans, when they mean Nazis."
"trbb","10","5","7","19 May 2006"," Far and away the best film of 2005
","I came across this film in the video store while searching for a movie I have already forgotten. It wedged in a tiny column in between entire walls of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""The Wedding Crashers."" It was only because of the Oscar buzz over the former and the sophomoric media hoopla over the latter that this film has received such little attention here in the US despite being vastly superior to either.<br/><br/>What impressed me the most about this film was Bruno Ganz's acting. His portrayal of Hitler was the capstone to a production effort that could have stood without him. As a historian I have seen the footage of Hitler giving speeches and read numerous accounts of his madman personality (both on stage and in private) that held his audiences spellbound. Ganz could have been forgiven had he failed to capture this virtually impossible act, yet he does so flawlessly. Words can't really describe it; the viewer must witness it for himself. At the same time, however, Ganz manages to portray the human side of Hitler as well, the non-drinking, non-smoking vegetarian who was an absolute hit with children. It is a true testament to Ganz's performance that some historically-illiterate critics felt that he portrayed Hitler as being ""too human"" while others felt he went overboard in his portrayal of Hitler's lunacy.<br/><br/>Ganz is not the whole show, however. Much of the movie is focused on the plight of every Berliner, ranging from Eva Braun and Hitler's close subordinates to Hitler Youth mounting a last stand in the streets to the old men and women being chased through the streets as ""deserters"" by the SS. The acting is superb across the board and the production of Berlin burning is downright disturbing in its accuracy. Those with narrow attention spans will have difficulty with the length but the engaged viewer will find themselves enjoying every minute. This film is a true masterpiece and the best piece of German cinema since ""Das Boot""."
"RolyUK","10","5","7","25 April 2006"," Absolutely amazing
","Superlatives cannot do this film justice. Bruno Ganz in the role of his life as Hitler is extraordinary, but his performance is only so strong because of the outstanding supporting cast. An absolutely essential film for anyone with an interest in history and politics. It is not 'just another WW2 movie' because it takes you into the heart of fanaticism, the people who instigate and lead that fanaticism and the people that consent to be led by them even to the death of themselves and everything they love. Nothing could be more relevant today.<br/><br/>Even watching it on small screen you find yourself wincing at the suicides, the injuries and the explosions, and gasping at the coldness and horror taking place. The fact that it is based to the closest word and detail on two eyewitness accounts just knocks other supposedly 'realistic' pieces like Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, etc. into a cocked hat.<br/><br/>I have only two (slight) criticisms. Yet again in a film Hitler comes across as a gibbering madman - he was far more calculating, chilling and subtle than that, or he could not have seized power, fooled the 'Great Powers' into inaction, and then led a modern, industrialized country to its own utter destruction in the space of a few years. As the film develops though there are glimpses of the former Hitler, and the supporting cast are utterly convincing in their fanaticism - the actors playing Goebbels and his wife are particularly strong. As the film goes on we start to see this is the end of an incredibly powerful process. The supporting cast show just the right combination of fear, desperation and total, self-annihilating belief in Hitler and his leadership. Most of them are literally seeing for the first time the situation they have let themselves in for, and the true nature of their leader. Secondly, you couldn't want it to be any longer - an edited down version for those with only a couple of hours on hand would be good."
"dromasca","9","5","7","31 December 2005"," best docu-drama in years
","I got to see 'Der Untergang' only now, on DVD, but maybe this is the right format for it. The film is a docu-drama, with all the goo things and the limitations of the genre, and as a docu-drama is better to be seen on the small screen than in a theater.<br/><br/>And it is one of the best docu-dramas I saw in years, maybe the best. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel brings to screen the last days of the Nazi regime and of its leaders, crowded in a bunker with a seemingly infinite Web of corridors, terrorized by the louder and louder noises of the approaching Red Army attacks and living the last phantasms of the nightmare their sick minds created, the nightmare that swallowed the whole world.<br/><br/>A lot was written and said about Bruno Granz's rendition of Hitler. There is no Oscar for no-English speaking actors, and it's a good thing, because Granz deserves not a Oscar but a Nobel prize for acting, if such thing existed. Hitler's madness exceeded the limits of human understanding, it was madness at history level. Was Hitler a man, or the incarnation of Devil in man's skin? His success in turning his nation into a Evil Empire and half of the world in hell was the result of a mix of historic context, but also the result of a magnetic personality, that Granz analyzes and recomposes with art. Granz's Hitler is a master in human manipulation, the majority of his foes stay devoted to him until the last moment. Granz's Hitler is charismatic, physically sick and mentally mad, he lives in a world that mixes messianic faith with murderous hate for his enemies and especially against the Jews, a world fill of phantasms and military fantasies. He is completely isolated from reality, as all dictators, because dictators inspire fear, fear inspires lies, and you cannot build strategies on lies.<br/><br/>Almost all acting is superb. The Nazi leaders, one more sinister than the other are brought to life with art. Julianne Kohler's Eva Braune is a frivole, living the day in the shade of the Great Leader. The Goebbels pair played by Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch are sick and fanatic, they commit the absolute family crime by killing their children before taking their own lives, and killing with them the myths of the German Nazi family. There is some controversy abut the image of Albert Speer, the Nazi minister of economy and the architect of what would have been the capital of the 1000 years Reich, the film presents him in a more human light, but life and history was also more understanding with him, making him the only Nazi leader who ended his life in his own bed.<br/><br/>A few words about the character of Traudl Junge, Hitler's young secretary acted by Alexandra Maria Lara. The movie presents her as completely fallen under Hitler and Eva Braun magnetic powers, she is genuinely devastated not by the end of the war but by the personal loss and death of his masters. Only when she gets out of the bunker and sees the smoking ruins of what became of Germany she starts to understand the dimension of the tragedy brought by her superiors to her country and to the whole world. However, the total understanding may have come later, and we understand it when the real Traudl Junge, at his old age tells us, looking into the eyes of the camera 'I should have known!'.<br/><br/>Docu-drama has limits, the purpose and quality lies more in the accurate rendition of the history than in looking for the deeper truth. Still, for whoever sees this film, the last days of Hitler will remain as they are described here. There is no one movie that can encompass all the lessons of history, but this movie made from the German perspective provides a veridical and true version of the human dimension of the absolute horror."

There are fewer and fewer film out there that challenge you, but this is one of them. And boy, does it challenge you. The Nazis were the most heinous people on Earth, but a lot of them were not bad.

By that I mean that the films portray a story that should leave all who watch them with a deeper understanding of the suffering involved, the lives that are destroyed and the pointless waste. There have been several excellent films of this genre. Saving Private Ryan, Schindlers List, Gallipoli, Lion of the Desert are just a few. This film, this masterpiece, sits atop that list. I have never seen a more gripping saga in my life, absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>Every performance from every actor, from the incredible Bruno Ganz, down to the young children playing the Goebbels children, was immaculate.<br/><br/>Even now, several weeks after I first saw it, I have vivid memories of scenes from the film, not just the graphic harrowing scenes which I think will always remain with me, but the conversations, the one between Hitler and Speer springs to mind. Added to these are the scenes of Hitler's rages and the brilliantly intimate camera work which gives the viewer a 'close up', 1st person view of the film.<br/><br/>There are far too many excellent reasons why someone should watch this film to be listed here.<br/><br/>Basically, it will keep you enthralled for the two and a half hours (it flies by), and it will leave you emotionally drained at the end.<br/><br/>Trust me....this is no 'war' film!"

","A film that takes you into the heart of darkness that was Adolf Hitler. An absorbing central performance by Bruno Ganz that allowed me to imagine what it must have been like in that bunker as the second world war drew to a close. I found the film completely believable and one of those rare things in cinema, a film that stays with you and which returns to you weeks, even months after you see it. A disturbing and unsettling film in that the intimate portrayal of Hitler as a fallible human being invites us to empathise with him, despite all that we know about his political fanaticism and monstrous actions. In this regard, this is an important film from Germany about German history. It is courageous and bravura film making and an important contribution to understanding how fascism came to power in Germany and why, of course, it must never be allowed to do so anywhere else again."
"kergillian","9","9","15","28 March 2005"," Possibly the most important film of the year...
","Hirschbiegel wanted to make sure that this film was directed by a German, and done right, so that the story was put forth cautiously and in the proper hands. It was heavily researched, and is based primarily on interviews with the sort of 'narration' character, a secretary to Hitler named Traudl Junge, who was 22 at the time, and was excused after the war, considered one of the 'young and innocent' - the youth who were caught up in the Nazi Machine without being considered 'at fault'. Excerpts of her interview make the perfect bookend to this film, as we enter and exit from the story with some powerful thoughts to process. It's also based somewhat on interviews with Albert Speer at Spandau, and shortly after he was released, and on a book by one of the world's foremost historians/researchers on the subject. It's aura is exhaustingly real, unbelievably intense. Even now, three days later, I'm still somewhat numb. This is definitely not Hollywood melodrama...<br/><br/>This film is extremely important, because it forces us to realize that Hitler - along with everyone else surrounding him - was one of our species. It does not pull punches, and certainly doesn't make him sympathetic, doesn't 'humanize' him, and highlights his delusions to make sure there's no mistake about his mindset. But it's a film that forces us to realize that it was a human being who did this - who committed some of the worst crimes humanity has ever witnessed, and that is an eye-opener that some people, I think, need to have. Because if we simply dismiss Hitler as an inhuman monster rather and a human one, then we are trivializing the deaths of tens of millions of people, each of whom died in order for us to learn what human beings are truly capable of. 9/10."

","Much will be written about the performances and historians will no doubt quibble about minor details. They have nothing better to do. But you should see this movie. Everyone should see this movie.<br/><br/>The debate over whether or not it paints Adolf Hitler in too human a light is specious. The problem with high ranking members of the Third Reich, Hitler included, is not that they were inhuman. The problem is that they were quite human, and thus they show us what all human beings, ourselves included, are capable of being when devotion to a twisted ideology is carried to the right-wing extremes of fascism. To dismiss these people as easily recognizable monsters is to absolve ourselves from the duty of watching out for them in our midst. <br/><br/>The movie reminds us that Hitler didn't come to power as a result of some coup d'etat, nor did he fall from the sky. His party was elected and legally enacted the laws that led to their rise to power. Little by little the German people sacrificed their freedoms in the name of their ""national security"" and grandiose visions of their imagined global destiny, until the state had so much power, no one could speak up against it for fear of marginalization, imprisonment and, ultimately death. Do you see where I'm going? And silence in the face of growing horrors during time of war was considered patriotic, - then just as it is now. <br/><br/>Everything about the movie is first rate, the performances and direction are nothing short of stellar, and one can't help but feel better for having seen it. Pay particularly attention to the epilogues, which include a caveat from Traudl Junge herself, taped shortly before her death last decade. She reminds us that our naivete is no excuse. <br/><br/>The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. See this fine movie and never forget.<br/><br/>8"
"secondtake","10","6","9","28 February 2010"," Persuasive, visceral, shocking, and enlightening. And brilliantly made.
","The Downfall (2004)<br/><br/>There is no way to find any movie-making fault here. The filming, the acting, the sets (if you can call such amazing scenes merely ""sets""), and editing, and drama, the effects, etc etc are all as good as it gets. There no reason to even list all the great actors, from Bruno Ganz playing Hitler on down. It's so disturbing, convincing, and perfect (as much as movies can be) it'll shake you up, deeply, and properly.<br/><br/>Historically I can only assume it is accurate. It fits all the bits and pieces I've read about the last days of the Third Reich well, and it is a fully German effort, which gives it some kind of credence. Note, for a moment, that there are a lot of these redemptive, unapologetic, probing films by contemporary Germans, such as Sophie Scholl, and there are not similar movies made by the Japanese for their role in World War II. The implications of that I'm not sure, but it's worth pointing out at least to give huge thanks to the Germans involved for wanting to be honest, openly.<br/><br/>There will be a million ways of treating Hitler the person, including not treating him as a person at all. I think director Oliver Hirschbiegel (and his producers) make an astonishingly good effort to get it ""accurate."" It's not a documentary, and there are short scenes clearly meant to be moving beyond just information (like when Dr. Speer finds the patients in the basement of the hospital, or when the woman and the boy ride their bicycle down a woodsy road through golden sunlight). But why not? I don't think beauty is at fault here. The main narrative personality through the movie (the secretary) has at her core a sense of noticing what is true, and wanting what is right, and in the end she finds beauty by simply surviving.<br/><br/>But there is a way to analyze what happens here, but not quickly. There are moments that are gory, but there is no dwelling on violence (many suicides take place and we don't usually witness them directly). That alone makes the movie quite the opposite of Tarantino's version of Hitler's demise, for example, or even how Spielberg might show the blood, judging from Private Ryan. The Downfall makes the facts of Hitler's madness no caricature, but a real, frightening insanity, subtle enough to inspire followers. The willingness and the sometimes stupid sheeplike attitudes of the many officers around him is a huge part of the message here, assuming we can call the basic intention of the movie a drive for reassessing the facts of the times, and the implications about how power can be so wrong, and so persuasive.<br/><br/>Bottom line? An amazing movie."
"OttoVonB","10","6","9","20 February 2007"," The Definitive Word on the Subject
","In Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall"", we follow young secretary Traudi Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) into Hitler's bunker and witness the final days of the Third Reich through her increasingly disillusioned eyes.<br/><br/>Finally, Germany gives us a film on the matter, and, rather unsurprisingly, it feels far more authentic that any other take on the subject. Hirschbiegel's film is taut and claustrophobic and his characters breathe and feel real. His depiction of the war above ground is harrowing and efficient... Yet, as with all such films, ""Der Untergang"" will live or die by its central character: Hitler.<br/><br/>Hitler is such a monumental figure that, if you translate him, you are unable to see anything else than the actor portraying him, however talented (Anthony Hopkins and Alec Guiness gave it a go and didn't transcend). For the most part, we have had to accept mediocre caricatures suggesting that Hitler was as seen in his speeches (overly manic/dramatic) 24/7 (most films about Hitler fall prey to this, and ""Hitler, the rise of Evil""'s Robert Carlyle is just another example of getting it completely wrong!). Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler crashes through these misconceptions and the heavy baggage and makes us distinguish the man from the phenomenon. To our horror, we discover that the man who sparked this wretched out-of-control ideology is also a sometimes touching and amiable father-figure, making us understand how so many people would follow him. Ganz manages to become the man, utterly believable throughout, whether showing kindness to someone, yelling at his cowardly generals, or putting his pet out of its misery (a heart-breaking scene).<br/><br/>The film, technically admirable and boasting powerhouse performances, truly marks itself as a triumph in terms of tone and message. ""Der Untergang"" shows quite rightly that it is not the misguided and ultimately tragic man, but the system and its followers, that are monstrous. Ganz's Hitler seethes with anger at what he perceives as a betrayal: the German people have failed him, putting an end to the lie that Hitler was a cunning and deceitful sorcerer who brain-washed Germany. The people deceived themselves, and in the final moments, Magda Goebbles and other underlings prove themselves to be more repugnant and evil than Hitler himself ever could be. Thus, the film attracted naive controversy because many refuse to see Hitler as a human being. They do not realize that doing so dilutes the most important message of Nazi Germany: the people, not just Hitler, made it what it was! This could all too easily happen again...<br/><br/>You owe it to yourself to see this incredible film!"
"ewarn-1","9","6","9","20 January 2007"," Truth Stranger Than Drama
","I think that in a thousand years of Western History, there has not been a more dramatic saga than that of the rise and fall of the Third Reich. No screenwriter could come up with a harder hitting tale than the rise of a man like Hitler and his eventual demise. It seems too incredible in an era of constant entertainment that this actually took place, but what makes it even more amazing is the way the whole story ended.<br/><br/>The whole history really took place in an astonishingly short time period: Hitler rises up out of epic conflict, spreads his evil message to his villainous followers, people join in his evil plots for their own self interests and lust for power, they spread misery and destruction over the world with their fantastic destructive weapons, and finally they are vanquished and driven by their enemies underground where they die at their own hands, while their country is destroyed around them...No wonder fiction writers have been working on this same basic premise for more than sixty years.<br/><br/>This story is not fictitious. This is one of those rare movies where the real events could only have differed only slightly from what is depicted on screen. This is an amazing decision on the filmmaker's part, to unfold the events in a semi-documentary fashion, to avoid dramatic overacting, which is too easy to do in depicting these types of people, and provide an unbiased look at the events of the end of the war.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of movies made about Hitler's last days, but I think the reason this one stands out is that it unfolds at such a calm and steady pace. Certainly here is the best depiction of Hitler on-screen. Too human? Maybe, but that makes him all the more disturbing. Viewers might question how far each evil Nazi officer is removed from each one of us, and whether we might have the guts to take a higher path when it comes down to it.<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen a few more battle scenes featuring individual combat, but the movie squeezes a lot of info and characters into its running time, and not a shot is wasted. Among war movies it's most similar to ""The Longest Day"", and like that film it works because it stays away from nationalist sentimentality. Very disturbing, but entertaining and fascinating all at the same time."

","This was obviously a difficult subject to tackle, but somehow they were able to give the overall essence of what Hitlers bunker and the surrounding rubble of Berlin was like in 1945. War pictures are not meant to be historical documents, as many would believe. The movie industry will never make historically accurate films. Historically based films should do their best to interpret text, photographs, footage; and then only attempt to paint a coherent picture of what happened. Details are important(i.e. whether a Waffen SS soldier was wearing the correct uniform) but what is more important is that the tone and overall feel of the film captures the moment. <br/><br/>Take a look at the jingoistic approach to American WW2 film making. The German soldier is essentially Satan. Which is not true. Each German soldier had motivations; Whether it was love of country, loyalty to the Nazi regime, or a family to protect or the taste of power. That is what we get from this film. Normal people trapped in their own machinations. The movie DAS BOOT for instance does the same thing. It doesn't attempt to bulk the German people into one category. Instead it attempt to show each individually. Downfall is another great German films that only a German could do properly."

I recommend reading Cornelius Ryan's ""The Last Battle"" before you see this movie. If you like that book you'll like the movie plus you'll be historically prepared for the events depicted in the movie. The performances are dead on, especially the minor characters of the fanatic Nazis. If you spend much time looking at blogs and message boards in today's political climate, it's easy to believe people can be this crazy. Magda Goebbels made me think of Ann Coulter. The vignettes of Nazi Germany's death throes interspersed with the battle in Berlin's ruins are one of the truest pictures of the horror (and heroism) of war since ""Saving Private Ryan."" Some viewers may find some scenes too horrifying, as Frau Goebbels did murder her own children, and there are numerous executions and murder-suicides shown as well. This movie is good history, centered mostly around the experience of a nice-looking, but not very sharp girl who was Hitler's secretary for the latter half of the war. She wasn't corrupted by the experience, which is one of the most interesting aspects. I wonder what the affect of a wide US release of this movie would have been last year."
"rosscinema","9","6","10","27 March 2005"," Powerful film about the last days of the Third Reich
","We have seen numerous portrayals of Adolph Hitler in films before but we've never seen one like this that uses facts to give viewers an incredibly honest portrayal. In my voting I gave this film an 8 but I'm ready to give it an even higher number because it's one of those amazing films that will stay with viewers for years to come and I think has the greatness in it to be thought of as a classic and should be studied by students of film. Story is about the last few days of the Third Reich where we see Berlin crumbling from the Russian forces and Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and those around him having to go underground in a bunker. Hitler is approaching his 56th birthday and we see him displaying emotional outbursts when his orders are not carried through and we also see the deterioration of his health as one of his arms trembles from a previous assassination attempt and the ravages of Parkinsons disease.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT***** Most of the films story is told through the eyes of Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) who is loyal to her employer but has started to wake up and see first hand what is really happening to Germany and how others are reacting. Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) not only stays with Hitler but attempts to cheer everyone up with parties and lots of drinking and eventually she and Hitler marry in a small ceremony less than two days before they both commit suicide. Joseph Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) moves his wife Magda (Corinna Harfouch) and their children into the bunker also and when it appears that Germany has lost the war they decide to commit suicide rather than live without National Socialism. In a harrowing scene Magda slips cyanide capsules into the mouths of her children as they sleep and then she and her husband prepare to kill themselves as well.<br/><br/>This is directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel who's source of material is inspired by the memoirs of the real Traudl Junge and the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest and while it's historically accurate it does an even better job of showing the blind loyalty of Hitler's followers. We have seen countless films where Nazis are portrayed in the usual over the top manner but this is the first time (that I have seen, anyway) where their point of view is shown in such an ambiguous light. Not only is their perspective shown but also the point of view from the secretaries who at first thought of Hitler as a father figure and than the realization (and incredible disappointment) of who he really is. While the production design and historical accuracy put this in a class by itself this film is still enhanced by an utterly magnificent and haunting performance from Ganz. His portrayal of Hitler is nothing like the caricatures we have seen before and Ganz actually studied rare tapes of Hitler engaging in normal conversations to get the proper tone of his voice which is vastly different than the one that shouts at crowds. There are those who criticize this film because it shows Hitler in a more human light but let's face it, the guy was human and did things that others do as well. He wasn't screaming and frothing at the mouth every second and did partake in everyday events like walking his dog and having tea with his mistress which isn't going to make anyone forget how evil and psychotic he was. Ganz's performance is so eerily accurate that he shows the trembling in one arm from the Parkinson's that he dealt with in the last 12 years of his life. This is one of those rare films that is achieved through historical fact and brought to life with some truly haunting performances and it's a film that makes a solid claim to greatness."

","I must confess that this movie is quiet an experience. But I'm not sure that we can describe it as a war movie. If we compare it with Saving Private Ryan, we get the difference pretty fast. This film try to be objective and want to get a clean radiography of the German way of thinking. I get really impressed with the German patriotism and I stop for a moment and think about something Steven Spielberg's film didn't show. How must had been for the German people to lost that war, for much people the conflict was everything. That is why I think this film is much better than Saving Private Ryan. Oliver Hirschbiegel is not a conformist and doesn't agree with Spielberg simplicity. Good soldiers, bad soldiers and an evil empire.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","5","8","18 March 2005"," Inferno
","The deepest impression I had emerging from the cinema after two-and-a-half hours was the vision of an inferno that uncannily reminded me of scenes I saw a month earlier in the same cinema, in Constantine.<br/><br/>The next thing that hit my mind was that Downfall is not about Hitler, at least not largely about him. The screen time allocated to this character is not as much as you would expect, and after his death, the movie goes on for another half-hour. It is more about the downfall of Berlin, mainly reflected in events surrounding Hitler and company, about the city's degeneration into the inferno we see.<br/><br/>Even for those of us fortunate enough to have been spared WW II, the mere mention of the word ""Hitler"" conjures up images of monstrosities that make the blood boil. It's therefore difficult to view Downfall with a detached and objective frame of mind. But then, this movie does not really show us Hitler as such, but only shows him during the last two weeks of his life. The point I'm trying to make is that this movie does not achieve the effect of showing Hitler in a favorable light, even if there's such an intention, which I doubt. If I can express this graphically, what we see is just one tiny little segment of a circle called ""Hitler"". <br/><br/>But even within this very tiny segment we see of Hitler, there are things that firmly point to the Hitler we understand him to be. For example, when told that what he is ordering is to send boys out as young soldiers to die, his reply is ""Isn't that what's they're for?"" And here, he's not talking about Jews, but about people who are going to be the future of Germany. I rest my case.<br/><br/>So we see Hitler the mad man maybe a little madder than usual in his last two weeks. We also see different people around him reacting differently. Most chilling are those who look absolutely in control, but whose minds have in reality been totally warped by him. Topping this list are the Goebbels, particularly Madga. Others fall in different positions in a wide spectrum. Outside the underground Bunker where these people are hiding, there is an even greater variety of people reacting differently to the bombardment of Berlin, the devastating destruction of life and city and the menacing approach of the enemy (i.e. the Red Army). All these unfold in front of our eyes in an epic of inferno proportion.<br/><br/>We are not spared the graphic atrocity of limbs saw away live by army surgeons, half a head appearing right beside someone coming around after a shell explosion, just two among many scenes that speak even louder than those in Saving Private Ryan. By comparison, blowing a brain out, a common occurrence in Downfall, is banal. Adding to the total experience, with the incredible sound system in the cinema I went to, my chair shook every time there was an artillery shell explosion on the screen.<br/><br/>Painstaking attention has been paid to the camera work in this movie. This is quite important in a dramatized documentary of this sort, when there is really no story line for the audience to hook on to. Instead, what I found most stimulating was that almost every frame displays a different construction: varying angles, positioning of objects and characters, panning, still shots, various points of view  endlessly changing so that you're always looking forward to the visual stimulation of the next frame, even when the story may not always sustain the same level of interest.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, we are told what happened to each of the more important characters, from receiving judgement at Nuremberg to vanishing completely and never to be found. This rounds up the movie with a good historical perspective, allowing the audience to leave the cinema a little less stunned and dazed from the harrowing experience they've just had.<br/><br/>So is it good? Yes, and ground breaking in some ways. Is it good enough to win the Oscar? No, particularly when there's a movie called Mar adentro in the running."
"rolivire","9","5","8","10 November 2004"," See and feel this destruction and tragedy
","Der Untergang is a realistic story of the last days of Hitler as seen through the (beautiful) eyes of his favourite secretary Fräulein Traudl Junge. The film shows us the slaughter and murders above the ground, the terrible blasts of the Soviet artillery fire on the governmental district of the capital Berlin. Under the ground life is peaceful and almost normal. The strength of the movie is that it shows us very acceptable, human and normal people around the broken Hitler. The most macabre scenes involve Magda Goebels murdering her beautiful children after she gives them a drink to sleep. The persons act very convincing, speak German as they did and also had the faces of Germans so typical for that period in history.<br/><br/>The only thing I missed was some more realistic pictures of Berlin as it was in those last days. Only (a model of) the heavily damaged chancellary and the Voss-strasse is shown and one big office building was used which is acceptable as a building which could have been located in Berlin, but other buildings or streets were NOT typical for builtup and ravaged Berlin. The Tiger I tank was a model used in Private Ryan. In reality there were a couple of the big Königstigers around. The same is true for the Flak gun which was a Soviet 85mm gun, where in reality there were German 88mm Flak guns. At the end the movie follows Traudl Junge and her flight out of Berlin. In the last scene she is a very old (but still beautiful) lady and tells us about her experience more than 55 years ago and how she felt pleased to join Hitler as his secretary and knew nothing of the crimes Hitler committed to the Jews. She was totally innocent and a victim of history. Most people around Hilter have died now, recently also: Traudl Junge and Hitlers personal adjutant: Otto Günsche and strong character Wilhelm Mohnke, which was also present in the battles in Normandy, in the Ardennes and Hungary as a divisional commander of the 1st SS Panzer division. The only one still living today is the man which also left the bunker as the last person to see it: Rochus Misch. The technical operator of the generators of the bunker.<br/><br/>Compared to ""The Bunker"" of 1981 this movie is less romantic, less clean and more realistic."

They commit suicide, fight and die or try to escape.<br/><br/>The film was narrated out of the sight of the young girl, which was Hitlers secretary, Traudl Junge. As far as I know, the movie make only a few little historic mistakes (not important), the film is mainly based of the memories of Junge. She survived and died two years ago in 2002.<br/><br/>Swiss actor Bruno Ganz plays Hitler in a realistic way which nobody else has played before. The film shows the madness of Hitler and his inner circle in the last days of WWII. For example directly before he kills himself Hitler married his girlfriend Eva Braun. And the registrar asked really, if Hitler has his identity card and if he is really no Jew, because it is official regulation. Goebbels have to remember the officer that he is talking to Hitler...!<br/><br/>""Untergang"" concentrates on a few persons: Hitler, Junge, Magda Goebbels, who killed her own children with poison and some other. So some important Nazis are not detailed enough, perhaps that the weakness of the film. But the main persons are played so intensive, its more than enough for a legendary movie.<br/><br/>Besides the film has one of the best sounds I have ever heard. It makes war as real as movies can. Perhaps only the first minutes of ""Private Ryan"" can compare with it.

"ironhorse_iv","9","4","6","1 April 2016"," This movie has great insight on the final few days of Adolf Hitler's reign over Nazi Germany in 1945. It's a watch must for anybody, curious about WWII.
","Downfall is an early 2000's foreign language movie with English subtitles, probably best known for most people, as the movie where the Angry Hitler internet parody meme came from, where Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) rants about modern, often trivial topics. For me, I saw the movie, as more than that; it's a haunting masterpiece of a historical World War 2 reenactment of a very important date in world history. Based upon the books: 'Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich', by historian Joachim Fest; 'Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary', the memoirs of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge; 'Inside the Third Reich', the memoirs of Albert Speer, one of the highest-ranking Nazi officials to survive both the war and the Nuremberg trials; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye–Witness Account by Gerhard Boldt; Das Notlazarett unter der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin by Doctor Ernst-Günther Schenck; and Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949 (1992), Siegfried Knappe's memoir. The mixer of all these source materials, was good enough to nominate for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 2004. While, the film directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel takes some liberties on the source materials, by changing Traudl Junge's (Alexandra Maria Lara) escape, Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) meeting with Goebbels family, and how Heinrich Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) met his end. Despite these dramatic licenses, the film generally shows an accurate view of events. Much of the framing is taken from contemporary photographs and newsreels—one of the movie posters is basically a staged version of the very last picture ever taken of Adolf Hitler. It show, how well-shot, this film is. I just wish, director Oliver Hirschbeigel had more passion for this film. I get that, he wanted to direct 2004's 'Blade: Trinity', instead. However, I don't think, that film would had works well, with his style. Plus, his contract stated that he couldn't leave the project and had to direct 'Downfall'. Despite that, the accuracy and details that Olivier Hirschbiegel put in the film really helped viewers get into Hitler's frame of mind and what it must have been like living with him for his last few days. This also helps by one of the best acting, I ever saw in a World War 2 film. Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler, was amazing. It's really shows that he takes his role, very serious by preparing four months of research on Hitler such as showing the effects of the Parkinson's disease and listening to Hitler's secret recording in Finland. It's superb how well, he imitate Hitler's mannerisms and speech patterns. It's no wonder, why his performance was almost universally critically acclaimed by everybody. He was at his best, during the scene where he talks about his dream for Germania (The Nazi New Capital). This scene in the film helps the viewer get a sense of how Hitler lost touch with reality towards the end of the war. Glad, they didn't make Hitler or his followers into a sympathetic figure, at all! The film also powerful in the way, they show the blind devotion of the Nazis, even during Hitler's insanity, by capturing, their violence acts, through many disturbing suicides, commitments, and fighting scenes even knowing they had lost the war. These events become very somber, when children are involve in the fight. It's really shocking to hear, how many of these mad men deprive their little kids of their lives. Because of that, this movie is hard to watch for some people. Another thing, I felt was a little jarring is the overtype supporting cast, actors such as Thomas Kretschmann and Ulrich Noethern. Not only does they play Hermann Fegelein & Heinrich Himmler in this film, but they are no strangers in playing roles concerning Nazis. Most of their filmography are roles like this. While, it's no fault of the film, it just something that hard, not to notice. Another is the interview samples of real Traudl Junge toward the end. I don't like it was taken from the 2001's documentary ""Blind Spot"". It felt out of place, from the majority of reenactment scenes, however it was short enough to care, too much about it. So you can call that, a nitpick from me. Overall: This provocative look at Hitler's last days barely has any faults, besides being grim and somber. While, this film isn't for everybody, due to the graphic violence and language, it's best viewed by very mature people who've had studied World War 2, and are prepared to ponder complex questions about what makes, the darkest, most brutal men in human history into the monsters, that they would soon would become. It's a character study movie, for anybody curious about how the Holocaust, and the War in Europe was able to end."

","There have been hundreds of actors over the years who have portrayed Adolf Hitler but I'm pretty sure there has been no better depiction of the Nazi leader than the one done by Bruno Ganz. This is a brilliant film about the final hours of Hitler, his foot soldiers and the people who worked and lived around him in his bunker.<br/><br/>Unlike most war films this is a German made movie with German actors and this gives this so much more authenticity. Not surprisingly this was nominated for an Oscar and i have no doubt if this had been an American film , Bruno Ganz would have won the best actor award.<br/><br/>There is one heartbreaking scene where Magda Goebbels gives her children poison while they are asleep and it just goes to show how far some of the top Nazi's would go not to surrender under any circumstances.

At certain times throughout the film I had forgotten that an actor was playing him, and actually thought I was watching the real person. His demeanor, personality shifts, loud outbursts, even facial expressions are so dead on it's incredible. In fact, the entire cast as a whole delivers an extraordinary performance. It is clear that careful thought went into the selection of actors/actresses.<br/><br/>The film tells the grim story of Hitler and his right-hand men during the last days of his life. We see a man grow increasingly insane as he refuses to accept the ultimate end of his lifetime goal. We also see the differences in the characters around him, some believing in his ideas until death, some showing the slightest ounce of disbelief in the world around them. It offers an extraordinary look into the past, a first hand look into the mind of Hitler, and takes a concept that has been tried hundreds of times before and makes it right.<br/><br/>Simply put, ""The Downfall"" is a must see film that will leave you curious and intrigued for days after the final credits roll."

","The Nazi regime and everything associated with it has been demonized in the past six decades up to a point where it is truly hard for a layperson to have a fairly realistic view of how things were. Don't get me wrong: every bit of the moral condemnation is fully deserved and necessary to be made.<br/><br/>However, we have to understand, that Nazis were just as human as any regular guy. It wasn't demons, or Satan or some unimaginable evil that has committed those crimes- they were people, cruel & despicable people, but otherwise having the same feelings, fears & uncertainties as any one of us. Attributing demonic powers to the enemy is never a good way to understand; and you might say who wants to understand such a thing?; but there is no other way to learn from the past- or from anything else for that matter- then trying to be realistic instead of dismissing.<br/><br/>We HAVE to condemn crimes that have taken place; but we have to condemn them for the right reasons; only after medicine has learned that diseases are caused by microorganisms, genetics etc. rather then by evil spirits that it was able to treat them. It is only if we accept that the nazi crimes(and many others before & after) were the results of deeply human processes that we can hope to avoid them in the future.<br/><br/>This is what I think this movie transmits to us."
"sddavis63","9","4","6","6 March 2009"," Straightforward But Very Powerful
","There's nothing particularly earth-shattering from a historical perspective here. It's simply the faithfully recounted story of the last 10 days of Adolf Hitler's life in the Bunker beneath the Chancellery. The basic story has been told before in 1981's ""The Bunker"" which starred Anthony Hopkins as Hitler, but although I thought that was well done, this is far superior, primarily because of the frighteningly superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He became ""der Fuhrer"" in this movie. He was completely convincing, and offered a more complex portrayal than Hopkins' version. In this movie Hitler shifts between being a charming boss to his secretaries, even sometimes being self-deprecating with them (he says to a nervous Traudl Junge on her first day ""I make a lot of mistakes; you won't make as many as I do"") to being maniacal and out-of control, raging against the betrayals of his colleagues and the failures (in his eyes) of his generals. Brilliant. Alexandra Maria Lara was almost as convincing as Junge. Her character seems to be what ties the movie together (and the movie begins and ends with actual footage of the real Junge being interviewed for the also fascinating documentary ""Im Totem Winkel."") There was also an interesting portrayal of the Goebbels, and especially Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) as she struggles with her conscience at the decision to murder her five children. The setting was realistic; the atmosphere totally believable. I appreciated as well that the movie painted a pretty good picture of what life was like outside the bunker, as we see street-fighting against the Russians, largely involving the Hitler Youth, who were the only ones left to defend the city after the collapse of Germany's armies. The cowardice of Hitler's generals and other officers was clearly shown as well. They obviously know that the war is over and Germany defeated, yet to the end they won't stand up to their demonic leader. This is truly one of the most powerful movies I've seen in a long time. 9/10"
"shafatqadri","8","4","6","21 March 2008"," Serious Movie making!!!
","I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as ""Der Untergang"" aka ""The Downfall"" did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge. We watch Hitler, in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masses. We watch Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. <br/><br/>Few films have dared to touch WW2 objectively from a German point of view; Most of the movies are shot and told from the Allied point of view. But this movie is shot completely from the German point of view.<br/><br/>""The Downfall"" tells the story of Fuhrer's final hours, his last critical 12 days in a fortified bunker below the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, while the Soviet Army was slowly taking over Berlin and their artillery bombarding the whole city Based on the book ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest. ""The Downfall"" is in a word, shocking. The last act in the great horrific play of the Third Reich plays out like that of a cult so many men and woman who swore allegiance to Hitler commit suicide by either shooting themselves in the head or by ingesting poison capsules. But the madness of Hitler himself is horrifically captivating. He changes his mind and opinion on a whim. One moment he advises his SS-Guards and Generals to leave the city after learning that he does not have enough troops to protect Berlin. A particular one named Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein , who was Eva Braun's brother-in-law, takes the Fuhrer for his word and leaves Berlin. When Hitler realizes this, he denounces Fegelein and orders him executed. What is more, Hitler discusses the final demise of the German people. He explains that this failure is not only that of the military, but of the civilians themselves. As such, his soldiers do not protect the people from the coming onslaught of the Soviet Army. He advises, ""In a war as such there are no civilians."" <br/><br/>Hitler is recreated by the superlative performance of Bruno Ganz, who appeared in the 2004 remake of ""The Manchurian Candidate."" Ganz captures the movement, voice, even the involuntary shaking of Hitler's left hand so well, that the audience would feel as if they are watching the dictator himself. We are often left with shivers down our spine at how realistic Ganz's depiction is. <br/><br/>It is amazing to see how wonderful country like Germany survived to the chaos, destruction and lack of command, arrived from the ashes like Phoenix and sixty years later is again one of the greatest nations. And for those who love war, I really recommend to watch this magnificent anti-war movie, and see the behavior of the leaders and population when a war is lost. <br/><br/>""The Downfall"" is an impressive and brilliant piece of film making and ingenuity. The film is completely in German so do not forget to get a DVD which has English sub titles unless of course you are well versed in German."
"blubb06","7","4","6","18 August 2007"," Important and controversial
","Although it's a good film, it was just as interesting to read the comments  especially from Germany. It's true, whenever a film such as this comes out portraying the Third Reich not as an Indiana Jones-type Empire of Evil, we Germans turn around in advance protesting: ""This is not meant to justify anything! Of course Hitler was a monster!"" I don't think anyone seriously judges young Germans today by what their great-grandparents did, but it's of course something never to be forgotten. Sadly, it's also a convenient stereotype in politics and movie-making that tends show demons instead of humans, with the effect that we no longer understand just how on earth such things were possible. Hopefully it will take a very long time before the Nazis are surpassed in evil. But closing our eyes to the real Hitler, Stalin or Mao and their minions in favor of a legend will prevent us from ever understanding how these things work. ""If you look into the Abyss, it looks back into you"" (Nietzsche?). Movies like this one challenge the viewer's ability to look and do some honest self-reflection, or we all might wake up one day to the same bad realization, that we chased a dream and killed millions along the way.<br/><br/>""The Downfall"" suggests how hard it was to be an outsider and not be affected by Nazi propaganda, and how well Hitler had managed to brainwash his troupe, especially the SS, into believing Germany was to be Sparta reincarnated, whose code of honor called upon everyone to fight to the death and without mercy. He ruled his admirers by being the source of their ideals (read: delusions of grandeur), pride, hope and fear. Bruno Ganz has justly been praised for his performance, and what he did was just enough  to make Hitler more mesmerizing as well as menacing would have invited unnecessary criticism. But imagine for once Anthony Hopkins in that role  the outcries of indignation! And the stacks of fan letters ...! (Hopkins actually played Hitler on TV in dark pre-Lecter times.) This Hitler is rather funny in his spitting and raving.<br/><br/>I was often annoyed by the kitschy music when suffering civilians and wounded are shown  scenes like these are stronger without it  and also by the urge to show ""good"" Germans, in the moral sense of the word. Not one of them, except the SS commandos hanging ""traitors"" in the streets, is fanatic enough to be entirely unsympathetic. There are some really memorable quotes by Hitler which serve as historical cues: ""Mercy is a crime against the people"" is the most remarkable. Juliane Köhler is striking as Eva Braun  she speaks volumes with her eyes, as is Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) who kills her children in cold blood (and allegedly had a thing for Hitler, but that's subtle in the film)  the ""bravest mother of the Third Reich"" indeed, by Hitler's standards! Joseph Goebbels, apart from a superficial resemblance, remains bland and not half the intellectual, charismatic orator he really was, and the rest of the cast is not particularly impressive either. The film's atmospheric moments are inside the bunker, when a grenade hits and suddenly the wild merriment stops, and you feel a claustrophobia and sense of dread that makes the goings-on seem like a mad fever dream. That was when I felt the fiction was real.<br/><br/>Some commentators have called this the best WW2-movie they ever saw. It's maybe the most complex recent ""big screen"" issue about Germany's Hitler madness  so far. My ""favorite"" is a Russian film (I can't recall the title) that shows what Germans  and Russians  did on the Eastern front, mostly seen through the eyes of a Russian boy whose village is burned down with its inhabitants locked inside the church, to which the SS set fire. Though not as grisly in detail as ""Saving Private Ryan"", it depicts the events Hitler's ""table talk"" set into motion in all their bestiality and without all false sentimentality. We should not forget that most of the war victims besides Jews were Russians, and for the latter the killing was far from over after 1945. They have their own story about killing for ideology or conformity that I'd really like to see made into a film as challenging as this one."

","Painting Hitler and the Nazis as anything other than real human beings is the great failing of most WWII movies.

However, their human sides are revealed as are the impetus behind many of their decisions and actions.<br/><br/>I have never seen a better film about WWII from any perspective. The plight of the Jews was barely shown because we have seen it in countless other great films like Schindler's List. This allowed for more time to be devoted to the Nazi government and was one of the most interesting and informative films I have ever seen. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because of a subplot or two that could have been shortened. However, these showed the plight of the German citizenry which was necessary to the story; they just could have been a tad shorter."

When the Germans admit to themselves they are beaten, one can see the base of human emotion and circumstance in the characters, and relate to them. <br/><br/>Engrossed in the movie and the flawless character portrayals, I actually felt bad for the Germans and in my American brazenness, wanted them to fight back!

","This was an excellent film, one of the best I have seen. I saw it in Berlin a couple of times ( in German ) when it first came out, and now have the DVD. Have also read the book. Just one comment I have to make which no-one else seems to have picked up on so far. In the scene where Hitler is presenting the Iron Crosses to members of the Hitler Youth in the Reichs Chancellery garden, he is introduced by a man in the brown uniform of the Hitler Youth, Artur Axmann, Reichsjugendfuehrer. Axmann salutes and gives the Nazi Gruess with his RIGHT arm. However, according to my information Artur Axmann was wounded on the first day of the attack on the Soviet Union, 22nd July 1941, when he lost an arm. And as far as I can make out from photographs of Axmann I have seen, the arm he lost was the RIGHT one. So he should have saluted with his LEFT hand.<br/><br/>I am not 100% certain of this, but I wonder whether there is any further information on this point.What do the film makers have to say about it ?<br/><br/>Also, I am anxious to obtain the song "" Blutrote Rosen "" by the Marek Weber Orchestra, which is played in the film when Eva Braun is dancing in the Reichs Chancellery. I know that the recording is available on the CD of the film, but I don't want to purchase the entire film soundtrack. Can anyone tell me where I can obtain the record ( preferably on CD ) of this song without having to buy the film soundtrack ?<br/><br/>Terry Moody."

","Downfall launches the viewer head-on into the last moments of the Reich in Berlin, 1945. It doesn't patronise the viewer with an explanatory voice over it is unflinchingly real. Ganz's performance as Hitler is terrific he manages to capture the sense of terror and awe that the real-life counter part had. The supporting cast are also superb portraying the sense of utter loss and crushed belief as the seemingly invincible idea of Germania collapses around them. This film has been criticised for humanising the Nazis, particularly Hitler but I find this to be it's strongest point. Unlike most war films the Germans are shown as human, they have emotions, they weep as their children die and their leader weeps as his monstrous scheme dies. The film really portrays the manner in which the German people were swept up with National Socialism, they lived and died for it. It also captures the terrifying will to power which the Nazis used so inhumanely over the 'weak' which even turn out to be the German civilians after a while. All in all a moving and shockingly realistic portrayal of a legacy which still haunts us to this day."
"maveric_74","9","4","6","7 February 2006"," Outstanding, amazing, spellbinding
","History tells us that Hitler was a great orator, a charismatic leader who held millions spellbound. Downfall follows that same role model as it paints a gripping, harrowing last few days of Adolf Hitler in his bunker in Berlin as the Russians close in..Still in charge, but barely there in mind or body, it almost seems that as the country collapsed around him, Hitler himself disintegrated. The movie is amazingly real, thanks to an amazing performance by Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler. The set detail, the storyline and all the supporting cast of characters is just about perfect. I could not fault this movie at all. You feel as if you are witnessing history unfold before your very eyes. To the end, despite his state of health, Hitler believed in his ""ethnic cleansing"" policy, appeared delusional in his belief that somehow he could lead Germany to victory over the allies.<br/><br/>The story itself is based on facts recounted by one of Hitler's close secretaries, Traudl Jung who managed to live through the war and survived to tell her account of the story.<br/><br/>This is clearly a great film of an important subject matter and director Oliver Hirschbiegel has crafted an amazing celluloid masterpiece of a man whose all-encompassing hatred and passion for the Jews literally drove him insane and to his ghastly death.<br/><br/>Some emotionally powerful moments in the movie involving mass suicide or murder will mean that the movie may not appeal to all fans. This is a must-see movie for fans of cinema. An absolutely riveting, astonishing piece of movie-making that left me shaking my head thinking I was watching a real documentary even though I knew it was a movie!"
"thosholzel","10","7","13","3 April 2005"," Powerful portrayal of the end of a world.
","The producers of The Downfall made a number of brilliant editorial decisions. The film explains nothing. It shows in historically accurate detail what happened. The viewer is a witness to the many surreal vignettes played out in the charnal pit of Berlin in final days of WW-II. With this essentially neutral portrayal of a man who alternates between being a kindly uncle and a raving lunatic, the usual cadre of critics who feel they alone own Hitler (it is much more than a cottage industry) are left speechless.<br/><br/>Many will find the human Hitler in this film difficult to reconcile with his mythically evil stature. Like Christ, Hitler was a human turned into a god. In Christ's case it was by his supporters; in Hitler's case it was by his enemies. As Christians' have made a sacrificial human a symbol of their religion, so have many Jews incorporated the murderous dictator into a symbol of evil, far more potent than any positive aspect of their religion. But religious ideologues can't have it both ways: If Hitler was not a god, then he was a human and cannot be criticized for being portrayed as one. To complain that the film ""humanizes"" him is an attempt to have one's cake and eat it. <br/><br/>To add further complexity, one of the quiet heroes of the film is an SS medical officer. This nuance will clash against the shibboleth that all SS men were only sadistic concentration camp guards instead of also the Swiss Guards of Hitler's megalomaniacal rule. Heavily indoctrinated, they were also the best-trained and fiercest combat troops of WW-II.<br/><br/>If there is a criticism that can be made against the film, it is that too many of Hitler's generals were reasonable men, professional soldiers, yet still honor-bound to a madman's captivating aura. Yes, the German General Staff was comprised of classically educated noblemen of a caliber that will never again lead a nation's military. But surely they were not all so resolutely noble, regal and handsome. OK, there were two fatties-Göring and Bormann-but they are clearly as evil as they are corpulent.<br/><br/>The supporting women are expertly cast, particularly Eva Braun-more of a party girl than one images (and with a subtle nod to her possible affair with General Fegelein)--as well as Magda Goebbels. Frau Goebbels is an icy beauty, as fascinating as the stare of a cobra. Her methodical poisoning of their six children is one of the most sickening moments in film.<br/><br/>Watching this gruesome story unfold is like traveling back to the bunker in a time machine. With stories of the horrors of the Holocaust long since dulled by saturation, it is shocking to witness the catastrophic violence of the death throes of Berlin. Death in the camps was a smoothly humming assembly line; death in Berlin was sudden and always capricious-a deafening cacophony of artillery shells, tank fire, collapsing buildings and the whistle and thud of small arms bullets. Fresh body parts litter this urban moonscape.<br/><br/>In the end, The Downfall comes closer than any film or book in portraying convincingly the dissolution of Hitler, the genius psychopath who was able to lead a nation-and himself--down a path of utter destruction. Scenes of officer suicide in the face of Russian advances are realistically portrayed (and evoke echoes of Masada). And yet, still, Hitler's hold on the psyche of a nation is not fully understandable. We see what happened; that his followers thought him truly a god. But how-really-did that happen? Could it happen to us? Extraordinary as the film is in depicting the dying days of a once brilliant madman expiring in his lair like a wounded rabid dog, yet something more is needed to make us understand the ""why"" of it. Perhaps, like all religious conversions, the reason for such a captivating thrall can never be understood. It can only be experienced."

","This movie was totally awesome. It was wonderful to see the director make a movie based on real life stories and facts, regardless of worrying about what bad things people might say about the movie. I have heard a lot of controversy about portraying Hitler as a human being. This kind of thinking defeats the purpose of us writing down history and remembering it. If we all decide that Hitler was not a human being, but a devil or demon, or something of that nature, then we will doom ourselves to let another human being rise through the ranks to be a brutal dictator with intentions of world domination and ethnic cleansing. To say that showing Hitler as a human is wrong is to say that sugarcoating history is right.<br/><br/>I also found that the humanizing of Hitler has been way over-rated. The movie was not just about Hitler during the last days of the war; it was about the German Government scrambling about Berlin trying to figure out what they were going to do, slowing coming to the realization/acceptance that their worst fears were closing in on them. I really like the fact that the movie was not just suddenly over when Hitler and Eva Braun killed themselves. It went on to show the frantic desperadoes of Berlin fighting to keep the city from surrendering to the Soviets, and also Traudl Junge's escape out of the bunker past the Soviet Soldiers.<br/><br/>Great visuals, great acting, and an amazing depiction of Adolf Hitler makes this my favourite movie of 2004. 10/10"

They had no clue that their country was becoming a dictatorship, where the monsters running the federal government cared nothing for the people, but only for power. Any similarities to Amerika, where our media are owned by the corporations who diddle the puppet strings of Bush? Excellent portrayals of the families so mesmerized by the charisma of this Bush-like Hitler that they murdered their children and themselves. You know this happened but to see Medusa Goebbels (or was it Goering) poisoning her children, one of them resisting) or to see the Doctor of the obscene medical experiments blowing his family up at dinner is to have the real charisma of this monster exemplified.<br/><br/>Watching Hitler be tender to the secretary wasn't difficult, as it's important to know that he was just like us. He just had the power of charisma (how sad that a word would come from Christ to represent these indescribably evil people). The sound effects of the bombing of Berlin, the hanging of the Germans who wouldn't fight, even as their 'empire' collapsed around them.....all this was so evocative of the end days of our own country. As I exited the theatre, other people were remarking on the similarities between the German 'patriots'.. Hitler followers... and our sheeple, willfully indifferent to the slaughter by their excellently trained armies of innocent people. Hitler's insanity is well emphasized by his continual planning, his announcement that new planes were being supplied (by Bush's grandfather, who was stopped by our government finally from financing the Luftwaffe factories) even as Berlin crumbles around him. The suicides by the Army officers were so sad, because they truly believed that our government would be as brutal to them as they were to our prisoners. Then, no; now, yes with our architects of torture at the highest level of our government. Encourage your fellow citizens to see this movie. If they are not completely anesthetized by the Bush propaganda machine, they will see the parallels. Of course it won't, but it should win some Oscars for the excellent acting, writing and sound effects."

I was thoroughly engrossed from the start to end, and you will be, too. The choice of actors could not have been better. Bruno Ganz as Hitler gives the performance of his life and the supporting cast all do a great job also.<br/><br/>I must admit I've never really understood people criticising Der Untergang for humanising Hitler. It was right that the film makers chose to portray Hitler going through all the emotions as described by those who were around him at the time. If you'd prefer see Hitler caricatured as Satan watch Hitler: Rise Of Evil (ok, that was a film portraying Hitler's rise to power rather than his final days alive, but you get my drift). Der Untergang doesn't set out to paint grotesque caricatures of Hitler and his generals as evil monsters. It attempts to bring to life as vividly and accurate as possible what went on without showing bias. Also the plight of the German refugees walking through rubble and children as soldiers hit me profoundly.<br/><br/>Adolf Hitler will always continue to arouse interest in people for many years and centuries to come.

"mark-397","8","5","10","14 May 2005"," Brilliant humanising portrayal of Hitler's final days.
","""Downfall"" is the dramatisation of Joachim Fest's marvellous book, detailing the thankfully premature end of Hitler's Thousand-Year Reich.<br/><br/>We follow Traudl Junge, who in 1942 is given the immense privilege of becoming Hitler's personal secretary. The real Traudl provides commentary at the beginning and end of the film that helps provide a moral compass reading for this immaculately detailed and forceful dramatisation.<br/><br/>I expected to see something much more stagy and claustrophobic, but the film counterpoints the stark, sterile bunker against the gutted streets of battlefield Berlin, this is clearly no made-for-TV historical drama, the evocation of a city, and a people on the edge of destruction are grimly realistic and clinically accurate. The violence seems somewhat inconsistent, we see very little blood and guts, we see something of the horrors of a make-shift surgery, along with hack-saw amputations, but this is far removed from ""Saving Private Ryan"". Maybe Oliver Hirschbiegel thought that overt gore might be considered a distraction from what's really important, maybe so, but this for me stood as the only real inconsistency in the production.<br/><br/>The dark heart of the film is of course Adolf Hitler. Bruno Ganz provides a portrayal of Hitler that transcends impersonation, we see a man who is greater than the sum of his world famous odd-ball mannerisms, Ganz provides a level of humanity and reality that makes the unfolding events all the more compelling to watch. We meet Hitler the tee-total, dog-loving vegetarian, a man who often shows great compassion and humility. The Hitler we expect to see, the man gripped by nationalistic paranoia and chilling racism is ever present, ready at any moment to launch into venomous rants that become increasingly irrational and unhinged as he descends into the titular downfall.<br/><br/>While Ganz is always enthralling to watch, we know what we're getting with Hitler, much more interesting are the Nazi clique. Amongst Hitler's closest confidants we have Joseph and Magfa Goebbels, whose zeal for Hitler's new order renders them into suicide-cultists, unable to accept the possibility of life after the death of their leader, even for their six children. Likewise for Eva Braun, whose devotion to her beloved Hitler is so complete that she wantonly shares his fate.<br/><br/>The film gained most controversy with its representation Nazis like Prof. Ernst-Günter Schenck (humanitarian and rationalist). You are reminded that you can no more judge a man by his uniform, than a book by its cover. You never sense that the film is trying to mitigate Nazi crimes, but remind you that the crimes were committed by humans with varying degrees of complicity.<br/><br/>In the end ""Downfall"" is an important reminder that we demonize the Nazis at our very great peril. Winning the war on our terms we were able to paint Nazism as some kind of supernatural plague. I often hear people say how important it is that we remember what the Germans did, so that such evil can never again be allowed to go unchecked. What's wrong with this? Since 1945 the unspeakable evil of the Nazis seems to have worked as an effective camouflage for numerous horrors, from the ravages of Stalinism and China's Cultural Revolution right up to Rwanda and Yugoslavia. It seems to me that the only lesson we have learnt from the Nazis is that if you want to perpetrate massive acts of unspeakable evil, keep the noise down, complacent super powers are trying to sleep!"
"Eumenides_0","9","5","10","22 April 2005"," Cruelty Has A Human Face... And Great Actor Behind It!
","I haven't been so enthralled in a movie in a long time! Der Untergang was the last of the great 2004 movies left for me to watch after enjoying Million Dollar Baby, Vera Drake and Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind. After eagerly waiting for it to premiere in Portugal, I've finally seen it and it's as brilliant and beautiful as word of mouth would have one believe. Oliver Hirschbiegel, an unknown director to me until now, made what is to me one of the best movies in many years and easily one of the best gems of last year. I can't think of anything negative to say about it.<br/><br/>Technically, it's outstanding; it recreates the wrecked, chaotic Berlin of 1945 with as much accuracy and attention to detail as The Pianist recreates the Warsaw Ghetto. The beauty of the sets doesn't restrict itself to the open city but also to disturbingly clean, anti-septic scenes of Hitler's underground bunker, bathed in a bluish, pure light that contrasts bitterly with the horrors happening outside this fantasy world the dictator created for himself. The art directors should be commended along with the directors of photography. The sound in this movie is also another great aspect: the explosions, bombings, gun fires find their way into the story seamlessly; the bunker dwellers might be having a party in one moment only for a bomb to explore right next to them ruining their futile attempts at pretending everything's alright outside the bunker. Their downfall becomes more real to them as the sound of the Russian artillery keeps getting closer and closer, heightening their despair and runaway attempts. Only Hitler remains frighteningly calm amidst all this panic. I feel Der Untergang is a movie that was inexplicably short-changed on a lot of Oscar nominations.<br/><br/>I have no complaints from the cast either: most actors were unknown to me, except Thomas Kretschmann; and I didn't even know he was in the movie until I saw the poster at the theater. And yet everyone was brilliant in their particular roles; some were relatively short and others occupied a large bulk of the movie, but everyone was perfect! Obviously Bruno Ganz's unique performance will always overshadow anyone else's, but worthy of note are Alexandra Maria Lara, who plays Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary who has a very touching relationship with the dictator; Christian Berkel, as an SS officer whose main concern is helping the civilian population when all the higher powers abandon them; Michael Mendl, playing General Weidling, who sees the madness of continuing to resist the Russian army's impeding advance; and Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, a truly haunting performance as the man who keeps feeding Hitler with dangerous fantasies about victory even when defeat is obvious to everyone.<br/><br/>But it is Bruno Ganz who gives the performance of the movie: forget Clint Eastwood and Jim Carrey for their two fine performances in 2004; and do forget the overrated Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio. Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. Ganz isn't just performing; he is really Adolf Hitler! He embodies with perfection the mannerisms, body language, voice of the tyrant! With a remarkable make-up that further transforms his semblance into Hitler's, Ganz completely transforms himself for this role. I've only seen Ganz in another movie before, a European co-production called In The White City: I hated it and hated Ganz. I never imagined only one year later I'd be praising this same actor. This isn't the Bruno Ganz of In The White City; this is one of the best modern actors playing his art to new heights! It's not easy to make Hitler a compelling, fascinating, and even human character; it's actually very easy to make him the inhuman monster, the raging, babbling lunatic we would like to think he was. But Ganz played Hitler with chilling complexity and that made the dictator look even more monstrous. It only makes this man look even crueler and callous when we admit he was also a man who loved playing with his dog, or enjoyed listening children singing to him, held polite conversations with people and liked to stroll. When one takes all this in it becomes more chilling how such a man could have given orders to kill millions. All his excuses are finally gone. I hope Bruno Ganz is proud of this role; I imagine it wasn't easy, but it's a treat for movie lovers. And again, one feels he was criminally missing at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Der Untergang is around 150 minutes long and remains entertaining until the end. The only reason I was looking at my watch sometimes was because I wanted to know how much longer I could be enjoying this experience; I just didn't want it to end. The story is interesting enough as it shows what's happening inside the bunker in the last days of the Reich. Although there's a cast huge enough to rival a Robert Altman movie, the movie never loses narrative coherence: it's always about Hitler and how Hitler's madness and growing weakness alienates many of his followers and just forces others to make interesting decisions; the political machinations, the back-stabbings, the plots, the desertions, the suicides are all result of this one central figure. Particularly chilling is the scene in which Magda Goebbels kills her six children with poison, then dies with her husband in suicide.<br/><br/>One of the best movies of 2004, Der Untergang is a fantastic cinematic experience. One shouldn't leave this movie for DVD rental, it needs to be enjoyed on a big screen for full effect."
"writers_reign","6","6","13","6 May 2005"," Bunker Hell
","I put off seeing this film until it was the only game in town and although I've been known to nod off even in 90 minute fare I remained awake for all two and a half hours of this. Its strength is to remain detached from the actual combat it is recording so that we never actually SEE the Allies in action but only the effects of the shelling, bombing, etc. A good ninety per cent of the footage is devoted to the bunker in which Hitler holed up for the last days of the war and whether by design or accident the feeling is of rats scuttling through a maze in search of the cheese that is never going to be there ever again. The acting is of a uniformly high standard virtually all of it in the hands of actors completely unknown outside Germany - or at least in England - and if one must single out Bruno Ganz it is only because he has been saddled with trying to find something in Hitler that would indicate that once he WAS a human being. Although the bunker is well lit and the occupants DO from time to time venture to the surface for a breath of fresh? air the lighting favours darker, solemn, even depressing hues and the symbolism at the end which depicts a day of glorious sunlight could be said to be a tad over the top but otherwise it's a fine film that depicts characters from the full spectrum of our preconceived image of the 'Nazi' from the chilling Magda Goebbles calmly killing her own children in the finest tradition of Greek tragedy to Hitler himself contemptuous of the German civilians who have and must continue to suffer on the altar of his madness to the more rational even verging on the humane of some of his staff. It's difficult to say who is the typical audience for this film but other comments and responses show it is wider than we might imagine."

","Not exactly spoilers as this movie is a true story, almost a documentary, and we already know the ending.<br/><br/>But this is what surprised me the most - We actually don't know Hitler as well as we think we do.<br/><br/>And the below review is as a layman who was never hurt by Hitler, nor have I ever really researched or studied him (other than school and movies).<br/><br/>The movie starts in 1943. A young woman is being interviewed by Hitler to be his secretary and I was quite amazed to see this gentle and compassionate man talking with care to this innocent girl.<br/><br/>Fast forward 2 years (Hitler's last day), the bunker in Berlin which is like the temporary HQ of the Nazi, and from this girl's love and respect towards Hitler we can clearly see that he has treated her well (almost like a grandfather). <br/><br/>But now we see a totally different Hitler. Though he is relatively kind to the non military people around him, the moment it becomes business he turns into sort of an animal. His core ideology is that the weak deserves to be killed. His subordinates, senior military officers, are killed off if they show the slightest sign of being not loyal. Example - a senior officer is missing from duty for a few hours. They find him, shoot him, and his body is just left there. When Hitler is told that the civilians need to be evacuated, he says that the German people have cheated him and so they deserve to die. Killing is rampant everywhere. About 6 million Jews were killed, so the rest 44 million were his own people!!!<br/><br/>Once he understands that defeat is a given, he decides not to flee and go down with the ship. But he then openly encourages the loyal people around him to kill themselves, giving them cyanide vials like precious gifts from the Freur. He then officially marries his partner of 15 years and then they both kill themselves. His guards then carry them outside, pours gasoline over them and burns them (as instructed by Hitler before death)!<br/><br/>And there are people who are more crazy that him. The wife of a senior political leader has bought her 6 children to this battle front so that they can die as she doesn't want them to live in a non-Hitler world! She sedates them and then proceeds to kill each one of them!!! Then she and her husband kill themselves.<br/><br/>There are also other surprising things - Hitler is not exactly a military person like we normally assume him to be. And he is angry with his military because the officers don't tell him everything. He sees failure as being a traitor, so they keep giving him half truths and so when he strategizes he is working on imaginary things (like whole divisions of military that don't exist or were wiped out long back). No wonder then lost.<br/><br/>This movie is 'not' fiction. I was repeatedly surprised realizing this, as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>Please do see this movie, because its not about the past. It shows us clearly 'why' there are wars and conflicts. Its mostly because the few people in power have a particular ideology and the people below them obey blindly either because they personally like him or because they swore an oath (and also because they don't care to understand because for them its just a career and they want to go up). A lot of the time its almost as simple as that. And above all, we should never create a 'culture' of killing. When by some logic it becomes OK to kill just one person, we will then become empowered on making more and more reasons (excuses) to kill more and more people.<br/><br/>Then there is the rampant manipulation of the young. You just need to make them pledge and they will then die for you! It made me so angry to see this.<br/><br/>Most ww1 and ww2 movies show us the terrible pain of war. It makes us feel that we can opt for love and prevent wars in the future. But in this movie we can clearly see that its not in our hands at all. Of all the war movies I think this is the most important.<br/><br/>Try seeing Gandhi just after this movie. I think the greatest difference between Hitler and Gandhi is that Hitler just hated 'everyone', whereas Gandhi never hated 'anyone', even his own oppressors. And we may even need to, to feel hope again.<br/><br/>The entire cast is wonderful. Proper class 1 acting. The cinematography, editing, settings and everything is like a big budget movie.<br/><br/>But its not at all a fun or entertaining movie. I couldn't even see it in one sitting (saw it over a week split into 3 parts). The moment I got a little distracted (annoyed, powerless, hungry, some small excuse), I stopped it. There is too much negativity. Still, its 'highly' Recommended, so much that I think this movie should be part of school curriculum.<br/><br/>""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Nelson Mandela</li></ul>"

It is based on two books, written based on witness accounts of what happened. You need to watch stuff like that in order to understand that even the worse people have been human and had a good side and dreams and connections, but also to understand how the best people get caught in it too, probably because of these same human connections and feelings of loyalty and respect.<br/><br/>What I find disgusting is that movies like these only appear a long time after they can do any good. After half a century of Nazi demonizing, when most of the people involved have died, we muster the courage to admit that Hitler was human, too, and that he and his staff were not a bunch of psychopathic evil monsters; they had ties directly to our very nature. Perhaps in a few decades we will get movies depicting terrorists as human, too, and we will wonder on how delusional they were, but still loved their friends and their spouses and their children. A movie that would probably not help anyone still fighting or trying to come to terms with the consequences of terrible acts, because it would be so much time after the fact.<br/><br/>What jumps in one's face, again and again, from this movie, is how the cocoon around Hitler, just as with so many other maniacal leaders, left him completely disconnected from reality and from the people around him. We get to understand that the same connections that caught so many people in the tide of Nazism also make a monster from the one that chooses or is forced to sever them. Any possible respect for Hitler vanishes immediately when confronted with the image of a crazy old man, ready to let the entire German nation perish, rather than face his own failure.<br/><br/>I would make this film a movie to be watched by children. Not for them to become the subjects of Godwin's law, but to see that human interactions in the inner circle of the Third Reich were no more or less special than the way children relate to each other and their parents. And even if we feel disgust for the people that played strategy games with real people, but were never in the harms way, we have to see those willing to fight for the paternal image of the Fuhrer, the party, God, freedom, or whatever mass delusion they just love to submit to.<br/><br/>This film shows - as so many should have, but chose to parody reality for a quick buck - that ""Never again!"" doesn't mean not killing people in concentration camps or drawing swastikas, but not falling in these oh so human and easy to miss traps of character. The little things, the ones that should become apparent before they turn into monstrosity.<br/><br/>It also shows how good German actors and cinematography really are. Good job! The only issue I had is with the length of the film. True, it would have been impossible to compress the horror in less time, but some watchers might be ill accustomed to watching something for such a long period of time. Even if you find it difficult, please do try. It is worth it."
"CinemaClown","Null","3","5","9 August 2013"," Unbelievable Realism. Exceptional Accuracy.
","Exhibiting relentless realism & exceptional accuracy on-screen, Downfall (also known as Der Untergang) recreates the events surrounding the final days of German dictator Adolf Hitler's life in the Führerbunker while also depicting the fall of the Third Reich & Berlin during World War II. The film is bookended by excerpts from the real-life Traudl Junge, Hitler's final secretary, and the plot itself is derived from her accounts.<br/><br/>The best thing about Downfall is that it keeps the human characteristics of the Führer intact & boldly defies the conventional portrayal of Hitler in media, which was controversial as expected but in my opinion is a brave, respectable & important attempt. What's even more surprising is that by taking this humane approach, the film is able to evoke sympathy & pity from its viewers for someone considered by many to be the most evil person to have ever lived.<br/><br/>Contrary to what one might expect, Downfall neither glorifies Adolf Hitler nor Nazism. In fact, it presents the Führer as a completely degraded, broken down & delusional shell of a human being trying to win an already lost cause. The film also exhibits just how profoundly deep rooted & blind was the faith & loyalty of Hitler's followers in him & his ideals as we see many committing suicide for they couldn't digest the idea of living in a world without National Socialism.<br/><br/>With great emphasis on showing the value of a human life, whether evil or not, the direction by Oliver Hierschbiegel is an absolute class. Screenplay is pure gem from start to finish. Production design has done a fabulous job here to perfectly recreate the 1940s atmosphere of war-torn Berlin. Cinematography captures every frame in meticulous detail. Editing makes sure every single scene is relevant to the film. And music often goes unnoticed here but it's an integral part of the film.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Bruno Ganz delivers one of decade's strongest & most haunting performances as Adolf Hitler and from mannerisms to fits of tirade, he gives us the most convincing & authentic portrayal of Führer in media, so far. Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge with fine elegance while the rest of the casting is near-perfect too as each actor highly resembled their real-life characters & played them splendidly well. It's a film with powerful performances & every single one of them has delivered.<br/><br/>Extremely well researched, beautifully detailed, brutally accurate, insanely realistic & highly gripping from start to finish, Downfall tries to remove our assumption that only inhuman monsters are capable of doing terrible things & shows that how even the most charming men can manage to seduce a whole lot of into barbarism. A German film about the fall of Berlin that places Adolf Hitler in the central role? This isn't just a landmark moment for cinema but for Germany itself.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Downfall is a profoundly moving motion picture & a significant masterpiece that would easily find its place amongst world cinema's greatest films & is arguably the best to come out from Germany. One of the most flawless works of 21st century in my opinion and a perfectly crafted historical account that needs to be shown in schools & universities around the world, this unique take on the most feared dictator of all time is a must watch for everyone. Extremely recommended."
"simon-thome3","8","3","5","31 July 2007"," A perfect portrayal of the final peak of Germany's darkest time
","With ""The Downfall"" Oliver Hirschbiegel and Bernd Eichinger created a cinema experience, which had seemed to be too delicate for German movie makers till then; the portrayal of Adolf Hitler and the depiction of the last twelve days of the Third Reich. Historically precise and provided with an enormous amount of artistic intensity, ""The Downfall"" managed to form a cinematic coming to terms with apparently one of the most tragic and in equal terms catastrophic chapters of German history. The more and more appearing senselessness of war and the decaying conception of national socialism are contrasted to the aim of Hitler and his leading elites to continue the war by all means necessary. By the same token the incapability of the principal generals of staff, who are unable to manage, respectively are not willing, to instruct Hitler about the absolutely hopeless situation he maneuvered himself into, is depicted plausibly. In this regard it is essential to point out the acting performed by the main characters resp. the entire cast, for it is the brilliant acting which makes the movie such an intense experience for the audience. Several critics stated that ""The Downfall"" would picture Hitler to human, too much in private moments and that those scenes would distract people from recognizing the delusionally controlled and hate-driven person of Hitler. But it has to be stressed, that just due to the fact it does not conceal Hitlers human and private side but displays it quite obviously, a notion within the audience rises that the evil, the most obnoxious and even the most inhuman ideology might lurk inside of everyone and could possibly find its manifestation. In other words, the danger of such ideology could not be concentrated in this one abstracted evil but in every human at all."

","..Nazi Germany was born and when belief became madness, Berlin fell at the hands of the Allies. In the craze of the Fuehrer's final days, ""Downfall"" lets us see into the souls of men that allowed the madness to rule their compassion, their judgment. As the fate of the German people becomes bleaker and bleaker, as Berlin is invaded by the Russians, the men who cower in their Bunker to lead them into doom refuse to cease the madness of Hitler, instead allowing him to fill the country with false hope while pointing an accusing finger at his Generals and laying the blame of defeat at the German people who so mistakenly followed him into power and mistakenly believed in a cruel false prophet.<br/><br/>A story of the final days of the Reich as lived in The Bunker, ""Downfall"" is a film of amazing performances, a gripping drama where the end is clear and historically known, yet still draws you in and takes you to a place so dark, so evil; you wish you could find another ending.<br/><br/>Sadly you can't. Innocent children still die at the hands of their mother, Hitler dissolves into a gray, stooped, frenetic, trembling mass of insanity, Eva Braun still dances gaily and smiles through the end of a war that took an awful toll from the heart of humanity.<br/><br/>When watching ""Downfall"" you quickly forget you are watching a movie, you forget the people on the screen these are simply actors (amazing, gifted actors), who make magic with a compelling script.<br/><br/>If you watch one foreign film this year, make it ""Downfall."" You will walk away baffled, at the lengths blind loyalty will go; at the immense sacrifice one country made to follow an impossible, imperialistic, hateful, hedonistic dream.<br/><br/>Yet because of a movie like ""Downfall"" you will learn that not all Germans were Nazi's and some Germans were just people that simply loved their country and the people in it.<br/><br/>The lesson of Downfall is...may we never again see a ""Downfall"" as wrenching as this one, for in the film lays a vivid warning for the entire world to see, for the price the German people paid in the end of WWII was very, very steep."
"faraaj-1","10","3","5","29 October 2006"," Best biopic ever....
","I read Sir Ian Kershaw's definitive biography of Adolf Hitler little over a year ago. I had studied that era before, but that book really gave me a pretty thorough insight into this monster. This man who was after all made of flesh and blood and was for over a decade almost a father figure and a person to be revered by the German people - among the most literate of Europe at that time. I hated Hitler even more after reading this well-researched biography because I understood how intelligent he was, how great an orator; a person with an aura yet so bloody-minded and bigoted.<br/><br/>The Downfall is uncanny because the image that I retained of Hitler after reading his biography is exactly the portrait presented in the film. I can understand how disturbing this film would be for people born and bred on one-dimensional caricatures. The Downfall shows the real Hitler - charmer, lover of dogs and little children, dynamic orator, unrepentant warlord, completely delusional madman. He was all those things and The Downfall is a three-dimensional view of the real man and his last days.<br/><br/>The film contains the usual rogues gallery from Hitlers last days: Eva Braun, Goebbels, Speer, Himmler, Keitel, Jodl, Fegelein, Mohnke and the chilling Magda Goebbels. All are portrayed realistically even if some come out looking heroic in their stubbornness. The mechanics of film-making are excellent, and the performances/acting superb.<br/><br/>Fegelein comes out looking honorable (which I can understand) and Speer's comes out positively heroic, which I believe to have been one of the great errors of judgment history has made. I refuse to believe he was as innocent as his autobiography portrayed him. Actual conversations Hitler had in the last few days, actual snap decisions, rantings and ravings are all captured realistically in this film. I found almost no fiction in The Downfall and I was already familiar with the very 'realistic' portrayal of events. In fact a lot of ground was covered in the three hour running time in covering a large number of factual incidents. This is an amazing achievement and I would say a history lesson for the open-minded. I would however agree that children, being impressionable, should not see this film because they might come to the wrong conclusions about Hitler."
"unakaczynski","10","4","8","27 September 2005"," Incredible...
","I consider ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"" to be pretty much the pinnacle of World War II films. Many others that I've seen, such as ""Windtalkers"" and ""Enemy at the Gates,"" while each great movies in their own right, have never been able to equal the impact and flat-out power of those films. In fact, I believed for a long time that there were likely no war movies, World War II or otherwise, that could match the power of those filmsI'll be the first to admit, however, that my viewing of ""Platoon"" may need serious refreshing and that I've yet to see ""Apocalypse Now"". However, in my experience, even the impressive ""Full Metal Jacket"" fell a little short of the pure visual power of ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""Schindler's List."" Well, I just finished a film that has done a remarkable job of proving me wrong.<br/><br/>""DOWNFALL"" is based on the true story of the final days of the Third Reich in 1945, with incredible realism and stunning storytelling. In a word, I would actually call this film ""riveting."" In fact, I can't remember the last time I watched a foreign film (American that I am) that so intensely held my attention. At any rate, as I began, it takes place during the final days of WWII on the European front. Hitler has become and aged and weakened old man. The stress of illness, war, and his years in leadership have taken a heavy toll. Here, we have a man with a hunched stature and increasingly obvious palsy (I may have this confused with another condition, if I'm wrong I apologize--it may have been Parkinson's). In fact, we have one of the most evil men of the 20th century looking weak, defeated, old, and incredibly human. We view his paranoia growing as we watch his Generals lose faith. We see German people struggle to maintain their loyalty as they are torn by the will to live and escape the constant shelling of Berlin. We see a man who, through his intense hatred, looks weakened and frustrated that the grand plans he had for Germany and his people, well meaning as they may have been, has led to a no-way-out scenario which only continues to worsen. Much of the film is seemingly based upon historical fact, and especially, personal reports from another person whose story is closely followed in the film: That of Hitler's personal secretary, Traudl Junge. Much of what we see in this film was taken from her personal accounts of those last dreadful days.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--First off, there was very little about this film not to like:<br/><br/>--The acting is brilliantly done, especially by Bruno Ganzwho is frighteningly perfect as Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>--Excellent cinematography and photographyoften reminiscent of the brilliant, grittily realistic look ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>--Arguably the highest production value of any foreign film I've yet seen.<br/><br/>--Incredible scenery and backgrounds. I can't imagine how this film was made on such a grand scale in tiny, cramped Germany. Even if filmed elsewhere in Europe, I can't quite imagine where they found these areas, so destroyed and so accurate.<br/><br/>--Incredible epic scope.<br/><br/>--Among the best sound effects I've heard from a foreign filmvery realistic.<br/><br/>--Several smaller stories are told which intertwine together brilliantly and give an excellent, all-around view of people, beliefs and opinions of many Germans during the war.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--The music is good and works perfectly, but nothing truly special or different.<br/><br/>--This war epic focuses less on graphic violence (though there is plenty) and more on the violent and conflicting personalities. It is then easier to equate this powerful film to ""Schindler's List"" than to ""Saving Private Ryan"" in this way.<br/><br/>--Characters often not properly introducedoccasionally confusing trying to follow all the characters--reminded me of ""Passion of the Christ's"" poor character development.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--The only problem with this film is that it's so well made, directed, filmed, and acted that I found myself feeling sorry for Nazis and even Hitler at times! The human aspect of this man comes through that well! But worry not, for the more sadistic side of his nature rarely fails to come through and keep you shocked and perhaps even, emotionally confused.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--Any time children die.<br/><br/>Memorable Scene:<br/><br/>--This was another film with so many memorable scenes it's hard to pick just one. I'm going to go with any of the number of scenes where you feel the humanity of Adolf Hitler--because they seriously catch you off-guard.<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 9/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 10/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 3/10 (very little of either) Violence/Gore: 7/10 (not a ""constant battlefield epic"" so this is a quantity rating) Dialogue: 9/10 Music: 9/10 Direction: 10/10<br/><br/>Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10<br/><br/>Overall: 10/10<br/><br/>I'm giving a ""10"" to this film for it's overall quality and intense visuals and characters, epic scope, and well, basically everything. I highly recommend this to all fans of War films, especially those of World War II and WWII buffs. All this despite the fact that I believe that ""Schindler's List"" may actually be a slightly better and more powerful film. But this is damn close.<br/><br/>www.ResidentHazard.com"

","This was undoubtedly one of the best films I have seen in a long while, and it strangely wasn't made in Australia. (that is sarcasm, for those unable to detect it). Bruno Ganz has produced the ultimate portrayal of the paper hanger, and makes all other portrayals to date look like cartoon characters. That said, No, it doesn't make me sympathetic to Hitler. Yes, it shows him with human foibles, and not simply as the monster he is usually shown as (simply because its safer to do so). That he was evil is without question, and Downfall does nothing to try and persuade you otherwise. It makes the statement that this happened, and can happen again because of human gullibility, stupidity and pigheadedness. One only has to look at a certain fellow in the US at the moment! The rest of the cast is superb, so good in fact that I would not be surprised to find that many of them would be unable to get regular work because of it, finding that like Andy Robinson of Dirty Harry fame, that they have been type cast for being too good. The cinematography is flawless, the action (more hinted at than shown, as it deals more with the bunker than the war itself) is scary, and I can only thank my parents that I was born when and where I was, as being involved in this mess...well you get the idea."

Deciding to base the film just as much on the experiences of Adolf Hitler's secretary and the things she witnessed is brilliant.<br/><br/>And Bruno Ganz - my god, if this performance of his is not worth an Oscar, the Hollywood incarnates truly show what lousy stuff they're made of. This film could never have been made anywhere but Germany, making it into an English speaking film would be a disaster (but of course, with their tendency to remake anything over there I wouldn't be surprised! ha ha)..<br/><br/>Go and see this film, sure it's a hard thing to watch, but it's an experience for life! 10/10 - no question in my mind!"
"Swifttraveler","10","4","8","13 May 2005"," The film Downfall covers new ground in the war film genre.
","Everyone, regardless of age, has heard something about World War II; as a result, the filmmaker's dilemma is that he or she must show an aspect of the war that is unusual and therefore worth the time and money spent filming. No one benefits from cliché. The last ten days in the lives of the major players--Hitler, Eva Braun, and the Goebbels--as depicted in Downfall, appeals to the viewer who wants to get past what has already been attempted in the war films of the past 60 years. Having said that, any film on World War II will be expected to get the facts right, e.g. the time and manner of Adolf Hitler's death. What is harder to depict is the feelings individuals had about life as they were living it. An art film such as Downfall walks a line between exact correspondence to historical fact and the filmmaker's (and viewers') desire to slant the action toward the interpretation that is most acceptable to a humane, reflective, and well-considered view of ""reality."" What I require of art film as well as biography is a focused perception of this reality, something that raises the human spirit, and our need to triumph over base human motives. The ""reality"" is that in April 1945, the people who worked for Hitler felt differently about the end. Only a few people planned to kill themselves in the bunker with Hitler; most people wanted to survive the end of the war, and get on with their lives--whateer that might be. This point is reinforced throughout the film in the female roles: there are several weepy women who felt they couldn't live without their ""Fuehrer,"" and, in contrast, there were those women (and men) who could walk away after the Russian entry into Berlin, those with the will and knowledge to live on. The culmination of this theme of ambivalent service to Hitler comes near the end when the Nazi doctor argues with an officer: the officer intends to commit suicide, and the doctor can't believe how anyone would choose that. Thus, it seems to me that some people thought it was an honor to kill themselves for Hitler, others were killed by Nazis because they saw what was happening as wrong. Another point is that several people/characters asked Hitler to surrender ""for the sake of the German"" people; it became clear that Hitler never gave a damn about the people who ""served"" him nor about the German Nation. The filmmakers were wise to have the telling of the story cohere around the secretary, Trudl Jung--a sort of ""innocent"" bystander who decided that what she did not know was not going to hurt her. In other words, the secretary was the Everyman who thinks ignorance is bliss. This film has reminded me that real power requires checks and balances on excess; and that people who believe in humanity must speak out against genocide (e.g. the Sudan, Rwanda). See related films, Hotel Rwanda and an older film, The Garden of the Finzi-Continis."
"jcanettis","10","4","8","7 May 2005"," Trylly Compelling and Realistic!
","I have seen quite many WW2 films in the past, yet very few of them managed to amaze and shock me as ""Der Untergang"" did. Under Oliver Hirschbiegel's excellent direction, we watch the agonizing last hours inside Hitler's bunker, as accounted for by his young secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara). We watch Hitler (Bruno Ganz), in his peak of his insanity, as he awaits for imaginary troops to save him and his motherland, while his closest associates start to realize that the game is over and begin to desert him en masse. We watch Eva Brown (Juliane Kohler), who amidst the turmoil and destruction, her main preoccupation is to die looking beautiful, so she chooses the poison instead of the bullet. We watch Frau Goebells (Corinna Harfouch) who prefers to have her children killed than live in a world of ""decadants"". All in all, we watch the members of the Nazi elite and their entourage spending their last moments awaiting their well-deserved fate, with their reactions varying from binge drinking to committing suicide.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz delivers an amazing performance definitely worthy of an Oscar. He is amazing as Hitler, switching from manic and hysterical to sweet and caring, in an a paranoid way. The other members of the cast are also doing a great job, portraying the personalities of that time in a highly realistic way. The fact that the dialogs are in German adds to the astonishing realism of the film even more, making it look like a professional documentary.<br/><br/>Some people accused the film for displaying Hitler in a more ""humane"" manner than appropriate. I definitely disagree with the accusation: Hitler is not displayed as humane; he is simply portrayed exactly as he was, namely a paranoid and ruthless fanatic, yet who had also some moments in which he displayed compassion and fondness. The whole point is to see this monstrous personality exactly as he was, and not try to conceal some aspects of his character in the name of political correctness; Hirschbiegel deserves credit for achieving this difficult goal immaculately.<br/><br/>""Der Untergang"" is a 10/10 film which everyone should watch."
"mike-925","10","4","8","2 May 2005"," Downfall is Best Film About Hitler and the Nazis Ever Made
","I've seen a trashier version of Hitler's last ten days in the Berlin Bunker. It stars Alec Guinness as Der Fuhrer. Though it used Hugh Trevor-Roper's account of the last ten days, it was the usual blend of stereotypes and caricatures. I think I have seen Anthony Hopkins as Der Fuhrer somewhere too. But neither Guiness nor Hopkins could do justice to Schickelgruber without a serious movie wrapped around them.<br/><br/>This is a German-made movie that is genuine enough to warrant being taken seriously.<br/><br/>One problem a serious drama about Nazis in the Berlin Bunker is how to create heroes and villains.<br/><br/>A good film never creates heroes and villains simply. They come in shades. Downfall has the shading right.<br/><br/>The screenplay is pulled from two accounts of Hitler's last days, one of them by the then young stenographer he had hired only two years before the end of the Thousand Year Reich that made it just a few days longer than 12 years.<br/><br/>Incidentally, tho the US TV Press has been hyping the fall of Saigon 30 years ago this week, yesterday (Saturday, April 30, 2005) is the 60th anniversary of the death of Adolph and Eva, who jointly committed suicide. I saw this movie the day after Adolph and Eva's 60th Anniversary as a married couple. Never mind that the marriage didn't even last a full day.<br/><br/>Let me tell you the lengths the film went to be accurate. Joseph Goebbels had a childhood bout with polio that left one leg four inches shorter than the other. The limp he had as a result was portrayed accurately in the movie. Many Nazi film accounts make few distinctions in the uniforms of the Reich. Goebbels was the Gauleiter of Berlin, in addition to being the Propaganda Minister. His orangish sport coat uniform is a detail often missed in films about the Nazis.<br/><br/>The screenplay pulls few punches. Those who know the Bunker melodrama from reading Hugh Trevor-Roper or William Shirer carry the details in their head.<br/><br/>Magda Goebbels' murder of her five children is shown in a detail even Magda would have been interested in seeing. The Whole bunker is full of talk about suicide by all manner of major and minor Nazis as Der Furher contemplates his End. Everyone has a cyanide pill at the ready.<br/><br/>Magda only married her womanizer husband to get closer to Hitler. The movie suggests she was the most soulless of Hitler's sycophants. Her husband Joseph doesn't have the guts to put the children to death. But Magda consults with the Bunker chemist to make a bitter-tasting drink to drug the kids before the ultimate cyanide crunch.<br/><br/>Through several scenes, the Goebbels children are portrayed as having a grand old time playing in the Bunker as the sands ooze out of the hourglass. The kids are dressed like caricatures of happy schoolchildren and appear to have no sense the end is near.<br/><br/>Except one daughter is suspicious and Magda shows increasing concern that this one daughter will tip the others before she can bring off the 'final solution' for the kids.<br/><br/>The happy Bunker kids are mostly buying Magda's claim the potion being offered them is just a mild sedative. But the suspicious daughter says she doesn't want any and when Magda mildly insists, it doesn't work. Mother and chemist who mixed the heady brew have to force this daughter to drink it. A few minutes later Magda is shown placing a cyanide pills in each child's mouth and manipulating mandibles so the pill is crushed and does its work. The audience fears the recalcitrant daughter will awaken and put up a fight over the cyanide. We can tell Magda is worried too. But the reluctant daughter goes like the others.<br/><br/>Magda goes outside the children's room and slinks to the floor in relief at having completed her gruesome task. The less courageous husband Joseph approaches and they play a few hands of cards while contemplating their own last moments.<br/><br/>There are moral witnesses of all stripes to provide points-of-view of these events in the bunker. There is a humane doctor who opts for life and who is the main positive image in the film. Frau Jung, the stenographer who escapes with her life, is billed second to Hitler but is mostly a wide-eyed spectator with no opinion of events as they occur. At the end of the film, the real stenographer makes an appearance on film regretting her complicity while she worked for Hitler.<br/><br/>Albert Speer, Generals Jodl and Keitel, Martin Boorman, Eva Braun, a veritable party animal, and assorted Nazis and non-Nazis come and go as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>Der Fuhrer and others remonstrate with one another about the failures of the Reich, the German people, assorted generals. Heinrich Himmler, who attempts to surrender without permission, is believed a traitor. Eva's brother-in-law, whose wife, Eva's sister, is about to give birth, pays the ultimate price for disloyalty to Hitler. Eva begs for his life to no avail.<br/><br/>The Germans have an oafishness to their language and comportment that is often considered funny by other Europeans and Americans. They are often pictured as drunkards, party animals and perpetual Octoberfesters. The Downfall is heavy on the oafishness. I think the Germans are like that, but, in context, it is a good thing. They are not as cynical as other Westerners. They are more soulful and serious.<br/><br/>Downfall is a sad movie. The Audience finds itself on the side of many members of the Third Reich hierarchy. It is possible to feel degrees of sorriness for Adolph, Eva, even Goebbels and his wife.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this film. A multi-part TV series made with the same degree of seriousness would be a hit around the world."

","Being English, I have a natural disposition to avoid foreign language films, because reading subtitles is a bit of a chore and I'm sure I'm missing out on some of the finer nuances of the dialogue. Nevertheless, after seeing this movie, I almost want to learn German so I can go back and watch this movie without having to worry about subtitles. Not since Europa Europa and Das Boot have I been so impressed with the depth and scope of film making as I have been after Downfall(Der Untergang). Bruno Ganz' performance is just mesmerising and I, like others have said, really did start to believe that Ganz really was Hitler. Support cast were top notch as well. Unmissable. Some may have noticed Rolf Kanies(General der Infanterie Hans Krebs) also appeared in the German-Canadian scifi, Lexx as President Reginald J. Priest."
"diand_","6","5","11","29 July 2005"," The fall and decline of the Third Reich
","The whole story of Hitler's downfall is told through the eyes of his former secretary Traudl Junge. It starts with her selection, and while another woman born and raised in Berlin is dismissed in an instant, she is chosen because of her Bavarian background (Hitler was born in Austria, not far from Bavaria). She died in 2002 and in the documentary I'm toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin / Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary she is interviewed and the script of Der Untergang / Downfall is also based on that interview. The problem I have with her is that I just can not believe her naivety. Yes, she admits in the end of Der Untergang (taken from that documentary) that she should have known better. But I personally still believe that she knew better but went along and this movie and the documentary suggest there are some people defending or at least believing her.<br/><br/>This is the most expensive German production ever made and it shows. Especially the sound and sound editing works impressive as we have the bombing and fighting always going on in the foreground or background. Every time a person considers the bunker as an ordinary place to live, a sound (loud or soft) can be heard. The confined space within the bunker is also what makes this work with the opportunity to make shots of the long central hall where a lot of drama can be viewed with a distant camera-eye. By letting the viewer spend such amount of time in the bunker the restrictions and drama becomes only clearer. The war outside is used to create the contrast with the relative tranquility within and to show the difference between the suffering of the people and the madman inside that never once cared for them in the end. But the action outside is too sketchy, most characters are anonymous so it makes it hard to identify with any of them. This isn't on the level of Saving Private Ryan, by now the standard for war movies.<br/><br/>With Hirschbiegel's background as TV-man this is a well made documentary dressed as fiction, but that alone does not make cinema. There are a couple of scenes that reach that level: Speer shown in the end in front of one of his own neo-classical buildings, a boy walks from a battle scene and we hear gunfire only to find out seconds later it is the typewriter of the secretary, the readings of the letters of the females intertwined with the suicidal deaths of a male and female SS-soldier.<br/><br/>The fall of empires never comes unexpectedly, and although such regimes do not disappear in an instant, they ultimately dissolve in a few days. As the end nears, Hitler is shown increasingly as an idiot losing all sense for reality and giving random orders, appointments, and still decorating soldiers. The only thing important to him is dog-like loyalty. From his loyal followers we see a range of reactions: From the true believer Goebbels, sacrificing his whole family and his own forces, to the pragmatic Himmler, the loyal (but not to every price) Speer and the human Schenck.<br/><br/>Hitler did what the Germans demanded from him. He was a simple man with a humble background and limited capabilities who luckily failed in what he tried to accomplish. He saw Stalin as more ruthless, which to an extent is historically true, although their atrocities are of the same proportions.<br/><br/>This movie stays close to the known facts, and is therefore interesting as a history lesson. But for those familiar with all facts this is only an annotation, and for those not familiar it lacks a proper introduction in all the characters. Unfortunately it may send the wrong message: showing Hitler (perfectly acted by Bruno Ganz) as just a human being (soft spoken, animal lover and a vegetarian, all true by the way) it may be an attractive document for neo-Nazis too. So, to what end was this made, because there could be a somewhat stronger message like Hirschbiegel's Das Experiment has."

","Suddenly you are face to face with Adolf Hitler. He is in his subterranean fortress, the 'bunker', inside Berlin, surrounded by all his dear ones. Eva Braun, whom he marries just before they both commit suicide. His dog who is also doomed to die. The same as Goebbels and his family which includes seven kids. They have to die because Frau Goebbels does not think that it is worth living in a future without National Socialism. And, of course, there is Traudl Junge, his secretary, who manages to escape in the last moment, and who will later testify to an astonished and bewildered world that all these incredible things have really happened <br/><br/>Baffled you are in each and every moment of this film which lasts 155 minutes, a time which passes in a twinkling. Okay, you hadn't been born, some sixty years ago, but you have read lots of things, you know more or less all the details. And you have also forgotten about it, for plenty of years you have tried to bury the past. Although you live in Germany you were eager to make yourself believe that all Nazis were dead, that 'this' won't ever happen again. After all, Hitler was just an aberration, an accident of nature. Just a monster of the past which bears no meaning for our modern times.<br/><br/>Then you are right in front of him, as if you were just another member of his dinner party, listening to his xenophobic viewpoints, shaking your head in disbelief. It is pure authenticity, there are none of the effects that show you that this is just a movie. And then suddenly you see the human face of the devil, you become aware of the fact that this monster shows feelings such as anger and affection, and that he behaves in a perfectly normal fashion: caressing his dog, praising the cook for the spaghettis she prepared, and so on.<br/><br/>Those who hadn't been living in the times of the Nazi Reich always tended to put the blame for the atrocities committed in the name of Hitler on the fact that he was simply 'inhuman'. But what is humanity anyway? Does this not also imply that there is a dark side in ourselves, and that in special circumstances everybody might be prone to be such a devil?<br/><br/>A man like Hitler is by no means just the product of a peculiar waywardness of history that is dead and buried now. As a German you should be especially sensitive to a possible reawakening of Nazi ideologies of every shade. Recent developments show you that the resurrected devil is just outside the door. In the region where I live, the Ore Mountains, elections were held some weeks ago, and a Neonazi list gained about 12 per cent of all the votes, nourishing themselves predominantly from the young. Although the arts have never really led to but a slender change of people's awareness, 'Der Untergang' is a fair try and has appeared just in time to counteract a dangerously destructive tendency in our society."

","Usually I don't write a comment. Especially not when it's a good movie, because everybody sees something slightly else in it. But since I'm quite outraged about this one, I needed to write something. Hitler with human traits, sure I can see that. Fair enough, this makes it all the more worrying, if he's human, we all are able to make the same horrific mistakes. Great acting performances by basically everyone. No problem there. But.... Hitler and Goebbels are the two rotten apples in the basket the movie seems to be telling us. And Goebbels (the brilliant intellectual who re-invented propaganda) is depicted as a loyal moron dog. Ein ""voll-idiot"" as they may say in German. The rest of the bunker crowd are either loyal but stupid, or realists who have cowardice as their biggest vice. The last ones are all depicted as people who want to talk some sense in this raving megalomaniac, as people who want to save the German population, but in the end were not able to stand up against big uncle Adolf. They meant so well after all.... To me, it came across as a feel-good movie, there were 2 madman (and a couple of loyal wives and secretaries), but the rest wasn't so bad after all, really. We can all go to bed safely now. Sure, a lot of Germans (most probably, in fact)were not responsible for the atrocities that went on, but to claim the same for the bunker crowd is stretching it. They too were human, bound to make mistakes, yes, but here most of them are almost angel material, cowardly angels, stupid angels, but nevertheless...........a sad, very sad story indeed...."

There has been a lot of investment into getting good actors and impressive sets. The bunker scenes are shot with low camera angles and in a greenish light. There is not a weak link in this film.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz (actually Swiss) gives the performance of his life as Hitler, and Alexandria Maria Lara (Romanian) plays the role of Traudi Junge as his secretary, on whose book the film was based.<br/><br/>Given the lasting impact on world history of this brief period in central Europe, this film should be required viewing for everyone.

","Traudl Junge, the final secretary for Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz), tells of the Nazi dictator's final days in his Berlin bunker at the end of WWII.<br/><br/>The difficulty of any film focused on Germany during World War II is how to portray the humanity of the people without sympathizing with the Nazi cause. One does not want to make Hitler out to be human (although he was), but it is also unfair to paint an entire country as monsters.<br/><br/>The Hollywood cliché is that German soldiers were cruel and ruthless, but were they? Here we have Hitler's secretary, who saw much of the last days. If anyone can be said to be both inside the circle and yet innocent, it is her. If we are to believe the real Traudl Junge, such decisions as regarded concentration camps were never made known to her. She was a secretary, but apparently not typing up the most terrible documents."
"richardv-johnson","10","2","3","5 November 2005"," Devastating, necessary, and very brave
","A highlight of the Russian art exhibit at the Guggenheim is a propaganda picture of Stalin and other Soviet leaders (some, like Bukharin, about to be purged) smiling and greeting an exemplary worker. It's very large and somehow comic and shocking at the same time. It's very hard to imagine a picture of Hitler and the Nazi elite ever being displayed like that, even 100 years from now. Possibly Stalin and Mao were responsible for more deaths than Hitler, certainly of their own people, and they were no less insane, especially in their final years. Maybe because they died still in power, they've never been dramatized as Hitler has been so many times. The Alec Guiness Last 10 Days of Hitler covered much the same ground as Der Untergang, but Bruno Ganz has outdone any previous portrayals. This film is relentless in making the audience experience life in the bunker and also in the streets of Berlin above. Josef and Magda Goebbels have never been so real and frightening. Eva Braun has never seemed so frantic and pathetic. It took great courage for German filmmakers to approach this subject so honestly. Ironically, while war-torn Warsaw in The Pianist was recreated on a Berlin sound-stage, it appears from the final credits that the Berlin of Der Untergang was shot in St. Petersburg. This is a great antidote to the Russian film Moloch, made at Berchtesgaden, which made the Nazis clowns instead of monsters. Stupid and banal they were, but not funny. Charles Chaplin said that if he had known about the death camps he would have never made The Great Dictator. There is no comic relief, nor any tragic dignity either, in this harrowing and graphic account of the end of an evil tyranny."

","'we never forced the people,' Mr. Goebbels said. 'they chose us.' Now is the time for them to die for their choices.
This, in my view, is at the heart of the German tragedy. It's just that the target of the culprit is so recognizable that people can easily shift the blame to them, making them more visible and visible. But good deeds may be done incognito, the rights of the people may be exercised by their representatives, but evil cannot be hidden or accounted for by their representatives. Hitler, as a human being, must have a human side; Since people are human beings, they must also have a bestiality. So Hitler could be the ""uncle"" of the little goebbels, and every bit of nazism in Germany could be combined to launch a powerful anti-semitic machine.
It's not a matter of ""cheating"" to cover up. 'but they're people,' says Grace to her father in dogtown. 'people have weaknesses.' The iron-faced father replied, so they have to pay for what they did. Von trier's technique is not only to save money, when all obstacles do not exist, when all the behavior of people are naked in front of each other, can not avoid, human nature no longer hide. When Grace was first raped, the residents of dog town went about their business as usual. The evil of transparency makes all calm absurd and disguised. What if those invisible walls really do not exist? What if the crime was exposed in broad daylight? Would things be different? Or do they really or pretend they don't? When it became an open secret that every man would go to Grace's room for the night, where did their eyes look? God is merciful, he let us learn to block. How many human weaknesses, cowardice, selfishness, cruelty are prevented by the four walls, avoid the test, the blame and the loss, so that we can continue to dress up to play their role, to god as an innocent good man.
But are we? Are we really good people? Are we worthy of our own moral and conscience?
'no one forced me to do this,' Traudl Junge says in the opening credits. 'it was my choice to go to Berlin.' At the end of the film, she added: I finally know, young, is not an excuse.
'I don't blame them,' Grace told her father. 'they've done their best in their environment.' 'if I lived in this environment, I couldn't do it any better,' she added.
If that is all, the hope that remains in Pandora's box really does not deserve to be possessed by humans.
Mankind deserves, perhaps, only the towering flood of god.
In von trier's box, too, was a spirit of hope. The bright moon like god's searchlight, let Grace clear out the reality of the dog town. She said to her father, they did their best, but it wasn't good enough, it wasn't good enough.
So the child was killed in front of the mother, the house was burned, the sky was red.
Hope had never been an angel, and the deal with morpheus was the only way out.
Someone is bound to accuse the director of suppressing violence with violence. But Grace has tried. The purity of the virgin can indeed infect and change people. However, they have their limits. They always come to a screeching halt before the dividing line.
Von trier just did what god wanted him to do. If god had the atom bomb, there might be no need for a flood"

","It's been almost seventy years since the end of Second World War and Nazi German regime . Dozens of flims has been made on WW II but none can match the class of Downfall .<br/><br/>The flims is all about last ten days of Nazi Germany and Adolf Hitler . Yes , Hitler , who perhaps is the most hated and evil human ever born . The flim cuts all the nonsense out and directly shows what actually happened as if you are watching a documentry . Downfall takes place almost entirely inside the bunker beneath Berlin where Adolf Hitler and his inner circle spent their final days, and died. It ventures outside only to show the collapse of the Nazi defense of Berlin, the misery of the civilian population and the burning of the bodies of Hitler, Eva Braun, and Joseph and Magda Goebbels. For the rest, it occupies a labyrinth of concrete corridors, harshly lighted, with a constant passage back and forth of aides, servants, guards, family members and Hitler's dog .<br/><br/>Based on the book 'Inside Hitler's Bunker' by Joachim Fest and 'Until the Final Hour' by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller , this flim has shown the horror of Nazi regime as well as the despondency of Hitler. The great thing about this movie is you can actually see a person or persons who have undergone a process of dehumanization and indoctrination that at the time point of the movie is irreversible . Hitler makes it very clear in several occasions that he chose to construct himself as such a person , and in the end nearly deiulisional , unable to separate his fatherland from his own persona , but remaining such a human being where he is not concerned about the matter of his civilians . On the whole you could see masses brainwashed by propaganda , blindly following Hitler even after knowing the possible outcome .<br/><br/>The violence and depression of the films goes beyond Dark as the scene comes where Magda Gobbles cooly poisons her own children rather than let them live in a world without Hitler's national socialism .<br/><br/>The film begins in eyes of Traudl Junge portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara , where she has been recruited as Hitler's personal secretary and later (as shown in the clip) how she fells about all that . Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler is perhaps the best portrayal of Hitler as well as any historical personal . What a spectacular performence he has given , specially on those scenes where Hitler outbursts in rage and takes it out on his generals . Each and every charecter is played with sheer brilliance by the actors . Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels , Christian Berkel as Prof. Dr. Schenck are only few to name . Those briliant acting performances keeps the audience attached with the movie for two and half hours .<br/><br/>We all know the outcome , we all know how it ended yet the director Oliver Hirschbiegel keeps the pace for each and every second . The fall of thrid recih , the vilonlense and casualties of war is shown perfectly. Without a doubt Downfall , originally titled 'Der Untergang' ,is a brave attempt and successfully carried out by the cast ."

They were tricked into following a madman; they simply ate up the rhetoric he was spewing without a second thought until it was too late to really do anything.

","While this film is a fictionalized version of the events that marked the final days of Berlin and the Nazi leadership, it is clear that Producer Bernd Eichinger wanted to make the movie as historically accurate as possible, while still perceiving traditional movie making elements. The film uses historical accounts of people who were actually in the bunker with Hitler during his final days, such as Albert Speer, and Hilter's secretary, Traudl Junge.<br/><br/>The film and the storytelling elements were overall very impressive. There was never a dull moment throughout the entire run time. Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler, does an impressive job at portraying a madman who becomes out of touch with reality, and who's mental state alternates between unrealistic hopefulness and impeding, certain doom.<br/><br/>The producer and director do not hold back in showing the shocking brutality that occurred in the final days of Berlin while it was still controlled, to some degree or another, by the Nazis. There are many shocking and intense scenes that depicted the fanatical last stands of Hitler's last supports, the mass despair and hardships of the population, and the decent of a city into absolute chaos and destruction."

"Aylmer","8","1","1","16 December 2018"," History performed with lightning... makes me wish there was more of its kind
","The last 10 days of the 3rd Reich has been fodder for plenty of films over the years, easy to make a 3-act structure around and showcase the fascinating final days of a corrupt dictator losing touch with reality. It's easy too fall into the realm of cliche with every character in one form or another having to cope with the fact that within a few days, nothing in their lives will ever be the same again... their system of government, their jobs, their family life, their society. Everything is soon to end.<br/><br/>Compared with THE BUNKER (1981) and HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS (1973), this film feels much more ""real"". Similarly with the others, it makes Albert Speer the natural voice of reason but strangely enough also puts Hermann Fegelein in this role once Speer leaves. Traudl Junge, though very much of Hitler's entourage, serves as the center of the film's point of view, giving the audience someone to side with due to her pure naivety.<br/><br/>Good narrative technique here showcases some truly spectacular performances, principally Bruno Ganz as Hitler. He doesn't quite capture Hitler's look as well as Alec Guinness and his voice sounds too raspy and high-pitched, but his mannerisms and commitment to the part are truly a part to behold. He plays his role not of a screaming tyrant (like Anthony Hopkins) but of a human being exhibiting both the ego-driven confidence of a superstar yet the panicked tantrums of a 4-year-old when he does't get his way. Of all the historical films I've seen, this is the most difficult in which to forget that I'm just watching a movie and haven't been somehow transported magically back to the past no matter how many times I've seen it.<br/><br/>The main rewatchability for me now comes from anaylzing the supporting players, all of Hitler's generals and ""friends"" who stuck by his side to the end. Some, such as Jodl, Mohkne, and Speer were more clear-thinking, while others such as Goebbels had likely lost touch with reality even more-so. It's fascinating to see how people cope with their world crumbling in around them, helpless to do much about it, yet at the same time obeying the rules of their corrupt system and worshiping tyrants who made their own megalomania and insanity that much clearer by the day. In a rarity for films of this kind, a few characters belonging to the SS (namely Mohnke and Schenk) are even given a sympathetic portrayal trying to save lives and end unnecessary bloodshed, giving this film authenticity in terms of presenting the events in moral shades of grey as opposed to black and white.<br/><br/>That said, DOWNFALL shuffles a lot of historical events around for sake of its narrative which bothered me. Goering, for instance, sent his telegram prior to Hitler's birthday and the shelling of Berlin by the Soviets. Fegelein was arrested prior to Himmler's ""betrayal"" too and events only played out vaguely in the chronology that the film presents. I suppose that is one of the greatest difficulties of making a historical film; accurately conveying causality and fairness to historical characters while at the same time keeping things interesting to the audience."

It's a psychological movie about human nature, power and a sense of unity which can carry people beyond total madness.

","""Downfall"" takes you into Hitler's bunker during the fall of the third Reich and the last ten days of the battle for Berlin. This historical docudrama spends its time examining one of history's most enigmatic and inscrutable dictators as he descend into paranoia to the bewilderment of his inner circle and, in particular, one young woman stenographer who, in real life, survived the war and published her memoirs providing one of the few historical records of that time and place. The film is well done as a stand alone dramatic presentation. However, it excels as an historical drama by providing insights into Hitler's last days; something never dealt with in such detail before in film. An engrossing 2.5 hour watch with a splendid performance by Bruno Ganz as Hitler. Who better to make such a film than the Germans? Bravo. (B+)"
"fwmurnau","10","4","9","28 March 2005"," The best World War 2 epic ever?
","Let me echo others in saying I know no greater film about World War 2. DOWNFALL is so brilliantly conceived, so perfectly written and acted, and so uncompromisingly probing and honest, it makes SAVING PRIVATE RYAN look adolescent by comparison.<br/><br/>It's miraculous how DOWNFALL avoids the easy answers and typical agendas one finds in books and films about this period, opting to show all sides of one of history's most dramatic and troubling episodes. The bloodiest war in human history is grinding to a close, and YOU ARE THERE. Modern parallels abound ... something very much like this probably happened in Iraq, as Saddam held on till the bitter end.<br/><br/>The film's use of violence is truly commendable -- there is exactly enough to grip and shock us, where appropriate, but never the gratuitous gore-for-its-own sake that one finds even in Spielberg's battle scenes.<br/><br/>DOWNFALL recalls Woodrow Wilson's reaction to Griffith's BIRTH OF A NATION: ""it's like writing history with lightning."" The writing and the acting, especially Bruno Ganz's towering, fully-dimensional portrait of Hitler, should win every award there is. Previous film Hitlers have been paper tigers, melodramatic villains, but Ganz gives us a complex, living, breathing human being -- which makes him all the more frightening.<br/><br/>Bravo to everyone who had a hand in producing this masterpiece!"

","This was one of the most brilliant war films I have ever seen in my life. The description and portrayals of the Reich are one of absolute shocking madness, and what a performance by Bruno Ganz. It could be so easy to make a mockery, or comical, or over the top performance, but no. When you see Ganz up on screen you are literally staring into madness, you really think it's ""him"".<br/><br/>Amazingly executed, wonderfuly crafted, insanely scripted by the demons that only ""der Fhurer"" could provide, der Untergang is a flat out MASTERPIECE.<br/><br/>Nobody in this film is sympathetic, that is beyond obvious. The greatest thing this film shows (ecspecially those people who are it's detractors) how his followers so blindly led him and were gutless to stop anything, so much so that when Magda murders her 6 children it becomes the most powerful scene on film I have witnessed in many years.<br/><br/>A MUST SEE!!"

I was so riveted to the screen that I forgot all about them.<br/><br/>I also cannot believe that I have a sense that it was perhaps the best acting I've ever seen! And I don't even know German! There were no lulls or downers in this movie at all. I looked forward to EVERY scene and every thread of the story. The effects were amazing and I was left with the impression that painstaking attention was paid to reflect actual events.<br/><br/>One very slight caution: If you are going to see this movie and you don't know anything about World War 2 or Hitler then you might be a little confused. The movie ""skips over"" much of the war to focus on the last days of Berlin. There is a rich representation of the personalities but if you don't know your history you might not catch all of the nuances. The movie picks up on a war ""well underway"".<br/><br/>NOTE: This is NOT a negative at all in my opinion.

The movie is very psychological, you never are bored, although everybody knows how it finishes.<br/><br/>I was much impressed by the actor that plays Hitler, showing this person as a bit ""schizophrenic"": he changes his mind from despair to great hope although most generals know how it will finish.<br/><br/>You really feel yourself as one of the generals and thinking ""What should I say to this crazy Hitler now ? If I tell the truth he will become mad and if I lie saying everything goes alright, I and my family will be killed""<br/><br/>You see also the complete fanatic Nazis and SS that take Hitler like their god (Goebbels, his wife, the SS officers...)<br/><br/>You feel the cruelty and absence of mercy of Hitler, although he sometimes shows some humanity and gentleness to women and to the fidel generals. ""If I die, all Germans deserve to die too"" - ""all the strong Aryans are dead in combat, so all the weak (remaining civilians in Berlin) should die too"" <br/><br/>The play of the actresses (Eva Braun, the secretary, the wife of Goebbels) is impressive too.<br/><br/>Brrrrrr, what a terrible guy Hitler (and the SS) were.<br/><br/>Did you know that all future SS soldiers received a dog for their 14 year old and had to kill the dog when they were 16 !

","set design, special effects, makeup, costumes etc. are flawless and excellently done, technically this is a formidable movie.<br/><br/>it can be a little difficult to understand and follow the plot - especially in the beginning - if you don't know the entourage in the bunker and all the other characters (speer, schenk, fegelein, weidling, mohnke et al). but contrary to some critics in Germany i don't think this film is long-winded. the more you know about the background the more you discover in each scene.<br/><br/>bruno ganz did an outstanding job portraying Hitler. what a feeling it must be to impersonate this man - and to force yourself to give him the full set of human emotions, to play someone like Hitler as a human being, not as a stereotyped monster. an achievement for which ganz deserves great respect.<br/><br/>alas, he sometimes exaggerates. if you listen to Hitler's ""tischgespraeche"" you can tell that ganz overdid Hitler's voice, tonality and accent. this was annoying and produced some comical / awkward situations and suppressed laughter in the cinema where i watched the movie.<br/><br/>***mild spoilers in the next paragraph***<br/><br/>many scenes, especially magda goebbels poisoning her kids, Hitler crying or freaking out or the scenes of frantic drinking and feasting were very disturbing and emphasized the mood of the whole film: dire hopelessness on the verge of madness. <br/><br/>although historians and contemporary witnesses praise the exactness of ""der untergang"" we should not forget that this is a movie, not a documentary. read ""der untergang"" by fest to learn about the dramatic/storytelling freedoms the filmmakers took. in my opinion though, and taking into account previous picturization, this movie is as close to reality as it gets.<br/><br/>what is the goal of this movie? its intention? this movie can help you visualize and realize the surreal situation in these last days of the war. you probably read or heard about it somewhere already, what occurred in those days, how Hitler managed to keep his generals in control, how the German soldiers kept this madness going. i think this movie helps you get a glimpse of a situation that is beyond comprehension - even for the people who witnessed it. <br/><br/>critics warned or asked whether this movie makes you sympathize with Hitler or the top military and nazi leaders. whether it makes you feel sorry for ""the fuehrer"" because the movie succeeds in portraying him as a human being. whether the movie tries to play down the atrocities of WWII and the nazi regime. i have at no time felt that this film tries to reduce or shift guilt and responsibility. although you might be touched by Hitler's suffering and feeling of betrayal the movie never let's you forget what Hitler (and the Nazis and the military) planned, perpetrated and thought. pity you might feel, but not for Hitler. and when the lights turn on in the movie theater you'll feel like someone punched you in the stomach - and that's definitely not sympathy.<br/><br/>that they show Hitler as a human being is important, so is this movie. it shows that we have to see behind the curtain. because even the most evil tyrant can behave like a decent man - if it suits him. because evil can appear in the disguise of an alluring, simpler solution. this is a lesson we have to preserve for the future."
"rollotomasei","10","4","9","7 September 2004"," ""Der Untergang"" - maybe the best German movie about their darkest chapter
","This morning I had the opportunity of seeing ""Der Untergang"" in a press preview. ""Der Untergang"" gives us an inside look of the last days of Adolf Hitler and his surrounding staff in the ""FÃ¼hrerbunker"" in Berlin.<br/><br/>The story is told through the eyes of his 22-years-old secretary Traudl Junge who was like many other Germans fascinated by their leader. The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz gives a very impressive performance as Hitler, he succeeds in showing us the ""normal"" man and not only the evil monster.<br/><br/>But the movie not just focuses on this one man, it makes very clear that Hitler was supported by many other important men and women.<br/><br/>Most part of the dialog is authentic, the atmosphere in the bunker is very realistic, almost claustrophobic ( like in Petersons ""Das Boot"" ).<br/><br/>The permanent sound of the exploding bombs, that indicate the arriving of the Russian Army, gives the viewer a feeling of being him/ herself inside the bunker. But the main achievement of the movie is that it reflects the microcosmo of different characters of the Third Reich, all impressive played by the leading German actors. The script gives us no main characters we could identify with. ""Der Untergang"" is maybe the best German movie about their darkest chapter of History."
"Rawal_Afzal","10","3","6","1 October 2015"," A masterpiece! Right amongst my top war films!
","Let me first of all begin by stating that Bruno Ganz's performance as Hitler is in my book the greatest ever from amongst those based upon historic personalities. It is mind-blowing, brilliantly fantastic! The way he adopts Hitler's accent, the way he talked in general, the way he angrily reacts to every news of doom, is all out of the world. I in particular liked his acting in the scene where he discovers about Himmler's ""treason"". Pure brilliance, that scene. Knowing the German language of course lands me in a position to comment on these factors, as the dubbed English version of the film would have taken taken all these factors out of the equation, sadly.<br/><br/>The film in general is one great depiction of the last day events. So far it is easily the best German film that I have watched. One great thing was that it makes you get a good feel of the war, the things happening out there. For the whole two hours or so I really felt to have been living in 1945 in Germany. It was at times laughable to see Hitler sticking to his belief that they were closer and closer to winning the war, and then of course were there his generals who could clearly see the downfall. It was really interesting to see how different people belonging to two mindsets saw the whole situation differently.<br/><br/>Whereas 'Fury' (2014) for now continues to be my favourite war film, possibly because it was my first ever introduction into ""feel"" factor of the World War II, which is not experienced through extensive reading but through a film, documentary or a drama, this goes down as a film really close to that one in my war films list, very close. The film well and truly deserves to be in the top 250 IMDb films, as it is on number 116 I see."
"Kakueke","8","3","6","21 December 2008"," Deutschland Unter Alles
","Frau Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary, is the focal point of this 2004 German-made Bunker film. She is portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. In her comments at the beginning and end of the film, the real Traudl reflects on the forces that led her to be in the position she was and the immorality of Hitler and the Nazi regime. In the movie, the young Traudl has an innocent and despondent demeanor from the time she was chosen as Hitler's secretary in November 1942 until the end, when she and a group of other Bunker persons have fled, seeking to escape the Russians.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Hirschbiegel does an amazing job in continually making the viewer feel the sense of siege. What is most striking about ""Untergang"" is its graphic realism. All the scenes of shells dropping bring the viewer there, as if the viewer is experiencing it. In one scene, officers and other Nazis are dancing and making merry in the Old Reich Chancellery (connected to the Bunker by a tunnel) and a wall is blown up by a shell. This is a true story per Traudl's account. The realism of ""Saving Private Ryan"" may have come a few years before, but in urban battle scenes that use darker colors, military green, and grayish shading, Hirschbiegel makes things interesting in his own way, very vivid. Furthermore, he presents a number of scenes involving the wounded awaiting or undergoing medical treatment, including amputations, that are very graphic and gruesome. There was plenty of morphine available, but other medical supplies were scarce.<br/><br/>As for the characters, the Germans are divided between fanatical Nazis and those who are reasonable, those who have compassion for people suffering from the physical agonies of war. One of the central figures is Dr. Ernst-Gunter Schenck, played by Christian Berkel. He serves to symbolize the force of reason, as he objects to evacuations of installations and supplies that victimize remaining civilians, seeks morphine and other medical supplies, and questions the meaningless honorable-death mindset of remaining fanatical Nazis. Bur realities are remaining fanatics, wandering terrorized civilians, and the agonizing wounded. The scenes showing the human suffering serve to accentuate the evils of Hitler. He chose to commit suicide to avoid capture by the Russians, so he would not have to experience what everyone else was suffering through. In the meantime, many young German children, which could include females, were serving militarily and being killed or mutilated.<br/><br/>Hitler is played by Bruno Ganz. He is the ranter devoid of reason with whom most people are familiar. Ganz is a more wrinkled Hitler than in real life, but he does a good job with the mannerisms, the ravings, and the tremors. He is a totally evil person, as shown in his demand to implement a scorched earth policy even though it would leave German civilians without any necessities. That is on top of his lecture on the savagery of apes, who trample on outsiders; Hitler says humans should learn to be like apes. On this comments board and boards for other Bunker films, it is often noted that the Nazis and others in the Bunker have human feelings and are not totally evil. This observation includes Hitler, who thanks his cooks for things etc. But to me, ""Untergang,"" like other Bunker films, still shows Hitler, Dr. Goebbels, Martin Bormann, and some others as consummately evil, as they should be shown. There are some who seem not to be, military officers or whoever, yet even as they question what Hitler does, they are still loyal. He had a hypnotic effect on people. Even after Hitler refuses Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) the favor of rescinding his order to execute her brother in law, a favor requested with all trappings of emotion, she says, ""You're the Fuhrer."" Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) worships Hitler like her husband does and is willing to kill her seven children and herself to avoid a world without him. A well-acted emotional moment, for right or for wrong, is when she holds Hitler and falls to his feet, before he commits suicide. How sad will be life without Hitler.<br/><br/>One of the final scenes, after Hitler's suicide, involves Traudl in a group of Bunker escapees deciding what to do next. In combat garb, accompanied by a young boy, she is permitted to pass through the Russian lines with the watching Russian soldiers still. I guess it is silly to compare it to ""The Birds,"" for Traudl is not Tippi Hedren. But as in ""The Birds,"" when ""Untergang"" ends the viewer is left with the sense of having been relieved from a siege in a turbulent epic."
"Dwolvesbane","10","3","6","15 December 2008"," How to deal with a monster
","One of the great challenges that an actor can face is in the portrayal of an absolute and uncompromising evil. Such is the challenge faced by many of the actors in Downfall, depicting the final days of the ""Hitler Bunker"" and necessitating portrayals of some of the worst criminals in history, including Heinrich Himmler, Albert Speer, Joseph Goebbels, and of course the arch-devil of National Socialism himself, Adolph Hitler.<br/><br/>And that is precisely what separates this movie from any other on the topic, the utterly amazing portrayal of the world's most brutal of dictators by Bruno Ganz. Ganz's performance takes on depths that very few could imagine, let alone portray, in the character of Hitler. His outlandish and sometimes childishly inappropriate reactions to the crumbling of his empire reveal the deep neurosis suffered by Hitler, while other moments in the film reveal sides of Hitler that many do not know of, such as his vegetarianism and love for animals. Another particularly interesting aspect of Ganz's performance is the open but never mentioned portrayal of Hitler as suffering from Parkinson's disease, a widely supported theory on Hitler's physical appearance and mannerisms in the late stages of the war.<br/><br/>The deeper issues and consequences of many Nazi practices are only mentioned peripherally in the film, which instead focuses on the personal and psychological effects of the dissolution of the Nazi state on both residents of the bunker and of Berlin above. Some of the film's finest scenes deal with the Volkssturm militias of young boys and old men who were hastily armed and organized as a last ditch defense against the Soviets. In dealing with this a very interesting historical moment is portrayed in the film. The last appearance of Hitler on film before his death was at a small ceremony outside of the entrance to the bunker where he gave medals to several young men that had destroyed a soviet tank, and this moment is shown fantastically in the movie.<br/><br/>This film is definitely recommendable to anyone who is interested in the Second World War or even history in general and is sure to stand the test of time as the definitive portrayal of Adolf Hitler."

","Every time during the past decades when we (Germans) got confronted with our past it came down to excuses like it was a different time, different mentality, different political environment. But I believe this movie has finally changed some serious aspects of these confrontations. I don't believe the movie is an admittance of responsibility; it is a display of reality and facts during this dark period of German history.<br/><br/>Still today, generations later, we get punished for our history and there is no denying it; BBC2 for example still allows some of its moderators to display an uncalled for sarcasm and I don't think any German citizen will find this ""funny"".<br/><br/>The movie is an outstanding piece of historical accuracy and displays the typical mindset of the Nazi Party and their leaders. Military recommendations that could still have saved thousands of Soldiers and civilians have been over-turned single handed by a man that had no regard for human life. <br/><br/>The interview with Bruno Ganz (playing Hitler) on DVD shows clearly the conflicts and reservations that most of the actors had. Bruno asked the question: ""How can I display a man that is responsible for killing millions of people?"" Only through great personal strength and psychological intense preparation was he able to pull it off. We need to understand that he is not just playing a bad guy in some fictional Bond movie; this was a real as it gets and he and the entire cast deserve the highest respect for not slipping up into the ""lesser evil"".<br/><br/>I am by all means no film critic but I know how my fellow country men felt over the past decades when confronted with German history during the Nazi period. So my hopes and wishes go out to people who are watching this must see movie with the result to closely observe a truthful piece of never forgotten German history - and perhaps draw some conclusions when applying judgment to anyone, not just the Germans.<br/><br/>One of the great messages of this movie is the display of psychological manipulation, so always be aware; it happened in the past and could happen again. Some people might disagree with that statement but just take a look in the mirror and consider the objectives in your life, and what would you be willing to do to achieve that? The Nazis where (bad) humans with a motive and the means to achieve their objectives. But so was Stalin and the communists and so is Osama Bin Laden......do I need to continue? <br/><br/>I give this movie a 10 for the acting and the political accuracy and I'm sure it will find a place in some school history lessons. If newer generations take valid lessons from this movie then it achieved at least one goal - it will make them think for themselves....and not just follow an idea with blind folds."

No one race or nation on the face of the planet is free of the guilt that is displayed in this film, but it takes humility and courage to make plain to everyone that what was done to a nation, the world, and to select groups of people is the result of misplaced trust in false leaders. What remains is a national scar or cross to bear, if you will, that will not go away for some time. I think parallels could be drawn to contemporary issues and global concerns.

The story is told from his side, for a change, and gradually unveils the incredibly poignant story of his downfall. Everybody knows of the things he's done, so his crimes are hardly mentioned and never dwelled upon. Instead we see Hitler's mental deterioration as the war front grows closer and closer to his bunker. He must face something he's never had to face before: defeat. Bruno Ganz gives one of my favorite male performances of all time as Hitler. Not only does he physically resemble the notorious leader, but he also possesses the same assertiveness and odd mix of anger and fear which brings the character to life. The film is also sandwiched between actual footage from an interview with Traudl Junge (Hitler's personal secretary) which gives the film a firm foundation in reality and an unparalleled emotional core. This film is a masterpiece in every sense."

","Too many times in American film, or any war film, one side is demonized. It is an important movie for Americans who often like to view themselves as flawless heroes. It is always easy to think of Hitler as a monster or to make a parody him. The difficult part is to realize that he was human as well. Even more so, many of the Nazis had a very human struggle and it can be disturbing to some because their plight draws a remarkable resemblance to our own. Because of this, it raises deeper questions that are usually ignored in this genre. Most war movies are bordering on propaganda, but Downfall isn't. It's the best war movie I can ever remember seeing."

Whoever plays Hitler gives an excellent and noteworthy performance. For once Hitler is actually portrayed as a human being, capable of more than just being a fanatical megalomaniac (as he certainly was). What really strikes you in this movie are two things: a.) The total and absolute destruction of the German state Hitler has led his people into (as evidenced by the ongoing Battle of Berlin, fought by fanatical Hitler Youth and aging conscripts b.) The lunacy of the 3rd Reich, the grotesque, twisted mind of Hitler and the hard to comprehend complete obedience he demanded (and received) from his people. <br/><br/>All in all, a very good movie even if your not a history buff.

"oyason","Null","3","6","15 March 2006"," The mass mania and despair of the moment portrayed
","DOWNFALL is an excellent film. There have probably been thousands of films that focus on the Second World War, but almost always the focus on Adolph Hitler is one of demonization of one personality, as opposed to examination of the sickness within mass politics that supported him to begin with. Aside from THE TIN DRUM, I can't think of any other work in recent years that so captures the group mania that hatched the Nazi juggernaut.<br/><br/>But in DOWNFALL, we see the last days of the Third Reich as surely they must have been. We see first the frustrations of a medical bureaucrat (Dr. Schenck/Christian Berkel) who is trying to salvage what remains of civil structure in the midst of chaos, a man who is only in the late days of the war, along with his colleagues, realizing his own duplicity in the nuttiness that surrounds him. I'm not sure if this is a historically accurate depiction of Schenck, or if he is a fictional composite, but I believe it is right to put forward the idea that there were those few rare people even among the ranks of the Nazis who understood that if Germany had a chance to reshape itself, it would depend on such energies. Not far behind this are scenes in which we see Himmler (Ulrich Noetlen) discussing with a colleague how power will be divided once Hitler implodes. Heino Ferch is solid as Albert Speer, one of the survivors who is destined to tell the story of the Third Reich from the inside. Bruno Ganz portrayal of Hitler is one in which we see the charismatic descend into lunacy as the appointment with retribution draws near. <br/><br/>Effective also in their portrayals are Corrinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Ulrich Matthes as the war propagandist Joseph Goebbels, and Julianne Kohler as Eva Braun. Each of these actors represent the despairing mania that prompted the fascist machine among the down and out professional classes to begin with. Their inability to move outside of the extravagance of upper middle class culture is portrayed here in tight style and good form. <br/><br/>But most telling of all are the flashback scenes related by the central character of the story, Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, here portrayed by Alexandra Maria Lara. The movie begins with her job interview in Hitler's office. Hitler is seen through her eyes as the ""loving uncle"" idealist, who indulges her errors, who has hired her for the position because her background is one he connects with out of his romance for his own student days in Munich. Ganz's Hitler isn't the pop-eyed monster from propaganda films, but resembles more closely the guy who brings milk and cheese to your doorstep. Both characterizations reek of what Hannah Arendt called the ""banality of evil"". It is not necessary to sympathize- but I believe the creators of this project are trying to get their audience to understand how easy it could be for an ""advanced"" civilization to crumble into this kind of homicidal delirium. It is a huge undertaking, and while DOWNFALL is far from as comprehensive a movie as one which attempts such a task needs to be, it is an important effort at this moment. Our own time is one in which the professional classes of the western world teeter between a re-awakening of the democratic impulse, and the authoritarian ambitions and imperial designs of late capital. <br/><br/>It may seem ludicrous to some to suggest that the west could actually repeat the experience of fascism, but the prime components for such a movement- lower middle class despair, professional class vanity, national myths, infrastructural decay, are in full throttle in the United States, a country which has always been notoriously inattentive to its own political culture. Sad to say, anything could happen in this world of ""tea parties"" and Obamian new age political cults. <br/><br/>Fascism as a movement emerged out of the violent antipathies of the professional classes of Germany, the despair of the German workforce shattered by world war and economic depression, capitalist culture driven by late junker speculation, and religious and cultural mysticism. DOWNFALL works as a film because it shows us these twisted political fervors and what they do to people. Its focus as a work is less on Hitler's personality then it is on the mass pathology- to use Erich Fromm's phrase- that made such a violent dervish possible. That's why the work is devastating.<br/><br/>The images of Hitler youth, or early teens out fighting Stalin's armies- which, in one of Stalin's rare moments of being on the correct side of history- were administring the death blows to the Nazi mayhem,<br/><br/>the images of Frau Goebbels poisoning her children, these are the essence of fascism, far more so then Hitler's personality. The film focuses on what certain political cultures do to people without becoming a work that is tendentious or ""preachy"". It shows us how it must have been in those last days of the German holocaust. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has given us a powerful gift. It's not one that's easy to open, but it's a lesson from history that has to be confronted earnestly. DOWNFALL provides us with just such a tool."
"paul2001sw-1","10","3","6","4 March 2006"," Portrait of the tyrant as an old man
","Paul Auster once wrote a book, 'The Country of Last Things', about a society where nothing new is ever created, and the people subsist on only an-ever reducing collection of recycled goods. This parable of life without hope has been interpreted by many as an allusion to the concentration camps, but it also serves ably as a stylistic description of Berlin in the last days of the war, as depicted in Oliver Hirschbiegel's superb film 'Downfall'. At the centre of the film is a brilliant performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler, someone who had stripped himself of decency and who here is robbed by defeat first of his charisma, and then of his power, leaving only a vapour of malice and madness clinging to the shell of a man. There are also some interesting portraits of other members of the Nazi inner circle: Speer, dignified but unashamed; Himmler, rational and charmless; and the inhumanly zealous family Goebbels. We also see the life of Hitler's secretaries, who had chosen not to see the truth until it was too late but to do otherwise; one of them (in real life) gives an interview that tops and tails the film. Perhaps the most sympathetic portrayal is that of Eva Braun; her sang-froid, and love of Hitler, are utterly mad but retain some connection with what might be considered admirable qualities in another context.<br/><br/>I recently watched Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist', the best film I have seen about the holocaust, and there is of course a kind of black karma in the way that the Nazi's own fate in ruined Berlin mirrors that of the Jewish heroes of that film, struggling to survive in ruined Warsaw. But the differences are also telling, not just in the way that the Nazis brought their end on themselves, but also in the way that their behaviour, right until the death, has become so utterly divorced from any normal human responses; whereas Polanski's pianist is virtually reduced to his animal essence, the Nazis' twisted idealism seems positively unnatural, yet still believable. Horror films where dozens die at the hands of madmen in confined spaces are ten-a-penny (Hirschbiegel himself has made one, 'The Experiment'); yet this story really happened, and was but a sly coda to the overall war. The awfulness of Hitler's life and actions is perhaps too great for us to truly contemplate; yet in this harrowing picture of his final pathos, Hirshbielgel has made a compelling movie about what happens to humans who forget that they are men."

","I've always been a big fan of WWII movies, and mostly, I've always found Hitler to be one interesting character to read about, I've always wanted to know his motivations that lead him to do all those horrible things. Well I have read a lot about him, and watched a few movies about WWII and about him, and every time I would, they portrayed a Hitler who was more like a killing machine or robot, instead of a human being. Which led me to the question: Why did Germans trust this man? How did a man like that, cold and pure evil, could get the sympathy of a country and become what he became?<br/><br/>In this movie, lots of answers can be found. First of all, Hitler's human, what do you know! A charismatic guy, who sure has his rage outbursts, but who also is a man who laughs, smiles, cries, etc.. For example **********spoilers***********<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, when Traudl would do her ""trial"" for being Hitler's secretary, she kinda messes up and closes her eyes waiting for Hitler to yell at her or something like that. Well no, he acts really good and just tells her to try again. From that point on, I knew this wasn't going to be just ""another Hitler movie"", but something completely different.<br/><br/>********* end of spoiler *******<br/><br/>I loved the acting, Bruno Ganz was terrific, I hate the fact that he wasn't even nominated for an Oscar for best performance. Anyways he's great, completely flawless, great intensity into the character, it's almost like he met Hitler. All the other actors where terrific as well, the music in the movie is great, everything. <br/><br/>2 thumbs up for this movie, the best foreign film of all times for me! (along with Todo Sobre mi madre)"
"djecatepec","10","3","6","18 February 2006"," The best German WW II movie ever....
","For the past 15 years it has been, the news from Germany has been, worrisome to say the least: religious intolerance and oppression, neo-Nazis, racism, xenophobia, especially the constant German comments like ""it was the War, it was a long time ago, its over just leave it alone,"" one begins to wonder if in fact the German people ever really understood the magnitude of the crimes they actually committed against Humanity. Then this movie came out. It is without a doubt the finest German movie about the war ever made. In fact it ranks right alongside with the fantastic Jewish film ""Shindler's List"" as one of the truly definitive ""Nazi-movies"" of all time.<br/><br/>Normally I am so lazy, I just hate watching foreign language films. Even though I am fluently bilingual I have to put the English sub-titles on Spanish movies so I don't have to think too much. Hell, I'm so lazy and DVD-spoiled that I even put the English sub-titles on English movies! When we started the DVD, I was really annoyed. ""German"" its all in ""German!"" What a rip off! Well I have to admit that after watching the whole movie, I wouldn't have wanted to watch it in English after all. Hitler was German, the Germans speak German. Having seen so many movies with terrible doubling here in Mexico and just how much it can cost a movie's authenticity, I think this was a brilliant decision to put it out in German.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is simply spell-binding as Hitler. He makes every single earlier rendition of the man pale in comparison. While he can't quite get the mesmerizing, insane charisma just right, (and no-one ever will,) he hits everything else about the character dead center. This is as Oscar-worthy a performance as Kingley (Gandhi), Brando (Godfather), or Scott (Patton). He makes Adolph Hitler live on the screen for those 2 hours plus, like no other actor ever has before.<br/><br/>Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels is truly compelling as well as really spooky. The personality, the fanaticism, the madness necessary to slaughter your own children rather than allow them to grow up outside of your own self centered, perverse reality is something no true loving parent could comprehend ever, and that is so well captured in the movie. Unlike most American flicks where we would have been subjected to endless drivel and senseless ""psycho-babblings"" to understand the ""mind"" of Magda, this film spares us that and simply shows what she does, its powerful and riveting.<br/><br/>Michael Mendl is also superb in his role of Wehrmacht General Helmuth Weidling. If you want to know how it was that the German military even came close to winning a war in which they were alway seriously outnumbered since the beginning in men, tanks and aircraft, study closely the character of Weidling as portrayed by Mendl, amidst all the whining toadies, hysterical cowards and drunken fools, he storms into Hitler's bunker and announces loudly, ""appearantly I'm to be shot!"" For better of worse, doing his duty to the bitter end, he was the exact type of German officer who made the Wehrmacht the most feared army on the face of the Earth. Great performance.<br/><br/>There are so many others who give great performances as well, its a shame that in English language films we won't get to see many of these superb German actors much in the future. With only a couple of exceptions the casting, scripting and acting was brilliant and really re-created the ""last days."" To some critics who complained about the historical accuracy, as a historian and writer, I have no idea what you are talking about. Compared to the absolute falsity and stupid unnecessary ""glitter"" of the majority American war movies, this was extremely accurate and mostly based on eye-witness accounts.<br/><br/>To the German people: a simply excellent effort and a brilliant look into a dark corner of a terrible past, as a nation, you should be proud of this movie, the best German WW II movie ever..."
"Alex-372","8","3","6","22 January 2006"," Questions About Artistic Freedom And Integrity
","I feel quite ambivalent to the movie Der Untergang. <br/><br/>On the one hand, there is a chilling realism in the way Hitler is portrayed by Bruno Ganz. The war wounds are realistic, unlike the usual Hollywood/War Department movie garbage. <br/><br/>However, there are the apparent historical inaccuracies and cinematic devices. For instance...<br/><br/>1) How innocent was Traudl Junge? Her birth name was Gertrude Humps (no pun intended), and she received the name Junge when she married *SS officer* Hans-Hermann Junge. Considering her age, mustn't she also have been a Jungmaedl (the girl equivalent of the Hitler Youth)? She refers to herself as ""not a fanatical nazi"", but of course, she was a nazi nonetheless. People don't just end up employed in Adolf Hitler's bunker by accident. In the movie, she is taken aback by Hitler's anti-semitism, but she does have an apparent dislike of the Russians - whom the Nazis hated for the same insane and pseudoscientific racist reasons they hated Jews, Gypsies, and most Eastern Europeans. I don't know...<br/><br/>2) At the end of the movie, we see Traudl Junge, played by the gorgeous Alexandra Maria Lara, make her escape by walking through a large group of Russian soldiers. My problem is that it was known that ""every woman in Berlin"" was raped by Russian soldiers. So how did a gorgeous girl with huge eyes, wearing an army helmet with *SS* in huge markings on the side of it, make her way safely through a crowd of drunken, war weary and traumatized Russian troops? The little boy she takes off with didn't exist and is there as a cinematic device, signifying hope? Traudle Junge cycles off with him into the future, when in reality she was sent to a Russian prison camp. <br/><br/>3) How plausible is it that a top level nazi ""just didn't know""? I don't buy it. To quote Traudl Junge, ""We should listen to the voice of conscience. It does not take nearly as much courage as one might think to admit to our mistakes and learn from them. Human beings are in this world to learn and to change themselves in learning."" But the German Socialists knew the Nazis were scum - so did the Communists, Humanists, etc. I'm sure they didn't understand fully how crazy Hitler was, how far he would go in carrying out his ideas, etc. But they knew he was bad news, even back in the thirties. <br/><br/>4) The Timeline. Traudl Junge became Hitler's personal secretary in 1942, two years _before_ her SS officer husband was killed. And yet, she is presented as a wide eyed innocent, who doesn't really believe in nazism, and is picked by Hitler in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason. The movie never obviously flashes forward three years to Hitler's last hours in the bunker in 1945. <br/><br/>I think the movie needed at least one sympathetic character, and either the director or Junge herself played up her innocence."

"aliasanythingyouwant","Null","3","6","18 September 2005"," Hitler Made Human
","Adolf Hitler is the villain of villains, the embodiment of all that's evil for several generations of Westerners both educated and not. He is a symbol of everything vile, bigoted, insanely murderous - and yet we mustn't forget that he was also a human being. To put it in rather simple-minded terms, even Adolf Hitler was once a baby, was once innocent. And to have once been innocent means he must have had the potential to be something other than evil - if not good than at least innocuous, at least harmless. Unless you're a believer in pre-destiny, you must acknowledge that even Hitler had a chance to be something other than history's most famous genocidal maniac; even Hitler could've grown up to be a normal middle-class man with a wife and family, a law-abiding nobody. And it's precisely this fact that one must keep in mind while watching Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall, a film that seeks to strip away the symbolism, the veneer of myth and get at something of the real Hitler.<br/><br/>There are some who might not want the real Hitler - they might prefer the symbol; it's much easier to hate a symbol than a man - and frankly it's hard to blame them. Who really wants to understand a man so twisted, so driven by insane ideology, by unyielding will? But these are the things that make Hitler interesting, that make Hirschbiegel's take on him compelling. Hirschbiegel gives us a Hitler who is simply unwilling to accept anyone's notion of reality but his own. His advisors tell him the war is going badly but he refuses to believe it; he insists his doomed generals will pull their armies together and push the Russians out of Berlin (the film begins with the city about to fall). When someone tells him news he doesn't like he gets insanely angry, clenching his fists and throwing tantrums like a baby. Does Hirschbiegel mean to suggest that Hitler was some kind of overgrown child, an extreme case of arrested development? He certainly makes a case for Hitler being prone to infantilism; the tantrums reach a level of ferocity that is frightening and absurd, a grown man's version of beating your head against the floor. Some may find this a tad irreverent, portraying Hitler as a childish drama-queen, and yet this is exactly how the character comes across, and on the terms Hirschbiegel sets it is entirely appropriate. This is no in-depth psychoanalysis - Hirschbiegel knows this approach would yield only tedium. Rather than cracking Hitler open, Hirschbiegel seeks to portray as honestly as possible his outward behavior, the signs, if not the causes, of his psychosis.<br/><br/>Hirschbiegel hasn't created a great psychological study or brilliant moral treatise, he has simply taken one of history's most infamous figures and made of him the nucleus of a harrowing drama. And ""drama"" is entirely the word - Downfall is as rivetingly dramatic as any movie you're going to see; it succeeds both as a historical recreation and a more intimate portrayal of human dynamic. A good, hypey line for Downfall's blurb might be, ""It puts you inside Hitler's bunker,"" but in this case the line would be more than hype. The film has a you-are-there urgency that most historical films don't achieve, and not just because the production is so physically convincing, so thoroughly detailed. It's not enough to construct a bunker that's accurate down to the doorknobs - everything depends on how strong the players are, and Downfall is blessed with a marvelous ensemble. Foremost among the actors is, of course, Bruno Ganz, who plays Hitler with a ferocity, a focus that is truly impressive. Ganz enunciates super-clearly, like man who expects to have his every utterance not only understood but remembered for all times; and when he's throwing one of his tantrums he nails that high, hysterical note we're familiar with from films of Hitler's speeches, while injecting the words with an extra shot of impotent fury. Ganz's Hitler is ashen-faced and stooped, a broken man, and when he loses his temper he seems to shrink even more in on himself, becoming lost in his frustration at the world's unwillingness to conform to his view of it. Yet there are other facets to this performance too - Hitler has moments of lucidity, moments where he seems to come out of his psychosis, and Ganz is not afraid to lend these calmer times a note of tenderness. Hitler's relationships with those around him form the heart of the movie, and they're all complex ones. With Eva Braun he is adoring; Juliane Kohler gives Braun a confused, distantly anxious quality that melts into pure (some would say insane) devotion in Hitler's presence. Devotion and anxiety are the two emotions that most come to the fore when people deal with Hitler - his military advisors live in a constant state of terror (they know the war is lost but can't make Hitler see it), yet continue to perform their duties; and in Joseph and Magda Goebbels (ably essayed by Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch) we're given a portrayal of maniacal loyalty that takes on a frightening, tragic dimension.<br/><br/>A less insane loyalty is demonstrated by Hitler's young secretary, Traudl (the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara), from whom one senses a sort of maternalistic concern. One could almost imagine Traudl having strange, nurturing feelings for Hitler, a man she perceives as merely troubled (her naiveté), and by showing us Hitler through the eyes of such an eminently rational, radiantly soulful person - a person who is decidedly unevil - Hirschbiegel drags Hitler down from the Pantheon of villains, restoring him at least temporarily to his former status as a mere human being, and allows us, for a moment, to indulge in the potentially-controversial notion that inside the chest of even the most evil of men must beat a human heart."

","I decided to go and watch ""Der Untergang"", partly out of curiosity, partly because of the controversy it generated in Germany. The 155 minutes the movie lasted were 155 minutes well spent, though.<br/><br/>Der Untergang gives an almost documentary-like view into live into Hitler's bunker in Berlin during the last view days of the 3rd Reich. The whole atmosphere and acting is very believable, and at times I found myself wondering whether I was, indeed, watching real footage from those days in 1945. The movie carries an ""end-of-the-world"" atmosphere in which, bit by bit, everything is destroyed. <br/><br/>**** SPOILER ****<br/><br/>The movie contains some hard to stomach scenes. Other viewer already mentioned the scene in which Mrs. Goebbels calmly kills 6 of her children, but there are many more. One of the scenes I found particularly disturbing is set in the streets of Berlin. Here, a ""crew"" of mostly children (Hitler-Jugend) man a flac-cannon. As it becomes clear that their position is desperate, a number of them decide to commit suicide. At that point, a perhaps 12 of 14-year old girl has an older officer shoot her (before he kills himself), while she presents the Hitler-salute with a face full of determination. Terrible.<br/><br/>**** END OF SPOILER<br/><br/>The thing that sets this movie apart from, say, Schindlers List, is the fact that it forces the viewer to realize that Hitler himself was, indeed, a human being. It's convenient and easy to dismiss Hitler as a monster, or as a non-human, because that way one doesn't have to think about why the terrible events in WWII happened. Such an attitude breeds complacency, which is a dangerous thing: The longer we deceive ourselves that something like this will never happen again, the more probable it becomes that, at a certain point in time, the exact same problem will stab us in the back again."

","I just saw this on DVD. As a WWII film buff, I found this film interesting from a historical perspective. Certainly the best and most dramatic depiction of the fall of Berlin that I've seen. But as a ""movie,"" I found it lacking. There is no central POV; we're introduced to many characters, some of whom we recognize by sight (Goering and Goebbles have become caricatures over time)while others are unknown and their roles are never really explained. A friend is currently reading a book called HITLER'S INNER CIRCLE. Perhaps if I'd read that before seeing the film I may have had a better understanding of who all the personalities were. Rather than focusing solely on the bunker goings-on this film takes us to the streets of greater Berlin where we see generals making futile last stands and encounter roving bands of vigilantes executing anyone trying to flee the chaos and destruction. While these scenes are interesting, they take us away from the central story, which is Hitler and his main underlings' last stand. I felt drained at the end of this film. Nobody to cheer for, nobody to feel sympathy for. The people depicted were the architects of the greatest mass murder and sheer carnage the world has ever seen so they are unable to generate any emotion in the viewer. The only question I had at the end was why couldn't these psychos, murderers, and criminals have committed suicide a decade earlier?"

","Der Untergang was a good movie, but actually it did not quite live up to my expectations. First, I would have preferred a classic dramatic plot structure, rather than this docu-dramatization. The storytelling style was that of a bystander and not a filmmaker. I think the movie could have been much more effective with a more stylized narrative structure.<br/><br/>Also, the movie didn't really go into the political philosophy aspects of Hitler's Nazi regime. There were tiny snippets of it in the dialogue, but the monstrosities, pseudo-science and sheer idiocy of the Nazi ideology were barely touched upon at all. And the Jews weren't even mentioned until the movie was almost over.<br/><br/>I don't know the decisions underlying these choices of what to show and what not to, but I did not feel we got the whole story, nor an adequate impression of the nature of Nazism (and thus of Hitler). We got a personally focused ""reality""-style drama mostly set in a bunker - we got as incomplete a picture of the whole as some soldier who had been present in the bunker at the time would have gotten. Not a heck of a lot more.<br/><br/>Still, it was a serious and no doubt cathartic movie (for the Germans), and it opened up some sore wounds and commenced the process of healing them. The acting was great, and I have no objection to showing Hitler with a human face - though a lot of people may not realize it, Hitler *was* a human being. The monstrosities he was part of was not wholly of his doing; it was to a very great degree a result of larger social trends in the population at large. No one among the ordinary people knew where it would go, so no one can be blamed. We can only learn from our mistakes and do our damnedest not to repeat them.<br/><br/>7 out of 10."

","This movie shouldn't have been made, because it is absolutely impossible to express this part of the history in posterior made pictures. Let us remember that the plot of this film is based on the personal experiences of Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, the script written by Joachim Fest, a historian known as viewing history from a very conservative angle. To persons like him history consists in the results of the thoughts and deeds of persons at power, instead of understanding history as the sum of what all humans are thinking and doing, not to forget the effects of what is happening in the nature around us and, not less important, of what happens by accident. <br/><br/>The realism of this film is its weakest point, because it creates at the spectator the illusion of being well informed about what really happened. To learn more about the psychotic nature of this depraved crew of gangsters I would recommend to view Leni Riefenstahl's documentary ""Triumph des Willens"" about the ""Reichsparteitag"" in Nuremberg, Germany, from 1935, made on Hitler's orders. There you can see the real physiognomies and discover the collective paranoia in which fell most of the people of a country which was until then considered as a ""Kulturnation""."

","I know it's dangerous going to a movie with expectations, but not knowing very much about ""Downfall"" except for its excellent reviews here at IMDb.com I was anticipating something like ""Das Boot"" with brown dirt for green water. <br/><br/>As a film this drama's execution is quite superb. The audience seems transported into Hitler's bunker during those last days of the war. The city above is a wreck, and so is Hitler. Boys and girls and the elderly must take up futile positions against the advancing Soviet troops. No need for another plot synopsis here -- it's been well covered by the previous posts here.<br/><br/>Somewhere into this long and very engaging movie a chill set in. Yes, these Germans were real people, not monstrous demons, and this movie wasn't portraying their days here as heroic, but... Then something very odd struck me: during the scenes where the solitary Hitler contemplates his inevitable end, a poignant music plays in the background. It sounds familiar and my mind reaches back to my music school days to place it. It's from Johann Sebastian Bach's Mass in b-minor, specifically, the Crucifixus. Here in the film score, it appears sans words and chorus, but the music is distinct and powerful. Originally intended to evoke the tragedy and sacrifice of Jesus Christ (""he was crucified for us, made to suffer and was entombed..."") here it is an offense. Is this the real point of view of the film, is this its purpose? To portray Hitler as a grand person who suffered persecution and betrayal?<br/><br/>Or am I reading too much into what is only an element of the drama? Well, Albert Speer is portrayed as a dapper (an architect in a suit rather than a minister in a uniform), intelligent, urbane, and compassionate man. He and Hitler have a conversation about their lost future over Speer's model of the Berlin that was to be. Yet wasn't Speer beloved of Hitler out of a compatible grandiosity? Wasn't that Berlin-to-be dominated by a palace with a dome a thousand feet high? Didn't this cultured architect become Hitler's Minister of Weapons and Armaments and ruthlessly use slave labor in the service of the Third Reich? In this film, he is a rather unfortunate artist caught up in the whirlwind of the times. No way.<br/><br/>No doubt the Germans were real people. How did they get talked into this grand, barbaric, and murderous scheme? Yes, they were like us. So could this happen to us too? Don't see this movie, don't shed tears for Hitler, and don't even entertain the notion suggested in this movie that he was a persecuted and betrayed savior. Don't participate in the rehabilitation of Nazism."
"Viator Veritatis","Null","11","40","25 September 2004"," Better than expected, but still an anti-national socialist propaganda movie
","I have mixed feelings about this movie. Acting is impressive (even if the actors impersonating the German generals are unable to reproduce the hard, metal-like Prussian cadence), special effects are well-made, and it nicely conveys the depressive and claustrophobic feeling of the cramped life in the bunkers. It also conveys an adequate feeling of war's brutality.<br/><br/>The plot refrains from the most obtuse stereotypes of anti-National Socialist propaganda, and truly depicts some human sides of Hitler and his entourage. However, it remains a very unbalanced representation of reality, intended to impress the viewer's mind with political and ideological prejudices. For example, all Nazi characters wishing to carry on the fight - from high-ranking SS officials to Hitlerjugend kids fighting on the barricades - always fall in one of two stereotypes, either that of the unthinking, automaton soldier speaking in a machine-like way, or that of the equally unthinking, naive kid automatically repeating the slogans impressed upon him. On the contrary, all characters purporting a quick surrender are represented as wise and judicious individuals, speaking in warm overtones from the wealth of their life experience.<br/><br/>The movie's worst aspect consists its portrayal of Hitler. Instead of depicting the dialectics of rigorous lucidity and rambling illusions, of stern self-control and furious outbursts that characterized the dictator's last days, the film brings to life a rambling old man who has lost nearly all contacts with reality. In this movie Hitler is no religious prophet and political genius, partially broken by the immensity of defeat and bad health conditions, but a madman babbling his nonsense to an audience so foolish and subservient as not to see its obvious foolishness - a poor travesty of historical reality.<br/><br/>Whenever Bruno Ganz enunciates one of his most infamous (to the believers in the political religion of human rights and racial equality) precepts, he always does so in an especially rambling and stuttering way, and such principles are extrapolated from their context, to produce an impression of bleakness and near-madness. This tendency is made obvious in the scene where Hitler dictates his political testament: since there was no way to twist the text in the byproduct of an impoverished mind, we are just allowed to hear its first few words, then the scene is quickly shifted. In other cases this approach leads to historical falsification -- it happens in the scene where Hitler is asked what to do in case ammunition is entirely spent. Fest, in his ""Hitler. Eine Biographie"", unequivocally states that the dictator answered that in this case defenders should try to flee by small groups, while in the movie Ganz furiously waves his fist and mumbles ""I shall never capitulate, never!"".<br/><br/>The movie makers' tendentious intentions are made even more plain in the final scene, where a smiling Frau Junge travels away with a newly found stray kid, and the clouds part in the far skies, to impress on the viewer the idea that a nightmare is now over, and that a new and better age is starting for the survivors of Nazi madness. The short interview to the real Frau Junge, which is incorporated in the end segment, makes the movie's political underground impossible to miss. This movie does not attempt to impress the viewers with problems and interrogations, allowing him to find his own answers; instead it attempts to impose answers on him, defaming the National Socialist world view.<br/><br/>All this notwithstanding the apprehensions expressed by some members of the Establishment, that this movie could mitigate the effect of regime antifascist propaganda, are in my opinion justified: as the movie slanders National Socialism in a less coarse and loud way than usual, it shall be probably able to impress the herd's minds with lesser force.<br/><br/>Finally, this movie is probably the best that can be filmed on this subject under the present political regime; it has several bonus points, yet each viewer, especially young viewers, should go to the box-office conscious of its preposterous background."
"MartinHafer","10","3","7","13 March 2015"," Very important historically but not for the faint of heart
","This film is based on the experiences of Hitler's secretary as well as other survivors of the bunker during the final days of Nazi Germany. It follows these people (with a strong emphasis on Hitler through the first 80% of the film) and excels at its historical accuracy. Unlike some of the other Hitler biopics (such as the ones starring Richard Basehart and Alec Guinness), this one shows an odd and 3-dimensional man--screaming and irrational one moment yet rather kind and likable the next. If Hitler had ONLY been a screaming madman (as he's generally shown) no one would have followed him and he never would have led Nazi Germany. Here he is much more believable and the writer, director and actor (Bruno Ganz) all created the best screen Hitler to date. <br/><br/>The film is a history teacher's dream come true, as the film sure makes you THINK it's being filmed in Berlin during the final days. The look of the bombed out and burned out city is amazing, the bunker sure looks like what the real bunker would have looked like, the uniforms, weapons, cars, etc. all look as they should.<br/><br/>I have only one reservation about this incredibly well made film and that is although the film often sanitized the violence here and there, other times it's up close and personal and overwhelming. For example, many times folks blow their brains out with pistols. You often only hear it and you might see a brief look at the corpse. But, other times, with little warning, someone whips out their pistol and blows a hole through their head...and you see all of it. And, the death of the Goebbels children is heart-wrenching to watch. There also are the scenes involving amputations that are hard to watch. So, while I applaud the film for accuracy, it it NOT for small children or anyone who isn't prepared to see exactly how it was...blood and all. <br/><br/>Overall, incredibly compelling and a film that's among the best the Germans have ever made. Ironically, Ganz played Hitler in this one and his other super-famous film was WINGS OF DESIRE in which he played an angel!!"
"freemantle_uk","10","3","7","11 April 2008"," My favourite foreign film
","This is brilliant film, a great example that Germany is producing some of the best cinema in Europe and is starting to face its past. This film is also one of the most historically accurate films ever made. Downfall focuses on Hitler and the last few days of the Nazi regime. Hitler is seen as an evil in the sense that he did order the Holocaust (but its only mentioned in passing) and ordered the destruction of Germany which Albert Speer refused to obey. But Downfall also shows that Hitler did love Eva Braun, his dog and he was good with children. The film also showed that Hitler was loosing the plot, being in ideas of grandeur and that German was going to win the war despite the Russians overrunning Berlin. Hitler is also shown to be a kind man sometimes, especially to secretary Traudl Junge. The Swiss actor Bruno Ganz played the role perfectly, not portraying Hitler as a one-dimensional villain.<br/><br/>As well as looking at Hitler the film also looks at the wider collapse of the Nazi regimes, seeing many members getting killed, committing suicide or getting captured by the allies. The battle of Berlin is looked at, seeing how citizens were affected and Hitler youth members being used to fight the Russians. They were political power-plays also being made during this point in the war, especially by Goering, Goebbels and Himmer. There is a wider evil to the Nazis outside Hitler, but it also shows that they were some better people within them.<br/><br/>To anyone is who is interested in the Nazis, the Battle of Berlin or World War 2 then this movie is getting viewing.<br/><br/>A little footnote at the end, I also like how the filmmaker covered themselves because no one is 100% sure how Hitler and Eva Braun killed themselves."
"joebloggscity","9","3","7","12 August 2005"," A genuine classic, humanising Germans in WW2
","Downfall (Untergang, Der (2004)) War films can be the most emotive genre in cinema, but even in the company of other classics such as Platoon, Bridge over the River Kwai and Apocalypse now, German movie ""Downfall"" more than holds its own, and is simply one of the best yet. It covers the final days of Hitlers rein before and after his suicide in Berlin, covering the lives of all those around them. The genius stems from the acting whereby they more than convince you that you are actually watching Hitler, Goering etc in the flesh, and additionally the story doesn't simply demonise the characters but starts afresh and makes them human. <br/><br/>Hitler is shown as deluded, paranoid and threatening, and unsettling as it may seem at points you almost sympathise for him, but overall you see his ego and lack of sympathy for his fellow German. The other characters chart a cross section of Berlin society, and they conjure up the fear, delusion and suffering in the face of inevitable defeat, realistically staging the pain that must have engulfed the country at that time.<br/><br/>The film being made in German itself (and by Germans) adds a personal touch I guess to the movie, and adds a new dimension to war films. For too long, WW2 has been treated too much like as if it were all Star Wars, when the truth is actually much more complicated. This film hopefully helps to redress the balance a little bit.<br/><br/>If you have a chance, I'd strongly recommend it. Damns the Nazi regime by just showing them as they were, but also highlights the suffering many Germans themselves went through which has been pitifully ignored over the years. A genuine, touching classic story which sadly in light of the rise of recent terrorism shows that the lessons that have to be learnt are as relevant today as they ever were. ""Never again!"" 9/10"
"larson.72","9","3","7","26 July 2005"," One of the most important movies ever made?
","Through the decades since the end of World War 2, we've come to regard Hitler and the Third Reich as somewhat of a confusing question mark in history: how could this have happened? This movie, perhaps more than any other, tries to answer that question by presenting a unique view of the last days of the Third Reich. It explores the question of why people can be led so easily into hell and the madness of self-destruction by one man, and one idea. The bunker simply serves as a convenient setting to examine this question: after all, it's only at the end, with death imminent, with time for self-reflection, that we can get a really convincing picture of the motives and thinking of those who were involved. ""Why?"": I think that's the central question of this movie. No more, no less. And because of that I think it's one of the most important movies that have been made in a long time, maybe ever."
"Patrick-Dovermann","10","3","7","10 July 2005"," Another kind of view to the history
","Okay, so before you watch this movie clear your mind from all prejudices and think again about all Nazis being dead hearted monsters. Der Untergang is a very interesting example for every monster is ALSO a human being.<br/><br/>For me the best thing was, that in school they taught me six times about all the crimes that happened during the time of the 3rd Reich but never anyone told us about the humans that were involved. I once wanted to know, where Adolf Hitler was born, and I asked a teacher, he told me, that he didn't know, and it doesn't matter, for the only important thing about him were the 6 Million Jews he killed.<br/><br/>Please do not misunderstand me. Adolf Hitler is at least one of the worst, if not the worst criminal in history, but it makes me sad that nearly nobody thinks about him being human, and a disturbing realistic movie like Der Untergang becomes necessary to show the people that even he was."
"kengill56","10","3","7","23 June 2005"," an unblinking visceral experience
","I am almost 50 and very familiar with the iconography of WWII. I even lived in West Berlin for several years in the 1980s, and in a prosaic way perhaps this film merely adds to the canon. But, for me it is the flawless performance of Bruno Ganz, that is the key to the power of this film. You actually believe Ganz is Hitler and the film's close attention to the monster as a human simply amplifies the deep rooted madness, the inhumanity, the cruelty of the man and thereby the underlying evil of the regime. But words are inadequate to explain Downfall. This is pure cinema: slow, cool and deliberate. I need to see this film again at least twice more. Please see this film."
"dougloch","10","3","7","30 May 2005"," A wonderful piece of cinematography
","This movie was one of the best I have seen in recent memory. Bruno Ganz did a fantastic job of portraying Hitler during the final days of the Third Reich as it crumbled around him. All of the actors and actresses in this movie really nailed their parts as well. When the movie is over, all you can do is say ""Wow"". You'll actually believe you're watching archival footage from World War II. The sets are expansive and the special effects are extraordinary. The fact that the entire movie is in German and Russian adds a certain amount of authenticity as well. Kudos to the director for not glamorizing Hitler and showing him as the monster he truly was. A special surprise awaits at the end of the movie."
"nitratestock35","10","3","7","1 May 2005"," Best ""Final days"" movie yet
","Recently I am getting more into Adolf Hitler by reading books written by such accomplished authors as the late Sebastian Haffner. I am German spending my first 24 years in Germany and both my parents went through through WWII so I have some idea - and a strong personal interest - of what it was like. ""Downfall"" (Der Untergang) comes closest to the idea I have not only about the final days in Berlin but of WWII in general. The dialog is straight out of the period with only some minor compromises. German accents were (and still are) so different from each other that they have to be ""softened"" into ""Hochdeutsch"" to some extent in order to make everything understandable for audiences. I believe this is the case in any country. <br/><br/>Of course Bruno Ganz delivers the very best Hitler portrait I have ever seen. He just nails the man. There is a human drama within his sick ""nature selects the strongest"" philosophy which tries to suck you into him. That is the most diabolical part of Hitler the man.<br/><br/>I was totally absorbed by the impeccable photography by Rainer Klausmann which is pin sharp and has the colors exactly look like period color photography with emphasis on cyan (blue green) and yellow. I was surprised to see nothing that looked CGI. The beautiful musical score by Stephan Zacharias, mostly a small string orchestra playing melancholic tunes, suddenly joined by an oboe bringing some ""hope"" after the capitulation is official, is spot-on. <br/><br/>Overall acting is absolutely impeccable finding the right balance between period feel and some added weight with perhaps only Joseph Goebbels being the weakest portrait - but the man was so unique that I am unable to blame Ulrich Matthes' otherwise impeccable portaial with the accurate slight Cologne area accent. <br/><br/>This movie is very similar in tone to Wolfgang Petersen's ""Das Boot"" By showing the war as accurate as possible the movie automatically turns into an anti war film. The movie clearly avoids any comment about the war. It just brings you into the heart of Berlin during the last days of WWII. <br/><br/>This movie was long overdue. Sir Alec Guinness' and others tried it earlier but Adolf Hitler cannot be translated into any language. Who better to make a WWII movie viewed from the German side than the Germans? And again: Bruno Ganz' performance is 100% Oscar material - but of course Adolf Hitler is too hot an issue to be considered. Maybe the Academy is right - this madman must never be anything even close to an idol. In any case: this movie is much better than the foreign film Oscar winner ""The Sea Inside"". <br/><br/>Der Untergang, The Downfall: Highest rating!"
"CharteredStreets","9","3","7","28 April 2005"," Chilling, insightful, and stunning - Ganz is truly amazing
","Robert Altman once said that if every movie were like its trailer, every movie would be exactly the same. The TV ads for Oliver Hirschbiegel's ""Downfall,"" starring Bruno Ganz as Hitler, are making it look like an action war movie about heroes and villains. There are a handful of explosions in the movie, and all of them are in that ad  and little else. Those expecting violence and a neatly packaged message may be disappointed, or perhaps, like me, surprised by the movie's insights, depths and power.<br/><br/>The movie does, certainly, have scenes of carnage and battle  how could a movie set in Berlin in the last days of World War II not?  but the majority of the story unfolds in the claustrophobic rooms and corridors of Hitler's bunker. The movie follows the stories of Hitler, Eva Braun, Traudl Junge, Hitler's private secretary, and a doctor whose conscience gets the better of him.<br/><br/>Hitler has been represented in countless other movies, and he is usually shown as a caricature of evil, or a mocking imitation (most famously in Charlie Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator""). Ganz's performance surpasses them all; it surpasses imitation, and he presents Hitler as human, as a paradox, as a man affected by both evil and madness. There is a pre-title scene where he stands upright in his early days in power, as he hires a secretary. He has a certain charm over women and, later, we see the way that children, too, adore him; 'Uncle Hitler,' they call him. Later, as the end of the war looms, we see the cruel way he presides over his maps and diagrams, ordering troops into certain death. He is so cut-off from humanity that his view is that if Berlin falls, its inhabitants do not deserve to live. His back becomes hunched as he barks out orders, his hands darting in all directions; its astonishing to consider that this is the same actor who was so serene and introverted in Wim Wender's ""Wings of Desire.""<br/><br/>The two main criticisms I have heard made of ""Downfall"" are that it is not historically accurate, and that Hitler becomes too human; too sympathetic. ""Downfall"" may not include all the facts, but it is not propaganda; it has no political motives or agenda. Its motives are to help the audience question situations and events that are beyond the grasp of most modern people's understanding. Movies are not the medium for fact; the truth of ""Downfall"" is in the way it sums up the conflicting feelings of a deceived and confused people.<br/><br/>What would have been wrong and 'inaccurate' would be to deny the fact that Hitler was a person, and not just an evil force, like something from a comic book. I'm not trying to say he was not an evil person; just that an evil person is still a person.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a 'troubling' movie, as Stanley Kauffman pointed out in his review. How could it not be? What use would a movie which showed Hitler as lacking humanity have? What interest would it have? The movie is being criticised where it should be praised; it does not manipulate the audience, or tell you how to feel. That's where its power comes from. Watching the real Traudl Junge at the movie's end, I had tears in my eyes. It's difficult to say what is so moving about the film. When Hitler dies, we do not sympathise with him; in fact we feel a certain relief, because it means the end is in sight. His way out was an easy one, but the others had to live the rest of their lives with a burden on their conscience. Traudl Junge liked Hitler as a person, and that was her own downfall."

","SPOILERS There are demons in the past which are often kept buried. Scared of remembering our mistakes, we hide them and hope that they won't gnaw away at our souls. One country above all others has experienced this feeling the recent years.<br/><br/>Poverty stricken and suffering, the people of Germany in the 1930s looked for a brighter future. Bitter after their surrender in 1918, the people were tormented. Unable to foresee the eventually consequences of their actions, this once proud country turned to an Austrian to resurrect their fortunes. This man, Adolf Hitler, had a vision and a philosophy. Entering Germany into a long and bloody war, he ordered countless atrocities that Germany is still feeling guilt for now. The often misconception though is that Hitler was a monster without any human emotions. This film ""The Downfall"" challenges this view by introducing Hitler as a man who loves to feed his dog and who thanks his cook for every meal. This man, who could switch from a man of warmth into a cold ruthless mass murderer in a split second, is perhaps even more terrifying than normal views.<br/><br/>""The Downfall"" is an amazing film which hits home hard and the fact that it was made in Germany makes it all the more impressive. This is a film that all children need to see, that Germany needs to help with it's healing, and that ultimately just needed to be made.<br/><br/>In 1945, Germany was on the verge of defeat. With Hitler moving into his infamous bunker, Berlin is being bombed to the ground. As civilians are left to die by their Fuhrer, Hitler and his remaining circle of generals and friends dine and consider the future safe in a bunker under the ground.<br/><br/>The brutality of the war on Germany truly hits home in this film. In so many films about the war, the focus is mostly about the Holocaust and the murder of the Jews. A worthy topic, the Holocaust often overshadows the damage done to the lives of the other inhabitants for Germany.<br/><br/>From the first explosion and Hitler's comments that civilians are not worth saving, ""The Downfall"" paints a picture of a German people ignored. Forced to fend for themselves, people struggle to survive as through evacuation or suicide, slowly all their leaders abandon them. Berlin becomes a war-zone and it is the regular family that suffers the most.<br/><br/>Beneath the surface we are shown a German hierarchy who follow their Fuhrer's demands irrelevant of how mistaken they believe him to be. Hitler refuses to surrender and those Generals who don't run away often follow his orders with a sense of dejectment.<br/><br/>As Hitler, swiss born Bruno Ganzy places the role to perfection. Modelling an accent from Hitler's home area, and forever bending forward with a twisted left hand, Ganz gives us a Hitler to truly fear. Ganz's Hitler is a man who can be kind to a secretary, before entering the next room and screaming of betrayal. He speaks of loyalty, yet he abandons his German subjects to Russian artillery. He is a man of contradiction who only remains direct in his ideas of a brighter future. A scene where he dictates to his secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) his testimony is particularly harrowing. He speaks with pride at the removal of the Jews and he remains convinced of a dream of a united world.<br/><br/>Ganz's Hitler is not the only terrifying character in the bunker. Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun gives us confusing signals. Braun remains strikingly cheerful almost throughout the whole film. She sticks out as being either ignorant of the suffering her love causes or she simply chooses to not notice.<br/><br/>Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels is the one responsible for perhaps the most harrowing scene in the whole film. Her character is a devoted socialist who does not want her family to live in a world without it. The way she solves this issue is so brutal and shocking, that it's images stick with the viewer and stun, for hours afterwards.<br/><br/>After watching ""The Downfall"" it feels a shame to have a criticism, but sadly there is one minor complaint.<br/><br/>This is a truly gruelling film which focuses almost entirely on the suffering of the German people. For some reason though, at the very end, it feels an almost predictable urge to say something about the Holocaust. By this time, it has been an all but brief reference with occasional comment. The reason for this is that this film is not actually about the suffering of the Jews, it is primarily about the collapse of the third Reich and the suffering of the residents of Berlin. The Holocaust is the worst atrocity committed in Europe for centuries, but it's inclusion at the end of this film is not necessary.<br/><br/>Despite this small criticism about the conclusion of this film, it's difficult to find any major fault. Telling a harrowing story to a country which finds it hard to face up to it's past, this film is a necessary feature which leaves it's audience stunned for hours afterwards. It is to be heavily praised for reminding us that we should never forget. It is time Germany should begin to heal, and with this film, this might happen. ""The Downfall"" is a masterpiece which should be mandatory viewing for all school children around the world. This film is that important."

Is that possible? In this movie you sort of feel slight sympathy and you can see that Hitler knew, it was over. This movie isn't there to try to make you a Nazi, but it wants to show you that they were all people. I won't ruin the movie but the last hour is probably the most dramatic. It's a really touching movie and it makes you feel bad, for the people of Germany. Thank god for a movie that doesn't have, ""Nazis are bad! They are monsters!!!""

"thrillerclub","9","5","15","9 April 2005"," What's Wrong with this picture?
","This movie is a major breakthrough in the art of telling history in a media that usually comes up short on accuracy. But there are problems, such as selective editing obscuring actual communication and statements. By leaving out minor important details, even this agenda-bender tends in subtle ways to reinforce the perception, for instance, that Hitler was practically senile and in complete denial about the inevitable end. In point of fact, to certain associates he lucidly admitted that the war with Russia could never be won; and in rare moments of honesty brushed aside notions that any armies were coming to save Berlin. These people were not stupid or completely crazy. Perhaps they clutched at straws, but in the diaries and specific day to day communications, Goebbels and Hitler were putting up a front for the others, they themselves weren't as deluded as edits make them out to be. What's missing from the film are about a thousand pages of inter-office memos, private discussions and phone conversations that reveal they're saying very different things to one another ranging sometimes to the total opposite, yet keeping it all sorted out. Hitler was often lucid with a surprising grasp of reality when he'd let his guard down in the bunker; including more baffling contradictions of that aspect of Hitler's personality might have revealed more of his inner motivations. <br/><br/>While Ganz turns in a well researched Oscar-quality portrayal, Hitler himself was giving a portrayal, of a leader as the one man who would never give up, especially at 5 minutes to midnight; as the Kaiser had at ""the eleventh hour"" - prematurely in many German's minds - in 1918. Hitler's ruthless determination to stand and fight against all odds saved countless German lives, while coldly sacrificing many others, though not nearly in as detached a manner as Stalin, who wasted millions upon millions of Russian lives in order to win. <br/><br/>Hitler's greatest achievement of the war was preventing total catastrophe and collapse of the Russian Front, and thus perhaps subsequent Soviet capture of central and western Europe. I'm referring to the conclusions of serious historians such as John Toland, not those of Nazi sympathizers. As dramatized in DOWNFALL, young boys were sent personally by Hitler to die for their country; and against all odds a few doomed boys actually held a bridge long enough for civilians and deserters to reach American lines. The implication is that these boys died to keep Hitler alive a few more days. Yes, but it's more than that. <br/><br/>If a tiny tinge of humanness is so astonishing to associate with Hitler, there was much more of that going on in recorded history from that period alone than this movie can show, since real time is very different than a 2 hour condensation. Something had to be left out. The question is what, and why? <br/><br/>Many viewers of DOWNFALL have been genuinely shocked by the stand-out scene of Magda Goebbels taking the lives of her own children. Ask why she did it, by reading between the lines. Would it have made sense to surrender herself and her young daughters to the sympathetic Soviet soldiers of the Red Army? Should we interpret Magda's personally administering the execution of her children as an act of insanity? Was her last statement a calculated epitaph to secure a place in history for not betraying Hitler at the last minute as he said he had been by Himmler, Goering and everyone in the old guard except for Joseph Goebbels? Was she fearful of what would happen to her family if captured alive - especially her daughters? Reports reached the bunker that the Red Army, ever since taking East Prussia, were openly raping German women to death, age 3 to age 80; imagine 50 to 100 guys going wild with your daughters and that's the last time you'll ever see them, alive. Maybe that morphine/cyanide cocktail is starting to sound like a preferable solution to a worst case scenario. <br/><br/>Bruno Ganz has transcended the limitations of the final edit, which in spite of a sincere effort, selectively waters down the reality of certain events going on. That's a tall order to fill, to be fair, and meanwhile Ganz playing a very difficult part nails it, soaring above performances given by other fine actors playing Hitler in the final days: Richard Baseheart ""HITLER""; Alec Guiness ""HITLER: THE LAST 10 DAYS"", Anthony Hopkins ""THE BUNKER""; though they provided some insight into the man dragging everything with him into the abyss. I'd be more impressed if a filmmaker from Germany dared to look without flinching and reflect without filtering, the naked face of the actual man. Whoever and whatever Hitler is. Start from scratch. As little bias as possible. As much detail as possible. Shoot it in real time if possible. Just run the damn speeches, watch the real thing but, we want to see the private life and inner man don't we? The last 10 days or so are least entertaining period of Hitler's life, as far as film goes. A few kind comments about the spinach, that's controversy enough for now, one bite at a time. Chew slowly. Stick to the chronology and facts, let the chips fall where they may. No admission under 17 maybe. Can we tell it on film without reinforcing the same old stereotypes? That is my challenge. German films have faced the dark side of humanity head-on like none others, as in ""M"", ""The Testament of Doctor Mabuse"", ""Metropolis"" and ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" perhaps. Maybe German films are getting up the nerve to face their demons again. I'd like to see Bruno Ganz involved in another illuminating historical epic. <br/><br/>""That's our Hitler!"""
"GanzEhrlich","10","2","4","28 August 2015"," A Masterpiece when it comes to war movies!
","Downfall (Der Unterang in Germany), the story of Hitler and the other political staff in his Berlin bunker as the Soviets advance towards them, could well be described as a war movie like no other. It tends to use emotional violence, rather than physical, graphic war violence to pummel you (there are few instances of it, I'll admit that). Furthermore, instead telling the story of, say, a group of soldiers fighting for victory, there are no real heroes to root for, and plenty of unpleasant, confused politicians in their place. With realism applied, not even Bruno Ganz portraying Hitler stands out in terms of evil-mindedness (Mr. and Mrs. Goebbels are even worse). This narrative technique works in making the film as earth-shattering as it is.<br/><br/>On that note, congratulations Bruno Ganz, for delivering an all-time great performance as Adolf Hitler, arguably history's most iconic villain, that should have won him the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Shame Academy rules made him ineligible for even a nomination, which is a travesty. Not that the Oscars are gospel.<br/><br/>The Swiss-born Ganz, for the role of Hitler, gave everything into the performance, listening to the only audio recordings of Hitler as well as footage of him dictating. He simply nailed the physical mannerisms, as well as the accent and the aggressive nature of his character.<br/><br/>The way he explodes as his Hitler hears of military failings or betrayals from his comrades are terrifying (and in the process giving rise to countless memes and parodies of those scenes on the Internet). More shocking yet is the way in numerous other scenes he holds a far more subtle, more calm demeanour, suggesting, as must have been the case, that most of time Hitler didn't behave like a complete nutcase, no doubt unstable though. The genius of Ganz's performance is that in the end, he plays Hitler as a real, three-dimensional person, not a unrealistic caricature, such that it is definitively the best portrayal of the dictator put on film to date, if not for all eternity. One of THE performances of the 21st century so far.<br/><br/>I must also praise the Marion Cotillard-lookalike Alexandra Maria Lara for her performance as Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, not necessarily adding the same level of depth to her character as Ganz, but still powerful nonetheless. Just about everyone else in the cast each have their moments and do a fantastic job in transferring Bernd Eichinger's impeccable screenplay to the screen, especially Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch as the Goebbels couple, who disturbingly steal most of the scenes they're in after Ganz is gone from the film.<br/><br/>Credit has to go to director Oliver Hirschbiegel, who, without using much violence as aforementioned, maintained a mesmerizing level of emotion and intensity, most notably in the bunker scenes. Alongside getting phenomenal acting from his ensemble, he achieved this with dizzying, claustrophobic cinematography from Rainer Klausmann and incredible editing by Hans Funck, which contributed to the fact that not once in the 145 min film did I feel bored and found myself waiting for the next scene. Although, not reaching on a technical level, the heights of Saving Private Ryan etc. Downfall still proves that you don't need a lot of technical impetus to succeed in making a impact on the audience.<br/><br/>I have not yet seen Saving Private Ryan or The Thin Red Line, yet once I have watched those two great war movies (and they are great from what I gather) neither will strike the same chord which Downfall did. Hopefully a film that will be remembered in another 50, or 100 years."
"Eliteskeet","10","2","4","12 July 2015"," The best film about the Second World War - bar none
","As a huge history buff, I found Downfall riveting, exciting, and ultimately somber as people (both good and bad) are destroyed in the final days of the Third Reich. While the film portrays the downfall of the Nazi Germany and with it some of the most notorious people of the 20th century, it rips its audience into the emotions of the soldiers, civilians, and Nazi hierarchy as Berlin burns.<br/><br/>I love this film because it is presented from a German perspective. Most World War 2 films involving Germans portray them as the ""universal bad guys"" out of convenience due to the well-known atrocities committed under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. This film steps above that overplayed convenience; there are good Germans and bad Germans and they must watch together as Berlin crumbles. This film follows through on how various Germans react to the collapse of Berlin, including Hitler, Braun, the Goebbels family, Spear, and a host of officers and civilians.<br/><br/>I have seen most films about the Second World War, and Downfall is the best of them all. Yes, it is better than Saving Private Ryan. Yes, it is better than Schindler's List. This is a MUST WATCH film for anyone who is interested in the Second World War."
"oskari-ratinen","10","2","4","6 June 2013"," A stunning study of megalomania
","Having seen this movie a few times, it still sends shivers down my spine every time I merely think about it. It was criticized heavily for portraying Hitler as ""too humane"" before and after it was released, but people who say things like this are missing the point. Bruno Ganz's masterful interpretation of the most demonized human being ever is exactly the greatest strength of this movie.<br/><br/>Hitler may have been a megalomaniac, despicable dictator whose hands are stained by the blood of millions, but he wasn't a demon. He was a human being, and thanks to Ganz we now have the possibility to see that human being for ourselves and be touched in a way that no amount of text and numbers on the pages of a history book can ever touch us. You can easily believe that you're looking at the man who was the driving force behind mankind's most destructive conflict ever. No other cinematic portrayal of Adolf Hitler is anywhere near to Ganz's in terms of realism and quality. Truly, this is one of the best performances ever put on film.<br/><br/>And that is just the beginning. Everything is exactly where it should be in this movie. The desperate atmosphere of the ""throne room"" of a crumbling empire is astoundingly presented to the viewer, whose only option is to devour it with one's eyes and ears and be sucked in to the thick of it.<br/><br/>You feel the artillery shells exploding as the Red Army closes in. You feel the devotion of a maddened mother who murders her children because she thinks life without Führer is not worth living for anyone. You feel the desperation of an SS doctor who still has a shred of humanity in him despite all the horrors of the war he has witnessed, as the Nazis blame the innocent civilians of Berlin of their own failures and take their revenge on them. You feel the growing insanity of everyone as their entire world rapidly spirals towards its inevitable and complete doom. And yes, you even end up feeling pity and sympathy towards the devastated and trembling shell of a man, Hitler, even though you know he only has himself to blame for his downfall and that of millions of others.<br/><br/>There is nothing to be taken out from this movie, and nothing to be added. It's as close to cinematic perfection as mere men and women can get, and will hold you in its grips for a very long time."

The acting, tension, sound and historical accuracy are well beyond anything that has come out of Hollywood in recent times, IMHO.<br/><br/>The actor who plays Hitler is so frighteningly real that he seems more real than Hitler himself. Goebbels, Frau Goebbels and the other bunker staff are just brilliant in their authenticity, and in the intensity in which they play their roles.<br/><br/>It is not a pleasant or universally appealing movie but quite extraordinary for anyone with an interest in history or the detail of making truly powerful character development, acting and technical production in movies.<br/><br/>As for Poopmetheus, the less said the better."
"adam_evans14","9","2","4","20 June 2012"," Downfall- The most comprehensive study of Hitlers final days
","Whatever your opinion is of this movie, nobody can deny to create a film with Adolf Hitler the protagonist is a largely transgressive concept. With such a brave approach comes the degree of fictitiousness involved with the films narrative. Since very little is known of the events to occur within Hitlers bunker director Oliver Hirschbiegel has the task of piecing together what little is known with his own vision of Hitlers final days.<br/><br/>To start the film offers an array of impressive performances; Bruno Ganz's erratic Hitler perfectly transcends the mere perceptions a perspective audience has when watching the film. He really is awesome. And in honesty he has to be; the basis for the films credibility lay solely on Ganz's performance, but thankfully he delivers to thundering applause. Taboo it may seem humanising somebody whose actions are distinctively 'inhuman', it's still the most accurate portrayal to date; Robert Carlyles overzealous effort, decent but not believable due to farcical overacting.<br/><br/>For the supporting cast Traudl Junge, the secretary to Hitler is indeed portrayed inaccurately as a more virtuous, innocent and sweet young girl which sparks criticism from among those educated toward Nazi Germany. However the important motif of innocence is resonant throughout the entire film; children are left to defend Berlin (ignorent to the knowledge they haven't a chance of survival), and the innocents of Germany ultimately are left to face the consequences of the previous generations wrongdoings, while the real perpetrators cop out through suicide and hiding. Though the anti semitism of German society and atrocities perpetrated by the Germans during the war aren't as comprehensively addressed as say Schindler's List its important to address this film for what it is; the story of Hitler and national socialism's final days.<br/><br/>Well documented is propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels' murder of their children inside Hitler's bunker and this is one of the more uncomfortable scenes of the film, reinforcing the theme of the innocents paying the price. Goebbels and his wife's suicides bear resonance to the status quo sentiment felt by all Germans at this dreadful period; there is no life beyond national socialism.<br/><br/>To categorise this film into a genre is a tough task but i'd call it a drama more than anything with action sequences sparsely present. Sounds good on paper right? Well i'll try to place a balanced viewpoint in reviewing this film so lets address the reasons perhaps the film may be limited or perhaps just not for you.<br/><br/>1. To somebody perhaps not a keen enthusiast of History the lengthy scenes and claustrophobic feel of the film (with very few settings) this film may feel a bit of a drag at times. You may however find learning a little is beneficial.<br/><br/>2. To somebody overly educated in Nazi Germany the few historical inaccuracies may just be too much to overlook.<br/><br/>3. As my brother put it upon entering my bedroom and witnessing me watching Downfall, ""Why are you watching that for, its not in English"". An extremely fickle criticism in my eyes but subtitles aren't for everybody.<br/><br/>Overall despite this hugely pessimistic outlook on a topic widely controversial, anybody even remotely into films should watch this. Even if you're not a WW2 buff or dislike drama, this film's narrative is largely unrivalled in content, making it by and large a unique film i would recommend to anybody. 8/9-10."

","Okay, everyone knows what happened to Hitler at the end of the Second World War. In his bunker he committed suicide. For most people that's the end of the story. Yet, German director Oliver Hirschbiegel decided to go deep into the last ten days of Hitler's life, exploring his crazy military strategies and the people surrounding him, some supporting him others waiting for him to finally take his life so they can escape. This movie was fantastic. I have no complainants what so ever about this movie. Everything was perfectly done, the acting was out standing and the historical accuracy was out of this world amazing.

In no way am I a Nazi supporter or anything, but really liked how this movie showed what was going on with Hitler and his army and how he was dealing with WWII. I really liked that this movie did that. The actor who portrays Hitler looks a lot like him in this film, so much so that it's a bit creepy. I highly recommend this movie!!

"varunthedragon-931-766034","9","2","4","10 June 2011"," Haunting
","""Der Untergang"" or ""Downfall"" is certainly not your everyday Nazi movie. the movie begins with the introduction of Traudl Junge, who is chosen from a handful of ladies to be the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler's private secretary. Two years later, the Red Army has fought its way to the outskirts of Berlin and, despite the advice of his followers, Hitler decides to stay in the Fuhrerbunker and supervise Berlin's ""defense"". The movie then follows, through the eyes of Traudl, the last days of one of the most hated men in history. A classic question we ask ourselves whenever we hear or see news of someone doing a despicable deed (terrorists, for example), is ""Are they even human?"" We are often too afraid to know that the answer is ""YES"". To commit such atrocities, you can only be human. This is shown in this movie by its depiction of the Nazi High Command. We see them not as a set of demons ruled by the biggest demon of all but as normal men driven by fate to commit the atrocities. That still does not mean this shows them as ""sympathetic and misunderstood"". If you see this movie, had you hated Hitler for the well documented ""Final Solution"", you might hate him even more for his cowardice and the fact that he let his own people suffer the collapse of his dreams to the bitter end. Bruno Ganz's performance is not praised for nothing. It shows the world's most famous tyrant as a clearly deluded man living on fundamentally incorrect assumptions about human nature, slowly losing track of reality who nevertheless had a larger than life presence about him that people of like mind and impressionable youths took to. We see this dogged loyalty from his followers the most fanatical of whom are almost as deluded as the man himself. Hitler's personal life is also interesting to note. It goes a long way to show that you need not be a socially inept person or show tendencies of animal cruelty to walk the path of a tyrant. By the end of this movie, you might ""pity"" Hitler as one would pity a rabid dog that needs to be put down. Yet you see a differing of opinions even among his inner circle. There are the doggedly loyal ones like Goebbels and his wife but there were others who saw through his delusions and aimed for damage control albeit too late. Overall, this is a must watch for fans of Holocaust movies and, although fairly slow, is one of the most engaging movies I've seen. My rating-9/10"

","History aside, if we can, negative reviews compel me to add some comments, whether welcome or not. I note some reviewers whilst commending the skill of the delivery, condemn certain aspects of the movie, such as showing the ringleaders in a sympathetic light, playing unsuitable music with religious overtones & perhaps not portraying events accurately. I mark this movie highly despite the subject matter not because of it. I believe (personally) the acting to be second to none and rather than feeling sorry for the antagonists, watching them squirm like rats in a tunnel crawling over each other, I take a perverse pleasure in their frantic, brow mopping final machinations to delay the inevitable. The film does not portray them sympathetically, rather, it shows them as weak limbed, weak minded individuals easily led and paying the price of blindly following a distorted belief."

Movies like Der Untergang (Downfall) are very risky movies in many ways and this movie is no exception but this movie showed the last days of the Nazi era with a neutral point of view. In my opinion this movie is one of the best war movies of all time and Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Adolf Hitler is the best Hitler portrayal ever.<br/><br/>Direction and screenplay of this movie is simply great, dialogues are very deep and simply great. Every single acting performances in this movie are spectacular and most of the time stunning especially performances of Bruno Ganz, Ulrich Matthes and Corinna Harfouch, every single actor of this movie did a great job.<br/><br/>This movie gives you a chance to see the last days of World War II from the other side but with a neutral point of view."
"JCBar","10","2","4","10 August 2009"," Outstanding Depiction of Hitler's Last Days
","Downfall has nothing new to actually say about the last days in Berlin after the war. But while I've read many stories about 'Hitler and Eva committing suicide, the fate of Goebbels' children, Hitler's dog being killed etc'; to see these acts in this faithfully recorded story of the last days in the Bunker, brought home just how terrible those days were to its inhabitants. And while you realize that most of the participants helped bring on these events themselves, you can't still feel something towards them as human beings.<br/><br/>Now, I'm stopping short (very short) of saying this film made me feel sympathetic towards Hitler or the SS members that were caught in the final days (although I did feel that way towards the civilians); and I'm also stopping short of having any of my original feelings change towards Germany's role in killing millions. But this film was unique in that it was generally low key in its depictions, was realistic, and managed to tell a familiar story in a way unlike any other film I've seen about Hitler – and at the same time not portraying the entire German military and other Nazi supporters as cardboard cutout monsters. Not even Magda Goebbels (Corinna Harfounch) is entirely displayed that way (despite her horrific act, and undying loyalty to Hitler).<br/><br/>The acting from all is outstanding – esp the superb performance of Bruno Ganz as Hitler. The whole tone of the film was believable from start to finish. The one negative I could find was that at 155 mins, it might have been a little too long, but I'm not sure what scenes or story lines could have been left out.<br/><br/>All in all simply an outstanding film."
"echai","10","2","4","20 June 2009"," DAMN those Germans can act!
","One of the greatest films ever made - doesn't really make up for the rest of cinema about war (at least in the English language), almost all of it being propaganda or spectacle, one or the other. This film for a rare moment treats its audience with the intelligence we deserve - yes we know Hitler was a nutter and there's plenty of evidence to display what occurred during those crazy years in Germany. We don't need a lifetime of fiction and non-fiction slating him as a Demon. This realistic account will remain a definitive account of this war cabinet's last moments - if only more filmmakers were able to do this factual justice to important events of human history. I wonder when someone will make a film based on the work of Anthony Sutton who's research in the sixties documents demonstrable evidence of Wall Street and the Banks of England funding the development of the military infrastructure of Germany in the thirties and forties."
"classicsoncall","10","2","4","7 June 2009"," ""I must force an outcome in Berlin, or face my downfall"".
","I'm having some trouble with other reviewers on this board who feel the movie was an attempt at putting a human face on Adolf Hitler, as providing some sort of apology for the actions of a dictator bent on world domination. Yes, Hitler was a human being, as much as Genghis Khan, Idi Amin, and Osama Bin Laden, but I didn't come away from the film with the impression that he was simply some misguided tragic figure. There are just too many scenes of Hitler in tirades against anyone or anything within his sphere of influence if he wasn't getting his own way. Twenty thousand German soldiers dead attempting to defend Berlin against the Russians - ""But that's what young men are for."" His tirade against the military for the failure of Steiner to launch an assault against the Russians - a completely irrational rant against his high command in the face of certain defeat. The only scene I can recall that one might consider to evoke empathy for Hitler was when Magda Goebbels' children entertained him in the bunker, with the youngest daughter sitting on his lap in a grandfatherly pose. The complete incongruity of that scene with Hitler's true nature struck me as one of those surreal moments in a torrential landscape of surreal moments presented throughout the picture. Like Eva Braun attempting to strike up the dance while the city is being shelled immediately outside. One is forced to consider how these individuals maintained their own sanity as outside forces were about to come crashing down on their heads.<br/><br/>No, I think the film makers did a remarkably dispassionate job in presenting Hitler as the face of evil that he truly was. The claustrophobic feel of the underground bunkers conveyed a sense of the world caving in on Hitler and the Nazis. The mini-dramas involving Eva Braun's brother-in-law and Magda Goebbels' devoted loyalty while killing her own children only heighten the viewers' awareness that Hitler's fanatical grip on his followers went beyond human comprehension. This film in no way glorifies Adolf Hitler or the Nazi cause.<br/><br/>A couple of weeks ago, on Memorial Day in fact, I watched the acclaimed Frank Capra World War II documentary ""Why We Fight"". There was a line from Hitler quoted in the first installment, 'Prelude to War', that stuck with me, and was visibly prominent in ""Der Untergang"". It was the scene when the young Nazi street fighter received a medal from The Fuerher himself, having distinguished himself in guerrilla attacks on the Russians. Beaming proudly, the youth personified Hitler's vision of a cause that in his view would ultimately lead to Nazi victory - ""I want to see again in the eyes of youth the gleam of the beast of prey"". Truly chilling."
"Chris_Middlebrow","Null","2","4","8 March 2009"," Enter, After an Hour, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels
","If you haven't noticed, Germany in the early 21st century has been making quality movies focusing introspectively on not-so-pleasant excerpts from that nation's past (Sophie Scholl: The Final Days, about the 1940s anti-Nazi student dissident who was guillotined; The Lives of Others, about the excesses of the Stasi, the East German secret police; and The Baader Meinhof Complex, about the Red Army Faction terrorist group). There also has been at least one film about Germany's more positive history (Luther, about the origins of the Protestant Reformation).<br/><br/>In the historical drama Downfall, Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge (1920-2002), a real-life secretary to the Fuhrer who is depicted in documentary interview footage as well as by Lara. Like her age peer the martyred Scholl, the youthful Junge hails from Munich. Unlike Scholl, she took a moral wrong turn with the wrong crowd, but in so doing survived, along with others who were there, to give us an account of the last days in the bunker in Berlin.<br/><br/>One expects the movie climax to be the suicides of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, and the rest beforehand to be mostly a couple of hours of cinematically waiting around. Not so and not so, without giving too much away. Pay special attention, about an hour into the film, when Corinna Harfouch shows up in the role of Magda Goebbels, wife of the Nazi propaganda minister. Harfouch delivers a stunning supporting-actress performance. Also good, in a minor role, is Christian Berkel as an SS physician who has attained more sanity than others around him.<br/><br/>In my opinion, Downfall is the best of the recent German historical lot. Education in the psychological and sociological causes of World War II may not be complete without it. Moreover, as a war movie, Downfall in stature is up there with The Bridge on the River Kwai and Saving Private Ryan. From another lens, fascinatingly, albeit disturbingly."

It's so haunting yet never feels manipulative. Bruno Ganz is a brute force not to be reckoned with, and I hate not giving him the win but Giamatti is most triumphant. Somehow he managed to add a grand depth to Hitler, especially in his passive moments of deep thought - completely humanizing his 'character'. Entwined with the scenes of Hitler are war scenes, yet unglorified sections of one nearby area being attacked. So gritty yet stark makes for exhilarating viewing; outstanding cinematography and sound. It had perfect pacing, matching the subtext of events to make it more affecting, which was extremely effective despite not always being so subtle. I thought it was a wise choice to not make Hitler's suicide anything special over the other suicides, which were often more shocking. Watching the men re-evaluate their last thoughts was tremendous. The last image was beautiful, if contrived; showing us a last glimpse of hope for the truly innocent.<br/><br/>8/10"
"varundelpiero","9","2","4","31 October 2008"," Riveting, beautiful, powerful...
","DER UNTERGANG has to be one of the best WWII movies ever made, and it is unfortunate that it will not receive as many accolades as it should due to its international origin, limited release, and somewhat controversial subject manner.<br/><br/>The film is the third of its kind to account Adolf Hitler's last 10 days in Berlin before his death (I highly doubt that this qualifies as a spoiler), and though I have not seen the previous two, I have no doubt that DER UNTERGANG is the best of the three, otherwise I surely would have heard more of those other movies.<br/><br/>I was informed that Der Fuhrer was presented in a rather sympathetic way in this film, which was the cause of some controversy, but upon viewing I can say that nothing can be further from the truth. Bruno Ganz presents Hitler as a vile, pathetic (not sympathetic), angry, short-tempered, megalomaniacal, bitter individual whose primary beliefs are a perversion of the theory of Natural Selection: that the weak must be left to perish while the strong survive, and any assisting of the weak (and hence Humanity in general) goes against Nature. Ganz's performance is captivating, and he steals every scene in which he appears, which is no surprise given his role. His presentation of Hitler is quite easily the best ever seen in cinematic history, and he owed a lot of his preparation to listening to previously hidden recordings of Hitler in his final days, as well as studying Parkinson's disease patients.<br/><br/>The cast, while mostly unknown outside Germany, does incredibly well, and there is no scene in which any cast member seems to falter to weaken the movie. While the film is primarily about Hitler, director Oliver Hirschbiegel has no hesitancies in broadening the scope of the film (quite effectively) to include 'bit-players', while still managing to keep the primary focus at the forefront of the viewer's thoughts. The one scene in which Hitler manages to escape the thoughts of the viewers is the bone-chilling and shocking scene coming down to the end involving a mother and her children. It is a scene that is difficult to stomach due to its subject matter and accurate portrayal; one that serves to highlight how dangerous such blind loyalties can become.<br/><br/>The film is as historically accurate as it is beautiful. I am an avid fan of good WWII flicks, and I have to say, in terms of presentation and historical accuracy, DER UNTERGANG has to rank as one of the finest. It is an awesome character study of one of the most malevolent beings in modern history, one that makes today's terrorists and super-villains seem like naughty children who lost their playthings. This is a truly riveting and well-crafted piece of cinema, whose subject matter is treated exceedingly well.<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 4). 9/10. Should enter my Top 100 at about 62 or so. Unreservedly recommended."

Even if you aren't a fan of History (which is a shame, ""those that don't learn from history, are doomed to repeat it"", great quote can't remember who said it) this is still a great film in of it self. It doesn't matter if you know the story or not because you will be fully engrossed once you start watching this superbly done film. I wouldn't have been able to appreciate this as much when I was younger *cough* teenager, like I can now, but if you miss out on this film It will be a shame. The fact that most of this film %%80-%90 percent of it is probably true too. This was extensively researched by those involved & the commentary by the director is extremely informative and interesting as well. By far one of the best commentaries I ever heard.

"rajdoctor","8","2","4","12 May 2008"," The Downfall
","With the interest to see a balanced view of Hitler during the 2008 holocaust week, this movie was recommended by colleague Andreas Hensel.<br/><br/>The movie is partly based on the book written by Traudl Junge (Alexandria Maria Lara), the final private secretary of Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) and it narrates the story of the final downfall of Germany to Allied forces. It shows Hitler in a very pensive, defeated mood due to the losses in the war. The movie also shows a more balance portrayal of Hitler (and not one-track characterization) as shown in the other movie Hitler  the Rise of Evil.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz has done a great job in being Hitler. Again like I said for Robert Carlyle who played Hitler in Rise of Evil, it is hard to believe any other person playing the role of Hitler as Bruno has done. Comparison is bound to take place, but both these actors have done justice to their roles  that show different portions of Hitler's life.<br/><br/>The over-shadowing dominance of Hitler over his commanders, and the helplessness of the situation the German army was in  worn out, marginalized, defeated  but still fighting, is saddening to see. Hitler was blindly worshipped by Germans, and there were people who literally believed that he is the ultimate savior  the God, and his words are final.<br/><br/>Hitler deciding his own suicide rather than surrendering, so that he can be remembered as a great hero  has not lasted in the pages of history, or did not last after the World War II. Today everyone treats him like a monster, and realizes the blunders of the holocaust.<br/><br/>An excellent movie by Director Oliver Hirschbiegel. Sadly this movie  though a brilliant one  did not win an Oscar in best foreign film category. I hear that there were people who did not like its nomination too in Oscars.<br/><br/>But I still wait for a real balanced portrayal of Hitler in a movie format. Does anyone know of such a movie that exists that I can watch? (Stars 8 out of 10)"

","Hitler is definitely one of the most enigmatic and larger-than-life personalities to have lived in the 20th century. His views, ideologies are very disturbing and smell of hatred and detest towards a particular community. His actions confirm his distorted view of the world and the amount of damage that it inflicted on humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>'The Downfall' captures the last few days in the life of this person as seen by a lady personal assistant. It is most certainly one of the best movies to have been made on Hitler. The Direction, cinematography, acting, are all top class. Most of the movie is shot inside the famed bunkers of Hitler.<br/><br/>Movie shows how Hitler in spite of realizing that the war was lost, kept on making fantasy plans of how he would be defending Germany while his closest troops stood in silence. One of the highlights of the movie is the portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. It is as if one is seeing Hitler himself, and not some actor trying to impersonate him. He is that good.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes leave a lasting impression. Like a mother poisoning her children, Hitler's assistants not leaving him even when they are sure that it will lead to death, Hitler's own suicide with his wife.<br/><br/>Do watch this movie, and get enthralled by a spectacle..."

","A wonderful and apparently historically accurate retelling of the final day's of Hitler and Nazi Germany. The actors were cast in a way so they resemble the historical figures quite closely, and the battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat. If anybody has ever watched LEXX, you will recognize Rolf Kanies playing Hans Krebs. His fluent Russian in real life came in handy as his character had to speak in Russian during the negotiations with General Tschuikov. The movie didn't try to make any particular character appealing, except maybe for Ernst Gunter-Schenk. Considering how this bunch of men were responsible for 50 million dead it was a good idea to not portray any of the characters as 'good guys' anyway.<br/><br/>There was an amazing amount of research put into the film. The uniforms strove to be accurate, even the weapons and sidearms were the kind you would have seen in 1945 such as the StG44. Probably the only slip-up was the Russian soldiers all had PPSh's, and none had the PPS, which was more commonly seen in 1945. The only other niggle was a reference to ""penicillin"" in a phone conversation from a field commander but the Germans didn't have penicillin during WWII."
"w-canaris","10","2","4","1 February 2008"," The best ww2 film ever made
","Well, let me say, regarding the historical accuracy, the costumes, the script, the performance of the actors, this is the best ww2 film ever. I read some competent historical books about what had happened those days( in the bunker, and all about the suicides). I must say, except the fact that gen. Bugdorf's body wasn't found in, so we can't yet proof 100% that he committed suicide, all the other details are driven from pure and liquid reality.(I mean of course the main suicides' scenes).<br/><br/>In other ways, the film is a very realistic description of ww2, 100%. Of course, it may bother some people who should read more before qualify all German's ww2 soldiers as Nazi criminals or getting a ""scape goat"" out of Germany for all the ww2 war crimes, because it simply isn't like that. All the belligerent parts have their one role in the number of innocent victims. The difference between German films of ww2 and the allied ones is that in the first category we find examples of crimes made including by their own former countrymen, which of course we don't find in the Russian, English and American films of this kind( except Letters of Iwo Jima, when that Japanese prisoner is murdered). Just see the film and you'll know what I'm talking about.<br/><br/>Also, a big mark of realism in the street-fights, huge amount of historical resources like uniforms, military equipment and other things that give the note of the historical accuracy.<br/><br/>About the actors, I must say, the one who plays Hitler is simply brilliant. Also you should watch closely Thomas Kretschmann and A.M. Lara in their acts. <br/><br/>Here you got to feel the last days of the European war from different perspectives, following Hitler, his secretary, his generals, a HJ young-boy, a medic, Eva Brown, etc; in each's personal type of struggle. Every minute you get the feeling of the collapse of an empire, when some choose to stay and face the downfall, others to escape by all means possible, others to die by their own hand and others to hope that after all had passed away, they will be strong enough to rebuild their lives..."
"valadas","9","2","4","14 November 2007"," The end of a human monster
","This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Its direction is almost perfect in all its aspects: sceneries, camera movements, screen-play, acting, technical features, etc.. The character of Hitler is so well performed by Bruno Ganz that we forget that we are before an actor and come to think we are before Hitler himself. The movie shows with striking realism all the contrast between the almost normal and quiet bunker scenes and the awful war ones taking place outside with all their fights and the drama lived by the civil population. Inside the bunker we watch the progressive psychological and physical decay of the dictator still surrounded for his few fanatic supporters still ready to die for him and his ideology when outside in the city all crumbles under Soviet fire. The mad man still believes the war can be won and in the map he moves military units and divisions that don't exist anymore. Since monsters can sometimes also be human beings we can watch sometimes a few human and even generous attitudes of Hitler and his followers. Some people have criticized this as attempts to show Hitler and the Nazis under a more favourable light. I don't agree with this. Realism is realism and must not be Manichean. If we want to know a human being (though a monster) in all his entirety we must know all of his or her features. The movie is realistic in all its aspects and with extreme rigour. All the characters act just like we expect them to do and incarnate extremely well the real people they are supposed to do. Particularly moving are the scenes where Frau Goebbels proceeds to poison their children before committing suicide with her husband, acting simultaneously like a tender and nice mother and an horrible monster. This movie is a real landmark in the history of cinema."

"christian_gil88","9","2","4","29 July 2007"," A stunning portrayal of evil and defeat.
","There are I think 4 films about the last days of Hitler, of which this is the latest. The others are : The Death of Adolph Hitler Frank Finlay January 1973 UK TV 107 mins. Hitler : The Last Ten Days Alec Guinness May 1973 108 mins. The Bunker Anthony Hopkins January 1981 USA TV 150 mins.<br/><br/>Which is the best ? Each has its own undoubted merits. I have recently viewed all of them again. All are riveting. All these films make for uncomfortable viewing. It should not be otherwise. The knowledge that these are in essence accounts of real events makes it so. All make attempts to be as accurate as the data to hand at the time allowed. Downfall is almost certainly the best all round and probably the most authentic account, despite the fact that I have an inbuilt dislike of watching subtitled films! (My German is not good enough to follow it without the subtitles). Of course, being German dialogue does give it added verisimilitude. Ganz is quite superb. Listening to the Director's commentary (on a separate audio track on the DVD  in English, thank goodness!) it is clear that the entire company had thought the whole film through thoroughly and used whatever they could in the way of documents and accounts to make it as accurate as possible  not just the events themselves, but the character of each of the players. The most horrifying and gripping scene in Downfall is not the sick rages of the demented maniac  made all the more effective by showing other sides of Hitler's personality  but the scene where Magda Goebbels kills her own children. Somehow, this awful act summarises the terrible regime that was allowed to infect the earth for 12 years. Sterling performances by all concerned."
"jzappa","9","2","4","6 July 2007"," Riveting
","Downfall views an extremely convincing, totally intriguing portrayal of Adolph Hitler, whom we know so much about, yet we are intensely engrossed in Bruno Ganz's performance. We have always known what he's done, but it takes an extremely well-directed, very powerful film like Downfall, showcasing Ganz in a lifetime's performance, to realize immediately that he saw so clearly and stubbornly his focal point in life. In scenes where he loses his temper, we see a man who is of course headstrong and violent, but not at all haywire. He had ideas etched in stone and when people did not understand, they suffered his wrath.<br/><br/>Also, rather than a safe, worried little American film that would never show him doing anything but screaming and massacring people, perhaps it takes the perspective of a German film, whose perspective not only counts greatly in a film about the Third Reich, quite obviously, but also, frankly, being a European film, is much more trustworthy in its appearance of honesty. The perspective of the main character, who is not Hitler but one of his naive secretaries, sees an authentically generous individual, who does have a questionable semblance of a heart, even when she sees him cruelly and disgustingly test poison on one of his loyal dogs. From a clever point of view of naivete, we actually see the raw Hitler unbiased, though we're aware of his inordinate viciousness, who is broad and extremely practical in his ways, yet his nature is so dominant that he frequently finds it rather difficult to work his loyal Nazis. As we hear him angrily snarl in his bunker, we hear an exceedingly determined monster who possesses unlimited faith in his own knowledge."
"galileo3","9","2","4","23 June 2007"," Humanizing Hitler...
","A compelling and provocative film detailing Hitler's last days.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is outstanding as the Fuhrer himself, in what I think was definitely a performance worthy of at least an Oscar Nomination.<br/><br/>Downfall does not involve the horrors of the Holocaust nor the bloody waters of the Normandy beaches, but the crumbling state of a disintegrating Germany where the SS is unable to withstand the Russians' ruthless assault and enclosure on Berlin.<br/><br/>This is an excellent account of the lives and troubles of Hitler and the men surrounding him in his final days as Germany kneels down for an inevitable surrender.<br/><br/>What this film does in an effort to document and visualise Hitler as a human and not as a monster is somehow admirable. It is rare to see an attempt to estimate this dictator as a human being; one that can be charming and polite and simultaneously switch into becoming a ruthless, brutal figure dictating the deaths of millions.<br/><br/>This is a heavy film. It is disturbing, distressing and depressing. However it is a wonderful recreation of the last days of Nazism and Hitler. Oliver Hirschbiegel's film is a masterful documentation of one of history' most tyrannous, but ultimately fascinating figures and the environment around him.<br/><br/>""An intense, human masterpiece"" <br/><br/>""Bruno Ganz is superb.

"startrek-22","9","2","4","8 May 2007"," review of Downfall
","With this film I did not know what to expect at first. But after I finished watching it I believe that this could be one of the best and most honest war film I have ever seen. This is a German film about Hitlers last Days in the Berlin bunker. Unlike certain British and especially American films that take a moral high ground, this film is a brutally honest account of what happened without judging the morality of any of the characters, good or bad, it just tells the truth as best it can. The story gripped me from start to finish and at the end there is an important message for all who see it. This film also shows how ignorance can kill but if not stopped can do more damage than you could ever expect, for instance, Madga Gorbells kills her 6 children when she realises that the war is lost because she believes, wrongly, that a life after Nazism is no life to live. After this she and her husband both kill themselves. Also Hitlers secretary shows us that no matter how naive you are that is never an excuse not to find out what evil others are doing, even if done in secret. And this is the lesson that we must all learn. Just because we don't know about things does not give us an excuse to do nothing because we can always find a way to figure it out. And once we do that we can all stop the evil that is around us a little bit at a time."
"hupfons5","10","2","4","19 November 2006"," Award-Winning Dramatic Masterpiece
","A powerfully disturbing portrayal of the last days of the 3rd Reich with riveting performances by the entire cast. Be prepared for an intense, rewarding experience on this one. From the brief documentary remarks of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge at the outset of the film until the hopeful conclusion, this tour de force will give you plenty to think about long after the final credits fade. This is one of the best World War II films ever made.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz gives an award-winning performance. He's chillingly convincing in his finely nuanced portrayal of Hitler during the last years of his demonic life -- from his amazingly patient, grandfatherly treatment of his secretary to his tyrannical rages with his senior military leaders. You won't see many performances better than this.<br/><br/>To the credit of the film's director and its casting director, the supporting cast is uniformly strong and gives compelling performances. One of the most noteworthy supporting performances is the sinister portrayal of Frau Goebbels by Corinna Harfouch. Magda Goebbels appears throughout most of the film to be an attentive mother (and political enthusiast) who prides herself at molding her 6 children into model National Socialist wunderkinder. In the film's climactic moments Ms. Harfouch convincingly portrays the pathology of Frau Goebbels' excessive glorification of the Fuhrer and his delusional ideology. Her heinous ""crime"" against nature will shock and outrage many viewers.<br/><br/>Not surprisingly, the sound effects and musical score artfully heighten the emotional intensity of the drama and suspense that unfold on screen. After the first few opening scenes of the film, which take place outside of Berlin in November 1942, the setting shifts to the bomb-riddled streets of Berlin. The 5.1 surround sound of the incoming artillery shells accentuates not only the sudden location and time change (to April 1945), but even more ominously it then continues a funereal cadence of pounding artillery explosions during the next 20 or so minutes, signaling the death knell of Hitler's crumbling empire.<br/><br/>The musical score also provides an almost haunting backdrop to the malevolence of the Nazi hierarchy, which in the final days of the 3rd Reich cold-bloodedly inflicts a horrific toll on its own German citizens. These effects clearly signal that film director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a film that is destined to become a classic.<br/><br/>Although the Special Features on the DVD release are limited, they are worth watching. The MAKING OF, while running for 50+ minutes, helps to introduce many of the principal characters of this large cast, as well as provide some interesting behind the scenes comments about the film. The INTERVIEW with Melissa Muller, who wrote a book about Hitler's secretary's memoirs is well worth watching.<br/><br/>Don't miss this one!"

I think most creative film makers leave stuff like that to the imagination, but in this case the depiction was devastating in it's intensity and detail.<br/><br/>When I left the film I felt like I was escaping the bunker. Strange thing is, I feel like going back. I thought I knew about this subject and thought I'd read or seen most of what matters about Hitler and his ideas and methods.

"extravaluejotter","8","2","4","1 September 2006"," A Difficult Perspective
","Everyone knows how WWII turned out, unless they don't teach it in schools anymore. A man called Adolf Hitler stepped into the political vacuum left behind after WWI, united the German people behind him and tried to conquer the world. He was one of the most charismatic leaders of the 20th Century and within a decade he had most of western Europe under his control.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for Hitler, he chose to take on the might of the USSR and the USA so by 1945 (when the film is set) his ""Thousand Year Empire"" was shrinking down to the hundred or so square miles around Berlin, Germany's capital city.<br/><br/>""Der Untergang"" (Downfall) dares to portray Hitler as a human being and has been criticised for doing so. I think that this is unfair because the film does not set out to give us a history lesson. The atrocities committed in Hitler's name are hardly mentioned, but why should they be? Why should every film about WWII have to tell us why it had to be fought? <br/><br/>""Der Untergang"" was made by intelligent people and it asks us to be intelligent as we view it. Hitler never saw what his followers did at Belsen. Hitler never saw what his followers did to Russian civilians. Hitler never fought at Stalingrad, Salerno or the Ardennes. During WWII, he never waded in blood. He just gave orders and dreamed of a German empire. ""Der Untergang"" shows him as reality finally intrudes on his fantasies. It also shows some of his most loyal followers trying to deal with the fact that their leader has been revealed as psychologically damaged and physically broken. <br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is outstanding as the man who ordered counterattacks by armies that had already been wiped out. If ""Der Untergang"" is guilty of anything, it is guilty of showing us the suffering of the German people as their Fuhrer abandoned them to their fate."

I was impressed for the movie because of the face and the acts of the actors really represent the real situation of the Nazi regimes at that time. I love this movie so much. Although, i don't understand German language, i can feel the atmosphere of the war and i wonder how if i live in the bunker like that. Almost all of the actors and the actresses in this movie are the elite German-speaking actors and actresses. They deserved to be the elite actors and actresses in the world.

"fordixieland61","10","2","4","27 August 2006"," finally a good film on the war in Europes final days
","Alright first and foremost Hitler was a horrible man. He was a murderer, and a war-monger. But Hitler was a person as much as I hate to admit it. As a society we cannot always see things one way, we must make revisions and reexaminations of the past and Downfall does that. For 60 years 99% of all World War II movies have been shown from point of view, the Allies. And they always portray Hitler as one type of person without explanation. This movie gave it's best shot and it did it. Hitler needs to be shown for what he really was and how he really acted, and he is in this movie. He isn't the same dictator that is shown in all the other war movies as the bumbling, psychotic, egotistical maniac. This film he is still mentally unbalanced and egotistical, and a maniac when he states that it is best for the German people to be thrown back into the middle ages since they have failed in his plan to win the war. And when he invents divisions to defend Berlin from the Soviets. No movie has done that before and this for changing the way Hitler is looked upon is in my minds eye a masterpiece."
"redeyereview","9","2","4","27 April 2006"," IN SHORT: A fascinating, shocking, moving film. INCREDIBLE ACTING.
","This is a German film about the last few days of the war and Hitler's reign as seen from within the walls of the Fuhrer's bunker. We are given a unique perspective of the desperate last few moments of Germany's dictator as his mental state becomes more unstable and he swings from fantasies of a last minute victory with invisible forces to hopelessness and a vengeful sense of betrayal. We are also given a glimpse of the horror faced by ordinary Berliners as a result of the overwhelming assault of allied forces.<br/><br/>Downfall is a very well made film it has some incredible effects and depicts the brutality and destruction of war as well as any war film I have ever seen. The film also avoids limiting it's portrayal of the main events and characters within the story with a well-rounded and realistic visual explanation of the madness of war.<br/><br/>What really makes this film something special is the acting. Bruno Ganz's depiction of Adolf Hitler is incredible. Not only is he able to recreate the famous power and zeal, he is also shows us the human side of the leader and his connection with those within his inner circle. This is essential for us to understand why so many followed him through the madness, and also enables us to mark the insanity of his anti-semitic mandate.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast support beautifully and the attention to detail with the costumes and sets captures the time perfectly. I was blown away by this film and as long as you don't mind education as much as entertainment you must see this film."
"frank.jaeger","9","2","4","24 April 2006"," There is a longer, even better TV version
","Probably difficult to get, and only for viewers who speak German, but recently there was a longer version on German TV. It did not add much to the story, but it displayed even more atmospheric scenes, and every scene with Bruno Ganz as Hitler is worth seeing and witnessing the insanity of the events over 60 years ago. In total, the extended TV version adds about 26 minutes to the film, totaling 175 minutes. The German version has English subtitles (I quote the German DVD technical information since I watched it on TV, not DVD). If you can watch, it, it is worth it. It is likely, though, that it will be close to never that it will appear in any other language. I remember the movie Das Boot which hit the screen only in a cut version. Recently, it came out on DVD in German language with English subtitles for the first time. So it may be you need a code free DVD player to be able to watch the Region Code 2 German DVD to get the whole story film."
"KingWright","9","2","4","15 April 2006"," Absolutely stunning. This movie will numb you from head to toe.
","I will keep this reaction brief, as to not try and dig too deep into my mind for words, because, in all honesty, there will never be enough to fully describe how enthralling this film truly is.<br/><br/>Telling the story of Hitler's final days, shot almost entirely from the bunker in which he took his last breaths, Downfall is a film that enlightens; it will show you that no matter how cold the blood or how black the heart, human emotion is unavoidable. This, in my opinion, is best seen in the eyes of Bruno Ganz, who does a superb portrayal of the ruthless dictator, when the time draws near to take his own life. As a viewer, you can feel his uncertainty about the situation that he endures; you can sense almost a mild fear in him as the thought crosses his mind. His body language conveys the tremendous amount of stress he under as the doctor sits down with him and gives him advice on the 'best way' to commit suicide. It chills to the bone.<br/><br/>However, no scene will pull your heart as if it were tied to a one thousand pound weight than the murder of Ms. Goebbel's children by Goebbel herself. It invokes mass hatred towards both her and her husband, Dr Goebbel, as he could not gather himself to do it, thus forcing the deed on his wife. Either way you tilt the balance, though, the length of the scene and the realism it provokes will haunt you, and it is certainly NOT for the emotionally weak.<br/><br/>There are handfuls of scenes, lines, and other small details in this film that make it as fantastic as it is, albeit depressing and bleak. All one needs to do is browse these message boards to learn about them all, but I highly suggest you see for yourself. If you are a war or movie enthusiast, this film should not go unwatched. Just prepare to be shaken."

","I think every person on earth should be required to view this film. I can think of no other film that does as good of job of relaying the horrors of war and in particular, the tragedy that the Nazis brought upon Germany. Certainly nobody could dare to profess an admiration for Hitler after seeing what he did to Germany. This film helps relate those last few days as Nazi leaders cower in their bunker and bark orders to other Germans on the outside to keep fighting and dying. Moreover, when we are forced to view the deaths of the six Goebbels children, well, it is almost too much. The performances and the writing are just top notch. I don't think I have ever seen a movie so realistic in details and this is of course because the movie is based on the testimony of Germans that were actually there experiencing this as it happened. Powerful, very powerful"
"delaboy","10","2","4","19 January 2006"," Best Film
","Der Untergang is the best film to have appeared on screens for the last couple of years. No director, producer, actor, writer or even cinematographer has been able to capture and represent on screen something so powerful for a long time. This film exceeds even the highest expectations as it presents a body of work to teach and exhibit rather than to tell the story of the man that was Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>Such subject matter has been tried and tested before with mediocre, stereotyping results that serve to condemn Hitler and his followers. Hitler WAS AN EVIL MAN - BUT WHAT THIS FILM DOES UNLIKE OTHERS, IS SHOW BOTH PARTS OF THAT STATEMENT...YES, HE WAS EVIL, BUT- HE WAS ALSO A MAN. Thus, it gives us the monster and the man - never forgiving him or excusing him. It shows us the disturbing truth of madness grappling society.<br/><br/>The film tells us how such atrocities can take place, how his followers were swept up by his charisma and personality (Bruno Ganz as you are probably aware is amazing in this film portraying the fuhrer so well that there is no doubt that he is Hitler), how madness finally outdid itself and how Hitler died.<br/><br/>Not for the faint hearted, Der Untergang is as shockingly brutal as it is mind-blowing beautiful. It paints a terrible beauty that was Berlin with haunting visuals of the underground chambers and mesmerising scenes of fire and chaos. It is both a condemnation and celebration of the human psyche and soul. Through great direction and acting we are shown the most low, horrific and dangerous of human capabilities whilst leaving us with an uplifting message of how life can go on.<br/><br/>THE DOWNFALL OF THE MOVIE'S TITLE IS NOT SO MUCH REFERRING TO HITLER'S BUT THAT OF ALL HUMANKIND. The message of this film is not concerned with the evils of Hitler but the verge of that evil within ourselves. THE BEST FILM I SAW IN CINEMAS IN 2005."

","An excellent movie. Finally, a movie that transmits the bunker mentality. Many films have failed to deliver this impression. This movie is accurate, well written and thoughtful. The scene of the death of the Goebbles children is beyond reproduction. This is how it must have happened. The last scene, with Junge leaving the Russians without interference is amazing. If you want true, historical cinema about the end of the Reich, look no further. This movie is a most for those who teach history. The opening scene re-enacts the famous photograph of Hitler handing out crosses to youngsters. His hands trembling with paralysis. Also, the role of the those who hung ""deserters"" is vivid. The old man in the cap, who hangs the innocent, yet hides from the red army is all so real."

","Bruno Ganz is perfect as Hitler! This fact alone would make the movie worth seeing, but there is more than that. It as a precise account of how the madness ruled in the last days of Hitler reign: how he let the country suffer and when he realized that inevitable end, how he said that Germans did deserve the fall. The film showed a lot of futile deaths: ten year old recruits falling in the streets of Berlin fighting against the Russians, deserters shot by Gestapo patrols. It also showed Hitler's power over the people who still obeyed him and many of them also followed his example and committed suicide in the last days. Perhaps the most shocking was Frau Gobbels, who murdered her six children, saying that it was not worth living in a world without Nazism. All in all, the film was shocking and it gave you a strong warning: beware fanatic dictators!"

The ""Downfall"" of Hitler, and what actually took place in the bunker those last days, even though it may have been show in History, has never been explained in such detail. Downfall was a terrific film. The precision of the performances, most notably by Ganz was so true to the reality that was World War 2. It is a true eye opener to what it may have been like. The story is told from the perspective of Frau Junge, a young secretary for Hitler who finds herself in a situation that she was never get out of. Trapped in the world of propaganda, and working for the man who was key to mass murder of 6 million Jews.<br/><br/>The cinematography and use of camera angles was amazing. Moving and changing to adjust mood and space. Hitler grows from a figure of power, to a pitiful man who is mad with jealously, anger and hate for anyone and everyone. The acting was bar none. It was like history was playing out for you. Bruno Ganz is an amazing actor. I can't imagine how difficult it would be to portray such a man to the perfection Ganz performed. Eva Braun was a particularly interesting character. Her dysfunctional manner and inability to find the appropriateness in any situation was unsettling. I will hand to to the cast and crew of Downfall, you sent shivers down my spine. The brutish, cruel and rather sad life od Adolf Hitler, and the blinded dedication he was shown by his Nationalist-Socialist followers was so disturbing. If there is one criticism of the film, it would have to be the realism of it all. It was too real! This really isn't a criticism at all. It only emphasizes my point that this film was of the highest quality.<br/><br/>The Teutonic and harsh manner of the German was amazing. Scenes of despair and utter loss, yet the ability to get up and move on for the ""sake"" of National-Socialism. The idea was terrifying that people could be such blind followers. To be sucked into entirely and be pleased with the idea of murder, racism and anger. Downfall is not to be missed. If you do not wish to delve into intellectual discussion and would rather a film like ""Bring it On Again"", then perhaps this is not for you. This movie is for thinkers.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it enjoyable, but it certainly is addictive. It is a great movie."

","Berlin April 1945: The Red Army has launched it's last great offensive of the Second World War with a massive armored and infantry assault on the German capital. Deep inside a bunker underneath the German Reichstag is the German Fhurer Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz,and his general staff conducting the last desperate defense of the city but time is quickly running out with even the most fanatical and optimistic of them, with the exception of Hitler, know that the end is near and are looking to somehow escape from this hell on earth or at least negotiate a surrender with the attacking Soviets forces. It's these historic days during the spring of 1945 that are covered in the movie ""Downfall"".<br/><br/>Explosive and blood-splattering film with an Acdemy Award caliber performance by Bruno Ganz as the German leader Adolf Hitler as his nation is being clobbered with daily and nightly one thousand plane bombing raids from the air and with millions of allied troops, on two fronts,swarming across it's borders on land putting an end to the Third Reich that he brought into power in Germany back in 1933. The total pandemonium that struck that city is realistically and graphically depicted in the movie that's based on the memories of Hitler's personal secretary Traudl Junge, Alexandra Maria Lara, who was working for him in that capacity since 1942.<br/><br/>One of the best movies about Hitler ever made has him shown in a very different light then the usual portrayals that were used to seeing him in the scores of films made about Hitler, and WWII, over the years. Wild threatening and hysterical towards his generals when things aren't going right, which in the movie was almost all the time, Hitler showed his ""human side"" when it came to his personal staff. Insisting that they leave the city before it fell to the dreaded Red Army and also being grateful to them when they refuse and wanted to stay, and kill themselves, along with him when the end came.<br/><br/>There's a great scene in the bunker when Hitler realizes that the ""great offensive"" that he expected by German General Steiner's 9th Army, to smash the Soviets and throw them out of Berlin, never materialized because he, Steiner, didn't have the men and tanks to do the job. Completely losing it and letting his generals have it Hitler at last finally realized, with the later defection of his two top honchos SS leader Himmler & second in command Goering, that the war was lost. Hitler then instead of trying to escape from the doomed city decided to stay at his post, as the German Chief of State, until it's defense was no longer possible then end it all by putting a bullet in his head.<br/><br/>Terrifying scenes with blood and guts and body parts flying in all directions with even the Germans themselves, the Army and Nazi Gestapo, shooting hundreds of German soldiers and civilians who were trying to flee the city, to save their lives, for disobeying orders and not standing and fighting to the last man and woman like their Fhurer ordered them to.<br/><br/>With all the horrors in the movies ""Downfall"" the one that struck me most, even though it was very minor compared to the rest of the carnage in the film, was the murder by the Nazi Misnister of Propaganda Joseph Gobbels and his wife Magda, Ulrich Matters & Corinna Harfouch, of their six young children by poisoning them as they were asleep. Determined to both kill themselves the Gobbels' didn't even want their children to survive the war saying that there's no reason for them to live in a world without National Socialism or their ""beloved Fhurer"" Adolf Hitler or uncle Adolf as he was efficiently called by them. the movie ""Downfall"" showed more then anything else how right the Union Civil War General Sherman was in his famous statement ""War is Hell""."
"verheyen_geer","9","2","4","23 June 2005"," great sober film, best Hitlerfilm ever made!
","'Der Untergang' (Downfall) has got a lot of comment when he released because Adolf Hitler would be 'too much human.' I don't support the man's ideas but I'm convinced that also he could love; he loved his dog a lot and he loved his wife just like any other human.<br/><br/>In this movie we see a Adolf Hitler with two faces: the Hitler as militair and the Hitler as human. Hitler can be very loving but also very angry and hard. <br/><br/>In this movie is Adolf Hitler played by Bruno Ganz and he's the best Hitler in the movieworld! (That's of course only my opinion but believe me, I have already seen many movieHitlers) Bruno Ganz is so good in playing this two faced Hitler: first you see him with a smile on face, giving his wife a hug and the next moment you see him really angry yelling to his generals. Great!<br/><br/>Because the movie plays the most of the time in a bunker, it's a very sober movie. Sober movies are not necessarily bad movies (look to 'Million Dollar Baby' or 'Batman Begins') and concerning the subject of this movie it must be a sober movie!<br/><br/>I can not believe that this film hasn't won an Oscar last year. He really was the best nominee for the category Foreign Language Film and my opinion is that Bruno Ganz deserved at least a nomination for Best Actor In A Leading Role, but the (conservative) Academy has decided....<br/><br/>However, 'Der Untergang' is a great movie who everybody must have seen. It's a movie about war, but also love, sentimentality and to lose your sense of reality..."
"cacnie","10","2","4","8 June 2005"," Perfectly Done!!!
","From the moment I saw the preview for this movie I wanted to see it. It did not fall short of my expectations at all. Every bit of this film is perfect! From the acting, to the visuals, to the story, it all falls into place taking the viewer's breath away. I think it is perfect that a movie has been done to portray Hitler at the end, not just the persecution of the Jews. It's very interesting to look at WWII from this perspective. Much like Schindler's List it is very easy for the viewer to be taken in by this film, knowing that the ""main"" character is a real person and not a fictitious story teller reading from a history book. I would recommend this movie to anyone. This movie has made it to my personal top ten."
"hedwards-4","10","2","4","23 May 2005"," Amazing
","I really enjoyed this film. The atmosphere in Hitler's bunker as Berlin fell all around it was reconstructed extremely well. The filmmakers did a brilliant job of recreating Berlin in the midst of battle. It actually felt like I was there. When we emerged from the darkened cinema my companions said that they felt as if they had just spent three hours in a bunker. The acting was amazing, particularly Bruno Ganz as an all-too human dictator and Corinna Harfouch with her chillingly calm performance as Magda Goebbels. I could not bring myself to watch as Frau Goebbels killed her children by placing cyanide capsules in their mouths and pushing their jaws together. It is such a shame that these German actors who are at least as talented as their Hollywood counterparts are confined to German language films. Some people have criticised Downfall for humanising Hitler but this was one of the reasons why it is a such a good and important film- we need to be reminded that there were people behind these terrible crimes, not monsters. 'Evil is banal.'"
"kterz","10","2","4","21 May 2005"," Definitely on my top 10 list
","After reading two dozens of posts for this film, I was not sure if I needed to write my own comment. Many other posters covered what I wanted to say. But as a tribute to the film, I feel obligated to write these lines so as to carve my own niche on the wall of posts for this great movie.<br/><br/>Der Untergang is a film of sheer excellence. From the uber-solid acting to the great camera-work, from the bleak internal and external sets to the ultra realistic explosions this film tries to raise the bar of movie-making - and excels at it.<br/><br/>The film has a great cast of actors. I recognized 2 actors from the other film of the same director - ""Das Experiment"" which I also liked very much. The performance of Bruno Ganz as Adolf Hitler must be seen to be believed. The director seems to be relying very much upon his performance, and Ganz does not disappoint at all. It is truly the best performance i've seen in years. The other performances are also pretty solid and complement Ganz without a single glitch in performances. The German language adds a lot to the realism, and I could safely say that this movie would lose a lot of points if English or American actors were used.<br/><br/>The external locations are incredible and occupy the majority of the film, adding a dark and claustrophobic feel to the entire movie. I was immersed in the film from the start and I really felt that I was in this bunker. The photography and camera-work are top notch.<br/><br/>The fact that this is a WW2 movie made by Germans scared me at first, expecting to find propagandistic elements in it. At the end I was satisfied that this was untrue, although one cannot avoid to feel sympathetic for the character that Ganz portrays: A madman on the last days of WW2 in Berlin."
"sergiocarvalho","8","2","4","2 May 2005"," History on film, told in a superb form
","Excellent, truly excellent movie. Don't miss on this one. Der Untergang tells a part of Europe's recent history from a different perspective. More than the perspective, it is very pleasant to watch -- in the sense that it lasts over two hours and time flies; the movie is rather heavy otherwise. Expect violent scenes, and war portrayed as the awful event it is.<br/><br/>Der Untergang translates as The Downfall or The Decline. The movie exposes Hitler's and its inner group's last days in Berlin, as the Soviet takeover became unavoidable. It is based off reports from Hitler's secretary, so should be somewhat accurate. You even get a short interview clip with her remembering that period of her life, by the end of the movie, which, to me, reinforced how recent WW2 is.<br/><br/>You get the idea that Hitler is mad or maddening, which was, to me, unexpected. From what the press is writing, I went to the theater expecting a human view of the dictator. It is not. Hitler is clearly a madman.<br/><br/>I was not disappointed, however. In that period, it is natural he was in an extreme, and losing his edge. On the contrary, I came out wishing there was another movie telling the story of his rise to power from such a intimate angle.<br/><br/>I'm still surprised how a modern democracy was able to give its power to a madman. Hitler must have had a perfect public image back then, and studying how democracy failed with him is a most interesting topic, certainly interesting for a movie."
"rogerdarlington","Null","2","4","1 May 2005"," A worthy and important work
","This is the first German film in 50 years in which Hitler is a central character and almost five million Germans have seen it at the cinema, so it is clearly an important work which represents a honest attempt to face the nation's history in a manner which would be unthinkable from present-day Japan. Of course, this real life version of Gotterdammerung is familiar material to viewers of a certain age or education, but nevertheless the narrative - the last 10 days of the Fuhrer's infamous life - is utterly compelling.<br/><br/>The work is an immense achievement for Bernd Eichinger who both wrote and produced it. Although based on two detailed accounts of the claustrophobic life in the bunker - ""Until The Final Hour"" by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge (from whose perspective the film is shot) and ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by German historian Joachim Fest - Eichinger has clearly done enormous research and has attempted to root all the significant scenes in a documentary source. He was aided by a fine director Oliver Hirschbiegel and a sizeable (for a European work) budget ($16M).<br/><br/>Above all though, the film works because of the mesmerizing performance of the Swiss German actor Bruno Ganz as the dictator losing all sense of reality as his dream of a thousand-year Reich is blasted away by Soviet artillery and - as he sees it - the lack of will of the German people. Among a uniformly excellent cast, Ulrich Matthes gives a chilling portrayal as Joseph Goebbels and the scene where Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels murders their six children, because she cannot bear them to live without National Socialism, is the most disturbing in a work that could haunt one for a long time through its violent images.<br/><br/>The movie is framed by events involving the secretary Traudl Junge: her job 'interview' in 1942 by a Hitler who seems interested only in that she is from his beloved Munich and an extract from an interview that she recorded just before her death in 2002 when she admits that her youth was no excuse for not thinking about her political seduction. This framing device works well, as does the concluding reminder of the war's toll (six million Jews killed and a total of 60M deaths) and of the post-war experience of the leading characters.<br/><br/>Any work about Hitler and especially one by a German production team is bound to attract controversy. The film has been criticised by reviewers for making Hitler too human, but I think that Eichinger has answered this well by insisting: ""If he had been a monster rather than a man, it would take the guilt away from other people"". It has also been challenged by historians for not making clear the Nazi background of Junge and the war crimes of some of the characters who are portrayed more sympathetically than others, but even a work of this scope cannot indulge in so much back-filling.<br/><br/>A final danger is that the film might be seen as representing at least elements of the German forces as valiant fighters to the last and the German people themselves as in a sense victims of Hitler's mania, but I feel that a balanced assessment of the work would acquit it of such a charge. My wife and I saw ""Downfall"" with a Jewish couple who are very close friends and who, between them lost four grand-parents in the Holocaust. They too found it a worthy work which is sufficient validation for me."
"ThrownMuse","8","2","4","26 April 2005"," Captivating with stunning performances and a powerful underlying message
","This is a dramatized account of Hitler's final days in his bunker at the end of World War II. The story is told partly through the eyes of his most fervent supporters as well as his last secretary, Traudl Junge. Downfall is a cinematic triumph that has the potential to be completely misunderstood, but it seems most critics and viewers are grasping it. The filmmakers assume the audience is familiar with the history of the Holocaust, and focuses solely on Hitler and his interactions with his loyal supporters and family at the end of his reign. The story is a bit uneven and has trouble deciding whether it's Hitler's narrative or Jungle's narrative. But ultimately, it is a character study of Hitler in his final days--a man who wanted to retain his power so badly that he wanted to sacrifice the German civilians that he claimed to be saving. It is also a portrait of a group of people who are so unquestionably zealous in their beliefs and how they react to the destruction of their power. The performances are haunting and emotional, especially by Bruno Ganz (Hitler), Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge), and Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun). Some might think this is an insensitive film or ""sympathetic"" to Hitler, but this is not how I saw it. This is an important film and exactly what the world needs right now. Hitler wasn't a monster that should be seen as an anomaly in the human race. He was a human being capable of monstrosities. There are plenty of people today with political power that are committing monstrosities and they shouldn't be followed blindly.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8/10."
"houndtang75","10","2","4","8 April 2005"," Brilliant
","Downfall is truly an excellent film. One of those rare pictures where you can forget you are watching actors and actually believe in them as the real people they are playing. Bruno Ganz is uncanny as Hitler, and the supporting cast is uniformly fine. There is no music, just the dull thud of the Russian shells in the background. Although there have been many war films, the fall of Berlin, one of the most dramatic events of the 20th Century, has been neglected by filmmakers. It's good that it is a German film that has brought this period to the forefront again. I think every secondary school pupil should have to see this film, it is a piece of moving history as well as a gripping piece of cinema."
"tfn65125","10","2","4","8 April 2005"," A Masterpiece. Seen it twice, will see it again.
","** CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS** <br/><br/>I think I can say that this film has elevated itself to my personal favourite war film - and I've seen a few! Not only does it offer a gripping, bone-jarring realism that all war films should strive for - it also disturbs and leaves the viewer with many questions. It encourages the viewer/ amateur historian to seek out more information that the film can only hint at. Why did General Krebs speak fluent Russian (I know that one - he was a former military attache in Moscow before 1941). Who was Professor Schenk, and was SS General Mohnke really so utterly fearless and devoted to his dubious Master?? What was in Hitler's last political testament (I believe he claimed that he did not want war and offered to disarm etc) Perhaps such films should be required viewing in schools? <br/><br/>Although I will definitely buy the DVD (you can buy this now on the German Amazon site Amazon.de - DVD HAS English sub-titles), this is a film to see in the cinema. There is no substitute for a big screen filling your vision and the whole cinema vibrating to the sound of Soviet artillery shells......."
"WildCoast","10","2","4","8 April 2005"," Amazing movie!
","I think the makers of historically based films have a great responsibility, it is their duty to mankind and history to show things 'as they were'. I think this movie has done just that, shown 'truth' without propaganda, with out black and white heroes and villains...something very hard to do when dealing with the history of Nazi Germany. Especially in regard to WWII, too many films and books still have this 'post cold war hang over'.<br/><br/>This movie is really one of a kind because there is just so little out there dealing with the end of the Reich (most films are about victory, while this one is about the defeat part of that victory)."
"jdesando","9","2","4","7 April 2005"," Eminently worth seeing.
","Enough has been written about Adolph Hitler, but not enough for the screen. There need be no more after you see ""The Downfall"" grimly presenting the Fuhrer's last days of his life in 1945 in his bunker. Bruno Ganz is the definitive Hitler: morose, fitful, tender, murderous, and demented. Ganz not only looks like Hitler, but he also inhabits his character with passion and possibly an understanding of his premiere place in the halls of historical hooligans. (The chance that Ganz does too close an interpretation is possible for the purists.) Ganz is able at the same time to flesh out some charm and warmth without a measure of sympathy for a certifiable despot. The scene where her hires his secretary (the only one not in the bunker area), Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), has a tenderness uncharacteristic of the public tyrant. This screenplay depends partly on that secretary's memoirs.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger provides the dialog that reveals the madness; for example: ""If the war is lost, it is immaterial if the German people survive. I will shed not one tear for them."" Eichinger adds insights about the willingness of the German people to be led by Hitler, who worked their racism and Xenophobia into a scheme of world domination only to have the world unify against them.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Hirschbiegel guides a stunningly believable scene showing the horrible obedience to Hitler that allowed the Goebbels parents to poison their children rather than live in a ""world without National Socialism."" Magda Goebbels goes beyond Medea when she transforms her six children into corpses with a deft movement too macabre to be described in words. The softness of the children and the cool of Magda's tormented act are more than the luck of good acting; they depend on a perfect mise en scene only a director can create.<br/><br/>Escaping Hitler but not banality, Heinrich Himmler wonders, ""When I meet Churchill, should I give the Nazi salute, or shake his hand?"" Equally clueless but not without insight about the madman's character is Eva Braun, Hitler's new wife, when she says to his secretary, ""He only talks about dogs and vegetarian meals. He doesn't want anyone to see deep inside of him."" Nominated for best foreign language film of 2004 The Downfall takes us deep inside the bunker and partially into the depth of Hitler. It's not pretty there, but it is eminently worth seeing."
"baselle","10","2","4","3 April 2005"," Milton's West Wing episode
","I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I'm still trying to sort my feelings out. I can't really add much more to other reviews (best WWII movie yet made, Bruno Ganz's performance, several moments of silence by the audience after the movie ended). The semi-documentary style, accretion of detail (right down to the labels on the canned food) and sound of Russian mortars put me in an ever-circling, claustrophobic milieu of despair and violence that I would hope to never experience. Just from an American perspective, the feel of it and the movement of the action (lots of corridors) reminded me of a weird, but amazing mix of Das Boot and a satanic episode of The West Wing. I was sucked in immediately.<br/><br/>The fascination for me, though was in the behavior of all of the other characters - human rats in a sinking ship. Why would you stay? Why would you fight? How and where would you flee? Why would you keep such an obvious evil going even after the Fuehrer was gone? Why suicide? Russian retribution, or your conscience catching up with you? <br/><br/>Re: the criticism that Hitler was portrayed with some shreds of humanity. It reminds me a bit of the criticism that Milton got when he wrote Paradise Lost. We have to remember that Hitler was a human being, not Cthulhu with a mustache. Thinking of Hitler only as a monster doesn't help us recognize and defeat the next human monster who can do most unspeakable acts yet are kind to their staff and love their pets and spouses.<br/><br/>---- SPOILER ALERT ---- <br/><br/>The ending didn't particularly work for me, not because it was relatively upbeat, but it seemed too pat and broke with the painstaking detail of the last 2.5 hrs. Sunshine is fine, but there is no way that two people would be traveling alone on a road out of Berlin."
"sala-mander","10","2","4","3 April 2005"," This has to have been the most powerful cinematic experience I have
","The depiction of Hitler's deterioration throughout the days before the fall of Berlin is extremely moving, and Bruno Ganz carries the role with perfect execution. But the point the film makes which struck me hardest was the loyalty to Hitler. That people were willing to not only kill themselves but also their children lest the grow up in a world with out the Nazi ideals was shocking, and really hit home that people did believe so strongly. Even after his death, that they refused to go against his orders in the face of death...<br/><br/>I, as a half German, was particularly moved by this film. The way WW2 is taught, the Nazis are inhuman and almost unreal, but this film really brought their humanness to the surface, and has helped me to understand them and perhaps even understand a little more of their motives."

","This movie really depicted the utter destruction Germany went through under Hitler. It showed how Hitlers madness lead him to the deaths of millions and the people of Germany paid for it. Its amazing the Germany has recovered from the effects of the war but still the wounds of history remain. The acting was superb in the movie especially Bruno Ganz who plays Hitler was awesome he deserves all the praise. The suffering the people went through at that time i cannot even imagine thank god i was not alive in 1945. The movie starts in 1945 and Hitler chooses an assistant. The movie gave me the impression that Hitler was mentally ill leading him to commit crimes against humanity which the German people had to pay for his doings.

","This movie was fantastic. It truly represents the talented film making that comes from the European market without the Hollywood budget. The actors portray their roles fantastically, you believe you are seeing the real Hitler, Goebbels, etc. The film goes deep enough to allow you to understand the mindset of the characters, given the circumstances they are in. It does so in a manner which prevents you from slouching in your seat for even a moment of this film, which runs a good part of two and a half hours. It masterfully dances on a line, balancing the viewer on an emotional tightrope between sympathy and anger for the characters. The thing that was the most impressive was the fact that there was no Hollywood sub-plot, that we all too often see with major motion pictures. This movie just focuses on Berlin, under siege, with no fictional heroes- only one inevitable conclusion- utter capitulation. This movie is well worth any price of admission."

","A somewhat unique film by the Germans about the end of WW II. It shows the final days of Nazi Germany and SS officers close up from the inside of Hitler's bunker in Berlin, as the Russian red army is closing in on them. Powerful, intimate, honest, real, painful, brutal.<br/><br/>The entire film actually has no scene of Germans killing a single Jew. How refreshing! Yes, I know that they killed 6 million Jews, but that story has been told a thousand times. Instead, this time it is the Germans killing each other and themselves. Some very horrific and disturbing scenes of the brain-washed SS officers poisoning their own children to death. How can any human being do such a thing? No one -- unless you have gone completely mad, which certainly they had. It also has a detailed account of Hitler's own suicide, among many others.<br/><br/>Incredible cast and acting. Everyone does an amazing job in it. And I had never seen such a close up portrayal of Fuhrer (Hitler). He is superb.

You could see how much the movie had impressed all the viewers. The reason for this was (from my point of view), that the man who plays Hitler, plays his part in such a way that I almost believed he was Hitler himself. Further I found it interesting to see how his followers keep on following him till the end, it gave me the shivers that one man can get many others to follow him blind. This movie took me to Germany at the end of WWII into the mad world of Hitler himself. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly recommend you to do so."

"austindye91","10","2","4","19 March 2005"," History Noir
","""Springtime for Hitler"" was the droll marquee message for this film. ""Downfall"" is a minutely-detailed piece, with many scenes recreated from well-known photographs of that time. I believe the length was overlong (one glance at the watch), perhaps occasioned by its intensity and somberness. The simple fact that I was attentive for almost three hours to an unrelieved, predetermined outcome speaks to the excellence of the portrayals. No better fare for a film noir lover who seeks convincing that the plot could actually be real. There was no PC element, save the concluding interview with Frau Junge. I cannot understand the concerns of reviewers, who fretted that Hitler may be viewed sympathetically. Its historical accuracy transcends these concerns. Not a film for guys to take their ladies to, however."
"ferguson-6","9","2","4","13 March 2005"," Eavesdropping on History
","Greetings again from the darkness. Any filmmaker takes a risk putting the image of Adolf Hitler on screen. Many argue that providing any type of human image for this monster is too good for him. On the other hand, many believe there is much to learn from this tragic, horrific era. ""Downfall"" is based on two separate books by Joachim Fest and Traudl Junge. The movie begins and ends with portions of Frau Junge's final interview. It is painful to watch her in her 80's still struggling with choices made in her 20's. Her conscience still eating away as she asks the question of herself, ""Could I have known?"".<br/><br/>Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has crafted a docu-drama that leaves us feeling as if we are in the bunker during those final 12 days. The emotions of all involved are gut-wrenching. It is stunning to witness Hitler's balancing act of continuing his pursuit of world dominance in front of his officers, while carefully orchestrating his own demise behind closed doors.<br/><br/>While most of the acting is top notch, there are 4 performances that truly stand out. Alexandria Maria Lara as Traudl Junge was a joy to watch as she dutifully and loyally carries out her job tasks, while maintaining an immense respect and admiration for her boss. Juliane Kohler as Eva Braun literally brightens the screen and bunker every time she appears. Apparently comfortable with her place in history - beside her man in a hopeless situation, her smile never leaves as she exudes confidence for those closest to Hitler. Corinna Hartouch as Magda Goebbels ALMOST had me believing that lovingly poisoning one's kids could be forgivable when losing a way of life that has absorbed into their soul.<br/><br/>Of course, what really makes this film work is the chillingly masterful performance of Bruno Ganz. It is as if we are watching home movies from the bunker. His power while strategizing with the officers and charm when dealing with kids and women are frightening. The most amazing times, however, come during his moments of soul-searching as he realizes the dream is lost.<br/><br/>Accept this as an insight into history and not an attempt to humanize the monster. There are no signs that the filmmaker has attempted to excuse any of the decisions made by the regime. This is strictly a historical perspective on the confusion and paranoia brought on when power thirsty types lose their way. Amazing to watch."

","Excellent film. It shows how loyal the Germans were to Hitler. It also shows a more passionate Hitler. He is more human then ever portrayed before. How delusional he was and how in the end the more sane and ruthless of his gang betrayed him. One minor point is the actor playing dr Goebbels. He should have been more charismatic. He was a manipulator of people, not a tyrant. But it is only a minor mistake. I found it rather weird that the personal secretary of Hitler didn't know about the concentration camps. The movie is based on her story."

","I admit I wasn't thrilled by the first half of the movie, as I was a bit confused by whom all Hitler's Generals were - but as soon as I identified Himmler and Goebbles, I was okay. Besides that, I loved it, as far as one can love such a harrowing film. <br/><br/>I've heard people say that this movie put Hitler in too soft a light, which is not the case. It just focuses on other points than on the side of him most of us know, but it's not ignoring the awful things he did. That being said, this is a film about the last 12 days, not really about all his evilness and the horrible things he did. <br/><br/>This movie features a brilliant cast, very intense and believable. Such a cast is needed to pull off such a film. Even if one can't identify with some roles, they are all captivating. Some of the best (or worst) scenes were all without any dialogue at all. All in all, I recommend this movie to anyone who isn't left cold by the idea of the Holocaust."

","Astonishingly accurate and very authentic, the movie delivers an insight view into the ""führer"" bunker that many would have thought to be impossible to shoot. I think everybody agrees that all of the actors, especially Bruno Ganz (Hitler), did an outstanding job, confusing the audience whether they are watching a documentary with real footage or a movie. A huge controversy goes on with the question whether some scenes depict Hitler as being too handsome and human or not - I would say that the intention of the director and his movie are pretty clear on this subject: Hitler, though a mass murderer and the personalized evil, was a human being. Ergo, one has to show every side of his character. While focusing its attention mainly on the clearly dominating destructive side of the führer, the movie doesn't neglect the other, calmer side of him that seduced many people as well as his historic speeches did."

","April 1945. The Allies are marching towards Berlin. Within his hidden, reinforced bunker, Adolf Hitler celebrates his 56th birthday. A few days later he will commit suicide, heralding the end of World War Two. This is the story of those few days, largely based on the memoirs of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary.<br/><br/>A provocative subject, if nothing else. Especially because it takes the bold step to portray Hitler as a human being. A horrible, twisted and utterly racist human being, who has been given way too much power. But a human being, nonetheless. A point of view that is much rarer than you'd think. It's actually a common joke that the first thing you should do with a time machine is to go and prevent Hitler from being born. Yet at the same time it is a widely accepted theory that Germany would have rebelled and started another war even without this one man from Austria-Hungary. Perhaps it would not have been such a large war, and it's quite likely that the Jews would not have suffered so greatly. But Europe would have bled.<br/><br/>Still, even this Hitler is very much a caricature . Bruno Granz plays him in a way that to me speaks of wanting to distance himself from the character. His Hitler is a ruin. A stuttering, shaking shell of a man, human only in form. Granted, this has some basis in reality, based on multiple accounts of those final days in the bunker. Still, this Hitler would be a pitiful sight, if he wasn't who he is.<br/><br/>And perhaps that's the point. Hitler's evils were horrible and devastating in nature, but they weren't the result of some outside force, cosmic imbalance or anything else like that. We're not given that comfort. Rather they were the result of human nature. Which is a bitter truth to swallow, but a necessary one.<br/><br/>An interesting movie and recommended for fans of war and period films. High production values, good acting, tense atmosphere and a subject matter that isn't examined that often."

It was on Netflix a few months ago, I was wondering if I should even bother with it, looked up the trailer on YouTube, thought it was worth my while & sat down with a bowl of popcorn. I was blown away by this movie, everything about it was great, even though the people around Hitler weren't readily identified (such as in ""The Longest Day,"" another great film), you could pick out Josef & Magda Goebbels, Henrich Himmler, Eva Braun. It's like you, the audience, is there in the bunker with Hitler, watching/listening to him rant & rave to his generals. I would have loved to have seen what life was really like during the last few weeks in Hitler's bunker, but ""Downfall"" probably comes closer than any other movie. <br/><br/>Bruno Ganz should have at least been nominated for an Oscar. The Academy blew it, though (not unusual).<br/><br/>This amazing movie didn't get the publicity it deserved when it released. I have never cared for western or war movie genres but there are some exceptions and ""Downfall"" is one of them. Other war movies I've enjoyed--just for the record--are ""Das Boot"" (another great German film), ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" ""Schlinder's List,"" ""The Pianist,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""The Great Escape,"" ""Valkyrie,"" ""Conspiracy,"" and ""Tora!

For each instance he shows a 'human' aspect of Hitler, the director feels obliged to show 2 were Hitler appears as a deluded, pathetic old man, sick both physically and mentally. At some point I was reminded of the Charlie Chaplin 'Dictator' performance. It's a real shame because the acting is solid and you can tell the actor who plays Hitler tries very hard to avoid falling in a caricature. But I guess he has to work with the material he's given.<br/><br/>Political correctness is everywhere, even when the credit rolls. The participants who died hanged and executed in Soviet war camps were not really 'executed' - they just 'died in captivity'. Hitler's 'secretary', the only real-life participant the producers got on tape, simply 'didn't know' about the concentration camps, and of course is 'full of guilt' after she 'learned the truth' during the Nuremberg trials. Yeah right! The actress who portrays her during the movie, as this innocent looking, ultra-naive involuntary participant is frankly nerve grating in her absurdness as a character.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a feel-good movie, believe it or not. After watching this, you feel good knowing that it's Hitler who arranged for his own population to die during the conflict, that the top brass of the SS all paid for their crimes, and that the rest of the population was simply hypnotized into blind obedience to a small bunch of evil men.

And I am not happy with that. The film didn't arose my interest at most points. Why? Mainly because it is too long, it's more of a documentary than a film, and doesn't add any interesting special feature to make it more interesting. I particularly don't feel any suspense during the film. What I am trying to say is that when you are doing a film about something people already know (most people know a lot about Hitler and particularly that he committed suicide)you have to add something to the film to make it interesting, or to add your personal view to an historical event.

Even with the best intention (saving private Ryan), it gets never even close to this one. If you haven't seen this movie yet, I would really suggest you to go and see.<br/><br/>The film is about the last days of Hitler in his bunker in Berlin before the Russian came in 1945, told through the perception and experiences of his secretary Traudl. It portrayed Hitler trying to cope with the immense pressure of losing the war and getting caught by the enemy. His fear to end like Mussolini, his feeling of loneliness and hopelessness despite the presence of his close aids and his disbelieves that it could end like that. For once we see that Hitler is also a human being. Yes, I am afraid to say that in the very basic sense of being, he is a human person. What evil is his deeds, his political view, his propaganda's, his acts of war and any other things he is being accused for. The critics said the he is being too human portrayed by the actor. I can disagree with that. If you can see the whole issues from art point of view, Bruno Ganz played him the best. I am pretty sure if the Oscar is also given to ""foreigner"" he would won it with distance from any other contenders in 2004 Academy Awards (at least if one's is honest and free from any prejudice, historical burden or personal pains). After 60 years I would say so. <br/><br/>Although Ganz was the center of the whole movie, it is fair to say that the whole production (director, actors, cinematography, ...) was top.

"noralee","8","3","8","21 March 2005"," Gripping Docudrama
","""Downfall (Der Untergang)"" is a gripping docudrama that brings the History Channel to life, though I missed the contextual-providing talking heads and pop-up explanations, especially to know if there was anything new or revisionist in this German view of Hitler's last days in his bunker with his inner circle.<br/><br/>As I am not a regular devotee of military channels, I frequently got confused and misplaced among the ensemble, such that I really needed the closing snapshots to tell me who was whom and what happened to them after the film ends at surrender (documenting that suicide preempted many from being Nuremberg defendants). While I thought these might have been tenacious yes men, my husband does watch those programs and he explained that these advisers were with Hitler from the beginning, unlike Stalinist purges.<br/><br/>My husband also pointed out that some of Hitler's rants, chillingly portrayed by a dynamic Bruno Ganz, are not just paranoid ravings but accurately reflect his clashes with the upper class Prussian career military men who were naysayers to his pre-Stalingrad military successes, whereas his perceptions of the final military situation were quite delusional, especially once the top brass were afraid to tell him the truth.<br/><br/>Evidently, what are new are the quotidian insights of life in the increasingly bizarre bunker provided by Hitler's secretary, which were revealed before she died in a book and interview documentary ""Blind Spot (Im toten Winkel - Hitlers Sekretärin"", an edited version of which was shown on U.S. TV; my husband objected that even she didn't witness some of the scenes that are particularly tense so some poetic license is probably taken. While it is these personal touches that some have complained make Hitler human, I found it more interesting to learn about the inner circle, as he obviously couldn't conduct his reign of terror alone.<br/><br/>The film distinguishes among a spectrum of Nazi ideologues and fellow travelers at all levels-- the most fanatic are shown here as strident caricatures, particularly a scary Frau Goebbels who makes Livia Soprano look like fun and games, career soldiers, patriots and civilians, including child recruits, while Eva Braun is shown to be naive to the point of lunacy.<br/><br/>Like ""Rosenstrasse,"" another contemporary German director's take on the period, director Oliver Hirschbiegel is determined not only to go beyond the old ignorance disclaimers to show the impact of World War II on ordinary Berliners as Hitler dismisses their plight (including, disconcertingly, a symbolically blond, blue-eyed boy whose travails outside the bunker we tensely follow throughout the film) and his loyalists throughout the ranks continue revenge until the last moments, though his insistence that there are no longer any civilians in this war could also apply to the London Blitz he fomented or the Allies' firebombing of Dresden. Just as the film seems to identify many reasonable Germans, including some at high levels, disgusted with war and the Nazis, both Hitler and Goebbals point out that they have been in power for decades with the acquiescence of the German people.<br/><br/>While the script also carefully includes Hitler's paranoid anti-Semitism as part of his rabid philosophy until the end, the documentary coda about the facts of the Holocaust seem tacked on to assure audiences that the genocidal aspect of the Third Reich is not being ignored amidst choices of tactics, strategy, personality and loyalty.<br/><br/>It's amazing that a docudrama whose outcome we already know can be so taut and riveting, such that you come out of the theater drained."

In Hindsight what is amazing to see is that some of the NAZI refuse or cannot see it happening. For those sad souls, the death of Hitler is the end of the world. Most chilling is the extinction of the Goebbels family. The guilty also take away with them the innocent who are associated with them, such as the children and the dog. You also feel sorry for Hitler himself, he has made his pact with the devil, and he appears gone from us as a normal human being despite the attempts by Eva Braun to put some humanity back in.

"dbdumonteil","8","4","13","12 April 2006"," why so much fuss about this film?
","Hitler's last days in his underground bunker in Berlin in April 1945 and the fall of the Nazi Reich related from several standpoints including his secretary's. The Allies come on in leaps and bounds and are within an ace of the total victory but Hitler (astounding Bruno Ganz) is prisoner of his megalomaniac illusions and his absurd dreams of greatness. A strong division reigns in this underground world between the officers who know the nearly inevitable and adamant end and the ones who are still in prey to an unshakable fanaticism for their guru. Ultimately, endeavors of peace negotiations with the Allies will be begun by the most lucid officers while the most die-hard ones about the Nazi ideology will only see suicide as their last exit...<br/><br/>This film shot by Oliver Hirschbegel deserves credit for having looked into a prickly era of history: the end of the Nazi regime led by a dictator who plunged the world into an unparalleled Barbary and violence and responsible of the most horrible human crimes. Derived from two books relating Hitler's last days in his bunker, it was supposed to be an accurate rendering of the facts for the sake of the detail and the historic reality. But inevitably, there are some liberties taken and certain sequences are pure fiction. For example, according to the historian Jean Tulard, Goebbels didn't fire at his wife before killing himself. They poisoned themselves.<br/><br/>I also know very well that when the film reached the streets about two years ago, it gave rise to controversy and caused a lot of ink to flow. The mainspring: a more human face of the monster Hitler. But I think there is no real justification for this scandal in its major part. I didn't find that the depiction of Hitler in this ""Untergang"" introduced a more enticing face except maybe in some intimate sequences with some women. On the contrary, the Hitler represented in this ""Untergang"" is a mercurial, formidable monster who wildly oscillates between rare moments of short lucidity and tantrums, especially when his officers come to announce him that the Allies gain ground and the German army has to draw back. It was a good idea from the director to have often favored the off-camera during these incommoding moments. The camera goes in a next room, generally full of people and one can still hear the dictator's screams. By stubbornly striving to repel the Allies armies with restrained military means, he's like he's beating a dead horse. He also only displays contempt for the German people and holds inhuman facts about the Jewish people. He's a man who firmly believes(or does he?) that the Nazi Reich can go on. One of the most conspicuous sequences show him in front of a model of the architectural Berlin he wants to build in the future. In short, ""der Untergang"" introduced Hitler as I had imagined him, nearly exempted of a human face.<br/><br/>What remains is an absorbing assessment of a decaying world between the officers who know the impending end of the Nazi reign and have to endure Hitler's absurd intentions and his most staunch devotees which include quite a lot of women who keep on pandering to him. And many of them are ready to commit suicide not to see the end of the Nazi Reich like Goebbels, a narrow-minded man and his wife who is ready to poison her own children. There's a grisly scene which packs a real wallop. But chaos also reigns in this bunker. Some of the members absconded while others party to vainly forget the end. Dancing on a volcano indeed. But disorder also reigns in the devastated streets of Berlin. In the meantime, the apocalyptic shots of Berlin reminded me of Warsaw's in Roman Polanski's admirable ""the Pianist"" (2002). See the scene when a more than middle-aged man strives to make a bunch of teenagers realize that by trying to repel a platoon of Sovietic soldiers, they won't be able to hold on very long. But there's a young boy who will manage to repel two tanks ans will be rewarded by the ""Führer"". Then, the Bunker has a lot of dour corridors. They could be the symbols of the confused spirit of the Nazi members and the fact that all these people belong to an underground bunker could be interpreted as a faded microcosm of a regime condemned to disappear.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz's composition is mind-boggling. It seems that it was a tailor-made part for him. He seems to have studied in detail Hitler's persona and he delivered an Oscar-caliber performance which could be worth alone the price of admission. But the film is also buoyed by a topnotch cast in general. Each actor makes his part count. The persona of each protagonist fits them like a glove.<br/><br/>I must confess that I was very taken with this film and if one leaves aside the liberties taken in comparison with the historic reality, ""der Untergang"" is a gripping film. Its very high stance in the top 250 of this site is certainly too much but it's worth a watch all the same. When the film is over one can only hope this: that such a megalomaniac and dangerous man can never come to power again."

It is a tense, psychological, full of insight movie, devoid of any cheap clichés- so typical for American films. Better than ""Saving private Ryan"",and - from an intellectual point of view - far more entertaining and full of thrills than any Hollywood action movie."
"Chris Knipp","Null","3","9","14 March 2005"," Not much fun in this Hell
","The Germans have finally made a World War II movie with Hitler in it as a main character, hitherto a taboo for them, like showing Queen Elizabeth in a movie for the English, presumably for different reasons. Hirshbiegel's film gives us Hitler's last days in an unpalatable mix of generals, women, children murdered to save them from a world without National Socialism, Berlin crumbling around the Führer's meandering bunker, booms and crashes echoing around the auditorium.<br/><br/>The result is a harrowing and powerful but also plodding. It's as if director Hirschbiegel was so focused on just getting all the terror, gloom, and horror of it down on film he didn't step back to breathe. There's not much sense of pacing or rhythm. There's a steady unwinding, of course -- after all this is the devolution to end all devolutions -- but there's not much suspense or sense of calculated contrast between successive scenes. Maybe there isn't any room for art in such a story. But then you have to ask why ""Downfall"" was made, and the only answer is to provide some kind of catharsis for German viewers.<br/><br/>The director has epic ambitions. He not only covers the moods of the bunker on every level from general down to the lowest orderly (it's ""Upstairs Downstairs"" all played below), but also takes us up to street level where Berlin crumbles as the Russians move in, and it dives through battlefield hospitals teeming with moaning, screaming wounded and grizzled, exhausted surgeons sawing off limbs. (Why does the camera ritually shake every time there's a big explosion? It's a fake-looking effect.) We see so many people pop cyanide pills and blow their brains out it becomes almost routine. And we are witnesses to the kind of terrible battlefield gore we saw in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and more recently in Jeunet's ""Very Long Engagement.""<br/><br/>But in fact, in ""Downfall's"" foreground, inside Hitler's bunker, there's no real action except the decision to do nothing, not to yield, to go down with the ship. This is the Endgame, the checkmate: the ""king"" is cornered. There's a lot of talk about escaping or surrendering but neither is going to happen. It all stays in the bunker till the end. Consequently the movie is character-driven, and succeeds best in impersonating known figures.<br/><br/>Most importantly, Hirschbiegel has engaged a marvelous actor, Bruno Ganz, to play a fully rounded version of the doomed Hitler. Over-saturated color and ill judged sickly lighting -- however accurate a reproduction the latter may be of the underground setting -- make the generals look like waxworks, but Ganz's Hitler is three-dimensional and has all the qualities ever attributed to him. He screams and yelps at the generals in a voice uncannily right, he's soft as a puppy-dog with women and children; and there are all stages of madness and folly and denial in between. Ganz can do as much with his face seen from the side as he can do with his stooped exhausted body, his twittering left hand hidden behind his back, and his voice rasping and cawing as he curses his generals, brags of dealing with the Jews, and condemns the German people to die -- but mild and soothing to the strangely cheerful Eva Braun, and sweet and forgiving as he hires a secretary. This is no mere impersonation: it makes Hitler real and complex.<br/><br/>That's disturbing to many viewers, especially Jewish ones, who have protested this movie should not even have been made; that even to look Hitler in the eye and see a human being taints the memory of the millions who died in the camps. But this is wrong. We don't need a cardboard man to know the Nazis were the personification of evil. The hard truth of evil's banality -- and commonality -- was dramatized by Hannah Arendt's reportage of the Eichmann trial in 1963.<br/><br/>After suicides have happened and corpses have been torched and officers have left to fight over whether to surrender, ""Downfall"" narrates a terrifying escape by several women, including Traudl Junge, Hitler's young secretary, beyond the Russian soldiers and out of Berlin. There's a little poetry -- perhaps the only moment when the movie sings in any conventional sense -- when Junge, already seen in Heller and Schmiderer's documentary, ""Blind Spot,"" two years ago (to which this film owes much), escapes hand in hand with a small blond boy and cycles cross-country with him under a bright clear open sky (escapes, as the documentary shows, to a lifetime of guilt). Finally here is contrast, a flight from the bunker that sets off the grim experiences we've witnessed inside it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, though, we've already seen so many cinematic depictions of depraved Nazi officers getting drunk amid naked girls (a classic version is Visconti's lugubrious and cloying ""The Damned"") that even when Eva Braun is one of the celebrants there's a numbed sense of déjà vu. Outside the bunker, up above, the dark sequences of mere children in soldier's uniforms playing the doomed hero are disgusting and heartbreaking, but that was an aspect of the final days of the Nazis that had its ultimate cinematic expression long ago in Berhhard Wicki's powerful 1959 anti-war movie, ""Die Brücke."" No, the only thing that makes ""Downfall"" different is the bunker, and Hirschbiegel might have done better to have stayed down there and never let us out. Hitler certainly never got out, except to be incinerated so the Allies wouldn't get his corpse. This is not a great movie, but it's a powerful one. It deserves to be seen, if you can handle the claustrophobic nightmares it may give you."
"EUyeshima","4","6","24","14 December 2005"," Hitler's Last Hours in Excruciating, Desultory Detail
","Spending over 2 ½ hours witnessing the last hours of Adolf Hitler's life doesn't sound like an exhilarating time, and director Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2004 German-language film has to be one of the more deflating experiences I've had at the movies recently. But that's not to say there aren't moments of great power and passionate, truthful performances. In fact, it feels like quite a breakthrough to have the story actually done in German as it seems targeted to the German populace versus the rest of us interested only in the historical details from the outside. Regardless, the overall effect is enervating from the intentionally methodical approach the filmmaker takes in chronicling the waning moments of the Third Reich. The focal point obviously is the Führer, and Bruno Ganz is powerfully persuasive in alternating between gentility and irrationality but all the while descending into a palpable dementia. It's a vividly rendered performance, which captures all his seeping paranoia and despicable philosophies. The trick for Hirschbiegel and Ganz is not to humanize him to the point of having the viewer feel compassion for this mass murderer because even sixty years after the end of World War II, he continues to exert a powerful fascination. We are intrigued by the psychological forces that gave rise to German National Socialism and shaped its leader, and they successfully pull off the queasy balance of presenting a man who -- before he commits suicide -- speaks with pride about his annihilation of the Jews in Europe. For Hitler and his immediate supporters, the idea of facing the opposition and accounting for those war crimes was unthinkable.<br/><br/>Despite Hitler's dominance in the story, it is mostly viewed from the perspective of his personal secretary Traudl Junge, who was just 22 when the Führer hired her in 1942. For example, the anticipated suicide scene is done behind a closed door as Junge realizes what is happening from the outside. Alexandra Maria Lara portrays Junge with an open naïveté that makes her blind devotion understandable to a great degree, but her character is not interesting enough to hold our interest throughout. Consequently, there is a gallery of characters, Hitler's inner circle, who experiences the end of the war on their own terms. Of course, there is Eva Braun, Hitler's infamous mistress whom he married in the last moments of their lives. As portrayed ebulliently by Juliane Köhler, she is a caretaker for the whole bunker, attempting to get everyone's spirits up with liquor, tabletop dancing and the occasional walk outside for a cigarette. She gradually reveals a more tortured soul worrying about her pregnant sister and confessing her increasing discomfort but remaining steadfast in her devotion to the Führer. But the most fascinating and frightening character is Magda Goebbels, portrayed with a cold veneer of calm by Corinna Harfouch. In certain ways, it's an even gutsier performance than Ganz's. Her real-life character's dedication to the Führer reaches such pathological levels that in the movie's most shocking scene, she forces ampoules of cyanide into the mouths of her sleeping children rather than subject them to the grim prospect of ""a world without National Socialism"".<br/><br/>Aside from these elements and the shock-inducing recreation of the bombings, the movie is rather dull visually lacking, for example, the panache that Jean-Pierre Jeunet displays in his recent ""A Very Long Engagement"". Mostly, it has the unimaginative feel of a TV-movie, or given its excessive length, more accurately a miniseries completely driven by dialogue often focused on military tactics and sometimes on the human plight involved. The downbeat tone is relentless, as Hirschbiegel shifts his story between the increasingly desperate military situation above ground in Berlin and the oddly eccentric situation in the bunker underneath it. Perhaps the film's greatest value is the implicit absolution of the German people in blindly following Hitler. When he refuses to express compassion for the civilians, and declares that the Germans have brought their fate upon themselves, the movie is conveying that ordinary Germans were as much victims of Nazism as anyone else, a point raised and refuted 44 years ago in Stanley Kramer's ""Judgment at Nuremberg"". It's a valid perspective but unfortunately it's buried in an overlong and desultory film."
"MattBrady099","10","2","5","2 May 2015"," My review of Downfall
","So this movie didn't win a Oscar for Bruno Ganz spectacular performance or didn't win for best foreign language film, man f**k the Oscars.<br/><br/>The movie is about a group of young women to Wolf's Lair, Hitler's headquarters in Eastern Prussia. They are candidates for the post of personal secretary to the Fuehrer. Among them is 22-year-old Traudl Junge, a fresh-faced girl from Munich. Traudl is chosen for the job and she is overcome with joy at the thought of serving beside her Fuehrer. BERLIN, APRIL 20, 1945: Hitler has retreated to a bunker system under the German Chancellery. Traudl Junge is asleep in her room, deep beneath the ground. She is awakened by tremors from artillery fire. The enemy is getting closer. Charting the last 10 days of Hitler's life, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to his suicide on April 30th, the film uses multiple characters to show the chaos of a country coming apart at the seams, from Hitler's henchman under the streets of Berlin, to the soldiers and civilians fighting and dying as the Soviet Army ravaged the city above.<br/><br/>You know that video on YouTube ""Hitler reactions to this"", and a lot of people may not know where that scene came from and it's this movie when it's during Hitler couple of minute rant and putting those reaction videos to the side this is a great scene if you can get pass that. I thought about bringing that up just in cause you didn't know.<br/><br/>I what to start off this review by saying that Bruno Ganz gives one of the best performance of 2004 and probably my favorite performance of all time. Bruno Ganz got Hitler spot on and he delivered a masterpiece of acting. What Bruno Ganz did so well is add a little human to Hitler as you can see his struggle and I know we what to see him fail because his a horrible person but as horrible as he his he's struggle to win a battle that he started and it quickly going down hill slowly breaks him, at one point you slowly see him losing it and Bruno Ganz powerful performance that creates are powerful moment that we can feel a little bit of it. Amazing performance Bruno Ganz.<br/><br/>The directing in this movie is what works the best as the director shows every detail of Hitler's upcoming fate. I forgive Oliver Hirschbiegel for directing the epic fail that was Diana the film as he made a better historical drama.<br/><br/>For problems with the movie these not a lot to be honest, you can say it's kind of a snail paste at times with the pasting but that's really it for problems.<br/><br/>Overall DownFall is excellent movie with amazing acting, great writing and directing and a brilliant historical drama."
"notevenwordshere","8","2","5","22 November 2008"," Seriously, don't confuse this with the movie Falling Down
","So amidst all the rubble and carnage there lurked a man -- larger than life, crumbling within -- whom we know as Adolf Hitler. Downfall is a sympathetic, though never forgiving, portrayal of him, and it works best when it remains focused on him. Bruno Ganz's performance is incendiary. It would seem to me that the role of Germany's Furher may be the most difficult role this side of Jesus Christ, and Ganz plays him with a middling sense of teetering insanity. In essence, we are invited to watch a mind reach its breaking point and then snap.<br/><br/>Ostensibly, the story is told through the eyes of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary. But she seems more of a catalyst, as plenty of interwoven characters each have their own moments and subplots.<br/><br/>Despite the brooding charisma of Hitler that bleeds through every frame of the camera, the real frights of Downfall are the men underneath him. From Goebbels on down, there is an atmosphere of intense devotion, of fierce loyalty to what was, in the chronology of the film, a lost cause. One scene involves the Mrs. Goebbels giving cyanide to her children because she could see no future in a world without National Socialism.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are the least-impressive part of the movie; many films have done a better job at this. But the cinematography is gorgeous, and the screen drips its muddy tones and earth colors.<br/><br/>The real strength, though, is the acting, which is solid throughout -- consequently, Downfall is a brisk two and a half hours. As Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz reinvents our notion of the mass murderer: he blurs the line between the monster and the man, and rightly so. We have sympathy for Hitler as a human being, but our sympathy does not absolve him. In fact, it makes his misdeeds all the more atrocious.<br/><br/>Downfall is an important film, and a landmark in World War II-era movies."
"Cosmoeticadotcom","8","2","5","10 September 2008"," Best Hitler film ever?
","n the annals of film, the greatest screen portrayal of an evil world leader was undoubtedly Anthony Hopkins' 1995 turn as President Richard M. Nixon in Oliver Stone's Nixon. Within five to ten minutes of one's first glimpse of Hopkins- a Brit who looked and sounded nothing like the 37th American President, one almost forgets what the real Nixon looked like. But, now there's a contender who could knock Hopkins off his perch- or at least give him a good fight, and that is Bruno Ganz's turn as Adolf Hitler in the 2004 Academy Award nominated Best Foreign Language Film from Germany, Downfall (Der Untergang- literally The Downfall). What makes this all the more remarkable is that- unlike Nixon, many actors have tried and failed to get into Hitler's skin, including the aforementioned Hopkins, who took on the role in The Bunker (1981). In fact, Ganz is so great at portraying Hitler- and he looks far more like the real Hitler than Hopkins did Nixon, even sans the Chaplinesque mustache and combover, that the film took much criticism for portraying Hitler as a real live human being. Heaven forfend that art contain some reality, or 'truth,' as the PC Elitists claim! Ganz is brilliant- from his wild veering between depression and rages, to his jittery nervousness, and a shaking of his hands which, when held behind his body, seem to devolve almost into the claw of a wounded raptor, grasping for anything to steady his older than he looks fifty-six year old form. In fact, Ganz seems to age and literally shrink in size, as he stoops and hunches, with each succeeding scene. Yet, it's the moments of tenderness Hitler shows his fiancée/wife, Eva Braun, his wounded indignation at perceived betrayals, and his timidity toward women, as well as impeccable manners, that really offends the PC. This ability to move a viewer is, of course, the manifestation of the great art of a great artist.<br/><br/>Many big name critics, around the world, though, took the film to task for the most asinine of reasons. The New Yorker's David Denby, a minor thinker, wrote: 'As a piece of acting, Ganz's work is not just astounding, it's actually rather moving. But I have doubts about the way his virtuosity has been put to use.We get the point: Hitler was not a supernatural being; he was common clay raised to power by the desire of his followers. But is this observation a sufficient response to what Hitler actually did?' This incredibly idiotic statement, and many other PC comments like it, about film and art in general, are the very reasons I took to writing film criticism. What response could possibly be sufficient to the genocidal crimes of a Hitler, Stalin, Mao, Pol Pot, or King Leopold?. All in all, Downfall is a movie worth seeing, but it is not one that is 'required viewing'- neither for its art nor its historical value. It rises and falls almost solely on Ganz's shoulders. To me, the most affecting moments within come when Hitler willfully denies the reality of his nation's Götterdammerung, and pretends that this or that general will save the day with a brilliant maneuver, at the last moment, to cut off the Russians, and save the war effort. Anyone watching the recent change of American military leadership in Iraq is familiar with their nation's leader's utter refusal to face stubborn facts, and it's a scary scene- whether or not that leader is a mass murdering psychotic, or merely a clueless frat boy with a God complex. Yet, like many of the other 'historical' facts, this intermittent self-delusion is also considered, by most historians, untrue. Hitler is known to have commented after being repulsed at Stalingrad, and also after losing The Battle Of The Bulge, that he knew that an eventual German defeat was unavoidable. These are two more wasted opportunities to core into the man, and these ill wrought fictions- be they of whole characters or scenes with real personages, are ultimately what kill the screenplay. As a side note, it's worth realizing the fact that the Second World War, despite its horrors and nonpareil bodycount, can now be thought of as the last real war 'played by the rules' says much of our species.<br/><br/>That Downfall can succeed as a film, despite some bad acting, and a weak screenplay, also says much for the notion that a single great performance, as well as a historically significant and dramatic enough moment, can overcome abundant mediocrity more easily than a work of fiction can. Bruno Ganz is now the definitive film Hitler, but the definitive portrayal of his true downfall has yet to be made. Where is Ingmar Bergman when you really need him?"

","This movie belongs to Bruno Ganz for depicting the title role of Hitler, and believe me it is one of the best acting in a biographical role I have ever seen on screen. Maria Lara as Hitler's secretary too is very well depicted role and the story is from her point the way she sees Hitler in his final days. Acting from others too is very good, direction is excellent, music score is good, and camera work too is top notch. I didn't understand how to react to this movie after first viewing, should I be sympathetic to the characters or should I be happy for the end, as WWII and atrocities of Hitler is the worst in the history as far as my knowledge goes, but I will say this that I was stunned by the movie 100%. It is that good. The effort by the team of this movie must be applauded for there amazing work and bringing history closer to us in the movie in a best form possible. Watch it if you like the subject of war, knowing more about Hitler and his last days. Or just watch to see the amazing work of Bruno Ganz."
"tmullane-1","7","2","5","14 May 2006"," Why the build up?
","Great film. I'm not a German, although some of my ancestors were from Hamburg, apparently. It's somewhat ironic that many of the good/evil fairy tales we grew up with emanate from that land-locked, fearful but extraordinary country.<br/><br/>What a shocking turn of events to have that man assume power over one of the most sophisticated, innovative and proud people on the globe. What a frickin waste! The Soviet Union would have collapsed in about 1944 except that Hitler breathed life into it by virtue of attacking it. They lost 26 million people in less than 4 years. I cannot get my head around that figure - the Germans themselves lost about 6 million in the war with Russia. How did such senior Generals mess up the assassination plan so badly in 1944? Tough job, I know, but there has to be a backup plan. Still so many questions about all that.<br/><br/>Thank God it came to an end. 'Downfall' was an ambitious movie and nailed the target pretty well. I have never understood why the German people followed this Bavarian fool so blindly - the part playing Goebbels didn't convince me. Nor did actress playing his wife. Yet, it happened. I don't think any actor can really portray such utter perversion. Nice try, though.<br/><br/>Albert Speer is a fascinating character. I wonder what he did for amusement in his 10 years in Spandau. He was portrayed quite subtlety. I was glad to see that. Hitler loved him like a son and Speer told him the truth at the end, which I think was historically accurate.<br/><br/>Horrible, horrible business all round. Europe destroyed itself twice in 30 years - Hitler, Stalin, Churchill and De Gualle should have just gone to Samoa where people swim, fish, play sport, goof around, eat, sleep and relax under a coconut palm for most of the day.<br/><br/>That's what I call domination. (Now that I think of it, the Germans DID get involved in Samoa but lost it after WW1 - I think they built a brewery - Danke Deutchsmen"

But with this and some other high recommendations, when it was shown on Channel 4 last week it was recorded and I got round to giving it a go (having dismally forgotten to record the acclaimed Capturing the Friedmans the week before.) And I can definitely see why it got to where it did.<br/><br/>I wasn't aware it was as long as it was going to be either, and I ended up watching it in two parts. And I was glad I did this for while the movie is expertly made and put together, all in one go it's a bit of a trek to sit through and, aside from being over-whelming, some of the scenes tend to become a bit repetitive, making the movie a little boring.<br/><br/>Particular mention must go to Ganz in the lead role turning in a really good performance as Hitler, perfectly capturing the man, who could at turns be charming (especially in the company of women) practical and maniacal. There is a good supporting cast, but in the main role he is the best.<br/><br/>Brilliant film that this is, it's better to be seen in two parts. It gets more engaging towards the end (not to mention more shocking!) But all in all a very well made depiction of a story that needed to be told and it's alarming that a piece of German cinema should have to top our charts when so much meaningless drivel gets made everywhere else. ****"

","When I first picked this film up I have to admit I was not expecting such a captivating, well executed film. The film itself is based off of Hitler's last days in his bunker in Berlin. It accurately portrays what happens most of the time. You actually see Hitler physically deteriorating due to the immense weight of the news of his forces being repeatedly pushed back and the Russians surrounding him. He begins to delude himself into thinking that his generals are all out to usurp him from his power. Even to the last however he refuses to admit defeat and takes his own life. After that the situation in the Bunker turns to complete chaos, order is thrown to the winds and it is everyman to himself. The movie is told from one of Hitler's personal secretaries recollection. The actors chosen for this film are of very high quality and reenacted the situation as closely as could be done. The film is filled with emotion and it is clearly able to be seen the turmoil caused by Hitler's suicide on all the people surrounding him. Overall this film is a must see for the avid World War II film buff. The film also does an extremely good job in coming across neutrally and not trying to sway a person one way or the other."

","Of the many World War II movies, this one is the best you will ever see. Now I am not a big fan of movies that I have to read subtitles for the fact that it takes a little out of the movie for me. Bruno Ganz who played Adolf Hitler had a spectacular performance. Every scene he was in you felt like you were in the room as well. If he is shouting, you are frightened, if he is joyous, you are rejoicing with him. Untergang, Der shows the other side of the war that most movies will leave out. As the movie goes you feel like it is your duty to watch it. There is no downside on any level through out the movie and the further a long it goes the more and more it builds even if it is not meant to. Now a two and a half hour movie may sound like a long time to spend watching a movie but I can guarantee that you won't be disappointed.

A few of the scenes looked almost identical to those in The Pianist, another great movie. Bruno Ganz is outstanding as Hitler; I keep wondering where I've seen Ganz before. Needless to say he confirmed my thoughts that Der Fuhrer was a complete nut job! It's a wonder he didn't have a stroke every five minutes. I am always amazed that the Nazis were so fanatically loyal to the point of killing off their children rather than surrender. And although I can hardly compare Hitler to our own President George W. Bush, we do have those in our country who seem to support him no matter what. I especially like Thomas Kretchmann who seems to bring something new to every Nazi he plays (as in The Pianist). The battle scenes are fantastic too; just trying to imagine the director setting up such wonderful shots is enough to warrant a second look. I got a little chuckle seeing Hitler eat ravioli like it was the last thing on earth and they always seemed to have plenty of booze too.

","This film depicts the lives of several infamous and lesser known Germans in the final days of Adolf Hitler, as the Russians took Berlin, leading up to the victory of the Allied Forces in World War II. It is told through the eyes of one of Hitler's final secretaries. As well as detailing her experiences, it also closely follows the story of a doctor, a young boy and Hitler himself. What is unique about this film compared with most World War II-related movies, is that it tells a story from the perspective of the ""enemy."" In addition, it's also unusual in that it is neither condemning nor condoning of the events that take place. It non-judgmentally observes the events as they unfold. As defeat becomes more evident, each character finds his or her own rationalization to cope with the reality. Some steadfastly cling to their National-Socialist beliefs while others watch as their leader begins to spiral downward into mental delusion and his Parkinson's Disease grows increasingly more severe.

It's OK, it's only a way to protect ourselves against the idea of someone like us doing such horrible things. But don't you fool yourselves: there are no beasts with capacity for the humiliation and the annihilation but the Homo Sapiens.<br/><br/>This movie, ""Der Untergang"" (the last days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker among his closest friends and politicians), was not welcomed by German audiences. There are too many bruises that haven't being healed yet. A movie showing Hitler suffering just like everyone else? The Führer acting like a gentleman in front of his personal secretary and taking good care of Goebbels' children? There are too many people that don't want to see such things. Hitler was a monster, he wasn't even human! He couldn't have a heart, he couldn't have loved anyone! Well, Oliver Hirsbiegel (the director of the irregular ""Das Experiment"") makes clear that the Emperor of the Third Reich was no madman (clinically); he loved Eva Braun, and he suffered in his last days just like everyone whose plans are crumbling down would have suffered (Ok, some plan to build a house in the seaside, some plan to invade Poland... plans, after all).<br/><br/>We watch everything that's going' on in the Berlin underground through the eyes of Miss Junge, the personal Hitler's assistant, one of the few witnesses of those last hours. We can smell the sweat, we can feel the humidity, the terror that Hitler provoked in most of his subordinates, the chaos inside and outside the shelter, the hysterical laughing of those who know that are going to die soon. The portrait of the different personalities there is just superb: Eva Braun, THE lover, living in her world of fantasy; she just wants one more drink and one last dance. Mrs. Goebbels, maybe one of the most terrifying in the history of cinema (and what's not cinema), she seems to be even more extreme that Hitler himself. Those generals afraid of contradicting the Fuhrer, who still waits for some squadron to come and defeat the enemy. Outside, Berlin is on fire. The Russians, which had been invaded a few months before, now they are the invaders and they're gonna get into the centre of the Presedential Palace. <br/><br/>So, this movie is bigger than life. The script and the the artistic direction are just perfect... nothing!! Nothing compared with Bruno Ganz's work He has brought Hitler to life (and I really mean it). A millimetric job, so blended, never falling in the parody. How to play a character whose histrionism and personality goes beyond any kind of limits? Well, Mr. Ganz has the answer to that. The rest of the cast is also outstanding, but Ganz is the genius here. ""Der Untergang: Hitler und das Ende des 3. Reichs"", one the best movie ever done about the Holocaust? And without Jews?

Using natural lighting and muted colours in the bunker (where the majority of the film is played out)a somber and realistic mood is set, add to this the large amount of hand-held camera work and dark and chaotic battle scene one feels as though he/she is actually standing alongside the actors.<br/><br/>The actors are another strong point of the movie Gantz as Hitler is superb, the loud ranting outbursts one expects from seeing documentary footage of the man are there but where Gantz' real triumph lies is that he portrays the character in a very naturalistic manner one almost forgets the stereotypical view of Hitler. The Nazies were shown in a more balanced light than cinema is used to, sympathetic sides were shown in regards to their attitudes to the plight of the German people and one Nazi Professor/Officer is portrayed in the film as an almost admirable character.<br/><br/>Despite the balanced approach many horrors are in store for the viewer the hanging of 'so called' traitors in the streets images of child solders killed and the horrific final minutes of the Goebels children ensure that this movie will haunt you after its closing scene.<br/><br/>As with all movies I'm sure some details are not 100% correct but then neither are the all the school text books like 'Schindlers List' or 'The Killing Fields' this is not easy viewing it is however a excellent film and a good dramatic history lesson."
"SeminolePhenom","10","2","5","31 October 2005"," A breathtaking historical experience...
","The story of the people living in Hitlers bunker during the last days of World War II, told through the eyes of his secretary.<br/><br/>This is a real war movie. It has not been made to entertain such as a movie such as Saving Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down. This is the cinematic biography of Adolf Hitler and his men. It explains what happens in the last days of his bunker and shows the point of view that the Nazi's held. Because this is a German film, the movie is subtitled, but this takes away nothing from its greatness. This is just a great film. The man who plays Adolf Hitler(Bruno Ganz) played him so well that it feels as if you were actually watching Hitler himself. Ganz played the role perfectly and was the major reason for the movie's greatness. Although this story seems as though it wouldn't be very interesting, it is surprisingly entertaining just by the excessive detail. It is almost as if it is a horror film in some scenes. It shows brutal suicides, murders, and even killings of children. Reminding me mainly of Schindler's List, this movie holds a certain dramatic effect that makes war movies so great. Overall, the movie was great in every aspect but is not for a person with a weak stomach.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film."
"Billybob-Shatner","10","2","5","20 October 2005"," Bringing depth and humanity to monsters
","What can I say. I loved this film. Any filmmaker can show us the bad that people do, but it takes a depth and honest to dimensional-ize its villains. That's what I find so powerful about this film. Fully accurate or not, it feels like we're looking at real people. On a certain level, you almost feel bad for them. Its by no means an apology piece for the Nazi party, but it gives us a perspective I haven't yet seen in a movie. The performance from Bruno Ganz as Hitler was terrific. As a whole, the movie exceeds on so many levels. <br/><br/>If you enjoy richly drawn characters and history, you can probably do no better. 5/5"
"arne-57","9","2","5","20 September 2005"," No monsters, but not my kind
","One of the first movies to 'enlighten' us on what happened behind the curtains of the German high command. And to show their 'human' side and to try to portrait how they lived, how fanatic their devotion was to their fuhrer. In a way its refreshing because you feel it shows the truth... and the truth is so painful it took over 50 years before this movie could be made. I think this is one of the best 'anti' war movies ever made. Because it shows the failure of an 'absule' ideology, how following a man or an ideology blindly, can blind people from the Truth. Even when the Fuhrer himself can no longer see clearly.<br/><br/>This movie shows that none of the Nazi top and high command were monsters... Humans are not monsters and never will be. Saying someone, is a monster, tries to dehumanize them, and thus imply that 'normal' human beings would never do such cruel things. This denial is the real big threat, because we all need to remember. That under the 'right' circumstances we could do terrible things, and this movie portraits the 'right' circumstances they were in. <br/><br/>The flip side of the coin is that because the secretary of Hitler: 'Traudl' could see clearly Hitler as a human, she could not believe he could do such monstrous things.<br/><br/>The movie shows also that an absolute ideology leads to absolute measures and actions, and for some of them the ultimate action, to commit suicide. To follow the rules of the ideology is all what matters, and here human decency is not one of them. This means destroying everything and needlessly letting civilians die. Hitler says: 'In a war, there are no civilians', 'We are a weaker people, so by the rules of nature our people will rot away'. <br/><br/>Its becomes clear that children are even more susceptible to absolute values and are even more easily 'programmed', then adults. Seeing 14/12 year old children fight and die for their believes, makes that all too clear.<br/><br/>I really found this movie astonishing, an psychedelic mix of violence, romance, love, madness and cruelty. The reality portrayed is so surrealistic it doesn't need a Hollywood sauce. The acting and special effect are so good you think your're actually there. But that was of course the intention, to let us relive a part of history we would be all too pleased to forget, but never should."
"moviemanMA","9","2","5","6 August 2005"," The Last Days of Adolf Hitler
","When we think of World War II, we think of epic battles and storming beaches. There was the naval battles in the Pacific and the land warfare in Europe. One of the most infamous people of WWII was Adolf Hitler, a man that brainwashed an entire nation into believing in his cause. Considered one of the most powerful evil geniuses in history, his final days were not so cunning. The last days of Adolf Hitler can now be seen.<br/><br/>In Oliver Hirschbiegel's epic Downfall (USA title), we see the end of WWII for the German's. Berlin is surrounded and Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is running out of options fast. He and his staff of experienced commanders are now faced with a huge decision, stay in Berlin and try to fight off the Russian's, or surrender and try to make a peace treaty. Hitler will have no talk of surrender, for he would rather commit suicide than see his country beg for mercy. His newly acquired secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is caught up in the mess of things. The Russian's are closing in on the city and the morale is fading fast amongst Hitler's commanders.<br/><br/>In the streets, there are those who are loyal to the Nazi party and Hitler's reign. They fight till they have no bullets left and then end their life. There are those who hide in the ruins of the once prosperous city. Hitler and all of his cabinet are stationed underground to avoid any bombings from the invaders. It is here that the commands are sent out and the roots of treason are mended. One by one some of Hitler's 'top dogs' start to open negotiations with the US, England, and Russia, issuing the surrender of Germany due to Hitler's incapacity to continue his rule. Upon hearing the news of his commander's treachery, the Fuhrer is enraged, wanting them arrested and executed. Soon, everyone in the bunker is feeling anxious of Hitler's next move.<br/><br/>Hirschbiegel's film is a masterpiece, delivering on many levels. What is shown on film is a powerful portrait of one of the most sinister men to walk the earth. He is scene as the Fuhrer, a man who with order can kill hundreds and thousands of innocent people...because he can. Then there is the side people don't see, the real Adolf Hitler. This is what Traudl sees and what Eva Braun has come to love in him. His spirit almost broken, Hitler looks as if he has aged way beyond his years. Ganz is brilliant as the Fuhrer and gives him human qualities when he is usually looked at as a monster.<br/><br/>Downfall is a stunning account of the last days in Adolf Hitler's bunker. The final battles between the Russian's and the German's are coming to an end. This is the downfall of the Nazi Regime, and the entire globe is waiting for the biggest war ever to come to an end..."
"panzerhan43","10","2","5","11 June 2005"," What Can Be Said? Perfect...
","The end of the Third Reich, in its purest form, without taking sides and making comments and with the highest standard of acting and cinematography; this was all we need for years.<br/><br/>I have heard that in Germany there had been a great debate about this film if it showed Hitler from a humanitarian side.We saw that it just showed him just as he is. But the most interesting thing that we haven't seen in any other WWII movie before is the portrayal of Waffen SS and Wehrmacht soldiers as ordinary soldiers, not like monsters or unskilled and unexperienced soldiers in Hollywood movies before.<br/><br/>Besides this we see that the best acting of battle hardened German officer characters are played by Germans themselves. It would be better if the battle scenes would be much more.<br/><br/>Definitely a masterpiece..."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","5","28 May 2005"," A Nutshell Review: Downfall (Der Untergang)
","I watched this film to learn more about the final days during the Battle of Berlin, and to know more about Adolf Hitler and the twilight of his Third Reich at the end of WWII. A good movie can be made based on this premise alone, and true enough, I was blown away, as this film offered a lot more.<br/><br/>Told through the eyes of many historical characters - the various war generals, a defiant Hitler Nazi Youth, Eva Braun, Hitler's stenographer Traudl Junge, and of course, Hitler himself. However, this film never exhibited a case of too many cooks spoiling the broth, as each perspective focused on different aspects during the fall of Berlin. There are those who talk about surrendering, some who want to fight to the end, holding onto the Fuhrer's belief that their troops outside Berlin will come to their rescue. You get a good sense of what's happening in the bunkers as Hitler's slowing losing it all.<br/><br/>But this film is not all about talk and no action. Those expecting blood and gore from a war movie, will get just that. The filmmakers did a wonderful job re-creating war torn Berlin, and the bunkers in which Hitler and his generals spent their last days in. We don't get to see the Russians much, but we jolly well hear each and every Made-In-Russia artillery shell that's raining down - the entire movie really makes you feel like you were there in a war zone - every arty raid, every bullet fired. You'll get to see grizzly mock hospitals, where doctors amputate limbs. Suicides are common too, and you see blood and brain matter splatter on screen.<br/><br/>The many characters are well-acted and brought to life effectively, but I'd like to put the spotlight on Bruno Ganz's portrayal of Hitler. It really brings the chills, and we can see the many hours of research bringing in results of every nuance the Fuhrer had, right down to Parkinson's.<br/><br/>This film, while it humanizes Hitler and his generals, doesn't suggest that they are innocent of their war crimes. It puts into perspective the ""other side"", giving the audience a chance to perhaps understand the happenings in the fall of a regime.<br/><br/>Though it's 2 1/2 hours long, for someone interested in WWII and the Fall of the Third Reich, you'll never notice its length, and will clamour for more. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Postscript This film is a Cathay Cineleisure exclusive showcase, and today's sneaks happened to be in the smallest hall #6, which is a pity. Tickets are few, and sold out early. Hope those interested will be able to get tickets on the day you wanna watch."
"Geoff_T","10","2","5","1 May 2005"," Stunning!
","I could have sworn I was in Berlin in April 1945, instead of the Sydney cinema I was comfortably seated in. It felt like the Russian shells were landing around me. I was absolutely in awe of the actors portrayals of the historical figures. I have seen a number of documentaries of the Third Reich, and watched archive footage of the Nazi leaders and I was fully convinced that I was seeing Hitler, Goebbels, Speer, Himmler, etc. as they were in the final throes of the thousand year Reich. I found myself crying when Blondi (Hitler's Alsatian) was poisoned, and when Magda Goebbels inserted the poison capsules into the mouths of her five children. I left the film with more tears, listening to Traudl Junge's closing statement. I actually felt sorry for the German people. Hitler had condemned them to death for he felt they had failed him. Yet some still wanted to fight for him even when all was lost. A true masterpiece and undoubtedly the best film I will see in 2005."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","2","5","29 April 2005"," Extremely well made movie.
","This is a movie that was made with lots of profession, both in front and behind the camera.<br/><br/>Without doubt the best thing about the movie is the portrayal of Hitler by Bruno Ganz. The fact that he even didn't at least got an Oscar nomination should be considered a criminal offense. The rest of the cast is also top-class, the best acting I've ever seen in a German movie.<br/><br/>The movie is emotional touching but without making Hitler a sympathetic character. There are some really powerful moments in this which I'm not going to spoil, it's simply just something you've to experience. <br/><br/>In most movies and documentaries Hitler is simply portrayed as a mad monster. In this movie we get to know him in his humane form and makes us realize that he really was just a man after all. In a way it makes it all even scarier, if he was just a man than why is there a reason to believe that all of this can't ever happen again? Movies like this should work as a warning for the future for the entire world.<br/><br/>The atmosphere and cinematography work all very well and make the movie really powerful.<br/><br/>Only real complaint is that it focuses too much on some of the events outside of the bunker. It focuses a bit too much on some needless plot lines and characters, especially in the first halve of the movie. The scene's all work very well and are made with lots of profession but they just seemed out of place. In my opinion it would had been better for the movie if it had only focused on the events inside the bunker and create a claustrophobic atmosphere with the sound of dropping bombs in the distance. A kind of ""Das Boot"" atmosphere, if you like.<br/><br/>156 minutes of great cinema, that flies by.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"diane-34","10","2","5","18 April 2005"," Perhaps the strangest way any war has ended.
","I have seen docos and read of these strange last days of the Third Reich. This movie recounted those facts but was so much more than a history lesson-which is what it was with the extra dimension of human drama that could not be dealt with by a documentary.<br/><br/>The two plus hours of this engrossing film passed swiftly after entangling me in the extraordinarily fine acting, cinematography and lighting of the talented people that produced such a great film. I mention the lighting artistry because 99% of this film takes place in Hitler's bunker in the final days of the war; therefore, the constraints of shooting indoors would have taxed these guys to the max and their result was perfect.<br/><br/>The script writers, Bernd and Eichinger, took the memoir's of Hitler's secretary and shaped them into a movie of excellence and are to be congratulated.<br/><br/>Magda Goebbels must be one of the ultimate characters in European history and Carinna Harfouh played her beyond great-something that only the best of the best could carry off. A mother that commits the gravity of the acts that she committed in those last hours in the bunker warrants more notoriety than she has. I believe people should see the movie just to watch Harfouh's acting-it is a tour de force! This is not to take anything from Ulrich Mathes who played her husband, Joeseph Goebbels, who viewers can always identify because he is the only one in that brown uniform amongst a sea of Nazi army uniforms.<br/><br/>A final word must be said of the killings in the film and the decisions that accompanied them-these killings, beyond the executions for what the remaining officers believed was desertion, were suicides by the men and women remaining in the bunker. Execution for some suicide for others because, as Magda Goebbels said, ""I cannot live without National Socialism"". It is scary that some people can feel so strongly about a cause."
"alpolcay-1","10","2","5","3 April 2005"," An excellent German film
","I've watched many successful films about the World War II. Something was missing about the conclusion. That was because all films had reflected the Allies' point of view. I was wondering what Germans would say about the ending of war in terms of cinema. Der Untergang should be added to the top class films as Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List. It is a realistic Hitler film introducing a perfect acting by Bruno Ganz. It is also an ultimate success for Oliver Hirschbiegel. He deserves to be congratulated as a first class director. Of course there are a few words to add about Adolf Hitler. He had many crimes and sins of which he was aware. But he was not a monster, a human being which gives us a lesson on what can be the consequences of a wrong idea on patriotism, nationalism and Darwinism. The important thing is not what we think, it is what we do and how we do."
"Chris_Docker","8","2","5","1 April 2005"," Possibly one of the most remarkable documentary dramas ever made
","Downfall is an achievement on a tremendous scale, and all the better for being a German film since it chronicles the final days of a Hitler, who not only devastated half the known world and a very large number of Jews, but also most of his own country and the people who had put their trust in him long before he ascended to a position where he could abuse it on such a massive scale. It is a fascinating story because although we feel we 'know' it, it has never really been told on film, and never so forcefully or by his own countrymen (who of course play Germans, good and bad, much better than American imitations in Hollywood!) The film also comes at a watershed where Germans are coming to accept their history, as is the rest of the world, without feeling they have to apologise for Hitler at every breath. German people of that time, it might be argued, were also (at least very many of them) victims of a madman who were forced to endure the destruction wrought by the Allied bombing. That is true of almost any horrific dictator, but the film is careful not to over-humanise him. We see those (some, not all) of those near to him secretly horrified at his views - both regarding the destruction of Jews and the destruction of his own people. But the credits also point out that, even among the populace, ignorance was no excuse. Downfall is no revisionist whitewash - it is perhaps as honest an attempt as any could be to portray the last days of a madman, still clinging ferociously to power. Everyone whose life or loved ones was badly affected by Hitler has the right to feel aggrieved, but it is not, for instance, limited to Jews or even non-Germans.<br/><br/>As a documentary-style drama, Downfall is so convincing that we do feel we are watching the actual characters from history. We also see a range of German people, from equally fanatical, evil-minded officers, to those who were simply in the grip of his power, to the women in his life, to some of the ordinary German people who had little idea of what was happening or others that were simply strung up or treated as expendable for having put Hitler in power in the first place. Hitler's psychology is also interesting. We almost see his fatal flaws come to light, his disrespect for equality, his determination to put his own skewed philosophy before people (even the citizens of Berlin in the bunker above him). It asks if the one of the strengths of the Allies was a love of humanity, a desire to work for the common good. It reminded me that mankind as a species, however competitive, has achieved dominance over the animal kingdom and flourished largely through a sophisticated system of cooperation and the ability to build trust Easily one of the most memorable dramas about Hitler ever made, Downfall will burn into your brain notwithstanding the German subtitles."
"mute_e","10","2","5","19 September 2004"," A German masterpiece
","I've just seen this movie, and I was surprised by an amazingly good acting. Bruno Ganz is for sure the ""best"" Adolf Hitler ever. The audience was laughing when he first entered the screen, but suddenly everybody was quiet and astonished. You might think that Hitler himself has played this role. Same for Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels, outstanding acting. You can really feel the atmosphere in the bunker and maybe understand deeds and actions that seemed unbelievable before. The plot was written by history, hence its even harder to keep the audience excited. But this movie just works. Another pro for this movie is that it doesn't judge anything, it trys to explain history. 8 out of 10."
"blhubner","3","13","68","19 September 2004"," Extremely detailed, and way too long
","Having traveled from the Netherlands to Germany to see this movie, you might understand I was quite curious about this German production.<br/><br/>Well, in the beginning, the movie is fairly exciting, it gives a very accurate picture of life inside the Berlin bunker. Hitler as a person is depicted realistically and is interesting to watch. But, after a while, things become boring. Everyone who has some interest in Second World War history knows what happened, and it is indeed shown in detail. No minor detail of the happenings is left out. Although this is ideal for purists and Nazi fetishists, for the play itself, which must be considered drama rather than documentary, it makes the movie a very long sit, leaving the viewer only to wish the movie goes to an end. Another point of criticism is the fact that of the main players, no biography is given somehow during the play. Younger people,like me do not exactly know what names like Speer, Göbbels and Goering were responsible for in the third Reich."
"florida87","1","21","123","6 March 2006"," A Flattering Portrait Of An Evil Regime
","I'm resubmitting my review (edited of course), because ""someone"" said it was offensive the first time. What did I say about this movie the first time? To summarize, I gave it a 7 of 10 (rated it a one star to make it easier to find among 300+ reviews, mostly 10 stars). I said it was well made. I also said it glorified an evil regime. I based that on the premise that it did not show a dead Adolf (was that the offensive part, that I didn't address him as Mr. Hitler?). Was his dead body so sacred that they would show everyone else's corpse except his bullet ridden head? Was that too taboo to show in a modern German film, was the filmmaker too scared to show that? I say it wasn't shown because the purpose of this film was to be sympathetic with an old Hitler's plight. Anyway, there were no morally redeeming elements in the film that said the Nazi's were bad, just that it didn't work out the way they wanted it to. I recommend seeing ""Hitler: The Last Ten Days"", or others have liked ""The Bunker"" (I have not seen that one, but will someday). Read Alfred Speers book ""Inside the Third Reich"" also for a more true account of what probably happened. Is this worth seeing, of course. I enjoyed it especially because I'm a history buff of Hitler and his inner circle and their last days (really any of their days and actions they undertook) are fascinating to me. I was just disappointed that it really made Hitler look like such a nice old man when you know he was a power mad psycho and was surrounded by fanatic death squads at his disposal. He had recently finished his purge of his enemies (plus others I'm sure) from the failed coup of 1944, people were petrified with fear of him! Remember the stories of being hung by piano wire that he filmed and watched over and over again? That moment would have been nice to include here to show how evil he was, but no, no mention of that. My favorite parts had more to do with the collapsing German Army in Berlin and what resulted than on the actual Hitler moments. We'll see if those who seem to love this film so much find this review offensive because all it is is my opinion of the truth. Sometimes, especially for the political left (maybe it was a present day Nazi who didn't like my first review who knows, I do know a lot of leftists seem to like this movie a whole lot), the truth hurts so much they resort to censorship to quell debate. Hell, if I pressed that offensive button on the reviews I found offensive here at IMDb it wouldn't be a very interesting place to visit. Just use your voter buttons and let the debate be allowed, sheesh."
"noam-reisner","5","10","50","3 January 2006"," Don't be fooled by the cinematic excellence - Downfall is dangerous
","As far as films go, Downfall is excellent. The acting by all concerned, particularly of Bruno Ganz as Hitler, is inspired. The reconstruction of Hitler's bunker and of the atmosphere within and without it in the last days of the war, so far as anyone can judge, is very realistic and convincing. The script, which draws on two separate historical documents recording Hitler's final days, is well constructed, and the directing of the entire film is on the whole is immaculate. <br/><br/>However, some films are more than mere vehicles for entertainment. Downfall is arguably one of the most important World War II films ever made for one simple reason  it is a German film. That a German director should finally decide to tackle this subject is itself commendable but the resulting film, though excellent in itself, leaves much to be desired. In fact, it is potentially dangerous. Downfall has won world wide acclaim, and audiences around the world were moved by the portrayal of the Nazi high command as vulnerable human beings and not dehumanised monsters. Unfortunately, by allowing the film to do so, audiences around the world are being duped into believing one of the most spectacular myths post war Germany has concocted about the relationship between the German people, its army, and the Nazi party led by Hitler. While not excusing the Germans' support of Hitler, the film is meant to make the German people feel better about themselves by spreading the myth that Hitler was mad, the army and its generals heroic, and most of Hitler's staff either ignorant of Germany's inhuman war crimes, or somehow conflicted about their role in the War. This utter nonsense shies away from taking responsibility for the true horrors of WWII. A German film focusing on the war could have focused on any part of it. Did the director choose to depict the rise of the Nazi party to power? Did he choose to portray the horrors of Crystal Nacht and the rise of institutionalised anti-Semitism? Did he choose to focus on the unprovoked invasion of Poland, or the Final Solution for the 'problem' of European Jews? No. The director chose to focus on the final days of the war when the Nazis may be portrayed as vulnerable and as a confused band of misguided dreamers who put their faith is a madman who led them to destruction. This view of historical events is not only disturbing but frighteningly worrying coming from a German director, even though it is predictable. The only way most young Germans today can cope with their past is to convince themselves of this myth; to convince themselves that their grandparents were all young Traudl Junges swept into the Nazi mania out of ignorance, fear, poverty, and a sense of national shame after the surrender of World War I, which, incidentally, the Germans also started. But just because the Germans need to believe in this to get on with their lives in modern-day Europe doesn't mean the rest of the world has to buy into it. Just like the memoirs of Miss Junge on which this film is based, the resulting film is just that - a subjective impression coloured by guilt, denial, and self-loathing. To hail it as historically accurate, objective, and self-examining is reckless and foolish.<br/><br/>A case in point is the portrayal of Speer. Speer was one of Hitler's closest confidants, and a key architect of the Final Solution. He was a rabid fascist, anti-Semite, who laid the architectural plans for all of the Third Reich's future centers of powers. During the Nuremberg Trials Speers pleaded ignorance of the Nazi Death Camps and claimed he was only an 'architect' of buildings. While the other caught Nazis were executed, Speer received a light prison sentence. He was eventually released and died of old age in the comfort of his home. Historians for a long time since then have exposed Speer's lies. It is a well established fact that he hoodwinked his captors and got away with what very few of the Nazis did. But the film embraces Speer's benign and false self portrayal as a mild-mannered, sympathetic man who attempts to convince Hitler to surrender and is really little more than an over zealous designer of buildings. <br/><br/>Downfall is a very good film. But audiences should not be fooled by its oblique propaganda. Moving on and allowing modern day Germans to cope with their past is one thing  but to promote the idea that the entire war was the fault of one very unstable man is dangerously absurd. One of the film's tag lines, spoken by the real life Traudl Junge, is that 'being young is not an excuse'; well that's just not good enough. It is only when the Germans look themselves in the mirror and confront the harsh reality of their history that the rest of the world could maybe one day move on and forgive while never forgetting."

What's the sense to make a film which intention obviously is to have pity on Adolf Hitler. So, what happened? Of course, children who don't know much about history yet feel sorry for him.

","Der Untergang is a film about the days in the bunker in Berlin within the final assault on the city, showing us the ""enemies"" and ""monsters"" as quite ordinary men, women and children. Hitler is depicted as an old broken but disciplined man, keeping distance to others. He behaves awkward when he kisses Eva, is almost patient and friendly against his female secretaries. When eating one of his last meals his hand is trembling. His manners are also stiff from his Parkinson disease. Hitler doesn't become a real human being, he stays at a certain distance, feeding the still present self created myth around his person. The public feels no sorry for this man which was also guilty of ordering the execution of mass war crimes. Apart from the leaders the normal personal bear no guilt and are victims themselves of the circumstances, like the main character Traudl Junge and the hundreds of thousands above the ground. The last days in the bunker passes self-evideny like a clockwork. Above the ground the storm of the battle rages and the area is heavily and constantly shelled by artillery and rocket fire. At the end of the movie Traudl Junge in her last years of her life admits that however she didn't know about the warcrimes she still feels guilty.<br/><br/>The German government nowadays is obsessed to erase all remains of the Third Reich (and even beyond that). On the open terrain, were once the Chancellary stood, not even a single text indicates what happened there in 1945.

","There is no doubt that the actors and the sets are great. But this is all I can say in favor of this movie.<br/><br/>The movie does not know what to focus on. There are the scenes in the bunker, which are fine, but get boring with time, and there are the scenes in the streets of Berlin. You get to see the suffering of the civilian population and the ""ordinary soldiers"", but most remain without a face. One who has a face is a military doctor who could have gone but decides to stay in Berlin and help the wounded soldiers. Others are a group of youngsters, some boys and a girl, trying to fight the Soviet tanks.<br/><br/>There have been complaints about this movie that it shows Hitler as a human being. I have no problems with that - after all, he was human. I have problems with the rest of the characters. Except Goebbels, who is rather nasty, Goebbels' wife, who is such a fanatic Nazi that she murders her own children so that they don't have to grow up in a world without Nazism, and Eva Braun, who is rather foolish, all the other people in the bunker are very nice and reasonable, trying to convince Hitler to leave Berlin and trying to make him see reason and reality (i.e. the reality that the war could not be won any more.) They try to persuade him to save the civilian population (also called the German people) and the soldiers outside. Hitler refuses to do that, saying the people had not deserved anything better, because it had been too weak.<br/><br/>The same holds for the people outside. They are suffering soldiers and civilians, and some heroic men who hold out and try to help the suffering. One of them is the doctor I mentioned above. Yet he is a member of the SS - not of the Wehrmacht. Still he is shown as a good guy who has no flaws. There are two scenes of people being killed as deserters or collaborators, but they last only a few seconds, and these few people who fought against the Third Reich are left without a face and a story.<br/><br/>So in spite of the movie's claims just to show what ""really"" happened and not interpret history, it has a message: Hitler (and perhaps Goebbels) were crazy, all the rest were nice people and Hitler's victims."

","I once saw a work by the German graphics artist Klaus Staeck, there's a ""Entnazifizierungsurkunde"" (a formula of de-nacification), filled out for a certain Adolf Hitler, where he's rated as ""Mitlaeufer"" (nominal member) of the Nazi party, signed by Joachim C. Fest.<br/><br/>This poster very pointedly summarizes Fest's work on Hitler. It's a real shame that such an inadequate work with such a questionable moral background gets rated this high in the INDB. Just one snippet: The only person of the Nazi elite which really manages to commit an atrocity in the whole film is Goebbels wife! All the other Nazi magnificos are pitiful and broken creatures who have failed in a great endeavor.<br/><br/>Sure, maybe I should concentrate more on the capabilities of the actors, the camera work and the quality of the adaption of the book (which are all OK, in part even superb). But I won't. A film on this subject can only be measured by the subject itself, and in this respect it fails. The one relevant question - ""Why?"" - is neither asked nor answered."

The only moment that humanly moved me was when Hitler awarded medals to the youth soldiers. The obvious discrepancy between the Icon you are willing to die for, and the shabby disgruntled old man in front of you must have been quite distressing!<br/><br/>During the film lots of people blow their brains out yet we don't go through the process of their decision and emotion. Clearly it was not the intention of the director - he avoided any kind of association with the protagonists (maybe today, 60 years later, this still would be TOO scandalous???). Thus he placed us in the position of a street passer-by. For sure all the cast are great and they obviously lived through it (the Hell) but we are offered only the outside shell of their condition - as if Herr Hirschbiegel just happened to be around with a video camera while things were happening.<br/><br/>Still it is a step in the right direction - breaking out of the black&white demonisation of Nazi members which is a default in post-war European society."

"qljsystems","10","2","6","26 October 2005"," A brave and brilliant portrayal of one of history's greatest villains
","Like all movies, war films reflect the political agenda of their time. In the early 1950s, the world was still reeling from the immense tragic loss of life, but by the 1960s, war movies proposed a USA-politico-centric version of events: heroic US marines swaggering along with half-chewed cigars between their teeth, doling out wizened one-liners as each of their single bullets wiped out hundreds of screaming banshee Nazis. The theme was monotonous and repeated: the US won the war and the Nazis are the deserved losers. The Germans were simply the bad guys and there was no attempt to understand or dissect just what turned a leading nation into a murderous abyss.<br/><br/>It's only in the last decade that war movies have turned to more genuine, honest material, portraying war's hideous consequences, the unspeakable violence that it generates and the resulting loss of innocence. More recently, movies daring enough to depict WW2's arch-villain, Der Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler, have appeared, due in no small part to Germany's reunification and national catharsis. Having recently been in Berlin, it is remarkable to see how open the Germans have become. They have progressed beyond the shame and guilt to a true recognition of one of history's most traumatic eras.<br/><br/>Robert Carlysle portrays the main role in Rise of Evil which depicts Hitler's manipulation, bullying, dogmatism and unstoppable rise to power. In Max, starring John Cusack as a Jewish art dealer, Hitler is portrayed as a failed human being obsessed with political imagery, though Max was a weak movie in my estimation. However, it is Bruno Ganz's portrayal that truly shines.<br/><br/>Ganz's Hitler is authentic in every detail, right down to his Austrian accent, gravelly voice and stoic expression.<br/><br/>Most war historians concur that Hitler is a contradictory character, evidenced by his apparent enthusiasm for seeming trivialities and total disregard for important details. Bruno Ganz captures this schism perfectly. Far from being a one-dimensional Charlie Chaplin lookalike in uniform, Downfall's Hitler is both a kindly employer, beloved leader, a pit of seething resentment and progenitor of national evil. He can delight in the dulcet tones of his ministers' singing children, all the while knowing that their parents will murder them to ""save"" them from a future without National Socialism. Ganz perfectly captures Hitler's narcissism, altering between magnanimity of a glorified leader and explosions of fury and prejudice. All the while Hitler confesses to his closest aids that his catastrophic vision was ""meant for the best"".<br/><br/>It is probably the most psychologically realistic portrayal of Hitler: a confused, weary, narcissistic tyrant who couldn't see the wood for the trees even while his ministers repeatedly beg his withdrawal from Berlin. Not content to simply hold out to the end, he dooms his advisors and staff to the same fate by resigning to inevitable failure and his unconscionable act of suicide. Downfall captures the sense of immense betrayal this creates - the betrayal of the high command and everybody who bought into Nazist ideology. The movie also represents the catastrophic future bequeathed by Hitler to Germany, due to his dogged insistence that Nazi Germany had a future while Berlin faced overwhelming odds and a relentless tide of Soviet armies.<br/><br/>Downfall shows Germany's slide into oblivion from the viewpoints of Traudl Junge (one of Hitler's secretaries), a young Hitler Youth volunteer, a medically trained Colonel and Hitler himself. Historic figures such as Albert Speer and Goebbels appear in the movie.<br/><br/>I have no doubt that more movies about Hitler will be produced. Hopefully, some will dare to look into his brutal treatment by his father and the consequent narcissism and hatred that possessed him, or the personal reasons for his monstrous ""final solution"". We can only speculate. Downfall will remain, in my estimation, among the best movies about Hitler himself."

","Just finished watching this modern masterpiece, which brings to dramatic life the truism that the best movies made in the world are often outside Hollywood. Germany is not generally known for very good movies, notwithstanding classics such as Run Lola Run and Das Boot, but Der Untergang is among the very best movies ever made.<br/><br/>The film, which literally means The Downfall, charts the final days before the unconditional surrender by Germany after the final siege of Berlin. Exquisitely subtle, (there are only about a half dozen explosions in the entire film, each one literally earth-shaking and so well positioned structurally in the film, we remember this is basically a war movie of a kind. It is much more of a drama though, as it charts the emotions of those involved in the final days, in Hitler's inner circle. Told primarily from the perspective of a very young secretary of Hitler's whose then unquestioned allegiance to him and eventual (after half a century, that is) double take on her naivety provide a metaphor for Germany's own relationship to humanity's greatest shame, the film succeeds remarkably in going where no-one could, before.<br/><br/>In taking this perspective, the film broke a half-century old taboo, going where it wasn't possible to before a new millennium brought a new freedom. Even then the film kicked off major protests across Germany and elsewhere in the world (mostly Europe) for allegedly 'humanizing' Hitler. That it does, definitely, more or less the way Satya humanizes the participants of the Mumbai underworld. Whether film has the right to allow reprehensible individuals and groups a say through an essaying of their first person perspectives is a moot and morally complex point and this is not the place for such a discussion. Der Untergang at no point glorifies the Nazis, but it does sympathize with their condition when all was lost, as any human being or group deserves sympathy, even those responsible for the worst of the worst crimes.<br/><br/>What is utterly remarkable about this film is its exercise of storytelling and film-making technique. Outstanding in all departments, and blended into a gestalt so perfect that no element can be singled out as superior to the rest, it is an experience to cherish  a perfect film. Film at its best takes us into a space and time radically removed from our own, yet so real a reality that we are completely immersed vicariously in it  and Der Untergang fits this to a T. Yet it is necessary to make note of one aesthetic stroke  the movie's take on Hitler as a manic depressive bipolar swinging between absurd visions and profound melancholies that often descended into rants and rages and Bruno Ganz's portrayal of this complex role. Never for a moment did I doubt Bruno Ganz was Hitler, the channeling is of the order of Jamie Foxx's essaying of Ray  simply perfect.<br/><br/>All in all  this film is the reason we watch films compulsively, so that among the dozens we experience, one may rise up to the true potential of cinema."

","This film had to be one of the best cinematic experiences I've had with war movies,even though I watched it in my own home. The actors do magnificent portrayals of Hitler and his adjutants, not only showing you the horrors that they have committed, but the fact that they were people too, not just a stereotypical bad guy tying a girl to a train track. Bruno Ganz does a wonderful job at being Hitler, his compelling performance made you understand what it was that had so many people enthralled with the man, his charisma, his energy, and how he managed to make everything seem as though it were in control, even though the Russians were mere kilometers from the city center in the beginning of the movie. Ganz also shows the darker side of Hitler, his absurd ideals, his unreasonable strategies, and how mentally unstable he was by the end of the war. The film undoubtedly is dark, showing you over ten suicides, including those of mere children in the Hitler Youth, a girl a few years older than myself, perhaps 16, and a boy around 17. You also see the Hitlers', the Goebbles', their children's, and several lieutenants' suicides. The Downfall shows the chaos that ensued during and after the fall of the Reich, SS squads killing people who they had deemed traitors, those who had allegedly helped the Russians, and the horror of the war in itself. Traudle Junge's part and the young Hitler Youth boy, Peter, tend to be overshadowed by Hitler and his adjutants, but they do play a fairly large part. Overall, this movie was one of the best I have ever seen, morbidly fascinating and darkly compelling, a definite ten out of ten!"

But even here, they're still not quite as desperate and hopeless as were their victims, who went in hunger and thirst to their deaths without the benefit of handguns and vials of poison.<br/><br/>The coldness of the Nazis is, at times, breathtaking. Their unquestioning nationalism, their devotion to and belief in Hitler, and their readiness to blow their brains out for the cause, now lost, are sickening. Twice we see parents taking not only their lives, but also the lives of their children.<br/><br/>Nowhere in the movie, as I recall, did Hitler accept blame (or anything remotely close) for what was happening. It was the generals' fault. He should have killed them as Stalin did his. Then it was the people's fault. They were weak.

","Traudl Junge arrives in Rastenberg and gets a job as Hitler's shorthand-typist, later moving to the bunker beside the Reich Chancellery in Berlin. The rest is history.<br/><br/>A lot of the film is based on her memoirs and told from her point-of-view. She sees most things in the bunker and even takes Hitler's last political testament. The atmosphere is dark and depressing throughout the entire film, as you would expect with a bunch of people facing a certain end. The Russians are just a few miles away and the whole city is under heavy artillery fire; the defence is down to a bunch of young boys and a few old men.<br/><br/>Alexandria Maria Lara (Traudle Junge) is probably a fine actress  she is certainly very pretty  yet this film is covered with her ludicrous, 'it's all so strange and terrible' expression. She plays a parody of someone caught up in unimaginable situations.<br/><br/>For such an epic moment in history  the triumph of one civilisation over another  this film, for me, just doesn't convey the enormity of the situation. Hitler and Goebbels make the occasional comment on the Bolsheviks and how their victory will be terrible, but it is just unconvincing, though still very interesting.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz does a fine job portraying Hitler but, for some reason, he is made to look like a midget up against the other actors.

"svikasha","9","1","2","23 June 2017"," The Downfall Offers a Rare Chance to Witness the Collapse of the Nazi Regime
","Hollywood loves to depict World War Two. The Second World War has overwhelmingly been the setting of choice for major filmographic depicts of war. But the German film industry, for understandable reasons, has been much more hesitant to produce such films. To be fair, how does a filmmaker depict such a period in human history? How does one do justice to its tragic nature without glorifying the carnage? It isn't easy to depict Adolph Hitler on screen accurately without risking alienating and horrifying a great number of people. Such a task is especially not worth attempting on a budget of only 13.5 million. This fact alone makes the 2004 German film ""Der Untergang"" an accomplishment worthy of acknowledgement. <br/><br/>The war drama is called ""The Downfall"" in English and basically depicts the final ten days of Adolf Hitler's Nazi Regime in 1945. The film was directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel and received critical acclaim upon its release. But it is a movie that can still be watched years later. The story is influenced by two books: ""Until the Final Hour"" by Traudl Junge and ""Inside Hitler's Bunker"" by Joachim Fest. Traudle Junge was a historical figure who worked as Adolf Hitler's last private secretary until his death. The film is partly based on her personal account of the events that took place before Hitler's suicide.<br/><br/>Traudle was young when she was hired by Hitler to be his secretary in 1942. At the opening of the film, a much older Traudle expresses remorse for admiring Hitler in her youth. A common theme among portrayals of World War Two is that bad things happen to good people. In The Downfall, bad things happen to bad people. The Downfall was a dark and grim movie to watch. The movie is often both absurd and horrifying at the same time. There are times when the movie portrays the solitude and hopelessness of the characters in the film so well that you forget that the characters being portrayed in the film are some of the most ruthless leaders of the 20th century. There is a scene where SS officers and soldiers are getting drunk and partying with topless prostitutes in a bombed out Berlin that is actively being taken over by the invading Soviet army. Everybody knows that they are going to die. Yet nobody, at any point of the movie, can come to terms with the insanity of their situation.<br/><br/>Both the First and Second World Wars can both be summed up as soldiers fighting for politicians who were completely unwilling to fight for them. However, understanding this is one thing. But getting a chance to visually witness the stark contrast between the fates of the soldiers on the losing side to the fates of the politicians on the losing side is quite awakening. There is a scene where Eva Braun, Hitler's future wife dances on a table to celebrate Hitler's birthday even as the venue is getting shelled by artillery fire. Children are dying in Berlin to try to protect them from the invaders. But it isn't until a shell explodes right next to the gathering, shattering the windows of the venue in the process, that the vain attempts at celebrations are brought to a halt. These ""leaders"" couldn't care less about the Germany people. Half of them even abandon Hitler and his regime before the war is over. <br/><br/>There is a sense of desperation throughout the whole film. But that isn't the most horrific part. Any film that can get an audience member to feel pity for a barbarian like Adolph Hitler is remarkable enough to be worth watching at least once. At his ruined birthday party, against his own commander's advice, Hitler declares, ""I will defeat them in Berlin, or face my downfall"". He failed, and the rest is history."

","Downfall is a great movie with a very well developed plot and an outstanding cast. It is a very dark, surreal and blunt drama that really dives deep in to the final days of World War II. It does not hold back on the intensity of these times, the dialogue is suspenseful and we are at the edge of our seat throughout, feeling any of these characters could be killed off in any moment. <br/><br/>It can be a bit too ""big"" at times in terms of performances, not that any of the acting is poor, just a bit too theatrical at times for a film. There are moments, particularly in Hitler's office scenes, that are somewhat Shakespearean, that would have made more sense on stage, it could have been subtler. <br/><br/>The film makes a very controversial decision of humanising Adolf Hitler, portraying a lot of the traumas of this war from his perspective. Though I did not leave this film thinking Hitler is a good person, I did feel for his characters in levels that really surprised me, thanks mainly to a stellar, enticing performance from Bruno Ganz. <br/><br/>It is two and a half hours long, but it does not feel like that. Intense and very well acted, Downfall had me enthralled throughout, worth the watch if you are looking for a good drama. <br/><br/>Conveys the final days of the second World War through the point of view of Hitler's secretary. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bruno Ganz"
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","2","22 February 2017"," Excellent.
","This is simply the film transposition of the memories of the last secretary of Adolf Hitler, the Bavarian girl Traudl Junge. Its a historical document in film, insofar as its absolutely faithful to facts and history. Hitler was a man with a magnetic charisma and personality, who manipulated people and created in Germany a powerful cult of the leader, through which he became almost unassailable, doing everything he wanted without anyone having the possibility of oppose. We can imagine this manipulative power seeing his generals shaking as ill-behaved boys in one of its most famous scenes. We watch everything: the dictator commanding imaginary troops, inventing plans and dream cities, but also directing, in a ruthlessly and cunning way, the few that were faithful to him until the end. The gap between the reality in and off the bunker and the general insensitivity to the suffering of the country is brutally glaring. The actors are illustrious strangers, to the extent that I have never heard of any of them, but the work developed is enough for the film to work very well. In fact, the film is not an acting show, although its good. The value of the film is in the script and story told, no matter how well known it is. It has very strong scenes, some of them absolutely unsuitable for minors and more sensitive people."
"tomgillespie2002","8","1","2","19 February 2017"," A brave, bold movie
","While there may be a multitude of movies produced in Europe and America depicting the atrocities of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich - both to dramatic and deliberately comical effect - Germany itself is notoriously apprehensive when facing its dark, and very recent, history. Based on accounts from historians and witnesses, including Andre Heller and Othmar Schmiderer's documentary Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (from which scenes are used to book-end the film), Oliver Hirschbiegel's Der Untergang, or Downfall, is one of the best movies ever made about Hitler. Rather than investigating how the war veteran and struggling artist became the egotistical tyrant he is remembered as being, Downfall focuses on his final days holed up in a bunker as the war comes to a bloody end around him.<br/><br/>It's a testament to Bruno Ganz's performance that Hitler remains the enigmatic figure seen in Leni Riefenstahl's documentaries, even though he is descending into madness and is clearly in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. As the Russian army closes in on Berlin and the shell blasts increase in volume through the walls, Hitler and his cabinet are faced with the crippling realisation that their vision of global ethnic cleansing and forming a Germanic empire has failed spectacularly. Often hushed, cunning and inspirational to the men who still adore him, the Fuhrer is also prone to outrageous demands and formidable tantrums. He is a paradoxical cluster, damning his people to death by demanding they still resist an enemy that has already defeated them, yet Ganz still finds humanity in there. Between scolding the Jewish race and sending units into certain death, he mourns the death of his beloved dog Blondi and forms a tender relationship with Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler). He is humanised, but never sympathetic.<br/><br/>Yet Downfall is not simply a document of Hitler's final days; it is much more about Germany as a whole, and how the country fell into chaos as the Reich was toppled. We gain access into the bunker through Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), Hitler's secretary for many years. Out in the increasingly perilous streets of Berlin, Professor Schenck (Christian Berkel) does all he can to help the weak and injured while Hitler Youth assassinate old men fleeing the bombing. Many of the cabinet, including Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) and Hermann Fegelein (Thomas Kretschmann), are desperate to flee and urge their Fuhrer to do the same, while contradicting his orders in the hope of salvaging some sort of peace. Despite the scope of the story, you'll never hear Downfall being referred to as an ensemble piece or a war epic, as it retains a sense of intimacy throughout thanks to Rainer Klaussman's grainy, claustrophobic cinematography, with even the wide-open streets of Berlin feeling oddly suffocating. It's a brave, bold movie, and one that goes about its business with focus and a stern grip on the complex unfolding of events."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","2","14 January 2017"," WWII from the Nazi perspective: A tough task and even tougher experience, but profound and necessary
","Not just any World War II film or dramatization of Nazis, ""Downfall"" gets up close and personal with the Third Reich and its key members, recounting Adolf Hitler's final days in a Berlin bunker as Soviet troops besieged the city.<br/><br/>No one has had to play Hitler in quite the way ""Downfall"" requires of Bruno Ganz. This is not a good vs. evil, Axis and Allies WWII epic that reminds us all of the wickedness of Nazism and the great tragedy of the Holocaust. Screenwriter Bernd Eichinger wants to — with as much historical accuracy as possible — explore the Fuhrer behind the facade, the megalomaniacal idealist as he's confronted with his inevitable failure. With Oliver Hirschbiegel's stark direction and Ganz's multi-faceted performance, ""Downfall"" strips away the legend of Hitler and other high-ranking Nazis and provides a grim, pitiful portrait of a movement's dying breaths. <br/><br/>In addition to a book compiled by historian Joachim Fest, the story comes from the accounts of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary from 1942 through his death, who survived following the Nazis' surrender. Hirschbiegel actually bookends the film with testimonial footage of the real Junge reflecting on being young and naive, and how she played ignorant and absolved herself of any guilt at the time and now has trouble forgiving herself. <br/><br/>Junge's character (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) is the closest thing the film has to a protagonist, yet the film isn't presented entirely from her perspective. The story features an extensive list of characters, from notable names like Goebbels (Ulrich Matthes) and Himmler (Ulrich Noethen) to an array of military officers, doctors, children and volunteer fighters and more. It actually starts to get extremely confusing, but Eichinger was clearly determined not to exclude any one person or type of person, and the payoff comes in the form of the various ways these many characters responded to knowing the end was coming, which presents us with an array of fascinating psychological case studies.<br/><br/>Most fascinating of them all, of course is Hitler, who the film depicts as making careful preparations for his suicide knowing it was only a matter of time, but who refused to surrender and continued to bark military orders as if confident that a the final victory was still achievable. Ganz's performance has hints of the fiery orator most people are familiar with, but also a sensitivity and a sadness as he realizes just how many of his people have betrayed him by giving up and that was his failure. That's not to say Ganz or ""Downfall"" humanize Hitler to the extent that we actually feel sorry for him, but even those who believe so ardently in an evil ideology must confront failures, their legacy and death.<br/><br/>Hitler also knew he had lost, and the film portrays him of being at peace with it, so what's more chilling is the way others respond, those who were naive, those who went along with Nazism out of cowardice, and those who became so swept up in Nazi dogma that they couldn't toss it away in the face of objective truth and logic. Maybe more fascinating than Hitler's perspective is that of the prominent Nazi women in the film, Hitler's longtime partner Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler) and Maegda Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch). Both women remain loyal in spite of their fate, but handle the waning moments different. Maegda's decision to bring her six children into the bunker, for one, has a particularly harrowing effect on the film.<br/><br/>""Downfall"" doesn't have the cinematic qualities of most WWII films. In fact, it might be better suited as a play with its limited set and variety of scenes featuring conversations between a host of different characters. The constant shelling of Berlin throughout the entire film provides ample context for the drama underground that the story doesn't need most of the outdoor ""action"" sequences. <br/><br/>That said, Hirschbiegel does not glorify war or violence; his film portrays both rather matter-of-factly. In fact, he's a little inconsistent in how he uses blood and gore — the amount of it varies from scene to scene, but the amount of death in the film is staggering and a profound component of the experience of the film. ""Downfall"" kind of presents everything at face value, a rather critical decision considering the highly sensitive nature of the story and its characters.<br/><br/>Every WWII film, especially one about Nazism and the Holocaust, must have a niche and unique perspective considering how often filmmakers dip into its well of stories. Yet they do it because humanity will never quite understand how the Nazis were able to take power and how the Holocaust was allowed to happen. ""Downfall,"" as difficult a viewing experience as it is, unquestionably fills in one part of the picture of one of history's darkest chapters, a section that could've easily gone unpainted.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading.

","Downfall is an enthralling film that examine the final days of the Nazi hierarchy ensconced in their bunker. It is a war story I have never encountered before, the German view of the last days in 1945. As the war is lost we see the Nazis throwing their own citizens in peril as the red army takes control of Berlin.<br/><br/>As Goebbels remarks, he has no sympathy for the German citizens, they made their choice, gave the Nazis the mandate now they will face the consequences.<br/><br/>Downfall is told from the view of Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) a young woman from Munich taken on by Hitler as a secretary in 1942. Her memoir is one of the sources of the movie's narrative.<br/><br/>Hitler (Bruno Ganz) is increasingly unhinged at times shouts like a rabid dog of comrades, generals that have betrayed him. His acolytes in the bunker, some remain loyal, some look to get out, some look for a glorious death, others just to survive. As the city is near to falling, you see a few of the officers getting increasingly drunk, (Eva Braun lives a decadent life even as the city is being pounded) others make way in to the bunker and hear Hitler speak of some miraculous, imaginary strategy that an army division will come to the rescue. In the meantime he is making plans for his own and Eva's death and destruction of their bodies.<br/><br/>As Berlin is destroyed, its citizens turn on in each other, people get hung as Russian collaborators. A young boy is part of a makeshift resistance to repel the Russians and then just tries to make his way home.<br/><br/>At the end you see the Goebbels who decide it is National Socialism or nothing and Mrs Goebbels calmly kills her own children before they take their own lives.<br/><br/>The film finishes as we see documentary footage of Junge who confesses she did not know what was happening under the Nazis but she should had looked harder, after all Sophie Scholl who was also from Munich knew what was happening.<br/><br/>Downfall is apparently faithful to the facts. It is not just a film that is set in the bunker, you see the fighting in the city, the German soldiers trying to resist, getting conflicting orders at times impossible orders. One General is ordered to be shot for leaving his lines, he has not and goes to see Hitler to complain.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a commanding film that holds your attention and a blazing performance by Ganz. His Hitler is ill and mad, knowing his dream of the third Reich is in ruins and flip flopping between reality and fantasy surrounded by sycophants who want him to leave Berlin and suspicious military leaders, who feel betrayed by his overconfidence and ineptitude who wish to pursue peace at this late stage."

","Downfall begins with an excerpt from the documentary Blind Spot: Hitler's Secretary (2002), featuring Traudl Junge expressing her guilt and shame for admiring Hitler in her youth. The film continues showing Hitler (Bruno Ganz) hiring Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) as his secretary at the Wolf's Lair in East Prussia in November 1942.<br/><br/>The story resumes on 20 April 1945, the Führer's birthday, during the Battle of Berlin. A loud artillery blast wakes up Traudl, Gerda Christian and Constanze Manziarly in the room they share. Down in the Führerbunker, Hitler is informed by Wilhelm Burgdorf that Berlin is under attack and then by Karl Koller that the Red Army has advanced to within 12 kilometres (7.5 mi) of central Berlin.<br/><br/>At Hitler's birthday reception, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and his SS adjutant Hermann Fegelein plead with Hitler to leave the city. Instead, Hitler declares, ""I will defeat them in Berlin, or face my downfall."" Himmler leaves to negotiate surrender terms with the Western Allies, behind Hitler's back. In another part of the city, a group of Hitler Youth members are bolstering defenses. Peter, one of the members, is urged by his father to desert but refuses."

","I sometimes find films in a foreign language difficult to follow and a little bit tedious. I had heard a lot about 'Downfall', with many claiming it to be the greatest Second World War film ever made. Now while this may be a bit of a stretch, it is nonetheless a fantastic film which any war film lover should watch.<br/><br/>The story is of course well-known, however the way in which it is told it is something special. Following the diary entries of a young secretary, the film adequately captures the mix of panic, frustration and even jubilance that was present in the bunker. Of course for any English speaker, it is a bit annoying to have to read the dialogue, but I suggest anyone who is put off by this to not be. The film is more than worth the reading. I personally feel that this is better than 'Letters From Iwo Jima'.<br/><br/>A fantastic film, with very good acting and clever directing allows this film to more than deservedly be in the Top 250."

","(Warning: There Will Be Spoilers)<br/><br/>The Hitler in Downfall is not exactly the same Hitler we've seen before. He's just as hostile and hateful as we know, but here he is only a deeply insecure man masquerading as a powerful and strong one. ""Downfall"" shows how unbelievably single- minded Hitler and his followers were, and how the few humane people were far too outnumbered to make a difference. Consider for instance a scene in which Hitler is going to kill himself and Magda Goebbels comes knocking at his door sobbing and falls to her knees hugging his legs, begging him not to do it. Then consider a later scene in which she murders her children because she doesn't want them to live in a world without Hitler. As she kills her children her face is completely emotionless. Then she walks out, sits down for a couple seconds, stands up and goes to play cards, like nothing ever happened. <br/><br/>The most terrifying thing in this movie is how Hitler simply has no regard for human life. Hitler's world begins crumbling down on him and he brings everyone else down with him, and I mean EVERYONE. His country, his people, and even the few people truly close to him. Even after he basically announces to everyone that they're screwed, he continues to defend Berlin against Russia, knowing Berlin's fate, but convincing himself that he can withstand against it. He manages to convince himself that he is the courageous one and that all of the soldiers are being cowards, but ironically decides to kill himself.<br/><br/>But the most important part of all of this is about the people he influences. As I describe him most people probably think ""how could anyone possibly follow this man?"" and were given a glimpse to the first impression most people at the time would get with Traudl Junge. He would seem like a kind, powerful man to some, but his true personality was already hidden by the reputation he had built up, and in order to understand what kind of man he really was, we need to see him from a new perspective.<br/><br/>While I believe the movie does make points like this through the actions of the characters, but none of its points are ever forced or hamfisted. It simply shows the facts and leaves the viewer up to decide what the point is. Also, while they are one-sided, it never shows Hitler or the Nazis as inhuman monsters, it shows them as scared, confused human beings that cling to an insecure, scared man that has unrealistically high expectations for Berlin.<br/><br/>In short, I think ""Downfall"" is a masterpiece and its greatest strength comes in how it gets it's point across through the actors' performances and the characters' actions, and I could go on explaining many incredible scenes and the point that each scene communicates, but that would be pointless. Just go watch the movie if you haven't seen it yet."

"sandnair87","9","1","2","21 April 2015"," A Relentlessly Honest Movie Recounting Hitler's 'Downfall'!
","Downfall, Oliver Hirschbiegel's thoroughly devastating digest of the Third Reich's final days, isn't about commuting the sentence that history gave the Nazis, but heeding its warning - a gruesome, sustained-tension lesson about informed politics.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the final ten days of the Third Reich, as told from the perspective of several key figures that were present in the bowels of a dank bunker beneath a burning Berlin that Adolf Hitler retreated to, as Germany was invaded by the Russian forces in 1945. Hitler, now hunched-over parody of himself, seems defeated from the moment we see him, but his megalomania and outright insanity is always lurking just beneath the surface. On some level, we sense — as do some of the characters in the film — that Hitler knows it's all over for him and his Reich, but that doesn't prevent him from ranting about delusional betrayals, moving nonexistent armies across maps and blatantly refusing to surrender even in the face of certain downfall. But Hitler's mindset is not the entire crux of this complex film, which is really just as concerned, and possibly more so, with his inner circle's reaction to impending doom. Once thriving individuals in the streets of a city that showered them in rude luxuries, they have now been reduced to mere rats in an underground maze. As the dream around them crumbles into heaps of rubble and their followers become corpses in crowded alleys, we watch the hope and strength fade from their faces. Like the characters of the best of Shakespeare's tragedies, they occupy the narrative like shattered mirrors of themselves, retreating to the safety of their self-delusions and often reflecting on the reasons for their imminent destiny, as if to quietly confess their evil and seek some semblance of respect before the end comes. <br/><br/>Downfall takes on the unenviable task of portraying Hitler as a human being, rather than a caricature or larger-than-life monster as the norm has dictated. But while doing so, Hirschbiegel simply strips away the myth from the monster, laying bare the utter banality of his evil. It features a staggeringly creepy performance by Bruno Ganz, whose Hitler is both a raving psychotic and a beaten, melancholic man. He generates indelible ferocity as Hitler - his composure snapping at will and foam frothing during his delusional flights of fancy about military might. He takes hold of the job with clenched fists; his manner of expression and the growl in his voice are so meticulous and researched, there is seldom a moment we consciously think about it as a performance; it is an uncompromised embodiment.<br/><br/>Downfall is a spine-chilling experience, a masterpiece of filmmaking which conclusively damns the repetition of its history. It is an unflinching, hard, relentlessly honest movie that refuses to ask questions that have easy answers. But even with all the tough questions the movie poses, it remains a long stare into an abyss from which no comforting answers can emerge."
"williampsamuel","8","1","2","7 December 2014"," A gripping biopic of history's greatest monster
","Oliver Hirschbiegel's Downfall plays like a solemn, mournful dirge as it chronicles the last days of Hitler's Germany, as seen by his personal stenographer, Traudl Jung (Alexandria Maria Lara.) It is a tale of a city's death, and the fate of those whose actions were responsible for it. It is above all, an unflinching portrait of one of the most reprehensible people in history, yet one that never allows itself to forget that even he was human.<br/><br/>After brief interview footage with Frau Jung, and a scene showing her first meeting with Hitler, the story moves to Berlin, April 1945. The Third Reich, which was to last a thousand years, is in full collapse. Russian artillery pounds the city from positions only a few miles away. The people know that the end is approaching, and pray only that they will survive it.<br/><br/>Below the streets, deep inside the Furherbunker, many have come to the same conclusions. The top generals realize that they can only delay the inevitable for so long. Himmler, Goering, and the other Nazi bigwigs who for years trumpeted their loyalty to the ideals of National Socialism can hardly wait to flee. And in the center of it all is the Furhur himself.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz' portrayal of Hitler is absolutely brilliant. Here is a man who once ruled all Europe from the English Channel to the outskirts of Moscow. Now he is confined to his bunker as his empire dies. He is haggard and high strung from lack of sleep and a steady stream of bad news. His mood swings wildly with each new development. At times he remains convinced that final victory is at hand, that all will be saved as soon as this thrust or that breaks through the encircling Russians. He discusses his plans for a new, rebuilt Berlin with Marshal Speer and tells the new Luftwaffe commandeer that he has thousands of jet fighters ready to take to the skies.<br/><br/>But when he hears that the planned counterattack has failed, his rage is terrible to behold as he lashes out at his generals. He rants and raves about their cowardice and disloyalty, until exhausted, he falls into despair, declaring that all is lost. This cycle is repeated multiple times; with Hitler believing that one nonexistent force or another will safe him, then ranting against his enemies, both real and imagined, then settling into melancholy as he comes to terms with- and plans- his own death.<br/><br/>Through all of this, Ganz is entirely convincing, capturing both his madness and his humanness. When he gets angry, his face reddens and the veins in his forehead bulge. He looks, and sounds, just like Hitler did at the Nuremburg rallies. When he loses touch and talks about his grandiose plans, he speaks with such earnestness that those around him can only nod in agreement. When he talks of the Jews and the Russians, his voice goes cold, his eyes narrow, and everything human leaves his face.<br/><br/>And those around him must also come to grips with the reality of their situation. Some take an attitude of ""Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die."" His mistress, Eva Braun, even holds a party on the surface, until it is broken up by artillery fire. Others cling to faith in final victory, refusing to believe that Germany can lose, until even they can no longer deny it. Some reach a calm fatalism, accepting that their end has come. Still others, like Frau Jung, realize that their only hope is to escape.<br/><br/>The end, when it finally comes is swift. After Hitler's suicide, it is left only for the remaining occupants to either follow suit or flee for their lives, hoping to make it through the enemy lines, as the city burns and the last remaining die-hards make their final stands. Watching this unfold, the characters' fear and anguish are palpable, as is the sheer pointlessness of their struggle. And yet Downfall manages to fully convey the hopelessness, despair, and chaos without giving in to them. This is perhaps the movie's greatest strength. Although it draws you into a bunker mentality, and does not flinch from showing the chaos desolation of the Reich's last days, in the end, you are reminded that somehow, life goes on."

","There are few movies on Germany in WWII and this together with Das Boot are one of the excellently best. It covers the very last time of Hitler 's life in the bunker in Berlin.

Could they not have found an actress who could learn that? (Yes, later interviews with her on YouTube clearly reveal the accent).<br/><br/>This movie should be a must for history lessons, or lessons in German language for that matter. Bruno Ganz as Hitler is at his very best.<br/><br/>For a WWII movie junkie, there are very few ""action scenes"" although there is some suspense in wondering if they are going to make it out of the claws of the advancing Red Army.<br/><br/>The movie is an excellent base for further reading and history studies.

Second, there are plenty of streets with little or no modern advertisements and other commercial aspects. Clips from this movie are used in numerous parodies that appear on YouTube in which a scene (usually the one of Adolf Hitler yelling at his subordinates) is re-subtitled to imbue it with unintended new comedic meaning and pathos.

"kelby393","10","1","2","28 February 2013"," The most powerful WWII movie I've ever seen...
","I admit that I also heard of this movie from the many parodies on YouTube. Seeing Bruno Ganz's haunting portrayal of the Fuhrer was so fascinating (and so hard not to laugh at because it is so spot on!), I decided to see what the rest of the movie is like so I found it on Netflix.<br/><br/>And oh my goodness, I think this is the most powerful WWII movie I've ever seen. The cinematography and sets are wonderful and 100% realistic to the years 1943-1945. More importantly, though, is the story and characters - it's Hitler's 56th birthday, and for the next ten days, he will face his own downfall. In all that time, he watches his whole world fall apart, with his most trusted officers betraying him, and his army failing at his most desperate time. You see all this happening to him, topped off with a HUGE nervous breakdown (which explains him holding his injured left hand flapping behind his back), and shockingly enough you actually feel SORRY for him!! The movie gives Hitler a human personality and not a caricature villain personality. If a movie can do this and still NOT justify any evil thing that this monster did, that is an accomplishment.<br/><br/>Not only do you feel sorry for Hitler, you also feel sorry for every other person who is either traumatized or killed. The emotion is powerful in this movie - depressing, yes, but what do you expect? I mean there are even CHILDREN that die in this movie!! I guarantee, no matter how thick a shell you have, when you see this movie, you WILL feel something. The score, what little there is, is wonderful and bold. The amount of research that went into the production of this movie is phenomenal, and it shows. You are completely convinced that every bit of everything in this movie actually happened.<br/><br/>The acting - oh my god, the acting. When the actor/actress injects as much life as physically possible into their character, to the point where the audience sees them as not just an actor but the real character they are portraying, that is a great accomplishment in itself. This movie has great acting like this, beginning to end.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why there are so many parodies out there - because the movie was so great!!!! I completely recommend this. 10/10"

","This film is a truly admirable attempt to examine the character and mindset of Hitler and those closest to him. Indeed, I think it must be the most engaging and thought-provoking WWII movie I have seen. If this had been a Hollywood production with Hollywood stars it would not have had this impact, but it is German-made and its director (Oliver Hirschbiegel) seemed to go out of his way to avoid leading the viewer to any conclusion, instead allowing everyone to form their own opinion based on the facts. Too often the horrors of WWII led writers and directors to depict Nazis as monsters, but this misses the real story; the question of how they became monsters. In a way, the human Hitler which Hirschbiegel shows us is more guilty than a raving monster since it is clear he made choices to do wrong.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is absolutely convincing as Hitler, Ulrich Matthes plays Joseph Goebbels wonderfully, and indeed the rest of the cast are all excellent.<br/><br/>Highly recommended viewing and well worth the almost three hours running time."
"zizumia","9","1","2","15 June 2012"," Good film to see the other side of things.
","I personally liked it. As an extreme fan of researching and knowing about WWII, it was interesting to see the other side. As for I am an American, I have done much research and I have seen sides of the Allies, but not too much from the Axis. Only some ""unsubtitled"" clips. <br/><br/>It was interesting, even though I found this film to attract sympathy to such an evil person, I still found it to be interesting. Yet to know, that everything that happened to Hitler's ""empire"" was Hitlers fault, although through the film he blamed much of the failures on his Generals. Now I am not sure if this film was historically accurate, but to me, I saw the other side. People who loved him and saw him as a nice guy, were people who believed in him, and thought that we was god. Of course they will see him that way. Yet, even if this film was made to attract people to feel bad for the Nazis, they failed to convince me if their goal was that, for my views still stand with the Allies. <br/><br/>I was looking through the people who hated it, and some people said it was because they made Hitler as the good guy. Well, to put, this is the perspective of the Nazis, and Hitler had single handedly brainwashed and convinced all of Germany as well as every Nazi supporter that his views were right and are the only views that are right for the world. For this, is what made Hiter so fascinating to me. For he was able to make a vast amount of people believe in his ""evil"". <br/><br/>I am not sure if this was ""historically accurate"", for I never lived during WWII, and I only know the American side from grandparents who served or lived in that time. Yet as I see, that this film was based on the word of someone who worked closely with Hitler. So it may be facts. But I found it to be a good film, and I suggest watching to see what the other side was going through as the Nazi empire fell. The acting is quite amazing as well."
"oliverrhodesdopeypandas","10","1","2","21 May 2012"," Outstanding reconstruction of the Third Reich
","First thing, Bruno Ganz's performance is just the most realistic and only performance that is just like the real Hitler. Everyone in that entire movie, looked so much like their real-life version in the film. Movies like this that focus on making it realistic and accurate as possible seems impossible to do--but Downfall made it possible for any filming crew to search and want these pieces for making a brilliant movie. It also feels more authentic than the other movies about Hitler due to the natural German language. I'm actually glad there's no English dub as they usually would do for foreign language movies--I prefer subtitles over a dub! There are some things that are inaccurate. For instance, Fegelein was a Gruppenfuehrer in real-life during the last days, but in the movie he was a Brigadefuehrer. Those minor inaccuracies don't bother me, but if it's only I'm focusing on another character.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Downfall has to be the most brilliant World War II movie on the final days of the Fuehrer I have ever seen."

","The one type of artwork that perhaps captures the human condition better than any other is the war movie. However, this is not a universal reality, as many of these films fail to capture the horror of war and thus end up glamorizing it. Downfall is about as real as war movies get; the historical (not to mention visual) accuracy of the film, guided by Oliver Hirschbiegel's expert direction and Bruno Ganz's stunning portrayal of Adolf Hitler, makes for a tour de force that is both captivating and educational. Once, the people of the Third Reich were optimistic and fervent in their belief in National Socialism and European conquest; as World War II's final curtain falls, they succumb to grim realization that the fight is over and their leader has betrayed their trust and brought on, out of his own madness, the destruction of the Fatherland. A riveting account of the final days of one of the most malevolent empires in human history, Downfall is true cinematic power."

Despite the lengthy running time, DOWNFALL is never less than gripping thanks to the stark realism and depth of character present at all times.<br/><br/>It certainly makes for uncomfortable viewing in that it gets you sympathising with the top Nazi officials on multiple occasions. Even Hitler himself seems, well, human. That's the genius of DOWNFALL: it avoids painting characters in black and white terms of good and evil, instead showing that the German commanders were only misguided people after all.<br/><br/>Most WW2 movies adopt Allied perspectives of the war, so I found this to be a refreshing change of pace. The movie is expertly shot and acted, emphasising subtlety throughout. The cameraman sits back and lets the cast do their jobs, and what jobs! Bruno Ganz (NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE) is brilliant as Hitler, and everyone else ups their ante to rival his turn. By turns moving and horrific, disturbing and poignant, DOWNFALL is a mature, engrossing and reflective piece of storytelling."
"Desertman84","10","1","2","4 December 2011"," Hitler's Last Ten Days
","Downfall is an epic war film depicting the final ten days of Adolf Hitler's life in his Berlin bunker and Nazi Germany in 1945.It stars Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler and Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, together with Corinna Harfouch,Ulrich Matthes,Juliane Köhler and Thomas Kretschmann.The film was written by Bernd Eichinger, and based upon the books Inside Hitler's Bunker, by historian Joachim Fest; Until the Final Hour, the memoirs of Traudl Junge, one of Hitler's secretaries (co- written with Melissa Müller); Albert Speer's memoirs, Inside the Third Reich; Hitler's Last Days: An Eye–Witness Account, by Gerhardt Boldt; Das Notlazarett Unter Der Reichskanzlei: Ein Arzt Erlebt Hitlers Ende in Berlin by Doctor Ernst-Günther Schenck; and Siegfried Knappe's memoirs, Soldat: Reflections of a German Soldier, 1936–1949.It was directed by directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel.<br/><br/>Traudl Junge was twenty-two years old when, in the fall of 1942, she was hired to be personal secretary to Adolf Hitler. In April of 1945, Junge was still working for Hitler as forces were bearing down on Germany and the leader retreated to a secret bunker in Berlin for what would prove to be the last ten days of his life, as well as that of the Third Reich. As Hitler's mistress Eva Braun attempts to throw a cheerful birthday party for her man, Hitler's closest associates, including Heinrich Himmler, Joseph Goebbels, and Albert Speer, urge him to flee the city with only Goebbels maintaining any illusions that the Third Reich has any hope of survival. Hitler refuses to leave Berlin, and he spends his final days ranting and raving to Junge, blaming all around him as he tries to understand where his leadership went wrong. Meanwhile, Goebbels and his wife round up their six children and bring them to the bunker as Berlin begins to topple, determined to take their lives rather than face the Allies after Germany's certain defeat.<br/><br/>The greatest achievement of this film is that it gives a definitive and unbiased account of Hitler's final days and the collapse of the Third Reich.The film also had excellent and outstanding performance especially from Bruno Ganz,who plays the German dictator as delusional, hateful and cruel man -- but also human.Arguably,this film presents the greatest portrayal of the man who also has emotions and is affected by his demons as a human being.It also shows him in times of trials,tribulations and impending defeat.Although some may see Ganz' portrayal as a neo-Nazi in one way or another,the film only tries to show the humanity of the person who just like you and me have their own strengths and weaknesses.Aside from the focus on Hitler,this film's message also tells us how men who uses evil devices end up on the final run.It is a lesson that a viewer can see not from a historical point-of-view but rather on one's own perspective as a human being.No matter how one rises in power,one should also foresee that it doesn't last forever as there is a time that everything ends.In Hitler's case,his downfall also came inspite the fact that he was capable of conquering the world and turn it under his authority."
"wadechurton","10","1","2","21 November 2011"," Hitler was human. And that's the point.
","After watching this movie, I was intrigued as to why anyone might have 'hated it', and after reading the relevant IMDb reviews, I think I know. There were actually many reasons given; objections to everything from acting to sets to direction and more, but in light of the movie's evident quality they seemed to be nit-picking at best. The acting is first-rate, as is the rest of 'Downfall'. This is a powerful, gripping movie with characterisations so well-realised (Hitler himself, secretary Traudl, the supremely creepy Josef and Magda Goebbels and many others) they will haunt you. What the 'hated it' reviewers actually didn't like was the humanistic portrayal of Hitler. The hunched, shuffling and twitching 'grandfatherly' Hitler of 'Downfall' is a far cry from the long-familiar vigorous, raving 'madman' incarnations of popular culture. How anyone could have got a 'sympathetic' treatment of Hitler out of this movie is unfathomable. Yes, this Hitler is an ailing, crotchety, prematurely aged and even a vulnerable man; sweet to Eva Braun and his pretty young secretaries, but also the architect of the global madness which has backfired so catastrophically and is even now smashing its way towards him and everyone else hiding in his bunker. It is a tragedy of Shakespearian proportions, and entirely Hitler's doing. All of the executions, infanticide, suicide, revenge atrocities and madness of those last days of the Battle of Berlin are the end product of decades of his work. One of the most vehement 'hated it' criticisms was that the past crimes of the Third Reich (principally the Final Solution) were not detailed in the screenplay, but there is little need to gratuitously invoke the Holocaust with this tsunami of death, destruction and insanity bearing down on Hitler, his associates and his beloved Germany. To leave it as a barely-mentioned background feature makes its creator seem even more reprehensible, not less; because it is as if he didn't care about anything but his place in history. In the end, he is crushed and even tearful that it all ended this way, but he cries for himself, not the millions he has caused to die. Hitler has a human face, and is all the more terrifying for it."

As such, I don't know if it would be possible to execute a more perfect rendering of this moment in time, and the consequences thereof within the final days of Hitler's demise.<br/><br/>The portrayal of all the characters, their personalities and actions at the time could not have been more perfectly matched. Having seen the Bunker, and various other films of this genre', I was initially somewhat less than enthusiastic about seeing yet another ""last days in the bunker"" sort of film, but having read various reviews (not just here, but from a variety of sources), my thought was OK, I can take a brief glance at it. <br/><br/>However, from the very first few minutes onward, it became immediately apparent that the caliber of acting and direction of this work was far beyond anything I was expecting. Even if you may not be that particularly interested or aware of this history, I would still strongly recommend giving ""Downfall"" a chance, just to experience an excellent example of acting and filmcraft that is rarely presented to current audiences. <br/><br/>I was going to try to be at least a bit contrary to the other reviewers, but in all honesty, I can see why the 10 star rating is so consistent, as such is my rating as well.

","While this movie wasn't exceptionally flashy or stylistic, its pretty unique in the cannon of ""Nazi films"". As an under-informed American, these facts and this perspective were new to me, even as some one that has studied WWII and the Nazi state extensively, in university and independently. I feel that, unfortunately, there will be detractors about any movie about this or any other emotionally charged and polarizing subject matter. There are no universal aesthetics the filmmakers could use that would please everyone; the caricature of the Nazis as monsters and the German civilians as blind followers has preformed the rest of the world's opinions as to what is the most ""accurate"" portrayal of this subject. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to forget the caricatures and Riefenstahl's immortal presentation of these historical figures, and see them as flawed, deluded and twisted human beings. Because these WERE humans, and I find that to be the most important thing to remember when learning about Nazi Germany, Stalinist Russia, The Great Leap Forward, the hard-line Islamic take-over of Iran, the removal and extermination campaigns waged against indigenous people in the New World...name your tragedy, and there is a logical ""noble"" philosophy behind it, being adhered to with blinded fervor. It was carried out by human beings, not monsters, not madmen. People following a deadly and cold line of logic to a bitter and bloody end. That was what this movie made all the more clear to me."

","This ensemble film about the last days of Hitler and his Nazi regime should have left me chilled and disturbed, but I found it oddly soft.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is terrific as Hitler, but he feels like a supporting character in his own drama. The film focuses on too many people, blunting the tautness and drama of what took place in that famed bunker during those dark days in April 1945. The movie feels overly scripted; there are too many scenes that smacked of a soap operatic melodrama. And it's too tasteful or cautious to confront the most horrific moments head on. I'm not one to advocate for gratuitous violence in films, but Steven Spielberg showed in ""Schindler's List"" that graphic violence is sometimes a necessity when telling a story as horrible as any of the numerous stories about what the Nazis did to the world.<br/><br/>The whole time I was watching this film, I wondered what it would have been like if it had been in the black and white, stark style of Michael Haneke's ""The White Ribbon."" That movie, which I saw nearly a year ago, still haunts me, while ""Downfall,"" which I saw a couple of weeks ago, I've already nearly forgotten.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","If you were to only ever watch one movie about WW2 then this should be it. An absolutely fabulous interpretation of the last days of one of history's most infamous characters. Incredibly acted by Bruno Ganz, it leaves you wondering how he could possibly not receive the Oscar for his work. It must go down as one of the finest acting performances in history. As others have said, Ganz is Hitler. To say that the movie runs over two hours and is largely shot inside Hitler's bunk, it rarely if ever loses interest. A splendid support cast, authentic if limited action scenes around Berlin and a surprise twist at the end with the secondary story line, all adds up to a magnificent movie. I must say though that the scene involving the fate of Josef Goebbels children is extremely difficult to watch and may haunt you for some time to come after the movie has finished. Superior to even the marvelous Das Boot, this movie is a triumph for all concerned. Without doubt the greatest Anti War movie I have ever watched. 10/10"

","The movie shows the last moments of the famous Nazi dictator before his suicide on April 30th 1945 in a bunker in Berlin. The film starts 10 days before Hitler's fall and director Oliver Hirschbiegel shows the desperation of the Germans, including the Nazi officers, as Berlin is invaded and bombarded by heavy artillery. Facing chaos, the characters break down one by one in their desperate measures.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz's acting is frightening and fantastic. Everything from accurately nailing Hitler's accent to his imposing authority and yelling in scene is surprising. Ganz was nominated for best actor in the European Film Awards (he really deserved it) and the movie was nominated for best international film in that year. It gets 8 stars from me as the movie itself is quite exhausting - could have been briefer. But the point of view is great and it's not another American nationalist film."

","While there is no doubt that this movie has been very well made, there are certain aspects of which left me feeling very uncomfortable.<br/><br/>The movie has been put together very well, the acting is quite excellent, and the storyline is engrossing. The portrayal of Hitler in his last days in the bunker in Berlin is quite gripping and gives some good insights into the way his mental health deteriorated during that period. In particular it shows the paranoia which overtook him as he began to doubt the loyalty of his various German military leaders in carrying out his orders. <br/><br/>It also shows that he was quite paranoid about his body being captured by the Soviets and displayed publicly. Accordingly he gave instructions to his staff to ensure that his body was incinerated so that the Soviets could not capture and display his body.<br/><br/>While this movie has a lot to recommend it, the thing which made me very uncomfortable was the way in which Hitler was portrayed. It appeared focus quite often during the movie on his humanity towards various people who were it with him in the bunker for example, his personal assistant. These scenes showed Hitler to be a quite caring and sensitive to the those around him, and very concerned about their personal safety. I must admit that this particular image of Hitler was contrary to what I understood about the man.<br/><br/>While I understand the movie is quite historical in the way it portrays those final days, I got the feeling that the directors may be a little bit sympathetic towards Hitler which caused me some concern."

","Downfall has to be one of the best movies ever made.<br/><br/>I have just watched the DVD (which includes extensive extras about the making of the film, interviews and biographies of the subjects), which makes the third viewing for me. There are few movies that I care to see this many times.<br/><br/>Small errors of continuity aside, the impressive attention to detail, the casting, the acting and direction, sets, cinematography, sound - everything about this movie is to me just about perfect. The fact that it was made for 13m is astonishing: many Hollywood movies with a fraction of this class would have shelled that out to the lead star.<br/><br/>Casting such a story - the last few days of the Third Reich, mainly in the Berlin bunker to which Hitler and his coterie of believers retreated - presented a near-impossible task. Recent history, especially when so freely documented and photographed, allows only a small latitude with character portrayal: finding actors who so closely resembled the players such as Hitler, Himmler, Goebbels and the rest and were capable of playing them so well has been brilliantly achieved.<br/><br/>Much of the outdoor action was filmed in St Petersburg, Russia: a whole street was taken over for nine days and changed into wartorn Berlin to remarkable effect. The logistics behind this alone merit total admiration.<br/><br/>In some ways it is remarkable that it has taken so long to bring this story to the screen in this genre, and it is a tribute to the German people that it came about at all. The decision not to dub an English track over the original German, but instead to provide subtitles, might be seen by some as incorrect: in many films this would be so, but here it is absolutely right. The full impact of the Fuhrer's ranting, his malevolent diatribes, can only be appreciated by listening to them in German, whether one speaks the language or not.<br/><br/>If you haven't already seen this film, do yourself a favour and buy the DVD. If you *have* seen it - do yourself a favour and buy the DVD.<br/><br/>(Edited, 31st Dec 2010: The proliferation of YouTube clips of the Fuhrer throwing his toys out of the pram shows how a truly awful monster can be laughed into history as an aberration in the human race.)"

It also shows all the different persons gravitating around him, all with different motives. Some still fascinated (like Ms Goebbels), some fearing wrath (like Jodl), some weak (Speer), some opportunist (Goring), or some unaware (Eva Braun).<br/><br/>The only thing I regret, and unfortunately, it's the last scene, is that viewers might think that miss Junge could cross the soviet lines without harm, while in reality, she's been a sexual slave of a Russian officer for a long time.

"khanbaliq2","8","1","2","17 December 2009"," Downfall succeeds in painstakingly depicting who did what when.
","Claustrophobic, tense and often riveting Oliver Hirschbiegel's film is no sensational shockfest, but a living, breathing historical re-creation of Adolf Hitler's downfall. After World War II, Hitler's vivacious secretary Traudl Junge recalls the last grim days in the Berlin bunker before the leader of the Third Reich killed himself, as Russian troops advanced on the city.<br/><br/>Downfall is a fascinating film, featuring arguably the best portrayal on film of Hitler, by Bruno Ganz. It charts the delusional hysteria in the bunker with clinical clarity, yet the film has the same vulgar, voyeuristic appeal as the best reality TV: Eva Braun and her friends are literally seen dancing on table-tops and swigging champagne, trying to blot out the prospect of utter defeat and certain death. In contrast, a scene showing Magda Goebbels efficiently poisoning her young children is memorably chilling. Altogether, a superb re-creation of events. The film created controversy in Germany for its calm, neutral, non-judgemental portrayal of the Third Reich's leading players."
"prasanthalpha","10","1","2","20 November 2009"," What a Movie !!! A Masterpiece indeed !
","At times there comes a movie which haunts you. You are afraid to see it again and yet end up doing just that! Schindler's List was one, Der Untergang is another. The story authentic in most parts, the performances awesome and the jingo stuff is low! Bruno Ganz made me believe that he is indeed the Fuhrer. One gets a glimpse into the man, his sick philosophy of life and his stubborn refusal to feel accept defeat. While the scenes where Hitler explains and justifies his actions frighten and anger you, the one in which Albert Speer says goodbye to him bring tears into your eyes. What a show by Bruna Ganz. The scene of his reaction to Himmler's betrayal is awesome! Whilst he execute Feigelein to extract revenge for Himmler's betrayal, he is considerate to Junge Traudl, even telling her ""I wish i could have given you a better present."", while giving the cyanide capsules. That is exactly what sets this movie apart. The authenticity and the cold presentation of facts! Maria Lara too deserves credit for being Junge Traudl. The young follower who doesn't know whether to like or hate the Fuhrer. Magda Goebbels sent a chill down my spine! The rest of the cast too perform beautifully.<br/><br/>However one sore point is that justice was not done to Joseph Goebbels, who was in fact the most educated and intelligent of all Nazis. A dark genius, he is simply portrayed as someone who merely parrots what Hitler says. Besides Goebbels did not shoot himself or his wife. They were shot at the back of the head by an SS officer as ordered by him.<br/><br/>But these can be forgiven. All in all its worth every second of your time. By the way it's not for the faint hearted!"

"Lejink","8","1","2","27 November 2007"," Bunker mentality
","Remember the old TV programme from the 70's ""You were There"", putting the young viewer seemingly at the scene of a historical event - well this movie does that for adults, the authenticity aided of course by the characters conversing in the native German language. The movie of course has to walk a thin line between humanising these infamous characters from history without eliciting sympathy for any of them and succeeds by playing it straight. The only characters from the Nazi camp you really feel for are the innocent Goebbels children in one of the most chilling scenes when their mother, with her husband, the most ardent Nazi of all, who cannot see a place in the future for her infant offspring if the Third Reich fails and silently administers their poison pills after they have been drugged to sleep. The film interestingly does not hold back in its depiction of the real- life horror of the situation, many suicides for example are graphically rendered while contrastingly the camera pans away from the suicides of Hitler, Braun and the Goebbels. The drama also depicts life for ordinary Germans outside the bunker caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place, slaughtered either by their hardline SS countrymen or the invading Russian Red Army, focusing in particular on one small child who sees carnage all around him but comes together at the end with Hitler's idealistic young secretary who cannot offer the ultimate sacrifice of self-destruction taken by so many of the bunker's co-habitants. The performances are uniformly excellent, Bruno Ganz conveying Hitler's detached psychopathy in his crazed outbursts and yet still able to captivate the young pretty socialite Eva Braun. Cult of personality indeed. Best performance for me though is that by Corinna Farhouch as Mrs Goebbels, a striking character study of misguided devotion to an abhorrent creed. The creation of the battle-ravaged heart of Berlin is excellently done with several attention-grabbing images which ingrain themselves in the memory. Would it have been better shot in black and white just to complete the realism, however? Perhaps, but that's a minor gripe in what is ultimately a tautly told lesson from history."
"peter_omalley2003","10","1","2","2 October 2006"," A superb movie
","I first saw this at the movies and was completely bowled over by it. The story is familiar enough to anyone who's been conscious at any time in the last 60 years. The story is sordid (about Hitler, Goebbels etc) and tragic(for Germany) with it. Junge's own contribution at the start of the film is very telling. Ganz's portrayal of an avuncular Hitler one minute and a raving delusional the next is a standout performance. The mood of the film is claustrophobic in the extreme, no doubt reflecting how oppressive that time in the bunker must have been for all concerned and the switches to what was happening above ground highlight the whole unreality of the bunker existence. I've since bought the DVD and have watched it again 3 times since. Ganz doesn't look much like Hitler(always excepting the moustache) but after a minute or two it doesn't matter. It makes me wish for an equally good film about Stalin- a subject crying out for screen work."

","'Downfall' is a superb real life account by Hitler's private secretary Traudl Junge detailing the final days of the Third Reich. Based on her memoirs that she released as a book, this film follows events from Junge's point of view, beginning with her employment in 1942 as Hitler's personal secretary, until his subsequent suicide in 1945.<br/><br/>Swiss actor Bruno Ganz absolutely steals the film, and probably delivers the best performance of Adolf Hitler that any actor has ever done. He portrays Hitler not only as a tyrant, but shows his more personal attributes too, such as his apparent charm when talking to Junge, and other characteristics that were reported by Hitler's inner circle.<br/><br/>This film not only shows the tension from within the bunker, but also shows the chaos and destruction ever building in surrounding Berlin. There are genuinely some very memorable and shocking scenes in this film, that some people may find hard to believe actually happened. But all in all, watching this you actually feel the desperation and chaos as if you are there.<br/><br/>Recommended to anyone interested in this period of history."

We are able to see how are the last days of Berlin, the battle that is going to destroy the city and how different characters deal with this moment: some disobey Hitler and run for their lives, others commit suicide due to Hitler orders... The film is 2h 30m long, but you are so immersed in the story that probably you will not be able to realize that. The actors task is superb, specially Bruno Ganz (Hitler) and Ulrich (Goebbels) who play the most spectacular acting of Nazis leaders I've never seen. Touching and hearth-taking, this is one of the most hard war films ever done, as we are able to see how the city is destroyed and a country disappears (usually war films are about victories, not defeats). Unluckily, there are so many characters and so many aspects that the director wants to show that sometimes the spectator can find himself a little lost about what is happening to who. I realize that this is a hard task for the director and it does it quite well but this fact can result a little disappointing. To sum up, this is one of the best films of its year (nomination to Oscars included) and its recommended to both the ones that like good cinema or the ones that want to know about one of the darkest moments of the Humanee."

As mentioned by a previous poster, it struck home how human like these people were. We would like to think of them as without feelings of emotions. As machines who carried out an awful task and attempted to destroy a whole group of people. By seeing scenes such as the Goebbels family death pushes forward the fact that these people had families like you or I and had an existence which include socialisation, family and friends.<br/><br/>The actors portray their characters very well and with chilling accuracy. It is a film that I would strongly recommend. It may not be as up front about the horrors of the Nazi periods as other films such as 'Schindlers List, but it does demonstrate the people behind the horrors, giving us insight into their motives and how the German public were eventually abandoned by their leader in their greatest time of need."

It is also Germany's brave step to face her past that has for so long been referred to with phrases like ""Nazism"" and ""the Holocaust"". Nobody but Germans could have done ""Der Untergang"" and it makes the outcome quite an extraordinary experience to watch. It's not just a war film, it's a milestone in the mind of the German people.<br/><br/>'Der Untergang' is nothing like an easy movie to watch and it does not even tell you a new story. It only let's you to see the faces of those people who the world has condemned to hold the spectre of absolute, or at least partially absolute evil. You may think that as a rather inconvenient thing as well: you have to watch psychotic Nazis for quite a long time. You'll see detailed scenes how they will all meet their destiny and how far the reality is from these people's minds. You will realise how the evil leaders mislead their weak subjects and even if the situation is hopeless they will die because the thing they believed in is gone. It is all about commitment for things later generations have doomed, but the movie will ask ""what you would have done if you had lived in Berlin during year 1945?"".<br/><br/>You might not necessarily like what you see, you'll realise that almost anyone of us could have been there and you can almost see yourself in the film.

His performance of Hitler was extraordinary. This was no caricature (such as Anthony Hopkins or Derek Jacobi) but flesh and blood and terrifying, especially at the end. All the acting was first rate but Carinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes and the Goebbels were so horrifying that I had to tell myself they were actors at the end. I have never seen two monsters portrayed so realistically. The scene with the children at the end will stay with me always. (And I've read about what they did and seeing it reinforced my unbelief at the inhumanity of these two, not that Hitler and the Germans were any different but this scene just really shocked me.) However, I did find Traudl Junge's innocence at the beginning unbelievable; I cannot believe she didn't know what was happening, especially being up close and right after the war, assuming she really was that stupid, she should have seen the light.<br/><br/>Spoiler for those not having seen this: She took the pills but of course never used it. Her actions at time rang false.

","I saw this movie on DVD, forgetting all the hoopla over the premier of a movie that ""humanized"" Hitler. It did precisely that: it humanized a monster because he was really human and it showed him for the ugly, little cruel man he was. That he was kind to his help and his dog weighs light in his balance against his mass murder and all out war. Bruno Ganz blew away all those pompous Brits who normally star in those Hitler-in-the-Berlin-bunker sort of movie. He was awesome, almost real. The scenes above ground in bomb/shell/bullet ravaged Berlin are like Dutch master portraits of hell. Here, we see Berlin in her death agony at the end of the greatest war. Now it's the Zero Hour, Stunde Null, in Berlin in all the horror and absurdity. Ironically, they used the ultimate WW ll victim city as for location, St. Petersburg or Leningrad. It captures the feeling of one of the most horrific battles in modern history, in small, block by block scenes of small scale horror. The most horrible scene however, occurred in the bunker, as ugly Frau and Herr Goebbels poison their five children to death, before doing the world a favor by killing each other.<br/><br/>The movie is based on Traudl Junge's story, a pretty young steno/secretary of Hitler, and what she saw in those horrible last days. She was a teenager from Bavaria who was hired to be Hitler's steno in 1942, when the war seemed distant and going well, and lived in his court from then on. She adored Hitler like a teeny bopper going nuts over some rock star. But in the end, with the horror swirling around her and her idol ranting about killing even the German people and all his entourage off as the climax to his 1000 Year Reich, she reconsiders him a bit. Eva Braun was portrayed as some sort of party animal, drinking and dancing in a house as the Russians shelled it. and telling Traudl how much she hated Hitler's German shepherd Biondi. It is all fact based so anyone familiar with history knows the plot. Bravo for making such an ugly and real movie!"

","Bruno Ganz acts out of his skin in a performance that may just give an inkling why some people actually liked the real Hitler. Ranging from full-throated demagogue to crushed old man, he dominates the film, even when he isn't on screen, supported by some excellent performances from Corinna Harfouch and Ulrich Matthes as the odious Dr and Mrs Goebbels and Juliane Köhler as an Eva Braun who isn't perhaps as much of an airhead as we like to think. Add in the doe-eyed Alexandra Maria Lara and a wonderfully claustrophobic bunker set where you can almost smell the people boxed up for days on end, and you have a wonderful film. It isn't always comfortable viewing, but it's hugely compelling."

The acting is superb, with the complex mix of emotions the people (I can't call them ""characters"" since they were all real people) conveyed very well. You can feel the hopelessness, the sense of loss, the fear, the courage, the fanaticism and the madness the movie is trying to convey. By the end, I finally realized my jaw was hanging open, though I can not honesty say how long it was that way.

","In February 2002, I happened to be in London and read an article titled ""Hitler's secretary in his final hours dies just days after publishing her memoirs."" (The Independent, Thursday 14 February 2002, page 16) Now, I watched the film and it has given me satisfaction like finding a key piece in a jigsaw puzzle; that important fragment is women, married, unmarried, and mother.<br/><br/>Not being particularly a fan of war movies, I had been quite reluctant about viewing this film, but now I believe, within my limited experience, this is the one that women should see or be encouraged to see. Many battle movies may feature females as a kind of symbol of love, peace, and victory, but in reality women do fulfill a big function making a driving force to create and support a great evil, villain, or monster. Japan does have such women as well and what nations in human history don't? Their story are usually untold as they come from good quality valued highly in society.<br/><br/>This work projects calm but strong light on a hidden part with unruffled and delicate pictures. I also think actors and actresses (Corinna Harfouch, in special) perform excellent for difficult roles."

","Der Untergang is neither a requiem nor a denial of what Hitler did. For the fist time in my life I watched the Nazi Germany from German point of view. For years Hollywood made the world watch movies like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" to imprint Jewish sufferings on people's mind. Those movies were a perfect means to look at a war by only a means of suffering of race given that only the six million of 50 million demised people were Jewish. The movie perfectly humanizes Hitler and people around him without glorifying and justifying what he and his entourage did. The events mostly are reflected by the perspective of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge (Lara).Events outside Hitler's bunker are mostly depicted from the perspective of SS doctor Ernst Gunther Schenck (Cristian Berkel). Humanizing a war leader like Hitler helps us to see the historical importance of Nazis' rise to power:how human beings could be blinded by the desire to rule,govern and dominate.The movie at this point is a fine-crafted at which point shows us what happened exactly though it doesn't offer any leads of how and why? If you wanna see some attempt at objectivity, if you wanna see Bruno Ganz's laudable performance as Hitler this movie is a must to see!"

","I must admit I wasn't intimate friends with the guy, but drawing from history I can not imagine a much different Hitler than the one portrayed by Bruno Ganz. He is at times terrifying, stubborn, and ruthless, while at other times he is... well... much the same. Ganz also manages to capture the charisma that drew so many close to this dangerous man. The rest of the cast was spot on as well, as the sense of urgency in the ranks of the Nazi Party reaches fever pitch. Any Neo-Nazi would be well served to view this tale of their furor at his most feeble and deranged time, as they might begin to question why they follow such a leader."

","This was an outstanding movie with excellent performances by all, especially Bruno Ganz as Adolph Hitler. The scene where Frau Goebbels murders her 6 children rather that have them live in a world without the 3rd Reich is horrifying, but true. The scenes of shelling and shooting on the streets of Berlin and the vivid display of wounds and amputations. Hitler's descent into disbelief that the war is lost, and that surrender is the only option are riveting. With the Soviet armies less than a mile away, Hitler orders non-existent troops to repulse the invaders with a pincer-movement. The inability of all but a few generals to report the truth of the situation, while the majority pander to Hitler's phantoms is, as far as we know, a true characterization."

It is without a doubt an historical document for it depict's those days with all the accuracy that history could provide us with today.<br/><br/>For some, the movie might look like an apologetic and humanizing view of the Nazis for it shows the all the despair already blending blend in with the blind madness lived by the Germans during this period with the particular plus of a close up of that despair on the ones who worked and lived around Hitler. However, from this point of view this movie is at most a ghost exorcising job from Germans to Germans by engaging dramatically in telling this story they know so well and, for understandable reasons, are hesitant to talk about openly.<br/><br/>Very well produced and characterized, with special attention to Ulrich Matthes whose who's character, Joseph Goebbels just isn't any funnier because of the constant thought that he was indeed a real psychopath responsible for the millions of murders caused by the Nazis and Bruno Ganz. The latest engagement in the character of Hitler was something unseen and deeply profound for it is a trip into a mind psychopath that rivals the ones of Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.<br/><br/>A very good movie!"

","A striking aspect of this highly accurate portrayal of Hitler's last days was the unshakable loyalty displayed by many Germans even at the darkest hour when the end was clear. We must remember that Hitler was enormously popular up until the invasion of Poland. His personal popularity remained high throughout the war years despite his increasingly despotic rule. It is a warning to us today just how easy it is for a cultured population to strongly support amoral leaders who pander to fear and a twisted sense of morality. Although it was not visible in the film, the motto cast on every German army belt buckle was ""Gott Mit Uns"" - God is with us! Today our subhumans are not ""Bolshevik Jews"" but ""terrorists""."
"joel-28","2","15","100","3 April 2005"," Don't view it as history
","There were so many historical inaccuracies in this film I had to laugh to myself a few times. You would think at least the Germans could have gotten it right. One of the first glaring inaccuracies was the scene in which Hitler is in the garden of the Chancellery decorating Hitler Youth Boys with the Iron Coss. This event actually happened and was filmed by newsreel cameramen as portrayed in the film. However the even took place in the week before March 22, 1945, and not the day after Hitlers birthday. These are widely regarded as the last films made of Hitler. Strike 1! the HJ boy portrayed receiving the Iron Cross, was not actually from Berlin,and at that time the Russians were no where near Berlin. Strike 2! HJ Leader Artur Axmann was the HJ official at the sight, not some low ranking HJ official. Strike 3! So maybe I was expecting too much, but when I go to see a historic dramatization I at least hope they will stick to the facts. They do not. If you want to see a film based closer to reality see Anthony Hopkins award winning performance in The Bunker. If you know nothing of the truth of this story, hey it's a good little war film. If you are going expecting to see history as we know it come alive, you can forget it.Also the uniforms were among the worst I have ever seen in this kind of dramatization. The Bunker at least used an acknowledged expert, Brian L Davis, as a uniform consultant. These were the cheapest knock offs ever. Furthermore Hopkin's Hitler was far more convincing."

","after watching the movie one could have had sympathy for the Nazis (if you would not already hate them). it is ridiculous that this work was giving a nomination for Oscar. what else is to say? one of the Nazis, I think his name was Speer , is shown as a kind of good knight. but it is a historical fact, that this man is disliked by his own son, because he never reflected his time as a Nazi as an error or something. it is proved since over 20 years by now that he had known that 1000 of Jews had to work to death in his arbeitslager - they had to break stones for the Nazi-buildings. there is a scene where Hitler talks about that the Jews are the cause for everything bad in the world, that they are a plague. As he said so, his secretary looks to him (camera has a great view of her facial expression) as if he is crazy, as if she could not believe what he is saying. this is ridiculous: as if she wasn't an antisemit on her own ! but, why this ? the answer is simple: the book for the movie was created under the helping hand from this secretary. it is easy, eh ? Hitler was crazy (at the end (of his Reich)), and there were a lot of bad, but also a lot of good Nazis. and have a look at the end of the film: there is said that so and so millions of humans died in the WW2. and then, a new screen: so and so many Jews died . so: are Jews no humans, or what ? ... you should see the movie, and try to imagine if you would not known anything about this period of mankind: one could really have sympathy: For Adolf Hitler and his Nazis.<br/><br/>really, this movie i dislike."

That seems to be a glorification of Hitler and that should not be the intention of the movie...<br/><br/>So when you want to watch a good movie about this time then choose ""Die Brücke"" from Bernhard Wicki.

","This movie focuses on the human side of the Nazis as if to say, ""they're not all bad."" Hitler, though maniacal, is very brave and is kind and gentle in private. Though he's tough and ruthless with his generals, it's at least in part because they lied to him and because he does not want to admit defeat. Besides he's ruthless with himself, too. No wonder Eva Braun loves him unconditionally. He's really quite ethical, and had dreams of building a better society.<br/><br/>His generals are a mixed bag. A couple are monsters, but most are simply fiercely loyal. Some are more concerned with saving civilians in the cities than with waging a last desperate battle. I never knew how compassionate some of the Nazi leaders were. A few stand up to Hitler, and or even ignore his orders in the name of humanity.<br/><br/>One comes away from this movie realizing that Hitler and his generals had a great vision and were truly willing to die for their principles. These were courageous people. As far as the Jews, gypsies, and gays who were murdered by the Nazis, there are a couple of lines about the Jews, but other than that, those crimes were clearly not worth mentioning, lest they cloud the human side of Nazi-ism.<br/><br/>If you feel the Nazis have been treated unfairly by history, I think you will enjoy this movie. If you are unfamiliar with the atrocities of the Nazis, you will find this movie a truly sympathetic portrait. The only reason I gave it a 6 and not lower is because the acting is very good and the story is well told. Most people (hopefully) will find this movie offensive."

Of course, nothing changed and their exuberance was brief. (Perhaps they filmed such a scene and left it on the cutting room floor.) Second, the depiction of the bunker was so realistic that I had the feeling that the filmmakers had been given secret access to the real bunker.

Because it is soo easy to imagine all the time th person you see during the speeches but the way they try to show him within the movie makes it nearly impossible to paint a picture of the Nazis looking like robots. I'd say it is a good try to show the schizophrenic side of people who could kill other ones for they race at the KZ and go home after work to work in the garden as nowadays one comes back from his work. If you see this they appear human to you and no one can say Ah Hitler was an Idiot I would have gone into the resistance at once. The only thing I personally disliked was the outdoor action. Hm I don't think that we need a lesson of anatomy. You don't have to show the scenes in occupied Berlin with such brutality.

","Who says the Germans have no humour? They are just more subtle, and often their wit is easily mistaken for grave earnestness. An example might be the German lady who approached an invading American general among the ruins of Berlin in 1945 with the words: ""If only you Americans had stayed out, none of this would have happened"". That must have been a joke, right?<br/><br/>But now, all subtlety set aside, Hirschbeigel has chosen to go all out with an unmistaken farce in ""Der Untergang"", about the last days of Adolf Hitler. Be prepared for side-splitting fun: two hours of Nazis suffering from the consequences of their own crimes. Goebbels' wife popping cyanide pills into her five sleeping children (a gem), a commander exploding hand grenades under his unsuspecting wife's dinner table while soup is being poured, and Hitler himself ... well, Groucho Marx, Charlie Chaplin, and Jim Carrey spring to mind as runners-up, but Adolf takes the cake. What a comedian! I laughed myself silly.<br/><br/>Apart from that, Hirschbeigel's movie is well-acted and masterly executed. Besides obvious slapstick (Germans having their brains blown out), the film also offers more refined jokes, such as the smoking Germans who start out by smoking outside Hitler's bunker in gentle deference to their non-smoking Fuehrer, and end up puffing away right outside his door, as his madness soars.<br/><br/>Here comes the SPOILER: Hitler dies in the end.<br/><br/>Definitely worth seeing!<br/><br/>PS!

The first thing I look for is the accuracy of the equipment and uniforms and I was most impressed. I found out later the movie company had excellent technical advisor's.<br/><br/>What really left a profound impression on me was how some of the people in the movie would prefer death over surrender. The idea of loyalty, honor, and duty to country was outstanding--like the motto of the SS, ""My Honor is Loyalty"" or a motto like, ""Death before Dishonor"".

It tells you nothing, except that these people remain true to their principles until death. It tells you nothing about their crimes, it tells you nothing about their powers. It tells you only something about their characters, what nobody needs to know.

"Dr_Coulardeau","9","2","8","31 October 2007"," One can never forget the evil they have taken part in
","This film is tragic. It shows the fall of Berlin in the hands of the Soviets in April-May 1945 in the most realistic way possible. But the film decides to show the event from inside the inner circle around Hitler himself in his bunker and there we are surprised . First we are surprised because the film insists too much on the insanity and degenerating disease or sickness of the Führer. It is so simple to say he was crazy, megalomaniac, schizophrenic, the victim of some degenerative disease. It is so easy that it becomes some kind of an excuse for the crimes he committed. But this vision surrounds Hitler with people who are either yellow bellies or fanatics. Yellow bellies in front of Hitler and that makes them accept anything. Fanatics, like the Goebbels, to the point of poisoning their children. And the fanatics are holding the yellow bellies in line. Too easy in many ways since some of these yellow bellies will be tried, convicted and sentenced as guilty in Nuremberg. The last explanation is provided in the film with the testimony of Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary. They were young and they should have been more curious in order to learn what was really happening. Günther Grass in a recent book more or less defends the same opinion, though with less one-sidedness. Yes he says they knew a lot more than some might have pretended, but they did not look or see or think it was in any way important. Grass goes slightly further and pretends they had been well conditioned and formatted by Nazi propaganda, which is another half truth again. These survivors, and it is true on the other side too, like among the French resistance, needed in those difficult times to believe without any doubt what some adults were telling them. They needed to follow the line set in front of them in order to become adults, to believe in themselves. There is even one more element that is generally forgotten. These young people needed to accept the authority of an order that was bigger than them in order to be worth living, and that implied they had to suffer in order to get this worthy self-belief, self-respect, self-pride. Some even go as far as considering that dying in the most reckless way for a cause is a sacrifice, a human sacrifice mind you, a voluntary and willing human sacrifice for an absolutely justified cause. I am afraid that all survivors develop this idea, this attitude, just to be able to survive, that is to say to forget what they have to forget if they want to keep their sanity after the events, no matter what they may be. The film here is not centered on this issue, but it supposes the issue, whereas Günther Grass addresses the issue directly and then rewrites his ""memories"", pretending they are all fake and false in all possible ways, in order to retain the little sanity history has decided to grant him the privilege of enjoying. But it is a false truth in many ways because the disguising of the truth in order to survive also feeds the guilty conscience that haunts the surviving years.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

That's what happened to Berlin. A great left-wing city, the city of Christopher Isherwood and Cabaret, turned into a vast burned-out shell, with sister cities Hamburg and Dresden flattened by allied bombing. Seven million Germans are said to have been wandering homeless in April 1945, bombed out of their homes by Churchill's murderous war on civilians. The massive armoured columns that had fanned out over Eastern Europe as far as the gates of Moscow, nearly taking the oilfields of Baku thousands of miles away, had been wiped out by the Soviet hordes, and now the yellow menace was invading the Kuhrfurstendamm, drunken, raping and pillaging. In a bunker we witness the madman Adolf Schickelgruber, alias Hitler, cursing his nation and condemning them to death with him. Everyone is a traitor, and even now as the house collapses on his head, he is willing to order people summarily shot. How to capture the scale, the scope of this overwhelming disaster? From ruling a continent to controlling a city block, all in a couple of years! Truly, it's beyond the power of one feature film, but this German team has tried, and produced a drama that is compelling and yet lingeringly inadequate. How can you possibly show a whole city being raped? How to depict more than 150,000 individual women being multiply violated in the greatest unpunished sex crime of the modern era? Most of all, how do you explain and convey the magnetism of Schickelgruber, the angry little corporal determined to get his own back on behalf of a whole people? Stripped of his state trappings, Bruno Ganz's fuhrer is little more than a nobody with a mammoth chip on his shoulder who believes the Prussian elite has turned against him. It is ultimately inexplicable how he hypnotised the German nation and actually managed to get elected and formally appointed Chancellor, unless you blame it on the threat from the vast Communist empire next door. Germans must be somewhat bewildered to glimpse Berliners carving meat off dead horses in the ruined streets, considering their standard of living is twice that of any other European country today.

","On DVD, loan from my public library. I came across this title recently in a list of ""must-see"" movies. I agree, it is a ""must-see"" movie. German with English subtitles, and includes footage of the real Frau Junge, Hitler's personal secretary. <br/><br/>Bruno Ganz is just really good as Adolf Hitler, sometimes warm and friendly, other times seemingly crazed. In 1942 he needed a new secretary and several young women went to meet him. The one chosen was Traudl, who later married one of Hitler's men, and she then became Frau Junge. Actress Alexandra Maria Lara plays Traudl Junge, from whom much of the material for the book, and thus this film, came in interviews in the late 1990s. As the author explains, she wasn't hard to find, she was listed in the phone book. Since she had been a young woman and not even a member of the Nazi party, only a secretary, she wasn't subject to post-war prosecution. In her own words, back in 1942 Hitler was sort of like a modern day ""rock star"", she took the job because it seemed so interesting. Only later in her life did she realize the extent of Hitler's murdering ways.<br/><br/>The film covers mainly the few weeks of 1945 when Hitler turns 56 and then when it appears that allied troops, particularly the Russians, were invariably going to take Berlin, as part of the total defeat of Nazi Germany. Hitler became more and more agitated, more and more irrational, as the noose tightened. Interestingly Hitler and his Nazi commanders blamed the German population, for it was them that chose Hitler and to follow him. As the end was near Hitler showed no sympathy for the German people, he figured they were weak and the weak needed to be destroyed anyway.<br/><br/>I feel a special connection with this movie for two reasons. First, I was born just a few months after all this happened and second, I studied German in college, became fluent in the language, traveled in Germany in the 1980s, all without a clear realization of what had transpired in 1945.

Yes the Nobel prize is there and all that, but Adolf Hitler impresses so many that even Emily Hartridge likes to talk about him.<br/><br/>His story is actually a miserable one. Low ranking sergeant in the World War I, gassed, went crazy since that event, he obtained a feverish drive to make things right his way. His ambition was so strong and unrelenting that there was no one to stop him. Only old Hindenburg recognized the danger: I am not giving power to that Czech corporal! But he was too old to stop him. Von Papen even went to diplomacy to hide from a mistake of bringing Adi to power.<br/><br/>Europe of those times was ripe for another conflict, not because people wanted it, but because of poverty and misery of too many people. Hitler said it was the Jews who were to be blamed about all ills of German society, but in effect, WWI impoverished German society so much that recovery was to be slow and ineffective. Only sexual energy turned into adoration of the Fuehrer could turn things around. It did, but with such a disastrous results.<br/><br/>Watching last days of Hitler is so impressive, because everyone adored him so much around him that the world for some of them like Magda Goebels was impossible without Him and NazionalSocialismus. Nazis never thought they could loose, they thought they had Mesianic role in Europe. Boy were they wrong! Who flies high falls really low!

Hitler is delusional about a non-existent army that can push its way from behind and scatter the enemy. While this places courage in some, places horrendous fear in most. Mostly deals with Hitler's final days, his current views on the war and utter disrespect to life, his relationship with Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) and an ever faithful family, the Goebbels.<br/><br/>While the melodrama is in the air, the director takes care not to push it into the face of the viewer. Alexandra has such a pleasing innocent face, she will almost make you believe how Ms. Junge saw through the ordeal without making out much of it. While most of the cast deliver competent performances, Bruno Ganz would have made Hitler proud with his ecstatic emotional outbursts alternating with subtle body language that speaks a thousand words without saying anything. How he missed the Oscar, I am interested to see who beat him to comment on it. After the Russian artillery comes into the range of the Bunker - every dialogue, emotion and action is associated with fear or being skeptical about optimism which is brilliantly shown when Eva Braun forces a party to overcome the impending doom. While most of the action is said and understood, the director didn't shy away from showing a peek on the outside of Berlin which is full of fear, hordes of corpses and strewn away limbs drawing from a strong graphic content and state-of-art pyrotechnics. The background score is mostly non-existent and but delicately used whenever required. Screenplay and editing are slick without a dull moment and builds up enough suspense leading up to one of the most known endings.<br/><br/>Hitler would have been proud roasting in Hell"

","She gives her children sleeping syrup then she puts cyanide pills in their mouths before closing them, one by one, causing an immediate death. One of the most sickening deaths my eyes ever witnessed, and the woman who commits this cold-blooded murder is Magda Goebells, the wife of Adolf Hitler's infamous Propaganda Minister. When Hitler, Nazism, the Third Reich, the dream of Germania were over and the Russians coming, not only she refused to be part of this new ""Nazi-less"" order (she and her husband would kill themselves right after) but she decided to prevent her own children from living this reality.<br/><br/>This only scene sums up the cruelty and degree of evil alienation Nazism exercised on civilized minds, it's like the rise and fall of evil, seen in microcosm.<br/><br/>""The Downfall"" deals with the last days of Nazism trapped in a devastated Berlin, incarnating a Germany ripped in its flesh. The setting is Hitler's bunker, whose claustrophobic feeling gets more perceptible as the end is approaching. In the case of Hitler, so alienated by his own fanaticism, his contempt for weakness caused him to suicide, after having 'suicided' his own people. I think the parallel with the Magda Goebells' scene is quite obvious. Hitler literally put Nazism in the mind of his people before condemning them to a certain death. Therefore, I can't see how this movie could be blamed for sympathy towards Nazis. <br/><br/>What were people expecting? This is a historical movie, with the same coldness and detachment the course of events expresses towards our human judgment. The movie is about what happened, had it inserted any ounce of our post-war judgment; this would have been an epic, anything, but not this masterpiece of German realism in the same vein than the great ""Das Boot"".<br/><br/>Now, let's get this straight. Is the movie guilty of portraying Hitler in a sympathetic way? The answer is yes, and no. Yes, the movie did portray the ""Most Hated Man of Modern History"" in a sympathetic way, and no, the movie is not guilty of that. On the contrary, it's its greatest achievement, and success in the field of cinematic intelligence. Had it tried to portray the monster in a monstrous way, this would have been falling into the kind of traps that makes consensus almost synonym of dishonesty. ""Downfall"" reached the same level of intelligence as ""Das Boot"", while providing the same thrills through the claustrophobic feeling, and inviting us to question our personal approach to the notion of evil.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz delivers one of the most powerfully intense performances I've ever seen, inspiring both hatred and pity, as Adolf Hitler. It's the kind of performance that should have earned him every cinematic Award nomination but of course, considering the character, this would have been quite difficult. Another proof of the subjects's uneasiness, as if it was more convenient to portray the evil with one-dimensional levels of cruelty or simply to ridicule him, garnering pitiful laughs, in other words, better to please a fallacious consensus than to respect the audience's intelligence. That's why ""Inglourious Basterds"" is more popular than ""Downfall"", I guess people are more comfortable with that.<br/><br/>And if you think about it, the same reasoning that created the controversy carries something of the same visions that can lead to fanaticism. Fanaticism starts with general consensus, right or wrong, and this consensus is built on the automatic condemnation of the 'no'. Said differently, extreme positions lead to extreme situations, and the film finally broke the last taboo, in a cathartic way that transcended the big screen.<br/><br/>To understand is to analyze with objectivity. And objectivity, self-criticism, allow to avoid the same mistakes. Have we learned lessons from history, has WWII 'vaccinated' us against fanaticism, as destructive, if not more? No. Because people still read history from a ""winner vs. loser"" point of view. And this ridiculous categorization lead to perceive what was only military duty with the glasses of heroism or evil. That's why movies like ""Downfall"" are necessary. It depicted Nazis in a sympathetic way, but not Nazism, which is the main point. Nazism was totally embodied by fanatics, on the top of them, Hitler, and the main officers, but the rest were soldiers, fighting for beliefs they were brainwashed in, for years and years, without any opposition.<br/><br/>The movie redeems a whole misconception that have proved to do more bad than good, because of comforting the idea that evil is like a kind of virus that can be fought only by eradication. Nazism was the embodiment of an evil fanaticism, but to get rid of it is to kill it from the roots, the same roots that made Nazis point out the Jews as responsible of Germany's defeat, and we all know, how it ended up. The film tactfully evokes the Concentration camps at two moments, specifically one crucial scene where Hitler's evilness is more explicit. Similar moments occur where he spits on his own people considering they deserve to die in defeat, moved by his eternal contempt of weakness, inspired by the same rules that govern animals' lives. If one perceives this portrayal as sympathetic, well, it's hopeless.<br/><br/>Yes, in other scenes, he's shown as a delicate, charming, sober human being, but well, I guess one must be quite 'charming' if he managed to lead one of the most civilized people to the hell of barbarity. Besides, let's not forget this is a movie told from the point of view of his secretary, a young idealistic woman who saw Hitler as many German people did.<br/><br/>But the movie doesn't show Hitler this way to plead in favor of the population. As said Traudl Hunge, youth wasn't an excuse. And despite all the efforts, it seems like the guilt carried by German people is not over yet"

","this is a pretty solid film revolving around Hitler's last days.

Great performance by Granz as Hitler and the guy that played Goebbels also did a solid job. A pretty long movie, but if you are into WW2 history, it is very solid and worth watching, lots of scenes of gripping tension between Hitler and his Generals and it is nice to see someone interviewed that was actually there at the time (hitler's secretary, which the film opens up with).

It happened in Germany, too, in the mid-1930s, and this semi-documentary look at the Final Days of ""The Thousand-Year Reich"" is riveting. There are lessons to be learned, here.

","Having been away from the civilised world for two years, I finally moved to a town that has 'Der Untergang' on DVD. And yesterday I finally got to see it.<br/><br/>I've only read the last 50 comments, but judging from them I would say that almost everything has already been mentioned. Scary and unbelievable. Amazing performances, a grand depiction of one of the most grotesque moments in history.<br/><br/>What struck me the most was how out of touch with reality the inner circle of power had become. Or maybe had they always been lost in their visions and ideologies? That is a chilling point.<br/><br/>When Hitler says that the shelling of Berlin will aid him, because it will speed up the construction of his monumental capital Germania, when he orders armies to attack that virtually do not even exist anymore, we realise how ignorant Germans had been. Only in the end did many of them wake up to see through the lies and promises. Many never lived that long.<br/><br/>One thing that got stuck in my mind was the scene of the last SS battalion being encircled by the Russians. Even though blood is not commonplace in the movie, I seemed to get used to being surrounded by death: boys, girls, soldiers, deserters, civilians, generals, politicians, Adolf and Eva, the Goebbels family, dying by the minute. When the two SS officers blow their brains out, I didn't even blink. After all we had see, their suicide was just trivial.<br/><br/>I don't know why but that just grips me. In the beginning of the film, I was thinking about how hard it is to commit suicide. When the last two officers took their lives without hesitating, I knew that I would have readily done the same in the circumstances. Like Goebbels, Hitler and the Reich had been the essence of their lives. And like Goebbels, suicide was the only option.<br/><br/>Scary."

","I was lucky enough to see this film accompanied by a lecture by a survivor of the German side of the war. He is a professor of German at the University of Minnesota, and in March of 1945, was an 18 year-old Jew living in Berlin. He escaped deportation, as he was half Jewish. <br/><br/>He not only told the audience of the details of life in Berlin at the time, but praised the film for its ability to faithfully recreate the city's conditions in the spring of '45. He also was amazed at how much Bruno Ganz sounded like Hitler. He said it was chilling to hear his words in the theater, sound so much like the voice he was familiar with in his youth.<br/><br/>One of the most amazing things he brought to the lecture was a copy of the last newspaper printed in Nazi Berlin, featuring the story of the little boy who fired on the Soviet tank, as shown in the film.

","Downfall is a fascinating movie, illustrating the fall of Nazi Germany and managing to stray away from simple dehumanisation. Featuring a frighteningly dead-on performance from Bruno Ganz as Adolp Hitler, Oliver Hirschbiegel's film never sympathises with it's characters, but rather complicates them, showing the depths behind evil and hatred. Shocking at best, compelling at worst, Downfall is one of the best realisations of Nazi Germany's fall ever made.<br/><br/>Bookended with the last interview conducted by Hitler's real secretary (Traudl Junge), the film starts in 1942 with Adolph Hitler looking to recruit someone to type his letters and memoirs. He chooses Traudl (played by Alexandra Maria Lara) who is ecstatic to work with the Fuhrer. The film then cuts to 1945 inside Hitler's bunker, where it shall remain for most of the movie. Whilst Hitler is clearly the movie's selling point, it is largely told from Traudl Junge's point of view, being partly based on her autobiography - Bis zur letzten Stunde. We are presented with rational portrayals of those behind and around the Nazi regime - most notable are of Ernst-Günter Schenck (Christian Berkel) as a caring doctor and Albert Speer (Heino Ferch) who, despite his heavy involvement with National Socialism, is seen here as more humanitarian, pleading with Hitler to think of the German people.<br/><br/>In order to deal with the cruelty of humanity we must first accept that it is humans - not monsters or animals - that are responsible for it's shortcomings. It is far too convenient for anyone to look at the world's most evil men - in this case Adolph Hitler - and segregate them from our perception of humanity, in order to make sense of their actions. Downfall presents to us a view of the Nazis not as sympathetic characters, but rather highly complex ones. As as protagonist, Bruno Ganz' Hitler is an engaging character, with many depths. He is too proud to surrender or retreat from the Allies -even after all hope appears to be lost he still strives to fight the invading Red armies. It's clear that he is close to losing his mind, and even condemns his generals as traitors, when the most apparently rational thing to do is withdraw his armies from attacking the incoming Russians. Hitler is rightly shown up as the abhorrent despot he clearly was, but rather than shouting and bleating his way through 155 minutes, Bruno Ganz depicts a man who has compassion behind the madness. His relationships with Albert Speer and Traudl Junge show us the gentler side of the monster, as he is almost like a father figure to them.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't necessarily solve any unanswered questions, but does leave the viewer pondering it afterwards. As a historical document it works well, but as a a piece of compelling cinema it works even better - finding heart where many wouldn't dare to look, actually moving it's audience as well as engaging them. Hirshbiegel dissects all sides of the human condition. Magda Goebbel's final acts are particularly shocking, balancing the movie's heart with it's dirt. It's not always easy to watch, but it is pretty compelling stuff. If only to see for Ganz's turn, Downfall is something you should not miss."

"skyluck","9","1","3","2 March 2006"," Best ""Hitler's Bunker"" version ever!
","As a WWII history buff, I have seen numerous ""Hitler's bunkers"" flicks over the past 20 years growing up in Europe (and there are too many too list---American, Brit, German, and of course Soviet!) but this has to be by far the best adapted, most accurate versions of them all. One of the qualities that makes this historical gem stands out from the rest is its objective approach, presenting the nitty-gritty realities and chaos of WWII Berlin at the end of the war, portraying the Germans both as aggressors and victims with minimal politically-correctness ""pins."" Another exemplary feature of the film is its historical accuracy---from the war torn settings (bomb-out Reichchancellory, bunker, SS murdering rampages) to the relatively accurate plot to the authentic characters. Bruno Ganz's---had he been a Gringo, he'd have received Oscar nod for sure--- depiction of the Austrian ""little corporal"" (Hitler's generals reference to him behind his back) is the best I have seen to date, from Furher's megalomaniac mood swings to his delusions of grandeur and insidious evil magnetism. Beside the underlying psychological makeups of the characters, I particularly like the peripheral though informative elements of the film, such as images of widespread destructions of Berlin streets and the desperation of its inhabitants, the omnipresent terror and indiscriminant butchering of the innocents by Nazis zealots even as the ""curtain falls."" For a major motion pic, it did not spin or play to conventional beliefs as other big flicks have a tendency to do in order to appeal to mass consumption rather than historical accuracy. With a few exceptions, the movie follows many of the events surrounding Hitler circle quite accurately compared to other ""insider"" accounts (such as Traudl and Speer memoirs) of this fascinating history. There are a few historical divergences (i.e. most ""bunker"" flicks have the Goebbels asking one of the SS officers for help instead of doing it themselves at the end); however, these are minor lapses. Other than that, this realistic war drama will definitely be ranked along side other recent WWII treasures such as Schindler's List and Das Boot."
"sol-","Null","1","3","2 February 2006"," My brief review of the film
","Heavy but generally well made, this film has been marketed as being about Adolf Hitler's final days and his downfall; it is actually more about the downfall of the Nazis on the whole, with Bruno Ganz in very much a supporting role as Hitler. It sounds like a very positive thing that the film explores more than just Hitler's own downfall, however in execution, the film appears far too busy. There is a lot going on to be followed, as the film chases many different plot lines, without any real focus. Also, it is a bit too talkative to be followed at times. It feels drawn out despite all that is going on because suspense and tension is to a degree jarred by the jumping between all the different events. As lengthy as it might seem at two and a half hours long, a three-hour duration could have been a bit more appropriate. Either way, the visual side of the film is perfect for the project, with an appropriately washed out colour scheme, realistic sets and camera-work to match. Ganz is also very good as Hitler, slowly but surely maddening, and it is an amazement to watch whenever he is on screen - which in turn makes it a shame that such moments exist in less than half of the film's running time. Overall, this is a film worth watching for its realistic and harrowing depiction of the downfall of the Nazi stronghold in Germany, and for the work by Bruno Ganz. Otherwise though, it is not a film for everyone, with its large amount content squeezed into two and a half hours - but that does not mean that it is not a good film."
"mplaza","10","1","3","30 January 2006"," This film's major contribution.
","To me, perhaps the main issue addressed by the movie is to what an extent an uncritical, no-questions-asked support of a leader not only by his people but by his close entourage and society's controlling institutions may go. That such an uncritical attitude and obsessional following or obeisance of any whims and decisions of a leader or ruler can -and in time, will- bring ruin and dissolution to a society (as it certainly did to one of the most cultured ones in the world) is the lesson all watchers of this movie must learn. And this will apply not only to Hitler (that he is not depicted or clichéd as having Jewish kids for breakfast is beside the point) but to any other leader or ruler in any country of the world. It may be argued that Hitler was no better or worse than other despots in 20th century history, call them Stalin,Pol Pot or Castro, as differences in their political and socio-cultural environments makes comparison of little pertinence, but what they all have in common is their blind acceptance and following by their peoples and the consequent debasing of their different countries' institutions and democratic checks and balances, which these rulers invariably nulled and voided, either by outright suppressing them or by putting them at their unquestioned service. A serious, dis-passioned and objective questioning of such a posture is perhaps the film's major contribution."

Goebbels, Hitler's Minister of Propaganda, is played by an scary looking man, he has very angular features. The person I ended up hating the most out of this film though wasn't Hitler, but Goebbel's wife who was so into National Socialism that she took to her bed saying that without National Socialism there was no future. She then proceeded to murder all six of her children so that they wouldn't grow up in a world without Nazis. Psycho. You almost, I said almost, feel sorry for Hitler in places. His wife was also a weirdo, blindly following his orders ""you're the Fuhrer"" she tells him even when her pregnant sister's husband is sentenced to death because it is Hitler's will. The scenes of a war-torn, ruined Berlin were excellent, giving a feeling of a real war zone.

Since 1998 I have believed Saving Private Ryan was the best WWII film ever made, but I was blown away at the talented acting as well as it's writing and directing. The film's director Oliver Hirschbiegel has put together an excellent film about Hitler's final days.

","This movie is not made in Hollywood and is made by a German director in German language, the movie tells us about the fall and the last days of Hitler, although Hitler is portrait as Tirane a man without any feelings of remorse even when he sees that he lost and almost everybody has abounded him the director wants to show us that inside this man there is a little humanity despite his will to continue the madness that has victimized live of millions of people. The movie is made very realistically so the person seeing the movie has a chance to be very close to the whole situation going on in the bunker. The whole movie concentrates mostly on three people Hitler, his secretary and Ewa Braun, it tries to portrait each individual with his / hers feeling from the inside. The movie is based on the book and the director did marvelous job keeping to the book. This is not an American movie and perhaps is not hard to understand why this movie won't gather many spectators, to really appreciate the movie you have know the facts about Hitler and 2 World War. I highly recommend this movie."

","Downfall: Two and a half hours in the company of Hitler was never going to be easy going. But this film was so powerful it had you glued to your seat not noticing the time. Bruno Ganz (from 'wings of desire' (a favourite of mine)) gives a career performance as Hitler. He is so like him you could almost be watching a documentary. Which is what I did the night after I'd been to see it. You see I learnt some stuff at school and then some stuff from other films. But downfall made me realise I didn't really know enough, so the history channel it was for me and after several documentaries on old Hitler's rise to power and subsequent slaughter of thousands of innocent people, I was ready to think a bit more about this film. It is well directed, acted and shot, but the real controversy is in the fact that it shows Hitler as being in some respects quite normal. Nice to his dog, secretary and the children of fellow officers everywhere. He is shown as a frail old man with a bit of a temper. Don't get me wrong he is shown also as the monster he almost certainly was but I think its easier for people to understand the terrible things he did if they can somehow make out he was just pure evil. A bit like does the queen use the toilet? Of course she must but people don't see it that way. The fact that Hitler ate sensibly (vegetarian) didn't drink or smoke, loved art and was a good speaker, wouldn't warrant much hate against him. But to think off him as a cold-blooded killer helps us to kind of accept that he happen to kill 50 million people. The film is trying to lift the mask placed on Hitler by everyone. And in a way it does, it is slightly pleasing to see his end when it comes, and along the way it raises some very interesting questions. It is as much a psychological study of power and corruption as it is a war film and I think it should be shown in schools everywhere."

Bruno Ganz has the important role of ReichsFürher Adolf Hitler, and he does it greatly, he is excellent as Hitler! This movie is not only the best German film I have ever seen, but it is also the best movie over all that I have seen! There are many actors portraying all the people that were with Hitler in the Fürherbunker when he committed suicide, and all of those actors get the characters they are playing so really well.

","A very chilling and profoundly disturbing movie. This is a good outcome as I am sure that was the intent of the people who put this movie together. Sublime acting by the whole cast made it feel like you were in the bunker with Hitler for those last days. Some may need Prozac after watching this film as it does not have the typical Hollywood happy ending. Excellent history as the script attempts to stay close to the actual historical record as possible. Even though I am a historian of WWII, I still found things out in this movie that were new to me. Still, what sets this movie apart from other ""war flicks"" is the intense work by the actors to bring these characters to life and make them as multi-dimensional as their real-life counterparts must have been. These are not your cookie-cutter Nazis as seen in most war films. You still loathe and despise these people but you come to understand them a bit better. Hitler does not come off well as they portray his loss of touch with reality quite well. This was a man who almost conquered the world yet we see him beaten and broken and feeling betrayed by his loyal followers as well as the entire German people. You get to see some of the cost to the civilians of Berlin for Hitler's desire to see them pay for their failure to win the war. This movie does not glorify Hitler or the Third Reich rather it attempts to put those final days into a bit of perspective. A very tragic and horrific story but one that most Americans would benefit from seeing."

The voice is there too.<br/><br/>There is much good acting here, especially from Heino Ferch as Speer.

A WW2 movie from the perspective of Hitler during his last days - intriguing premise and should make a brilliant piece of film right? Boy, was I disappointed; this has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. It's full or clichés, about an hour and a half too long and the pace is incredibly slow - you won't believe how many times I thought to myself: ""just get it over and done with already!"" - even I wanted to kill myself by the halfway mark. But by then I had stopped caring. It does nothing to tell us anything new or refreshing about Hitler's last days, so the whole thing was just completely pointless. Yes, it's supposed to capture just how desperate they all became as the Russians closed in and the leader gradually lost his mind; as if he didn't I suppose the one saving grace of this absolutely terrible movie is Bruno Ganz's portrayal of the Fuhrer; he absolutely nails the great leader down to every little mannerism and nervous tick; you'd think Hitler himself had come back from the dead to be in this movie. But then, not even top-notch acting by Ganz can save this awful movie from its ""downfall""."

","If you want an entertaining German movie, I suggest you try ""Der Schulmaedchenreport 4"". So much better in every way...<br/><br/>Actually, Germans are not known for making good movies, and this little Bunker-Tage bio of Hitler is an indication why. The acting is mostly unimpressive, and Hitler comes off as a comic character. Of course, this is always a problem with portraying Hitler; he was so outrageous/absurd/unreal in every way that it's almost impossible to play him without the performance looking like a broad parody of him.<br/><br/>Hence, whenever Hitler (Ganz) shouts - and he shouts and bitches like a wild dog a dozen times at least - I was more inclined to giggle than to get into the drama of the moment. There's plenty of saliva flying out of Ganz's mouth, and if this movie were shown in 3D I would have feared that some might land into my face. Not a pleasant thought! Even Charlie Chaplin's spoof has more of the real person than Ganz's totally animated, overly grumpy Hitler.<br/><br/>Okay, the film isn't that bad. The subject-matter is too interesting to be botched even by a German film-crew, but the close-to 150-minute length is a bit of a problem, too. Frankly, to me the highlight of the movie was the ending, and I'm not trying to be funny. The outro, which reveals what happened to each of the main characters is interesting, but I guess that info one could get in the books or the internet anyway.<br/><br/>You can count yourself lucky if you don't speak German, because if you read the subtitles then the acting and the dialogue don't seem as imperfect as they really are. (This is the case with Bergman films, too.) If you see it in German then you realize just how hard some of these actors try but simply can't get their act together.<br/><br/>Besides, you just know that the Germans could never resist injecting a note of humanity into the main Nazi characters. (A little bias, perhaps...?) I found it laughable how some of these top Nazi psychopaths/sociopaths were portrayed. Another problem is that I could not really feel for any of the German ""civilians""/volunteers dying as they defended Berlin. Why? Because considering how many millions of deaths were caused by Germany in WW II - of which the concentration camps represented the worst - I really didn't care that much...<br/><br/>If you are unhappy with this dull Hitler flick, which you must be, just google ""Vjetropev Hitler Spoofs"" and this will lead you to my video clips with the vastly improved movie. Have fun.<br/><br/>For a truly (unintentionally) funny German movie, try ""Der Schnibbler"". I hear it's Edwoodesque."

","Forget 'Battlefield Earth', 'Wolf Creek', 'Dancer in the Dark', 'Catwoman', etc. 'Downfall' is inexcusable and unforgivable. This trivialisation of one of the bleakest periods of human history should never have been made.<br/><br/>There's a loose correspondence with real events: World War Two happened, Hitler died, and that's about it. Almost every scene rang false. There was no mention of the holocaust, just a few anti-semitic ravings, briefly confined to the later parts. The acting was uniformly (as befits a Nazi drama) awful.<br/><br/>It's a blasphemy against humanity to make a film like this. Show what actually happened, or get as close to it as possible when the records are lacking, but don't make an 'entertainment' of those dreadful days.<br/><br/>Any return to the evil and slaughter of 1939-45 should leave a viewer stunned and outraged. 'Downfall' fails at every level. It fails to tell the truth. It fails to involve any viewer who has any inkling of the truth. It shows scenes that certainly didn't happen.<br/><br/>Until watching 'Downfall' I'd rated 'Inglourious Basterds' as the worst war film ever. After what I saw tonight, Tarantino's greatest folly is now reduced to a mistimed joke. If you're going to falsify history, why not immolate Hitler in a Parisian cinema, cocking a snook at reality?<br/><br/>I can only think that 'Downfall' was made by persons wholly insensitive to human suffering who hoped to wring a few tears from a popcorn-gobbling audience by showing human suffering.<br/><br/>I kept watching, with increasing reluctance, for a long, long time. Then I felt so disgusted with the film, and with myself for being dragged along by a manipulatively false and farcical story, that I hit the off button.<br/><br/>Everyone involved with the making of this loathsome film should be ashamed of themselves. The favourable IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes ratings can only have come from reviewers not old enough to feel connected to the unspeakable vileness of Nazi Germany.<br/><br/>I thought it would be a hard call, but 'Downfall' is the worst film I've ever seen."

The Swiss actor<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz's portrayal of a 'human' Hitler clashed with a convention<br/><br/>which requires him to be cast as a carpet-biting devil. Audiences saw a<br/><br/>worried, frightened and tearful Fuhrer; they witnessed him kiss his new<br/><br/>wife Eva on the mouth (The Hitler Book makes it clear that he kissed her --<br/><br/>like a good Austrian -- on the hand); they saw his concern for the well-<br/><br/>being of his secretaries; and they saw the demon too, but one mitigated<br/><br/>perhaps by human (rather than humane) emotions.

An eloquent example of this is the alleged tantrum that was caused by Fegelein's<br/><br/>treachery. The cinema-goer hears Hitler, beside himself with fury, bellowing 'Treachery!', 'Fegelein! Fegelein! Fegelein!', and the script emphasizes, 'Each time Hitler beats the table with his fist. His face is so red that<br/><br/>it is fit to explode.'

"hasosch","10","1","4","16 January 2010"," Insights into the private life of Mr. A. Hitler
","It is a peculiarity of Germany that it produces, on the one side, uninterruptedly movies about the time of the National Socialism with the clear purpose of ""explaining the unexplainable"", but, on the other side, it punishes and persecutes with the utmost severeness all those who try to have their own opinion about national socialism or some of their exponents. Exactly the latter happened to ""Der Untergang"" (2004): Director Hirschbiegel was most heavily criticizes through weeks in the boulevard tableaux because he did not dissociate himself from the ""benevolent and favorable"" picture that Traudl Junge (on whose memories the film is based) gave about her former boss Hitler. Indeed: Somebody who watches this movies without the burden of allegedly commonly borne (and ""suffered"") past, he or she may sense Hitler as a bearer of sympathy: He does not drink nor smoke, eats only vegetarian and small-sized meals, drinks herb-tea and no coffee, is not pro miscue and loves animals and children over anything. Junge/Hirschbiegel also clearly differentiate (at various places of the movie) between ""the human A.H."" and ""Der Führer"".<br/><br/>It seems to be forbidden, at least in Germany, that also a dictator (who was by the way correctly elected Reichskanzler) is a human being and not a monster from outer space. When recently multi-Oscar winning director Oliver Stone called Hitler a ""scapegoat"" - whole Germany shook frightened its head. Had Stone been a German (or perhaps only in Germany to the time when he uttered that), the police would have arrested him because of ""belittlement"" of war-crimes. Of course: Only about two years ago, famous and popular TV moderator and writer Eva Herman lost her job because she was telling in one of her shows that the children's care had been much better in the NS-time than it is in present-day Germany. Nothing else. When, again some years earlier, a chemist offered a court house to show his chemical proof that cyclone B could not possibly have been used in cold Auschwitz - he was arrested and sentences without even having been given the possibility to show his scientific proof. The same happened to a meanwhile whole bunch of scientists who have tried to shade light on some of the innumerable inconsistencies and contradictions of what happened or not happened between 1933 and 1945. Speaking nicely about Hitler is strongly forbidden in Germany, one just wonders that this movie has not been banned in Germany. The more one has to praise its director, not only for his great and admirable achievement, but mostly for his courage in a land where only that is accepted as ""truth"" about the NS times which is accepted by Jewish historians."
"gregopego12","8","1","4","1 August 2006"," It captures a great moral catastrophe well
","First of all, this movie was incredibly well made (and much better than Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List). I am examining these movies as to their usefulness as teaching tools about that period in history. You're better off with Band of Brothers than Saving Private Ryan. Schindler's list is probably easier to show to an American school audience, because their are lines delivered in English (weren't there?) Also, Schindler's List exposes the evil of Nazi Germany better than Downfall. Downfall. . .is all in German (with subtitles)--very hard for high school students to sit through, and is much more subtle in it's presentation of the evil of the Third Reich. That doesn't mean that the message isn't there (or clear), but the viewer needs a lot more background to the story to understand that this movie is not pro Nazi or pro Hitler. The movie's only shortcoming is that the historical players seem to wander in and out of the story for the first 45 minutes or so, but the movie certainly starts threading all of the pieces together. The actors do a great job, and the attention to detail is correctly used (not overused). This movie shows the chaos of Berlin, the military, and Hitler's Government shortly before they surrender to the Red Army. If one thinks that this movie is pro Nazi, he or she has to juxtapose the obvious displays of fanaticism for Hitler's cause with the obvious frustration of his General Staff (they're left in a drunken heap by the end of the story) along with the ruin of Berlin (with no concern for the civilians at all). Do not confuse an excellent performance of Hitler with a sympathetic performance. This is still the same monster who murdered millions of people and held on to impossible delusions until he surrendered to cowardice. Also, do not confuse the fact that 98% of the story is told through the German side as being sympathetic. When they finally confront the reality of Soviet occupation, they all react as cowardly as possible.<br/><br/>A good movie to show in a college classroom."

","Step inside the artillery-pounded, claustrophobic confines of Hitler's final command post. As German boys confront Russian tanks in the streets, leading Nazis and their generals are locked in a dance of death with their Fuhrer, who will not admit the reality of defeat and release them from disaster. Some try to save their own skins, others are unswervingly loyal. Most can only wait helplessly for events to unfold. A few heroes try to bring an end to the suffering. But gangs of villains use the dying days of the war to intensify it in an orgy of political violence.<br/><br/>With Russian forces just blocks away, Hitler's political structure remains potently intact. Nothing is more shocking than the sight of death squads summarily executing traitors and deserters to a lost cause. Some civilians even take this duty upon themselves, ropes slung over shoulders. There is no compassion. There is not even logic. Just bitterness, pointless brutality and misdirected rage. Hitler speaks admiringly of his enemies, ""the disciplined people of the east"", while ranting at the failure of the ""weak"" German people. Goebbels too shows no sympathy for the suffering of German civilians, content instead to ""slit their little throats"" for being such unquestioning followers. His children must also fall under this category.<br/><br/>The concrete bunker is a symbol of a divorce from all reality and empathy. The director contrasts the compact, well-supplied, neat and orderly remains of the Nazi state with the vast and fiery chaos in the rubble outside. The faithful cling fervidly to party doctrine and sing patriotic songs while explosions rumble above. Huddled meetings in the bunker contrast vividly with images of earlier Nazi rallies. These scenes also brought to mind another famous German war movie, 'Das Boot'.<br/><br/>The film is an excellent recreation of the doomed dictatorship, and gives us much else to think about. Bruno Ganz somehow evokes pity rather than contempt for his stooped and haggard Hitler, in turns gentle and fatherly, poisonous and hysterical, deluded and powerless, fanatical and cruel. How can this twitching and shuffling figure who can't bear to watch his own dog being put down be the same man responsible for sending millions to their deaths? But there is also an uneasy sense that Hitler knows exactly what he is doing, a suspicion that his delusional ranting, his denial of reality, is really a ploy to maintain control at all costs, though now it doesn't extend far beyond the bunker. His decision to commit suicide, to have his body destroyed, and his acknowledgement that millions would curse him, are evidence that he was far from mad. The decision of several not-so-culpable Nazis to follow Hitler to the grave is a disturbing testimony to the power of his cult of leadership.<br/><br/>When I visited Berlin in 1997 there was not a trace left of Hitler's bunker, not even a marker. Germans feel uncomfortable about ""gawkers"" trying to revisit the Third Reich, especially as tourists. But I am glad that a German director has had the courage to make this film. It may be seen by some as an attempt to undo the demonization of Hitler, or by others as voyeuristic entertainment for Hitler ""gawkwers"". But no, the film is addressing our common human need to understand the past - the catastrophic, unthinkable and hidden past of just sixty years ago. How could such cruelty and brutality have taken place in a modern nation? And could it easily happen again?"

","*poilers if you don't know the ww2 story"" one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. Seeing through the enemies eyes, knowing things you don't read about in history books. I would not recommend this movie to anyone who does not know general facts about world war two, clearly meant for Germany a nation that realizes what it had done and has deep knowledge of the happening. If one does not know the evil of Hitler then the movie might stretch them to support him over an anonymous, ruthless opponent. This is not to say that the movie says Hitler is good, but it shows how ruthless of a leader he was without having to bring up the Jewish part of the holocaust. truly makes Hitler seem like an evil maniacal man obsessed and overcome with power."
"elcopy","9","1","4","26 March 2005"," Good historical film
","I don't understand why many people criticized this film for portraying Hitler in a sympathetic manner. On the opposite, this film portrays Hitler as a lunatic, cruel, dangerous and stubborn. Some people surrounding him were portrayed the same. <br/><br/>In the end, the only people you're sympathetic with are the millions who died thanks to the delusions of a mad man and the group who followed him.<br/><br/>It's refreshing seeing a German film portraying the Nazis more realistically and not as the caricatures Hollywood got us used to seeing."
"Schaumann_1","9","1","4","17 March 2005"," This is truly film history!
","This is with out a doubt, one of the best war films i have ever seen. Of course it could not come from the organized censorship known as USA, it had too come from Europe. <br/><br/>It dives into the madness of a man, a man who is fragile, an emotional handicapped shadow of a human being. But still it also portraits an icon who where worshipped by a great deal of the German people, this man who where a God to so many people suddenly gets a face, a face who is not only expressing hate, but also sadness and fear, but this is always overshadowed by his powerful hatred. This is not a film where you will find your self closing your eyes when people are killed, but rather a movie where you will hold your ears when this extremely hateful man is talking about the world as he sees it, still you can not help yourself, you will not hate this man when you leave the cinema, you will pity this broken shell of a man.<br/><br/>Bruno Gantz as Adolf Hitler is the single most powerful role i have ever seen, he shows Hitler the way we know him from pictures and movie clips, as a loud and verbally violent man. As for the side of Hitler who few knew he gives his most terrifying performance and reveals the fact that we all hoped wasn't true, that Hitler wasn't a God or a demon, he was a human being, a human being just like you and me ad you know what? thats what scared me the most."
"kathyandlarry","7","3","23","6 April 2005"," Very good but doesn't impact
","Certainly well done as the actor playing Hitler really brought out his personality. For me the interest though was not in watching Hitler as the people around him struggle or accept the mess they are in. Maybe that is why the movie doesn't rise to great for me. The supporting case doesn't rise to a level that really makes one care about them or what is going to happen. This despite the makers attempting and I believe showing what it really was like in Berlin during those 10 days. I suppose knowing how it comes out in the end doesn't help any. Minor crit: I wish the movie had done a better job of identifying the names of the people around him. Himmler and Goering were identifiable but I didn't realize until the end who was playing Keitel and Jodl for example."
"scorseseisgod-1","3","3","25","12 November 2005"," A Limp Heil
","Last year's ""Hitler's Secretary"" documented the life of Traudl Junge, the last woman to transcribe the virulent dictator's dictation. Did anyone out there order a straightforward narrative account of Hitler's final days in the bunker? Following in the goosesteps of Richard Baseheart, Alec Guinness, Sidney Miller and countless others is Bruno Ganz, Wim Wenders' fallen angel, trying hard to add a little extra sieg to the heil, stretch to the salute and spittle to the tirades. Ganz makes a great Fuhrer. The obligatory tousling that falling lock of famous hair and siphon-bursts of anger are brilliantly mimicked. He even adds a new mannerism to the character - the left hand behind the back spastically squeezing an imaginary ball.<br/><br/>In an attempt to add a touch of documentary realism, the first voice we hear belongs to the real Ms. Junge, Hitler's farewell stenographer. Apprehension set in early on during Traudl's (Alexandra Maria Lara) interview. Hitler confides, ""I make so many mistakes when I dictate."" Not that I was expecting a Mel Brooks musical number, but some type of subtle suggestion that the authors understood the irony in the dialog would have added a tinge of personality to this otherwise conventional directorial debut.<br/><br/>Much has been said of the movie's alleged attempts to humanize Hitler. He's nice to his dog and Traudl. He was good enough to marry Eva Braun just prior to their mutual suicides. Still, that doesn't make him sympathetic or any less capable of committing atrocities. More like a lame attempt by a publicist to frantically stir up word of mouth over a film that asks viewers to spend the better part of their day in a bunker with the Maharishi of mass murder, his architects of doom and their families.<br/><br/>Even though the film is limited to only one screaming mother, it still can't help but plead guilty to stirring up the kind of messy sentiment too often associated with the genre. When all else fails, toss in a child and feebly juxtapose their clean slates with the Nazi atrocities. In this case there are kids both in and out of the bunker. An eight-year-old ""civilian"" who takes down two tanks before receiving a personal commendation from Shickelgruber must eventually learn the errors of his ways. Next to a bucket of amputated body parts in the O.R., the most difficult scene to watch has Mother Goebbles feeding cyanide to her sleeping offspring. The former is off-putting due to its sudden, graphic appearance. The latter is even more repulsive due to its meticulous, downright loving (in the sense that the filmmakers knew the power of the scene and milked it for all the schmaltz its worth) pictorialization. Is this one of the humanizing elements people are bent out of shape over? It isn't long before death can't be mentioned without being butted against a scene featuring children. The Goebble's Family Singers perform a song for Aunt Eva and Uncle Hitler just prior to an in-depth discussion of various forms of death. A suicide is dutifully followed up with a symbolic baby's doll flying out a window.<br/><br/>The vast majority of the running time plays out in the bunker and once we lose Der Fuhrer it all becomes tiresome. The loose ends come together and once again, Ms. Traudl (this time with an image to accompany the voice) is brought into play, Obviously tacked on to add a bookend (and documentary credence) it cannot help but evoke unwelcome memories of ""Schindler's List,"" the film spawned it."
"lspaiser","5","4","42","6 April 2005"," Cinematic ally ""Downfall"" is a non-event
","I found ""Downfall"" boring and too long. Compared to Hotel Rwanda which was thrilling and chilling, ""Downfall"" was neither - it was a trivial movie. Don't waste your time and money unless you really want to get the exact ""who did what and how"" at the end of the Reich.<br/><br/>But if you like historical tales, and you like to see ""polite"" blood and a bit of guts - this movie is for you.<br/><br/>The movie, like its infamous villain states about himself  has no feeling. Indeed it portrays nothing in particular about this horrific person. Other, than probably like in his personal life, he must have been quite boring.<br/><br/>I guess it could rate somewhat higher if it was a documentary, but it can't even qualify as that. <br/><br/>Cinematic ally ""Downfall"" is a non-event"
"zchannel","10","1","5","19 October 2006"," It's like you were there at the end
","This is the most amazing movie about the final days of Hitler told from the perspective of his personal secretary. The madness of his regime comes through loud and clear. This is a ""must see"" for anyone who thinks one understands totalitarian or fanatical regimes or ""the madness of crowds."" Denial is a potent but essential drug of fanatics. One is impressed with Hitler's conviction and tenacity of his beliefs in his maniacal fantasies, delusional at the end. However, the madness continues. Compassion for the German people, who chose their leaders, is misplaced. They deserve what they get. Traitors are executed even though the war is nearly ended. Troops and officers get drunk, party with cocaine and alcohol, only to be arrested and shot just before the Russians overrun Berlin. Yet no one wants to live in a world without National Socialism. Clinging to the ideology to the end."
"b-gaist","7","1","5","7 November 2005"," Ambivalent?
","I'm not entirely sure about this film. On the one hand, it is undoubtedly a very well-directed and acted work of art, with an interesting and important story to tell; on the other, I felt an ambivalence - whether in the director, the actors, the story itself, I can't yet say - regarding the figures that were being portrayed. While the fallibility of Hitler, Eva Braun and the terrifying Goebbels family is immediately apparent (incidentally, I don't think I've ever seen a better and more frightening description of the dark side of motherhood than in Mrs Goebbels in this film), nevertheless I was left with a question mark: were these people really the savage misanthropes history has shown them to be, or idealists martyred to a cause they believed in, however misled? I think there is a danger in the film here, that it could be misused if it fell into the wrong hands. I was also somehow upset by some of the symbolism: the German 12-year-old who is able to destroy two enemy tanks, the drunk and disorderly Russian invaders. Are there fascist associations to this film? If so, are they consciously or unconsciously present? To what extent can a German director make a film of this sort responsibly? Eichinger certainly does a good job, but can he transcend his national origins?It may be useful, while watching it, to bear this question in mind. Nevertheless, a film worth watching."
"mcv905","9","1","5","11 October 2005"," A history lesson to be watched
","An outstanding movie. It was a little slow getting into it but ending up being a fast paced, action packed adventure into the mind of a mad man. Watching this movie and not knowing the history of Hitler and World War 2 you almost feel sorry for the guy. But to the families of the millions of people he ordered murdered, there is no sorrow for him. I found this movie very educational. It should be shown to high school students in all history classes. It starts by showing Hitler with a human side, then moves him to his delusional state that eventual shows him as a psychotic killer. The acting captured the mood when Hitler felt that his armies were coming to recapture Berlin and make everything right for, knowing very well that his armies were being defeated and there was no rescue. The way it was portrayed how Hitler turned on his biggest supporters when they realized all was lost and surrendered was bone chilling. His marriage to Eva Braun, a woman as nutty as he was, was also bone chilling on someone could love a man like Adolph Hitler. They both got what they deserve in the end although there still is doubt that they killed themselves and were burned. I still have beliefs that Hitler and Eva lived there lives out in Argentina, but I guess that story is for another movie. As long as you can stand the sub titles, I highly recommend this movie so that everyone can learn how this man nearly took over the world and maybe they will get an idea on how many other tyrants are out there is the modern world today."
"imdb-6155","9","1","5","5 April 2005"," Impressively realistic, and good colour.
","There were a lot of booms at the start of the movie - of the sound recording variety, which spoilt the otherwise incredible realism. There were also a lot of booms at the end, but the right sort that made the theatre shake.<br/><br/>My only criticism is that in all the excerpts of Traudl Junge I have seen, she had a very kind voice which gave her an attractive character. Alexandra Maria Lara did a good job of looking lost, but the voice did not seem right. <br/><br/>Gritty and realistic. At the end of the film you get a synopsis of what happened to all the characters, but they were not on screen long enough. I would have been happy to sit there for a few minutes longer."
"bunny_hater66","2","3","29","7 March 2008"," Come On Guys! Chaplin and Allen!
","I'm not that keen on the film there were sparks of promising moments but disappeared with suicide the only character that I did feel sorry for was the poor secretary being put through something that was probably an un-decided future working for a psychotic Jew hater. The narrative obviously had a subliminal message we are sorry for Hitler he weren't that bad. I just do not understand the great fascination and sympathy for a man that should have no respect for what he stands for which is rather hellish, I feel that they are trying to show that he isn't that bad but a normal human doing what any normal human is thinking and doing unfortunately for the Germans, Italians and Austrians I will not be fooled by pure trickery. But a common think that seems to be in the most recent of war films of foreign soldiers is suicide take for granted The Letters From Iwo Jima although that is a lot better and looks better. I was also anticipating something as good as Das Boot. But I did like a lot of the shots that made you feel quite moving and gripping like that young boy. What made this movie memorable to me were the scenes in which we could see the cruelty and sickening determination of some German officers and soldiers to fulfill their Führer's orders even when it was clear he had committed suicide. What I also liked was Bruno Ganz performance. I feel that it is just a flattering portrait of a evil regime and the devil himself. It shows quite a dark and profoundly horrifying ordeal of a death of there Fúrher and would go to any lengths to save there believes even dying with them. Probably the most eye opening and memorable scene is of when the mother killed her children showing that she feels that nothing is worth living if the Nazi's fall. And shows a kind of domino effect with one falling all the others do as well. It also showed that they were so dependant on him. . It shows that Hitler is visibally shrinking and shaking as he contemplates the third riech and almost alternating from despair and madness. Plus Charlie Chaplin and Woody Allen are Jewish so I side with them two"
"gilg7","8","1","6","15 June 2010"," A realistic film, keeps the Nazi's riddle unresolved
","I started watching this film with a prejudice: That's because of my disfavor about any attempt to show the Nazis as victims or even as miserables in retro-perspective. As a Jew, this opinion is accompanied by extremely strong emotions.<br/><br/>However, after watching the movie, I waive any criticism of that kind: There was nothing pathetic about these characters in the bunker. Their behavior while experiencing an extremely fast destruction was so realistic on one hand and yet as monstrous as you would expect i.e. we are not imposed by the director to change our narrative neither our feeling toward the Nazis (and in this context this is quite O.K.)<br/><br/>People committed mutual suicide, a mother killed her all sons, old citizens of their own nation are killed as traitors for nothing, and so on... The common initiation to all these horrible actions is one: persons took these inhuman act due to their cognitive dissonance.<br/><br/>But how did they reach such a level of cognitive dissonance ? This is the unresolved German riddle: what caused tens of Millions of people to choose a totally inhuman attitude. No one in this situation has shown any regret neither sorrow about ruining tens of Millions of lives. Just a purely egocentric dilemma about reality vs. the Germans' aspiration that time. They were inhuman in their lives and inhuman in their deaths. Such a phenomenon is unique in history and no nation has ever acted that way before neither after Nazis."
"tallahassee59","8","1","6","16 March 2005"," good movie
","GREAT movie with good actors....only Joseph Goebbels was played poor....the actor Willy Krause who played Joseph Goebbels in a movie from director Pabst ""der letzte akt"" was much much better. The cast are really great. These are mostly German stars, some not very famous, but they perform wonderfully. Bruno Ganz shows Hitler as he probably really was. The film is criticized because it gives the Nazi's a human face, but this is exactly it's strongest point the Nazi's were not extraterrestrial monsters, they were as human as you and I. It was very brave to make this film, given that controversy was almost certain to arise. One of the highlights of this year, to be sure. If you are interested in how it really was, go see it in the cinema, it's worth every penny."
"bhy1976","9","2","20","4 June 2006"," a glimpse into the German soul.
","There's not much to say about the film other than it is excellent from start to finish. I lived in Germany for 6 years and I it does not surprise me in the least that Hitler came to power to the degree that he did. This is not to say that modern Germany is full of fascist goose-stepping Nazis, but many modern Germans, even if they claim to be anti- Hitler/ fascist, still show a rather unsettling tendency to cherish the values that Hitler, the penultimate German, held so high. I speak here of the almost fanatical reverence for 'law and order', the territorialism that goes along with it, and the deep suspicion of all things foreign, all of which are well depicted in this film through the character of Hitler. Thus I think that this is a very educational film for most Germans because they have the opportunity to be reminded, lest they forget, of the devastating effects of xenophobia and intolerance."

","Went to see Down Fall because I heard Bruno Ganz was worth seeing. He was worth seeing. But after the sixth or seventh of his scenes I found his role and his portrayal of Hitler uninteresting. The movie was not worth watching; though I suppose if you wanted a synopsis of what went on in the bunker the story covers a lot of ground. I left the theater after the sound of the shot. We are led to believe that Hitler has shot himself. Main gripes: Too long, Cheap looking locations, Too many characters (OK so there were a lot of people who wanted Hitler to surrender, to leave, to try and lessen the horror of Berlin's citizens) I couldn't see the purpose of recounting each one, This looked liked what it was; a made for TV movie. We get a glimpse of one viewpoint. The newly wed Eva Braun tries to suggest that maybe Hitler was of two distinct persona. The man versus the leader of the National Socialists. But that or any sort of real explanation for the different moods Ganz portrays are not developed."

","Nobody knows what exactly happened in Berlin in 1945; this is fiction. The documentary stance is better than for example Hollywood's interpretation of Hiroshima & Nagasaki. One must always look at a movie in terms of profit-driven intent. No movie is a true documentary. European movies and all other industries have been suffering since 1945, and they will continue to do so for another 100 years or so... Except Great Britain and Switzerland, of course (they are shareholders in Hollywood media). We do not care about Monaco or Luxembourg, for now. When will there be real freedom of the press (the press includes international movie distribution). What if someone will make a movie that will show WW1 & WW2 from another point of view, and he or she will publicize it as fiction? That would have to be upheld as constitutional in a supreme court within the EU (let us not deal with the corruption of US courts that is, at least for now, is not substantial in the EU, but it shall come shortly). So, in our view, history books published after 1945 are propaganda, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>We have a passion for international media, Animax International Holdings BV ZRt"
"ww_sketcher","8","1","7","3 August 2005"," Downfall works for the most part despite some major flaws.
","Like all War films that surround World War II taken from Hitler's side they all often have the knack of showing Hitler on rare, unintended positive side. Der Untergang has this problem. For the person who was slaughtered millions of innocent people, how can we see him doing things such as padding through a young boy's hair or putting a nervous secretary at ease with a joke? Luckily this is sort of kept under control with screenwriter Bernd Eichinger, who basically delivers that idea that even the worst of the Nazis were still human at heart, regardless of their intentions. The more interesting parts of the film is seeing Hitler not just picking out the Jews, but him and his cohorts going from picking out everyone, even to random Berliners who were considered traitors in Hitler's eyes. This film basically does delve in the fact that Hitler was long gone mad in his last final days.<br/><br/>The film as a whole on the other hand..it's well..slow and scattered. You can even tell at times that it was glued together from a multitude of historical sources. Making some sequences long and over-done, allowing it to drag, even if Traudl Junge has an interesting story (even if it was re-stated before in the documentary ""Hitler's Secretary"".), and the filmmakers seem to lack the drama of what was going on with the specific people which allowed them to get all caught up in what was happening.<br/><br/>Overall Downfall succeeds even if does seem like it could have use some re-organizing, and better sense of pace. It's still well worth a watch.<br/><br/>8 / 10."
"kraz007","7","1","9","18 October 2005"," Downfall disappoints in not finding a positive character
","The movie opens with the real Traudl Junge (since she died in 2002, the footage is taken from an earlier documentary) talking about her experience as Hitler's secretary.<br/><br/>It matters a great deal how this movie starts for the simple reason we know how it's all going to end. Since 1955, this is the forth movie that focuses solely on Hitler's last 10 days.<br/><br/>In that respect, we're fortunate that the first scene where Hitler chooses his future secretary provides a unique perspective to Hitler  a warm, paternal leader who generously offers 20-year old Traudl a second chance to record his speech. Once this hors d'oeuvre is over, however, we are treated to a main dish (wursts!) that's been heated again and again in the last 60 years.<br/><br/>Even if you don't know ANYTHING about the Third Reich, you know that Hitler was a raging lunatic; you know that Goebbels had unconditional faith in the Fuhrer, and so on.<br/><br/>For the first 60 minutes, it's actually fun to place names to faces because the casting and the acting is so good (I do give credit where credit is due). Goebbels and Himler are an excellent match. I recently viewed ""Triumph of the Will""(1934) and the resemblance is uncanny. Bruno Ganz portrays a broken man whose rages feed on each piece of bad news and in 1945 every news is bad news: the Red Army is inside Berlin, Hitler's closest aides desert him The rages don't last very long and leave a smaller, even more broken Fuhrer.<br/><br/>Arguing that the director wants us to sympathize will be far-fetched. The stated intention was to make Hitler appear more ""human."" Hitler's manic/depressive scenes are balanced with acts of kindness to his cook, his secretaries, and his German Shepard, Blondi. This more ""human"" Hitler is even more disturbing than the iconic monster. All his impulses are focused on destruction: first, the Russian armies, then the traitors and the German people, and finally himself.<br/><br/>The movie's most disturbing scene comes after Hitler's death. Frau Goebbels carries out Hitler's will of self-destruction by taking the lives of her six children  angels too good to live in a world without National Socialism.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is not the only disturbing scene in the movie. Personally, I have a problem with the movie's depiction of good-hearted SS doctors or SS officers heroically committing suicide not to get into Russian hands. I also have a problem with the fate of the surviving officers. Some of them lived well into their nineties which cannot be said for some 50 million people who died in the war.<br/><br/>My last gripe: talking about Russian hands, why isn't there any reference to the Red Army's atrocities in the battle for Berlin and the immediate aftermath? In a real tragic sense, they carried out Hitler's last will  the humiliation and destruction of the German people. (A new book on the subject, Berlin: The Downfall 1945, is causing an outrage among senior Russian officials with some hard-hitting statistics on the number of rapes and murders.) Downfall is a good title for a movie that deals with Hitler's last days. It's also a good indication of what happened to my expectations as I sat through the movie's 140 minutes. It was disappointing to see one known fact follow another. Even more disappointing was the focus on just a handful of facts without a broader picture or a moral judgment. Despite it's budget and high production values, Downfall doesn't measure up on the epic scale. It's not good triumphs over evil, it's evil eats its heart out.<br/><br/><ul><li>Visit my movie Blog: FilmDailies.com -</li></ul>"
"bobbobwhite","7","1","9","21 March 2005"," Effective drama, grave and shocking
","Yes, Hitler was an unlikely leader of nations but was not a king nor an emperor but was duly elected into office by a supportive populace. The driving force of his impossible vision was due to two main things not often told or even known....one, his deeply neurotic mother love which gradually transformed itself into his deeply neurotic mother love of his(replacement)mother country and two, the character warping accomplished by this utopian artist's unshakable idealistic vision of the perfect world where all perfect things are forever perfectly in their places, just as in a perfect painting on a canvas created by a ""perfect"" artist such as he. An impossible combination, but always possible to him.<br/><br/>The mongrelized and thus, to him, imperfect world around him could never be the glorious Aryan world he wanted it to be, but he could not see that truth until the broken end of his fantasy dream, and the film showed well the harrowing result of that break through his collapse into madness and physical debilitation when the real truth of defeat became no longer avoidable.<br/><br/>In the future, all determined Utopia-builders will be forever feared, hated and defeated every time they arise, and this fact is in large part due to Hitler's undeniable but personally unknown contribution to the future of mankind and world history though his defeat. Unfortunately, this very same lesson has been obviously shown to us over and over throughout man's long history, but successive generations from each such event seem to have to relearn, through their own tragic experiences, this cruel lesson, the cost of which is always unspeakable human suffering that could have been essentially avoided if we humans could only better learn this oft-repeated historical lesson. One would think that, for man to endure, this lesson must stick tight to humanity one fine day.<br/><br/>Perhaps this defect indicates in part the real potential of human cloning as a future way to hopefully avoid the gross historical mistakes from which we humans cannot now seem to learn in order to co-exist in peace. Cloning scares me greatly, but we have to be open to its unknown possibilities for improving human beings as a species.<br/><br/>About the film....the main story of the film was the Russian invasion of Berlin, but it was so drawn-out and inconsistent, as they were near the bunker and then not, near again, and then not, and then again, until they finally were there and triumphed. Obviously it was done this way for greater dramatic effect as it made for a more exiting film, but even small changes in well documented war history annoy me when only done for entertainment's sake, thus more profit. True history demands greater honor than that.<br/><br/>Hitler's secretary was an important part of the film and of the true bunker story....but Fraulein Jumps' marriage and name change to Frau Junge was not even mentioned.....a sensitive congrats from Hitler that actually occurred was overlooked in the film, possibly in order to not humanize Hitler too much. In reality, Hitler was very fond of his Bunker ""inmates"" throughout the siege and thanked them often for their contribution to the cause, which proves that even monstrously sick people such as he can sometimes do nice and very human things on the long and uneven road to infamy.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was very effective in showing the main downside to the personal impact of infamy, that for some of them the only way to escape the terror of inescapable immense public hatred and humiliation resulting from a fall from grace is through the coward's door of suicide, and many criminals along with Hitler have passed through that inglorious door to eternal silence without ever having to face the incredible damage of their actions."

Also starring Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge, Corinna Harfouch as Magda Goebbels, Ulrich Matthes as Joseph Goebbels, Juliane Köhler as Eva Braun and Heino Ferch as Albert Speer.

","This is a documentary-like account of the final days of the Third Reich, with Hitler alternating between delusions of power and acknowledgment of defeat as the Russian Red Army closes in on Berlin. It is very well filmed, but offers no new historical perspective except perhaps to present Hitler as something more than a one-dimensional monster. Its biggest flaw is its sense of repetitiveness. There are countless scenes of Hitler meeting with his generals and discussing flawed tactics. Then the suicide scenes start and these go on forever. Since there is hardly any plot and certainly no suspense, the extreme length of the film becomes tiresome after a while."

What absolutely infuriates me though is the whitewashing it does of some of the Germans, particularly the doctor who's an SS Colonel, who's portrayed as a good guy. I'm not a historian, but everything I've ever read about the SS makes me certain that some good hearted decent guy isn't going to become an SS officer. The whole basis of the SS was totally evil. They were completely steeped in all the racist Nazi ideology, and to portray a Colonel in the SS as totally sympathetic is to me offensive.<br/><br/>Most of the controversy I've read about has been about how Hitler was portrayed, but I didn't have a problem with that at all. I think it makes the Monster that he was all the more scary simply because he was human, as opposed to some made up Hollywood villain like Hannibal Lechter or something . <br/><br/>It's amazing to me why one of the regular army Generals didn't just stab that guy.

Yes, he has his outbursts, but one might even feel sorry for him in this film (only if you're not familiar with his history, off course). Although he remained stubborn until the very end, this once powerful dictator - the devil himself - died cowardly by his own hand. May he rot in hell for all eternity!

Off course all movies will have key details changed for dramatic purposes, but the director and writer tried as much as possible to remain factual in all portrayals here.<br/><br/>The performance by Bruno Gantz playing as Adolf Hitler was remarkable down to even his looks. I am surprised this movie did not get a nod from the Oscar people or perhaps it did and I am not aware. I only learned of this film just last week as it was reviewed on someone's list and being the history buff I am, wanted to verify for myself.<br/><br/>The performances from the supporting cast is also impeccable, the actors that play Goebbels, his wife, Himmler, Eva Braun, several of the generals and even the main character that plays Jungl is spectacular and nothing short of award winning (IMHO). It is amazing how such a gem can be missed by mainstream movie buffs like me.<br/><br/>Bottom line, watch this movie, you wont regret it.

"sophiamarinova","7","0","1","24 November 2017"," Good acting but perhaps a bit too soft on Hitler
","Overall, the movie has good storytelling. The acting is solid and the whole war sequence is well- filmed. The only downside perhaps is that Hitler is represented in a more humane light than he likely deserves. It appears that the idea was to show him from the eyes of his followers, which the movie achieves but there is little coverage of his hateful ideology and quite a bit of romanticizing. As a viewer, I continued to be puzzled by his halo effect on those around him. <br/><br/>Obviously his character continues to be a bit of a mystery in the sense that so many romanticized him and did not truly acknowledge the extent of terror that his regime inflicted- some even to this day. It does appear that people will continue to look for false messiahs- and he must have been the proverbial ""wolf in sheep's clothing"" to his followers and much worse to everyone else."

"willwoodmill","6","0","3","25 April 2016"," Interesting concept, flawed execution
","Downfall tells the story of the last days of Hitler (played in the film by Bruno Ganz) in the bunker as Berlin was being attacked by the Russians. Which is an interesting idea for a film, and like most interesting ideas it's also a touchy one. The film follows Hitler and the remaining members of the Third Reich as they try to hold back the Germans, destroy all records of what they were doing, and come to terms with the fact that the Nazi party is over. At the beginning of the film Hitler seems sure that they can still win this, but as time goes on he becomes less and less sure, as the battle moves closer his home. Which makes for a great character study.<br/><br/>Downfall, as I said earlier, is an interesting idea for a film. It's nice to see that a film has has the courage to try and tackle such a difficult subject. The film doesn't try to portray the Nazi's as heroes or villains it just try's to show them as people. Which some people might take issue with, but then again if film is going to grow as an art form then we need to push boundaries and make some people uncomfortable in the process. But even though Downfall has a great premise, it struggles with bringing its vision to the screen. <br/><br/>Before we get into the issues I'd like to begin with what the film gets right, and if there's one thing Oliver Hirschbiegel, the director of Downfall, gets right, it's casting Bruno Ganz to play Adolf Hitler. He steals every single scene he's in, and this might be a backhanded compliment to Bruno Ganz, but it feels like he was born to play Hitler. I mean his performance in Wings of Desire was great, but this is the one that they'll remember him for, and it's a shame he wasn't nominated for best lead actor. Another thing that Downfall does really well, is that it is able to get you to sympathize with Nazis. At one part in the film I felt legitimate sorrow for some of the characters and then I realized, I was sad because bad things were happening to Nazis. Something I never though I would ever feel in my whole life, and since Downfall made me feel that, I would say it deserves to be commended.<br/><br/>But even though Downfall was able to get you to sympathize with Nazis, it still messed some other things up. The biggest problem with Downfall is that it isn't focused. The films main plot is on Hitler in the bunker, all the things he's dealing with, and how he faces his inevitable destruction. And with that center plot, the film tries to build all these different stories and characters that are tied to what's going on with Hitler in the Bunker, and a lot of these are unnecessary and distracting. Another problem I have with all the side characters is a good chunk of the supporting cast is pretty weak. None are terrible but I mean they were unnecessary some were annoying, and I just really didn't care about a whole lot of them. This might seem strange but at some parts Downfall feels like it's trying to imitate Schindler's List. The way in which the horrors of the war are portrayed in Downfall are very similar to way in which the horrors of the holocaust were portrayed in Schindler's List. Maybe it's just me that thinks this, but the way they would have horribly violent actions shot like they were just part of everyday life, felt identical to some parts of Schindler's List. Downfall also has a serious problem with using CGI in some of their battle scenes, it only happens a few times but when it does it ruins the whole scene.<br/><br/>Downfall was well received by audiences and critics alike, and was even nominated for best foreign language film by The Academy Awards. And I had have to say that I recommend Downfall, it's worth seeing just based of the concept of the film alone, even if the execution is lackluster.<br/><br/>6.6/10"
"GusF","Null","0","1","6 September 2015"," A hugely engrossing, powerful and thoughtful treatment of the material
","Released under the title ""Downfall"" in the English speaking world, this is a hugely engrossing film about the last ten days of Hitler's life, the fall of Berlin to the Red Army and the end of the Second World War in Europe. The excellent script by Bernd Eichinger is based on a variety of historical sources, many of them primary ones, and hues closely to the actual events of April and May 1945. Oliver Hirschbiegel's direction is superlative in both the quieter character moments and the appropriately brutal, uncompromising and often disturbingly violent battle scenes. Given the subject matter, it is interesting to note that much of the film was shot in St. Petersburg.<br/><br/>In the role of Adolf Hitler, Bruno Ganz is phenomenal and never less than absolutely compelling, whether he is being tender towards his companions in the bunker or spewing hatred for the Jews. The film endeavoured to make the dictator as three-dimensional and human as possible and it fully succeeded in this. Some criticised the film for this approach but it is important to remember that Hitler was human and not an alien or a demon or one of Frankenstein's creations. The British historian Sir Ian Kershaw, one of the leading experts on Hitler and the Third Reich in general, had this to say on the matter and I think that this says it best: ""Hitler was, after all, a human being, even if an especially obnoxious, detestable specimen. We well know that he could be kind and considerate to his secretaries, and with the next breath show cold ruthlessness, dispassionate brutality, in determining the deaths of millions."" His secretary Traudl Junge says almost exactly that in the film, which continually emphasises his crimes and his complete disregard for human life. In the final days of his life, Hitler was a pathetic, increasingly unstable figure but the film does not want us to pity him and I most certainly didn't.<br/><br/>Alexandra Maria Lara is excellent as Traudl Junge, who is depicted as a good person who finds herself in the midst of a dreadful situation which is far beyond her control and perhaps her understanding. She has a misplaced sense of loyalty to Hitler but she is not a true Nazi and she is extremely uncomfortable whenever he engages in one of his anti-Semitic tirades. The film is bookended by interviews with the real Traudl Junge, in which she discusses her inability to forgive herself for her involvement in the regime and the fact that her being young and naive did not absolve her as Sophie Scholl was the same age and resisted the Nazis. These interviews are crucial to our understanding of Frau Junge, who is depicted as a very sympathetic and quite a vulnerable character. However, I felt the greatest sympathy for the children, both the members of the Hitler Youth who were so deluded that they thought that they could actually make a difference in the Battle of Berlin and the six Goebbels children who were murdered by their frighteningly fanatical parents so they would not grow up in a world with Nazism. Their eldest child, Helga, was twelve at the time of her death and was the only one to realise that their parents intended to kill them. Her attempts to resist are particularly harrowing. The Goebbels children's death scene is the most disturbing and upsetting in the entire film.<br/><br/>Juliane Köhler gives a fantastic performance as Eva Braun, who arranges a party for Hitler's birthday in a textbook example of fiddling while Rome burns. However, her forced grins seems to hide an inner misery as at one point she admits that she hardly even knows Hitler after 15 years. The film has a very strong cast overall such as Thomas Kretschmann (probably the best known cast member in the English speaking world) as Braun's cynical opportunist brother-in-law Hermann Fegelein, Ulrich Matthes as Goebbels, Corinna Harfouch who is beyond wonderful in the comparatively small but pivotal role of his wife Magda, Christian Berkel as Ernst-Günther Schenck, André Hennicke as General Mohnke, Michael Mendl - one of the few people in the film who was actually alive in 1945 - as General Weidling, Birgit Minichmayr as Gerda Christian and Gerald Alexander Held as Walther Hewel. The Hitler Youth member Peter Kranz is the only notable fictional character. As regards the historical characters, the film's epilogue gives the fate of all those who did not die in the film. The exact fate of Hitler's cook Constanze Manziarly is unknown as she disappeared without a trace after leaving the bunker but she is last seen holding a capsule of poison, a perfectly reasonable speculation on the part of the filmmakers.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a powerful and thoughtful treatment of the material. My only criticism is that ten or so minutes could have been trimmed after Hitler committed suicide as the last half an hour occasionally lags. The film was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film Oscar but I think that it deserved a Best Picture nomination. I also think that Bruno Ganz should have been nominated for Best Actor but perhaps a performance which depicts Hitler as a real person was not to Hollywood's taste."

","""Der Untergang"" (2004) translated as ""Downfall"" for international market is lengthy (almost 3 hours) story about last days in Hitler's underground bunker when he was surrounded with only the most faithful followers as Berlin was being trashed and destroyed by advancing Russian army. The whole world is falling down on him, Third Reich is obviously only a dream that he can't let go,his own soldiers are completely destroyed (only soldiers left to protect Berlin are kids recruited as ""Hitler Jugend"") and even people in the bunker are only here because they have no other alternative. Yes, movie is German and based on several war memoirs of survivors who were there - historian Joachim Fest actually wrote a book ""Inside of Hitler's Bunker"" and he helped with making a script true to reality, but this is only part of the reason why the movie is such a strong experience. I have read a lot about this and all those scenes, sentences and even gestures actually happened (when disillusioned with his own generals, Hitler goes to congratulate to teenagers who are still fighting on the streets of Berlin and awkwardly grabs boy's cheek) - and than, there is acting. Director Oliver Hirschbiegel didn't just go for visual similarity though this has been achieved and can be checked with shocking results, he has calmly and objectively showed psychological turmoil these people experienced, their fears, refusals to accept the reality and nightmare that became their lives. Swiss actor Bruno Ganz is so perfect that watching him is chilling, almost scary experience - from the voice mannerisms to hand shaking to pathological switch between rage, illogical monologues, charming politeness and racist ramblings he IS the man crashing down completely. There is the whole team of excellent actors who were used to great effect even though their roles appear small - Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) is beautiful, submissive and forcefully cheerful like she is pushing herself and everybody around to enjoy, dance and have good time (just one more cigarette) but than she sits alone in front of the mirror and in a stunning, wordless scene watches herself, gazing at the reality and death approaching. The whole Goebbels family re-creating suicide exactly as it happened, with soldiers waiting around the corner to burn their bodies. Young, naive secretary (Alexandra Maria Lara as Traudl Junge) hoping until the last moment that this is not the end and not understanding the seriousness of situation. Just watch the face of Albert Speer (brilliant actor Heino Ferch) as he listen her naive questions - he says not a word and just looks at her. These moments when characters actually don't talk, just a glance or look, it says it all. <br/><br/>I was not surprised that movie was nominated for ""Oscar"" because it is so powerful, but I was surprised that some critics find the movie ""too sympathetic"" to Hitler - contrary to what most of the reviews so forcefully argue about, I see it not as glorification of Hitler but as a artful re-creation of true-life story and magnificent piece of psychological portrait, after all the movie does not show Hitler as a victorious or in any sense positive character, he is broken down man lost in his own illusions of grandeur and has no feeling of guilt whatsoever (he finds his war against Jews his biggest accomplishment and does not care for civilian life losses, dismissing it as unimportant - ""they have chosen us, so they deserve it"") . Brilliant, brilliant movie and I recommend it to everybody - and this is coming from somebody who usually don't care for war movies."
"robsta23","8","0","2","13 July 2015"," Short of Greatness
","Downfall is very good, but it wasn't great as I expected it to be, especially with all the hype it gets on IMDb. We have a unique look at WWII, seeing it through Hitler's eyes and being more about Hitler losing than the Allies winning as many WWII films do.<br/><br/>I don't know much about the 2005 Oscars from memory, but Bruno Ganz played Hitler so well he should have received an Oscar nomination if he did not. If they can give an Oscar to Marion Cotillard for playing Edith Piaf in a foreign film then they can certainly at least nominate Bruno Ganz for this performance in a foreign film. Hitler's brutality came across clearly with Ganz's various tempter tantrums he had to exhibit, while maintaining the integrity of Hitler as a leader, being a quiet and polite (yet mentally ill) man when all is well, doing what he believes is best for his country in the moment. It may seem weird that I'm practically sympathizing for Hitler, but the film portrays him as a caring individual; it is scary and strange at the same time.<br/><br/>I know the title is ""Downfall,"" so it deals with the OVERALL downfall of Germany in WWII, but there's something not right with killing Hitler 2/3 of the way through the film. I know this film accurately portrays what happened, but there's just something not right having Hitler's death be well before the conclusion of the film. If anything, this was kind of an early climax of the film, with about 40 minutes of falling action/resolution.<br/><br/>While this movie may have made me sympathize for Hitler, it made me sympathize with other Nazi's (or some children) even more since many Nazi soldiers promised Hitler they would commit suicide, and the children of Goebbels are killed in their sleep by their mother - very chilling scene.<br/><br/>Finally, I understand the point of endings of ""true stories"" where they give you information through text describing how people turned out later, but I'm honestly not going to remember many of the characters/their names, so I'm not going to remember what was said about them at the end of the film either. This is a good character study, but I have seen plenty of better WWII films."

","This is undoubtedly a priceless work of art. And a impinging one. The world knows who Hitler was to this day. He is perhaps the most famous man in history.

History is written by the victors, & they may dispatch a figure's name & reputation how they see fit. <br/><br/>This film gives you the privilege you crave to reconcile the hatred & insanity to a mere mortal man to judge for yourself. There are many pivotal scenes that require your full attention not only to detail but to the undercurrents of everyone's emotional loyalties. One scene shows us that Hitler refuses to give any empathy for his people who are by now suffering the worst. In fact, he reassures that they must perish for their lack of loyalty, & where loyalty is concerned, the ultimate sacrifice must be made. None can be spared. And yet he sheds a tear for himself in the very next scene when he hears of betrayal from a recreant.<br/><br/>Hitler was a mad man always on the borderline of insanity, & every time you are convinced he has passed such a threshold, he suddenly opines a statement of great vision & understanding of his predicament. You almost have to admire him for such a key mind at times & yet you know what he is doing is utterly wrong. <br/><br/>His people in the city of Berlin are suffering all around in the midst of prolonged war whilst he scoffs down platefuls of food in comfort. The man disgusts you as he should, yet this thread of respect you bare is a dangerous one. Couple this with the almost certain omitted information as to his more benevolent accruement which arises intermittently & you begin to build a picture of a man. Not a monster.<br/><br/>Adolf was either a weak man for his fear of kindness or he was strong for his partisan devotion towards cruelty. Who is fit to judge?

"classicalsteve","10","0","1","8 May 2015"," The Crumbling of the Reich During Its Last Days from Hitler's Bunker: The Ideology Was More Difficult to Topple than Germany's Armies
","According to the events of the film, which I assume are mostly accurate with some liberal aspects for cinematic effect, the ideology of the Nazi regime took much longer and was far more difficult to crumble than the buildings, infrastructure and military operations of the Third Reich. This film not only takes the viewer inside the bunker where Adolph Hitler and Eva Braun committed suicide in late April, 1945, it takes us inside the heads of the most loyal Nazis. And what we learn about these people is as terrifying in many ways as what the Nazis did to millions of people across Europe outside the confines of Hitler's final residence.<br/><br/>The structure begins and ends with an interview as cinematic bookends. A real-life survivor of the Reich who had been one of Hitler's private secretaries during the final years of the Third Reich, Traudl Junge, appears on screen. Now an old woman, she describes how she was enthralled to receive the opportunity to become a member of Hitler's inner circle. At the end, she alludes to the fact she didn't think for herself. <br/><br/>The narrative scenes begin in 1942 with Traudl Junge among a group of aspiring young women wishing to work for Adolph Hitler (Bruno Ganz), dictator and self-proclaimed savior of Germany. Not surprising, Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) is chosen for the job by the Führer himself. Then the film cuts to April 20, 1945, Hitler's 56th birthday. It's inevitable to everyone involved that not only is Germany going to lose the war against the allies, but Berlin is only days away from being taken by the Russian Army. Hitler's inner circle, including Heinrich Himmler and Joseph Goebbels, insist that it's time for him, Eva Braun, and the rest of his inner circle to evacuate Berlin. Hitler refuses, claiming it would be a sign of cowardice and surrender. Before going underground, he awards Iron Crosses to members of ""Hitler's Youth"". Then he moves his operation into an underground bunker where he and his closest associates will try to keep the Reich together during its final days.<br/><br/>The events which transpire in this film are some of the most disturbing and devastating as any film about World War II and the Reich I've ever seen. While all the residents of the bunker, save the children of Goebbels, know the war and the Reich are coming to an anti-climactic but tragic end, they cling to their ideology like moths in front of a lighted bug zapper. They must have known in their heart-of-hearts that this was not going to end in their favor. However, they can't imagine life without the Reich and their Führer. He had become the acknowledged decision-maker, philosopher, and thinker for the entire country. In several scenes, the people around him acknowledge over and over again that only Hitler can make the decisions, no one else. And if they question him, or, God forbid, refuse his orders, they are labeled traitors, even in the face of impending destruction.<br/><br/>Barely a week and a half before Hitler and Eva Braun will commit suicide, Hitler is still barking orders, arresting wayward soldiers, and sentencing perceived traitorous officers and AWOL soldiers to death, as if he is still in charge of his country, even though the allies have by now taken most of Germany, and the Russians are on the outskirts of Berlin, a few kilometers away. He rants and raves to the highest officers in his command, chastising them for not winning the war. He instructs his officers to mobilize army units in other parts of the country, even though they have all been defeated by the allies. He continues with his maps and strategies, like a chess player contemplating his next move, even though his king has been surrounded and near checkmate. However, surrender is beyond him, even at the price of more killing and destruction. The real eye-opener is not that Hitler wouldn't let go of his ideology, but those around him couldn't bring themselves to stop following his orders. <br/><br/>In his final days and hours, according the film, Hitler never wavered from his ultimate ideology, even though the ideology itself is what led to the final demise of the Reich. His ideology for Germany was relatively simple: a national socialist government in which Hitler himself is absolute ruler without question or pause, and ethnic minorities, particularly Jews, Poles, and Gypsies have no place and must be swept aside. These ideas proved immoral and ruinous. <br/><br/>It's not surprising that Hitler failed to see his ideology not only meant the destruction of Europe and the deaths and suffering of millions, but it also meant the near destruction of Germany itself. What is surprising is that those around him couldn't see passed Hitler's madness. During many scenes, high-ranking members of his inner circle could have refused his orders to save the German people, but they did not. They were so hypnotized by his rhetoric and ideology they had no concept to believe they could make decisions to save Germany and deny the Führer his power. Most follow him to the very end, and the price some of them pay for this loyalty is almost unimaginable. Goebbels's wife in a moving scene breaks down because she can't bear the thought of the country being without its socialist ideology and dictator. <br/><br/>The tragedy of Germany and those most loyal to him and the Nazi cause was a blind refusal to see how their ideology was self-destructive rather than life-affirming. They believed in one leader who would do all the thinking for them and therefore they couldn't and shouldn't think for themselves. Such a tragedy that that leader happened to be Adolph Hitler. At one point, Goebbels says he has no sympathy for the country, since it was the country itself which allowed these madmen into power in the first place."
"bbewnylorac","8","0","1","19 April 2015"," Excellent film
","A very well made film that dares to present Hitler and those close to him in the dying days of the Third Reich as human. But it must be said, it's quite chilling to watch him dressing down his generals whose men are dying for Germany in the thousands, and criticising failed military moves of his own making, as his world literally falls down around him in the Berlin bunker. Also, when he's told that civilians including children are dying because he won't surrender or negotiate with the Allies, he doesn't care. The film effectively portrays the banality of evil, as Hitler lovingly strokes his dog, and as his girlfriend Eva Braun rather manically smiles her way through the crisis. It's strange to watch an impeccably groomed Magda Goebbels calmly poisoning her six sleeping children to death because she doesn't want them to live in a world without National Socialism. It's so surreal it's hard to believe it actually did happen in real life. The film also dares to present some of the generals, secretaries and senior Nazis as having compassion and emotions. I found that quite confronting. Special mention here to the searing intelligence and courage portrayed by Christian Berkel as the apparently good-hearted Professor Schenck who finds himself confronting rogue death squads and amputating limbs on the frontline in the dying hours. The film doesn't shirk from the utter bloodiness of the destruction of Berlin that Hitler is bringing down upon himself. The film is wrongly promoted as narrated by Hitler's secretary, Traudl Junge, although it is based on her riveting book describing her time working for Hitler. In the film, Junge is very much a side character, and doesn't seem to do much, other than react with horror to what's going on. I guess the film's subject matter overwhelmed that angle."

","The name Adolf Hitler signifies the embodiment of evil to everyone born since the Third Reich collapsed. Most of us are used to seeing Hitler as a raving lunatic standing behind microphones. But what was it like to know the man personally? Oliver Hirschbiegel's movie ""Der Untergang"" (""Downfall"" in English) is based on the memoirs of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge. It focuses mainly on Hitler's final few days alive in the Führerbunker, where he hid with a number of acolytes as the Third Reich imploded. Bruno Ganz plays Hitler, forced to realize that Germany is facing certain defeat (and he looks as if he's developing Parkinson's). Almost as monstrous as Nazism's founder is Magda Goebbels, who casually poisons her own children and proceeds to play cards as if nothing has happened.<br/><br/>The opening and closing scenes feature interviews with an elderly Traudl Junge, who reveals that the prospect of being Hitler's secretary excited her, and that she had no idea what the Nazis were doing across Europe. Indeed, only a small percentage of Germany's population ever joined the Nazi Party but got blinded to what the Nazis were doing. The point is that this collection of men in Hitler's inner circle - Krebs, Schädle, Burgdorf, Högl, etc - may have seemed like calm individuals, but they were purveyors of evil. Nazi Germany was not a hellish place for people who did what they were told, but was horrifying for the ""others"".<br/><br/>""Downfall"" is a movie that everyone should see."

General's looks on their face,when they have no way but to send their soldiers to death trap made me speechless . Alexandra Maria Lara's acting as Hitler's secretary was also very good.At the end of the movie we can see the interview of real 'Traudl Junge' , which makes the story and acting more realistic.

","Downfall tells the story of Hitler's last days through the eyes of a real person - his secretary; a young girl plucked from obscurity. This film sends such a powerful message to the future, it's difficult to describe.<br/><br/>It's said that those who forget the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them and yet, we are faced with new fascists like Hitler almost everyday. <br/><br/>As others have noted, this is based on historical fact, and while being German production, it views history through the eyes of a historian - and not the usual, rose-tinted criticism that could be levelled at many other historical re-tellings.<br/><br/>Without doubt, this is one of the most powerful anti-war films that has ever been made; or perhaps, even could be made. Exposing the brutality of war; and the unlikely compassion of a man the world has rightly come to despise.<br/><br/>It's a visual treat with Hitler's role never excused or forgiven; a portrait of a man crazed with psychopathic tendencies and yet, apparently capable of warm emotion: which makes him all the more real and all the more terrifying. It's left an uncomfortable impression on me; I feel simultaneously sick and awed at the same time. <br/><br/>Politicians and political pundits should be made to watch this over and over until it sinks in.

","Saw this long pending film that had been kept aside as I believed that this would have been a monotonous account of Hitler. But finally, did see it coz I had wanted to write something on a revolt. <br/><br/>Now this film, adds nothing much in terms of differentiating Hitler and neither does it portrays him in a sympathetic, empathetic light and thus the monotony still prevails. This gruesome criminal still is shown in the same light of what he have learnt of him since our childhood. Having said that, it brings in a closer perspective of him from the witness of Frau Junge who worked as his secretary in the last days. She seems to have had great belief in Hitler and that even in the hopeless days, expects Hitler to turn the tide and bring a win to Germany. The monster only in few scenes is humane but again when he utters that he is proud of the Jewish killings, the monter returns.<br/><br/>Admiration I do have on the account that it so grippingly presented with so many characters all have a different view on many things and letting us know few unknown German history things. We know the end, its a matter of time for that to be shown as well but the way it was done and the entire movie was shot is commendable.<br/><br/>More than anything, I have not seen a better portrayal of Hitler in any film till date and also never saw a better gripping depiction of the world war specifically final days of the war. I can clearly say this coz neither I paused nor got bored at any instance all through the film and watched it in one go.<br/><br/>This deserves a watch to see how it is enacted by all the actors and for the profound authenticity that clearly depicts how Germany really was. All the technical departments did their job well. It's 4/5 from me for a really well made film that despite having monotony to it, was showed in a tight vein."

","The story rolls out very nicely, Having most of the scenes done in the bunker setting makes this movie prone to being boring at some point of its more than two hour duration. But this movie handled it well by depicting striking images and great shocking moments. What's lacking in my opinion is that the war scenes don't really get the real war aura, especially after we see what's done in Saving Private Ryan. But then again, the main focus of Hitler's surroundings on his final days at the bunker really captivated me as I watched this movie. Bruno Ganz acted out nicely in this movie. Before I see this movie, I have seen parodies of the angry Hitler scenes here and there and I wondered what movie was those from. Now that I found the original movie, it makes sense why people choose Ganz's Hitler character as the closest to the real person."

","Downfall is very well acted but hard to watch. It could have been trimmed down by 10 minutes or so. Since its focus on a lot of the high ranking nazi's there is no real sympathy for anybody expect a few of the young kids and the dog! It is a disturbing film to see all these people blindly following Hitler. Bruno Ganz really impressed me as Hitler,he did an amazing job. It really felt like watching the real Hitler. Juliane Köhler was wonderful as Eva as well. It is quite a violent movie but I think in a movie like this it's needed. The scene where the children were poisoned was very hard to watch,especially as the oldest seemed to know what her mother was giving her. I do think having some prior knowledge of the last days of world war 2 and who the high ranking nazi are and what they did helps."

","Words can barely describe the power of this film. I have a strong constitution for depictions of violence and emotional trauma, but 'Der Untergang' was utterly harrowing in its intensity.<br/><br/>There was a certain scene involving Magda Goebbels which made me want to leave the room and hug my baby daughter. Those of you who have already seen the film will know what I'm referring to.<br/><br/>I am in total awe of Ganz. His depiction of Hitler is utterly believable. I have read that he spent four months studying Hitler's mannerisms and accent in order to achieve perfection in the role. This is true professionalism.<br/><br/>When the Russians finally arrived they looked and sounded incredibly 'foreign' to me (more so than they would normally, if that makes sense) and I struggled to understand why.<br/><br/>I finally realised it was because I had spent so much time immersed in the world of the Germans that I had begun to identify with them. Consequently, I found myself viewing the Russians through 'German' eyes.<br/><br/>I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but it struck me as a testament to the brilliance of the cast, their acting, and the superb combination of direction and cinematography.<br/><br/>I rate 'Der Untergang' at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as an appropriately Teutonic 9/10 on IMDb."
"JaydoDre","8","0","2","13 December 2013"," Surprisingly interesting with so little happening
","You must have heard the synopsis already: The movie takes place during the last few days of the fall of Berlin and concentrates on the people in and around the Hitler's bunker.<br/><br/>This is not the most exciting premise, but the setting is no doubt a small treasure chest for drama. Do the makers dig into that treasure chest? Yes, they do. <br/><br/>The cast, consisting mostly of actors not well known outside of Germany, does an excellent job with the roles, especially Bruno Ganz as Hitler.<br/><br/>Hitler switches between hope, delusion, anger and despair as his staff hopelessly tries to find some clarity and a future in the man who clearly can no longer be of any use to them.<br/><br/>The suffering outside the bunker and the ever encroaching action of war are faded into the background to give more attention to the relationship between the largely isolated people inside, who are trying to cling to the system that is no longer there or come to terms with the truth that is upon them.<br/><br/>The humanity that these German actors have been able to give to their characters is palpable in each gaze, word and grimace and it is understandable why this movie got so much criticism. Instead of portraying the situation in the Anglo-American politically correct terms and separating the good guys from the bad guys, the makers have instead portrayed everyone as real humans (which I noticed is common in German films). They even ensured a good physical resemblance of the people being portrayed. This is refreshingly sober and reminds of Stalingrad (directed by Joseph Vilsmaier) - another good German war drama. Der Untergang feels like the most realistic portrayal of the situation in question.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I can't say I will remember much about this movie beyond a few of its characters. For many people this will be enough, but for this reviewer the experience of being stuck in a room with a bunch of officers who for several days cannot make up their mind on what to do is...a little pointless."
"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","1","9 October 2013"," Stellar cast revives an era long gone
","Let me start this review by pointing out my favorite scenes of the film: It starts and closes with interview footage from the real Traudl Junge, Hitler's secretary who's portrayed later on by Alexandra Maria Lara. It's as interesting as devastating to watch this old woman discuss her perception of existence or lack of guilt when it comes to her role in the Third Reich. It immediately gets you into the subject and mood and they really couldn't have started the film more convincingly. Next would be the surreal dance sequence instigated by Eva Braun and Köhler's ""I WANT TO DANCE"" is as bizarre as it gets in that situation with bombs hitting everywhere nearby. The comment of Lara's character and her collapse afterward summarize the ambiance perfectly and game me massive chills. Next would be Corinna Harfouch playing Magda Goebbels, the ""mother of the nation"" and her scenes with her children towards the end. Heartbreaking and so well-acted. And then, there is of course Bruno Ganz. I'm not sure if it's his very best performance, but it's certainly his most famous and it's good to see him getting the recognition for a lifetime of great acting. He has many good scenes here and delivers one of the most intriguing portrayals of a significant historic character. Of course, there's his angry speech to Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf about the attack from Steiner which was an order and should have taken place in any case, the one you may have seen spoofed with English fake subtitles quite a few times.<br/><br/>The film is probably the most famous one from Oliver Hirschbiegel, who gloriously failed with Naomi Watts' Diana biopic just recently. That came as a bit of a surprise, but then again, if you look at ""Downfall"", not that much. Not to diminish his efforts, but the real strengths of the film lie somewhere else, not necessarily in his direction. Here, we get one of the finest ensemble performances in the history of cinema that truly made the movie and maybe also made up for flaws in the script. Ganz, Lara, Harfouch, Köhler and Matthes are nothing short of excellent and you could probably find at least another five performances who elevate the material considerably. Christian Berkel is just one example. Away from the Führerbunker, we follow his path for a big part of the film and this is where we see the harm that is really done and does not really make it through the thick walls of the bunker: the casualties, the injured, the children and there was one scene in wwhich his character enters a room full of old people, basically all left behind to die. That one hit me particularly hard.<br/><br/>Every German should have seen this film at least once and from the large quantity of (sometimes underwhelming) WWII movies, this is one that shouldn't be missed by foreign viewers either. And this statement comes from somebody who considers war maybe his least favorite genre. It's entertaining, emotional, historically significant and packed with quality acting the way it should always be. I recommend this movie a lot. It's a prime example of coming to terms appropriately, a film that never sacrifices relevance for showiness and manages to avoid the slightest ounce of boredom in its very long 150 minutes."

I might as well consider this Hitler to be very humane compared to the real Adolf Hitler. He can still be angry, quite so. But his anger is more fun to experience too. By the way, I may enjoy his anger.Many of the scenes are very well put together and notable. The movie has also given a lot of character to Nazis. They have lovable quirks and are useful in a pinch.

","One of those rare movies that takes us into the Third Reich, this film focusing on its final days. A German production from the actors to the composing, this film holds back nothing and shows the events just as they unfolded. As an avid watcher of documentaries, I've actually compared the archive footage and film print, and to be honest at times the only difference of course is the clarity. Watching it all, I got the strange feeling that this was what the end of humanity would like: Optimists never truly giving in, a rain of fire from the sky, and the broken down idealists finally accepting their fate. The portrayal of Hitler here is just that; a broken man losing control. I wouldn't go so far as to call the film sympathetic to the Fuehrer, but it does portray him as a defeated visionary. Bruno Ganz played the man with sheer excellence.<br/><br/>Also, the film shows what the desperation of war brings out in people. Even with the German defeat immanent blood runs through the streets of Berlin like a river. It's a gruesome reality that at times feels like a nightmare. The acting is Grade A material and you can feel how each person is feeling as their world crumbles around them. The film neither praises nor condemns what is seen on screen; the events simply unfold.

","Oliver Hirchbiegel's Downfall (Der Untergang) offers a spectacular view at the final days of one of history's most notorious madmen. Based on the accounts of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge, Downfall unflinchingly depicts the end of the Nazi leader's life prior to the German surrender during World War II. Lead actor Bruno Ganz is easily the highlight of the film—he manages to be both captivating and frightening in his portrayal of a desperate Adolf Hitler. The rest of the cast performs admirably as well. They really draw you into the events of the film with universally believable performances.<br/><br/>The cinematography and production design work together to create an interesting setting for the events of the film. The cramped spaces and narrow hallways of the Berlin bunker combined with the tension felt by each of its occupants really sell the viewer on the volatility and grim reality of this environment. The film's music also proves to be memorable and appropriate.<br/><br/>Downfall is an exceptional war film despite not really focusing on any actual battles of WWII. Instead, it delves into the mind of the war's most heinous criminal and explores the internal conflicts within. Downfall was nominated for an Oscar in the Best Foreign Language Film category, and it certainly deserves that honor."

","A movie about the end of the Third Reich......from Germany no less.<br/><br/>The film is in German so I saw it with subtitles. Once at home, and once in a German restaurant in suburban Tokyo. No...really. The proprietors said it was brilliantly acted and truthful. <br/><br/>The best part of this film is that it sugar coated nothing. The head Nazis got no slack here. History has already taught us this but seeing Hitler slowly lose his mind and watching the Generals decide whether to save their own skin or stay loyal makes GREAT character study. Also the civilians in the bunker too. A classic moral dilemma.<br/><br/>Herr Ganz absolutely ROCKED as Der Fuhrer. You saw the frustration at his lack of success, anger when the Generals didn't obey, and lunacy at trying to get shredded, out numbered armies to go after the Soviet juggernaut knocking on Berlin's door.<br/><br/>You also saw the infighting among the Reichsters. A lot of this makes few history books. It showed who the real sadists were. No one wants to die but they know the little madman won't allow weakness. One by one high rankers run off. And all Hitler can do is yell and order another execution.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes in the bomb shelters may be hard to watch. Hysterical women and children fighting to save what little they have. Old men with looks of utter despair, that is when they weren't getting shot as traitors because they refused to let them selves get shanghaied into a suicide mission. And the civilians running from the final barrage in Berlin. Gives one another view of this dark time. I've seen real footage of this so I'll attest to the factualness. <br/><br/>Also some of the base level surgery (amputations really) in said bunker, despite the briefest of glimpses.....will NOT be easy to stomach.<br/><br/>And you also see what kind of a subhuman Dr. J Goebbels REALLY was. Let's be honest here....the guy was a cold-hearted mutant. And Ulrich Matthes was BRILLIANT in the role. He deserved Oscar consideration at least. <br/><br/>The film was well acted by everybody. And kudos to the German filmmakers for their honesty and artistic excellence. But be warned....we know what happens remember?

So close that, as that destiny had surfaced as the doom of the German people, it was generally accepted that the end of Hitler would also mean the end of the German people as well.<br/><br/>This movie is credited with successfully picturing that situation and the ensuing reactions of Hitler's entourage while the population of Berlin suffers and has to hold out for their benefit.<br/><br/>In Germany, ""Der Untergang"" has been criticised for failing to deliver a well rounded setting of the plot. There have been complains about the omission of footage of extermination camps or war atrocities. But this is where this movie truly excels: The justification of the characters' ever growing angst and subsequent actions is left in the fog of war. Because right there, at the edge of the abyss, it does not matter any more."

","This is an excellent foreign film. Unless you are an expert on period German weapons and vehicles you probably won't notice the few goofs listed on the previous page. Adding to the realism, the actors speak German and there is no over-acting. The mood of the film mirrors the dark desperation felt by Germany's infamous National Socialist government elite, during the last dreary days a war that would destroy that superpower. You might even feel sympathetic to a few individuals who realize there are impending consequences they will not escape for their involvement with the Nazis, and yet others who exhibit rabid devotion to Hitler and his evil policies that caused the second World War. If you ever wondered what happened to Hitler up till his last day, this is the movie for you."

","I became aware of this film through the many comedy videos on YouTube and wanted to see the whole film after seeing the great reviews it received. For many, The Nazi's are known as the scourge of the 20th century and while this film doesn't take any position on their actions, you actually find yourself feeling sorry for them, which is a first in my book and I would imagine others will derive the same sentiments from the film. The thing that brings on these feelings are the moments when the illusions of grandeur fall away for the characters and the realization that all they believed in is lost.<br/><br/>While I have never been in a situation like those in the film, you can relate to their peril by imagining moments in your life when beliefs you once had change and you realize the reality you saw was a skewed illusion and you're stuck rethinking your ideals and the heartbreak that goes along with being disillusioned.<br/><br/>I would suggest this film to anyone and would consider this a high quality movie and seeing it now makes me understand why it received all the acclaim it did. With all the garbage movies that are released today, do yourself a favor and rent or buy this film because its rare when quality productions like this are released."

You'll giggle at that scene, but the other scenes are quite well done, and make you forget for a moment that Hitler was indeed a monster. Here he comes off like a sympathetic figure.<br/><br/>Quite graphic in its way, it's best to watch this film in the original German with subtitles.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film are uncomfortable to watch, such as children being used as cannon fodder in Berlin's defense, or Magda Goebbels poisoning her own children rather than let them live in a Nazi-free world.

"hanvl","9","0","1","16 March 2011"," Incrediblle acting
","Story of this film evolves around the ending of the Second world word and is told but former Hitler secretary than twenty years old. Majority of the story takes place deep underground in the Hitler bunker. But it also shows fighting in streets and the fanaticism of some of the defenders, but also suffering of the normal people. The main story line is about Hitler and his incapacity to accept the inevitable, but there are number of smaller stories – of a SS doctor or a young Hitler Jungend boy. Those side stories are not bad but some of them are unnecessary and it seems to me that they have no proper bonding with the film. The film is gripping and good, but it would just normal good war movie if it weren't for Bruno Gang. His depiction of Hitler takes this film to the upper level and failure to even nominate him for Academy Award shows there is little credibility in them. He is just breathtaking, he really is Hitler. The speed in which he changes from a normal soft spoken guy to raving maniac is incredible. He plays Hitler with great strength and people can only think about how it is possible that this maniac could get to the country leadership. But this Hitler also has good sides, he is 3 dimensional and not flat caricature like in other movies. This makes him even more frightening because he is more human than ever. I can recommend this film to everyone, but be sure to watch it in Garman."
"Andy-296","9","0","1","12 January 2011"," The definitive film about Hitler's last days
","A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime, centered on the Fuhrer's bunker, from his 56th birthday on April 20th, 1945 to the fall of Berlin on May 8th. This is certainly a very compelling story (certainly one of the most important stories of the 20th century) and while it has been filmed before, it is the first time it's done in the German language. This makes the movie look far more authentic than when someone like Anthony Hopkins or Alec Guinness played an English speaking Fuhrer. And it has a neat framing device in the story as seen by Hitler's young secretary Traudl Junge. The more compelling parts of the movie, for me, are not the war scenes, but the discussions Hitler has with his closest aides and military staff: Jodl, Krebs, Burgdorf, Keitel, Speer, Wiedling, Mohnke. Most of them know the situation is extremely critical, but they are reluctant to tell the Fuhrer, who is increasingly in denial, promising final victory even after the Russians are only a few kilometers away from his headquarters. Only Goebbels remains completely wedded to the Fuhrer's autistic vision. Even Himmler and Goering, realizing the desperate situation of the Reich try to unsuccessfully arrange negotiations with the allies. These negotiations never got to anything, but Hitler is furious when he learns about them, and consider them both traitors. Bruno Ganz is brilliant as Hitler, but the movie is considerably helped by the strengths of its many characters. For example, Fegelein, who as Himmler's adjutant, tries to convince Hitler and the other people in the bunker that it's best to leave Berlin. Fegelein meets an untimely fate and has become the subject of many internet gags (more on that later). Or Eva Braun, portrayed here as the ultimate dumb blond totally subservient to his man. Or Magda Goebbels, who can be both cold and hysterical. Perhaps the only character whose portrayal is unsatisfying is Joseph Goebbels, since he is played by an actor in a heavy and ridiculous white make up. Also strange is the decision to have Goering appear in only one scene and without a speaking role, just looking impatiently at his watch. I remember that when the movie came out, some critics thought the movie was pro Nazi, in that it understood Hitler too much. I think with time it is clear that this charge is ridiculous. This movie clearly shows the delusion of Hitler and the terrible philosophy of the Nazis: no compassion and ultimate indifference to the fate of their own people. One criticism is that perhaps the movie was a bit too long: most of the scenes involving the bald doctor in the hospital or the child soldiers could have been cut and the movie would have been better. Of course, by now the movie is well known by the hundreds (if not thousands) of parody videos in the Internet where the original audio is retained but the subtitles are changed so that Hitler and his aides end up arguing about a lot of ridiculous and anachronistic subjects (like computer programs, sport teams, pop stars, whatever). Those videos are sometimes very funny (and they have been surprisingly resilient in time given the short attention span of fads in the web), but if the movie on which they are based was not powerful, they couldn't have thrived as they did."
"pekinman","10","0","1","25 October 2010"," A great anti-war film
","I can't see anything controversial about Oliver Hirschbiegel's film Der Untergang (Downfall). Perhaps some find it so because it has deeply human underpinnings on which the entire story rests. We all know Hitler was a monstrous mediocrity as a politician and some, who knew him personally, claim he was a soft-spoken, cultured and intelligent man who became something else when he became Das Führer for public events. That last group is usually dismissed as unrepentant beasts and nothing they say holds any water with the popular media.<br/><br/>This film does not dismiss those who had not entirely unfavorable views of Adolf Hitler. I suppose that is what has enraged some people. If you can get passed the powerful emotional knee-jerk reaction to anything related to the man you will find a deeply moving story of the frailty and imperfection of our species. Hircshbiegel does not sugar-coat Hitler's manic personality but neither does he show a Hitler who goes insane and blows his brains out in a last-ditch panic. The methodical and precise aspect of Hitler's mind is on exhibit here and that alone is frightening. At one point he holds forth about the sin of compassion, to his way of thinking. Compassion only protects the weak and, like the apes, the human being must crush the weaker if the race is to survive. This is brutal stuff and unpleasant to hear let alone contemplate. <br/><br/>This film sheds a new light on the last days in the bunker in Berlin before the war ended. There are many powerful scenes that stick in the mind. This story is based upon the memories of Trudl Junge, Hitler's last secretary. You could possibly call this film Hitler from a feminine point of view but that wouldn't be entirely accurate. Young German women during the Third Reich who committed themselves to The Cause of National Socialism were clear- eyed and truthful, except perhaps with themselves. The real Trudl Junge admits at the end of the film, as an old lady, that she was wrong to not have known about the murders of millions of foreigners as she calls them and that youth was no excuse for Not Finding Out.<br/><br/>There is nothing neo-Nazi about this film. It isn't that kind of thing. Downfall is one of the greatest anti-war movies there is. The overwhelming tragedy that is any war hits with great force here. The personal events are harrowing. In the case of Magda Goebbels unbelievably and unbearably so as she must kill her six youngest children with her own hand, using a sleeping draft and then cyanide capsules. It is a unique and unforgettable sequence of scenes. Corinna Harouch (Magda Goebbels) turns in one of those quietly volcanic performances that are rarely scene in film. <br/><br/>Bruno Ganz plays Hitler as a second cousin to Nosferatu, his hands constantly twitching behind his hunched-over shoulders. I am no Hitler scholar but I've read a fair amount of literature on the era and about people loosely associated with the inner sanctum and I don't recall anyone mentioning this physical twitch of his. More than one person has mentioned that near the end Hitler was zonked on drugs most of the time. He is not shown as a morphine addict in this film but as a puritanical vegan who drank nothing but bottled water. There's food for thought.<br/><br/>Alexandra Maria Lara plays Trudl Junge and she is a magnetic personality who quietly carries the film on her lovely shoulders. Her story is told with elegance and subtly conveys the imperceptible vortex of apocalypse without the use of a blasting militaristic score or scene after scene of carnage, though there is a fair amount of that, but it is never gratuitous.<br/><br/>There are moments of utter rest and calm and beauty but they are few and far between. A very wonderful scene happens when Eva Braun (Juliane Köhler) takes Trudl and Gerda, another of Hiter's secretaries, out of the bunker during a lull in the artillery bombardment of Berlin. The three young women sit quietly on stone benches amidst newly blossoming bulbs in a courtyard above the bunker. A melodious bird sings idyllically in the trees and the sky is blue and the sun is shining. Normalcy. Then the sirens begin and the cigarettes are carefully stubbed out and the women retreat back underground, for the last time in Eva Braun's case.<br/><br/>The film is full of wonderful scenes and episodes and I found myself forgetting it was about Hitler at all. Perhaps that too is what enrages some people. We mustn't ever forget Hitler.<br/><br/>Well, how can we?<br/><br/>The cinematography, music, costumes, claustrophobic sets and the entire cast of fine German actors, beautifully but unobtrusively directed, is a fine work of art and should be seen by all film and 20th century European history buffs."

","When I saw this film, I was very impressed by the role of Bruno Ganz playing Adolf Hitler. I think they're not many people who would like to play one of the most insane dictators of human history. But Bruno Ganz did a great job doing so. He played his role so convincing you might think Hitler was exactly like that. He was not just mad and insane all the time, but also showed human traits so now and then. To the end, the film becomes more and more dramatic and really gives you the feeling you are inside that bunker as an invisible spectator. You're experiencing the last desperate moments of Hitler and his military leaders finally resulting in their suicide. One of the scenes which struck me most, was the one in which Hitler thanked the Hitler-Jugend for their bravery and effort. I recently saw the original footage and it showed great accuracy and similarity with the film. Some believe this film is a tribute to the Nazis or a 'Hitler-glorification' which I myself fully disagree. This film simply shows the facts whether we like it or not but is at the same time very instructive."

","I assume that this is a relatively accurate account of the events in the bunker as the Russians occupied Berlin and Hitler met his demise. This is an incredible film. It first shows us the events that are war, not just the soldiers, but the civilian casualties. Also the forces of mindless dedication to a cause and ""honor."" As we watch the unstable Fuhrer and those surrounding him, pledged to destroy the world and take no prisoners (the cause is all; it is not for the weak), it's hard to feel sympathy, yet the collateral damage done by their decisions, wives and innocent children, for example, take this out of the realm of sanity. I know that the Russians committed atrocities too, as did the ""civilized people in the war, but the blindness of the principles to what end, that of an unbalanced creature with virtually no redeeming qualities, is hard to take. And then, of course, most of them took the cowardly way out when their hopes are dashed. Yet we still fight wars and do these things to each other. This is a striking film and everyone should have an opportunity to see it."
"johnnyboyz","8","0","1","17 January 2010"," Well past the end of the beginning, more-so well into the end of the end.
","Oliver Hirschbiegel's 2005 film Downfall takes us deep into the realms of the last days of the Nazi regime, in doing so, physically takes us deep into the grounds of Berlin as The Second World War comes to an end in Europe because the Third Reich is falling apart. The film isn't so much about Adolf Hitler's downfall, an aura built out of the fact it's his presence over most of the posters and so forth twinned with a quite stunning portrayal of the man by Swiss actor Bruno Ganz, as much as it is about the overall downfall of the Nazi party and their top officials located within Hitler's bunker. Crucially, the film does not end with Hitler's death but does so in a manner that sees a montage of sorts, featuring eventual outcomes of most of the other members of Hitler's grouping. This, as the fates of those involved in the film take their course during a pretty harrowing final thirty minutes.<br/><br/>The film begins with documentary footage of sorts, as an elderly German woman engages in an interview just a few years prior to the film's release and talks of her involvement in the Nazi ring towards the end of the war as her duty as a secretary is explained. The opening establishes perspective, a sense of oral storytelling as one reflect back. In a film that'll see many-a decision made throughout the runtime, most of which end in death, it all starts with one very routine one: the hiring of a secretary. We ourselves are as fresh to both the setting and environment these others inhabit as the potential recruit is; there is that sense that we as an audience are being welcomed in along with the new secretary, indeed 'hired', to observe and engage in the new surroundings – this twinned with the immediacy of the person talking in the interview footage and the frequent constructing of most scenes through the new secretary's viewpoint, go a long way in establishing how we, as an audience, will watch the events play out.<br/><br/>Downfall goes a long way in deconstructing how we might perceive Adolf Hitler, here he is vulnerable; scared even. If most Second World War films explore the making of the bed, Downfall is the slow realisation that one will have to lie in it. Whatever perception we have of Hitler going into the film; a probable image born out of countless, scratchy, black and white footage of the man standing on platforms resembling pulpits as his hand-and-arm-waving-rage streams out of him in a fury of loud, seemingly angry German ranting; then Downfall is prepared to go against type. He gets angry at certain points, sure – but the film is not interested in wholly delivering what audiences expect: we can feel the suffering and the bleakness of Hitler's eventual downfall without ever, and I mean ever, feeling sorry for the man, which is quite an achievement on Hirschbiegel's behalf.<br/><br/>Hitler is given the kind of build up you'd expect, in fact you get the sense the film sort of revels in the ominous aura it establishes as he is spoken about whilst still off-screen; spoken to whilst off-screen before shuffling out in order to call in the first candidate. When one of them makes a mistake in the interview process, Hitler is forgivable; he acknowledges the mistake and allows the backtrack, painting an early image linked to the above paragraph. In the bunker, internal conflict sees the once tall, proud figures of top Nazi officials have their power decay and run to ruin. This is all underground, whilst the buildings and the Berlin architecture above is going through a similarly desperate transition as the Soviets and their Red Army close in. Child members of the Hitler youth, still acting on their death-or-glory dedication to the cause of defending the motherland's capital, stand firm and do their best to build defence emplacements and then fend off oncoming enemies in what isn't an easy, manipulative method of getting across raw feeling by using children and placing them in a vulnerable situation as a manipulation tactic, but is just a chilling re-telling of a real life predicament.<br/><br/>And yet despite all these Nazi officials, it is through the eyes of Traudl Junge (Lara) that we see or observe events playing out; particularly evident when Hitler asks a number of people to leave a room so he may talk sternly to the remaining individuals – Junge is one of those asked to leave. The film hovers on the entrance from the outside as the secretary looks on, further giving off a sense of perspective, as everything transpires within. As the case-study between surface and below surface of confusion and chaos rages on, the film will cover a range of people going through a range of different emotions: characters will suffer sadness and become more depressed than others while others will become drunk more often than usual. As the realisation of the senseless waste of life the Nazi's incurred amongst most of Europe in their time comes to fruition, so too do the repercussions of it; with an additionally disturbing display of genocide, this time self-brought upon as the victims of which are so wholly infused within the political ideology they've just witnessed crumble around them, that surrender to the enemy is just simply not an option.<br/><br/>Downfall is rather-an impressive achievement; bringing to life a very important, specific period within an equally important, specific period and rendering it the terrifying, enclosed thing it is; cleverly through the innocent perspective of someone with no political sway. It would be hard to single out an individual triumph over all else in Hirschbiegel's film, needless to say it documents, addresses and brings down to Earth without ever being political nor exploitative; many-a film has been made of World War Two but few as dissecting and closed off from the conflict as this one."

","With a stunning visual, complete with ravaged sets, realistic uniforms and murky cinematography, Der Untergang still has a greater asset: Bruno Ganz's mesmerizing performance. In the main role, he manages to follow all the lines the screenplay draws to him, varying from a decadent tyrant whose fits of anger sprout every minute, to a decaying Parkinson victim, to the gentleman that gained millions of Germans' trust with gentleman-ship. As faults, there is the awful lot of supporting roles that you barely remember at the end (the movie explains their destinies, but you can't recall what exactly they've done) and Alexandra Maria Lara's character, the uninteresting secretary of Hitler who never deserves the attention the film gives her - and Lara does little to make us like her. It was correct to show Hitler in all manners possible, because it leaves for viewers to decide when he makes sense and when he deserves the label of insane demon he has got. A daring character study that tries to give visibility to a man, not the legendary monster. He is still a monster, but this is no ideological movie: it just shows every sides of the story."

","April 1945, all of Germany awaits its Downfall. Downfall is called dramatic and accurate by critics. It is a film based upon fact and seen through the eyes of young Traudi Junga, Hitler's secretary. What the audience sees is the everyday lives of Adolph Hitler and his wife, Eva Braun, amongst those that surround them in that infamous bunker during the final days. Hitler, with his many faults, appears almost human. A superb acting feat by Bruno Ganz, I am sure. The Russians invade Germany and bombard Berlin with artillery as the Russian Army circles the city. The bunker becomes an execution chamber for Hitler and his close advisors. The facts were horrifying. Many took their own lives out of fear of the approaching ferocious Russian Army. Nothing was more cruel than to watch Frau Goebbels kill her children as she cries over the loss of National Socialism. The film is filled with characters from the past and Ms. Traudi Junga tells her story with her own words. ""I must try (to survive)"", Traudi tells her friend as they are separated. At the end, Traudi tells the world that she did not know how bad things really were or the extent of the damage. Fifty million people died before the war was over. It is a story that needs to be told. At the end, the names and titles are shown of the ones that were there, along with a brief history of what happened to them. I mention this because I think it is important to note that some did survive. The language is German with subtitles in English. The movie is a superb achievement and I recommend Downfall to all those with an interest in history."

","Downfall is primarily based on the writings of Traudl Junge, Adolf Hitlers final secretary. She is portrayed in the movie by Romanian actress Alexandra Maria Lara.<br/><br/>The movie begins in late 1942 in Rastenburg, East Prussia, where Hitler is picking his final wartime secretary. It would appear that Junge is chosen primarily for being a native of Munich, where Hitler spent part of his early life and created the Nazi party. <br/><br/>We are then fast forwarded to April 1945 where the Third Reich has been reduced to a few smoldering blocks of rubble in the center of Berlin. The city is under constant bombardment and crossing the street is a life threatening venture.<br/><br/>The majority of the scenes take place inside the Fuehrerbunker where Hitler and his die hard followers prepare for the end. We see Hitler as only a shell of the man he used to be. His hand trembles constantly, his posture stooped and his stride is a wretched shuffle. He is still however the pitiless creature, without remorse for his actions. His strongest desire is to destroy everything and everyone around him. <br/><br/>Two groups occupy the Bunker. The regular combat soldiers who can't believe the insanity around them and Hitlers clique who plan mass suicide while still hoping for a final victory. <br/><br/>Junge is quite attached to Hitler, but is still unsure which group she belongs to. Laras tender beauty and doe eyed innocence are great attributes in her state of confusion. She goes to and fro in the descending madness, unsure of what to do next.<br/><br/>Ganz' rendition of Hitler is certainly unequaled. He is the raving monster one moment and the kindly grandfather type the next. He is capable of squeezing a child's cheek while simultaneously causing the deaths of untold millions. <br/><br/>During the final siege of the city center bedlam reigns supreme in an orgy of drunkenness, celebration and suicide. Groups of roving executioners wander the streets, murdering people at random, but many still escape Russian retribution. This film certainly reflects well the death of a regime."

Guiness.<br/><br/>But the ""downfall"" is about many other people who were associated with this tragic regime and their equally emotional downfall.

","I am a longtime scholar on National Socialism, the Second World War, and the German Military in the Second World War. My brother suggested that I see the movie. I think it was probably the best treatment on the last ten days of HItlers life in the bunker because it showed that Hitler despite all of his abhorrent qualities was a human being that felt pain, such as when he killed his dog and felt anger and hate, from which he assigned his rage upon the Jews and the world. Too often we assign labels to people and we detach ourselves from the reality of the situation. The fact is that Adolf Hitler did not come out of his mothers womb spouting anti-Semitic invectives. Rather he learned it and unfortunately ruthlessly destroyed European Jewry as we know it. Probably the most revealing part of the entire movie for me was when he killed Blondi his dog. Here a man who had started a war that killed millions of innocent people looked away when his most trusted friend in the world died. To me it was the ultimate irony, he loved his dog yet he could not care for the welfare of another human being. I don't think that any of us will ever forget the Second World War, it impacts us to this day. This movie went a long way in showing the human side and the effects that were wrought upon humanity"

","This film is the most powerful I have ever seen, a compelling vision of an episode in history that has always fascinated me. Adolf Hitler (supremely realised by Bruno Ganz), the archetype of evil, liberated from stereotype, is made human, sympathetic even. Stripped of his diabolic rhetoric from the podium, he becomes an introspective shadow of his former self, moving from incandescent rage to utter despair, vainly clutching to a delusional hope of final victory. Downfall also has a surrealistic element. Utterly despondent people whose Dream literally crumbles around them are seen partying with the Red Army knocking at the door. Innocent children, oblivious to their bleak future, sweetly serenade their elders in the claustrophobic bunker. For me, this is as close a vision of hell that has ever been committed to film, as Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge says, ""It's like a dream but I can't wake up."

","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. When I saw it I liked it but not as much as I thought I would. Perhaps this was because I knew the basic facts of the story beforehand but there were also some flaws. <br/><br/>When faced with a moral dilemma there are three kinds of people. Firstly there are a tiny number of moralists who will resist. Secondly there are a tiny number of psychopaths like Hitler and Goebbels. Finally there is the vast majority of sheep, who will go along with whatever they are told and compartmentalise it. The film does an excellent job portraying the first two. The characters who fall into the third category are not totally believable, with the exception of Traudl Junge. Other characters are shown with morals qualms which do not seem believable given the historical record. <br/><br/>In some places the dialogue does not seem realistic. There are things said by subordinates to Hitler which you cannot imagine being said. Partly this is because the director needs to inform the audience of particular facts. In situations like this the characters know each other so well, things do not need to be spelled out. It is down to the director's skill to ensure the audience is not left behind. This is one reason why this must have been an exceptionally difficult script to write. With a barrage of historical figures passing through the bunker it is easy to get left behind if you don't know who they are beforehand. <br/><br/>Even so this is a unique film and well worth seeing."
"tony1911","10","0","3","20 February 2006"," Excellent movie, but supporting characters seemed to be merely sketches.
","I first saw Downfall at an art house in Scottsdale. Wanting to be able to see it without the usual American movie accompaniment of gallon buckets of soda and garbage can-sized popcorn, I opted for the early, midday show. To my amazement, the place was packed! Still, to their credit, they were a very quiet and appreciative audience. The movie itself was brilliant, although the supporting cast bore no resemblance to the originals. Joseph Goebbels was small, and was known as the 'Poison Dwarf', but was played by a very tall German actor. Now, to my beef. I'm a writer (2 novels, 1 non-fiction book, many magazine articles), and I'm looking for information on Herman Fegelein, the Waffen-SS general who was married to Gretl Braun, Eva's sister. He was shot in the garden outside the bunker. I'd like to have seen more of this character, especially as he was seen in his apartment getting ready to leave town! Maybe if a 'director's cut' DVD is going to be released, we'll see more of this character."

","Honestly I have to say that this is the 1st movie I ever say to summarize Hitler's last days. I know that there are several movies like The Bunker for Anthony Hopkins but I never saw that. The movie was so realistic as If your living really the last few days with Hitler's and his men on their Bunker. Alexandra Maria Lara (as Traudl Junge) was so attractive and did a perfect performance as Hitler's secretary! if you are interested on knowing more about this you can check out the Documentary Blind Spot - Hitler's Secretary which is well informative. Also Bruno Ganz (as Hitler) adopted Hitler's character as if he was Hitler!! you cant believe this until you see some documentaries about Hitler's era. This movie is really one of the best foreign movies I ever saw and and no wonder it was nominated for an Oscar as the best foreign movie. I heard also that this is the 1st German movie regarding Hitler and the end of the Third Reich. weired! what they were waiting for!<br/><br/>This movie is a must to see... you gotta know the history!"
"howard.schumann","8","0","1","12 December 2005"," Should be seen to appreciate the insanity of war
","The most frightening things I can remember from my childhood in New York were the blackouts and air raid sirens during World War II and listening to the voice of Adolf Hitler on the radio. It was a voice that sent chills down my spine. That hypnotic voice, that chilling presence, is nowhere to be found in Oliver Hirschbeigel's Downfall, a powerful but novelistic account of the events that took place in Berlin during the final days of the Second World War. Bruno Ganz portrays the Führer as a broken and defeated man, stooped and palsied, raving about how his generals betrayed him, yet being kind to his wife Eva Braun (Juliane Kohler), his secretary Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara), and his dog Blondi. It is a strong performance and his character fascinates us, yet Ganz' fiery rants as the Führer seem to be overly studied, not emanating from the core of his being.<br/><br/>The film is based on Inside Hitler's Bunker: The Last Days of the Third Reich by Joachim Fest and the memoir Until the Final Hour: Hitler's Last Secretary by Traudl Junge and Melissa Muller, and is shot mainly within the confines of a closed space that approximates the dimensions of the real bunker. In that oppressive atmosphere, Ganz recreates the physical deterioration and emotional instability of the Führer who remains steadfast while everything around him is crumbling. Although faced with certain defeat, soldiers are still being sent to their death while Hitler insists that ""every square meter"" of German territory must be defended or left behind as ""scorched earth"". Those that do not fight are shot on the spot as traitors.<br/><br/>The city, however, is unable to defend itself against the continuing onslaught of Russian troops. Although military men know that there is no hope, no one is willing to challenge the Führer's orders or attempt to seize power. Many opt for suicide or go on drinking binges to obscure the failure of the military effort, although by that time, one of Hitler's chief objectives had been achieved with the annihilation of two-thirds of European Jews. As Hitler's wife Eva Braun throws lavish parties, the sound of artillery shells and bombs shake the bunker's walls. Both Eva and Traudl are shown as being so infatuated with Hitler that they dismiss reports of military failure and imminent death. Juliane Kohler portrays Eva Braun as a decent but superficial young woman, thinking only of serving the Third Reich. Lara depicts Traudl as young, apolitical, and hopelessly naive, the way Traudl views herself in her memoirs without ever discussing the impact her father's Nazi membership had on her life.<br/><br/>Hirschbeigel prides himself on his adherence to the truth and Downfall is, by and large, historically accurate. The film, however, singles out a few individuals for being ""good Nazis"" and does not always tell the entire story. One idealized is Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, who tells the Führer that he did not follow his orders to destroy the infrastructure in German cities. This did take courage, yet Speer's organizational genius is said to have prolonged the war for at least a year, with the consequent death of hundreds of thousands and widespread ruin. Hermann Fegelin, Eva Braun's brother-in-law is shown as being ready to question the fawning mentality of the German army, yet he was also a member of the Nazi SS, responsible for the killing of thousands of Jews. In another half truth, the doctor, Professor Schenk appears to be a selfless hero in treating the wounded, yet this was the same man who was responsible for the death of hundreds at Dachau during forced labor projects and medical experiments.<br/><br/>Despite its weaknesses, Downfall has a great deal of merit and it should be seen if only to appreciate the insanity of war and what can occur in a country where basic freedoms are denied. Of the many outstanding performances, two that deserve mention are Ulrich Matthes as the cold hearted Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbles and his wife Magda played by Corinna Harfouch. The sequence in which she calmly poisons her six children because she does not want them to grow up in a world without National Socialism are among the most horrifying I have ever seen. Another performance worthy of mention is that of 13-year old Donevan Gunia whose Peter Kranz represents the crumbling facade of the Hitler youth.<br/><br/>At the end, Hitler is a pathetic shell of his former self who refuses to admit his mistakes and begins to suffer from depression, spending his hours thinking of the best way to commit suicide. No compromise or surrender is ever contemplated though it might have saved thousands of lives. Hirschbeigel wants us to see that Hitler was just a flawed human being but human nonetheless. If this helps the German people to release feelings of guilt, it will have made a big contribution to world sanity. However, showing that Hitler had a human side does not help us to understand the man or his abhorrence of ""the dirty and degrading chimera called conscience and morality,"" as well as ""the burden of free will"" and ""personal responsibility"" which he thought should only be left to those in positions of power.<br/><br/>Hitler may have been a good boss to his secretary and a kind husband but he never showed any signs of remorse when people died because of his actions. It was reported that Hitler used to laugh when Joseph Goebbels described the sufferings of the Jews. He once remarked that a guilty conscience was a Jewish invention. If he had some human qualities, they pale in significance with the breadth of his crimes that have attained an almost mythical dimension. In his devotion to achieving his ends through the use of unbridled physical strength and cruelty, he surpassed all his predecessors in his inhumanity and those are the terms in which he should be forever defined."
"pantera1","9","0","3","8 December 2005"," Should be called DAS BUNKER
","This film should be called DAS BUNKER. A film both physically and metaphorically claustrophobic. Like DAS BOOT, one also gets glimpses of the outside world and the possibilities that could occur, but won't. It chronicles the last days of Hitler and selected cronies as they watch the world they created vanish around them.<br/><br/>Hitler is extraordinarily played by the actor Bruno Ganz, most famously seen in an antonym of this role as an angel in WINGS OF DESIRE. In the same way that Germany needed an outsider to motivate their militarism and eventual destruction, so has Oliver Hirschbiegel employed a foreigner(Ganz is Swiss) to depict this most deplored of dictators. He is humanised here- no Bokassesque cannibalism here. There were times he could be kind and, horror of horrors, even loved his dog! And not even in the biblical sense. But evil has always had a deceptive face and the depiction of the orderly, ordinary world is chilling in view of all that we know.<br/><br/>The film is taken from the diaries and observations of, amongst others, Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge here ably played by Alexandra Maria Lara- an innocent? amongst wolves. At times there is almost a fly on the wall feel to the film. At two and a half hours it's no slouch but I didn't feel it. Take a big pack of popcorn a strong bladder and prepare for one of the finest films of the year."

","This film clearly accentuates Hitler's Evil brains and cold heart towards his own people. Half way through the film I felt like ""I wish I was really alive and present there in front of Hitler, I would have slapped him in front of his own army, no matter whatever consequences I may have to face later, because he deserves that"".<br/><br/>The film is segmented in three parts connoting Hitler's Evil life; first, a complete dark scene with a voice-over conveying a message of Evil born on this earth, second, the film shot in absolute darkness in bunkers where it signifies Hitler ""down in hell"", and finally, there is light after Hitler's death and the war is over and scene's outside the bunkers in broad daylight. This film makes me extremely sad about the fact that numerous people were shot dead for no reason at all, plus a number of unnecessary suicides. Suicide in my terms is a complete waste of life and is the power of Evil.<br/><br/>The film is very well crafted and entertains you even if you are not a fan of any war films (just like me). Bruno's acting is spectacular and he portrays Hitler in its original form and deserves an award. I also appreciated the Set Ups arranged by the Art Director.

"michelerealini","9","0","1","11 October 2005"," An original approach
","""Der Untergang"" tells about the last days of Adolf Hitler. The film takes place mainly in his bunker, the downfall of the Nazi empire is seen through the death of the dictator.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz performance is a masterpiece, there's no doubt. We can discuss about the film approach instead.<br/><br/>The movie is very unconventional because it's completely different from what has been made so far. It's not the classical war film in which the good are on one side and the bad ones on the other: here we only see the last attempts of Hitler to save himself and (that's what he meant) his country.<br/><br/>Many observers criticize the movie for this. It seems that director Oliver Hirschbiegel doesn't express an opinion about the Nazi power, he chooses instead to show the decline and the death of a man. Hirschbiegel approach is similar to what Luchino Visconti did with ""The damned"": both films talk about the end of a structure power from inside. The difference is that Visconti feature was more decadent and sarcastic, whereas with Hirschbiegel we have something more like a chronicle.<br/><br/>In fact this objection is pertinent. But I don't think ""Der Untergang"" is a way of ""rehabilitating"" Hitler -not at all. Private behaviour of Hiler has always been a mystery -we don't have a lot of informations about. The film simply proposes another approach, which obviously (and luckily) doesn't justify Hitler total insanity."

It is not enjoyable and I thought of walking out before the end of the movie. And for a correction, The Movie mentions that 50 Million died as a result of the war and 6 Million Jews. The truth is that 13 Million died that were not connected directly to the War Including the Six Million Jews, So Nazism was bad for everyone, not only Jews.

Really there's no spoiler to give away in this comment, as everyone will know about the last few days of the War. World class acting by Bruno Ganz makes the story of Hitler's last days in his Berlin bunker the most impressive and personal account of this history to date. <br/><br/>Peculiar enough several comments in international media on the movie in the weeks after it was released noted that Ganz had given Hitler a much too personal and friendly face, but this makes me wonder what personalities are liked by the reviewers. I have hardly ever seen a more disturbing personal deterioration as Ganz gives away for his performance of Hitler. If only Hitler could win Oscars, Ganz would deserve it right now."
"motograndprix","10","0","1","26 September 2005"," Flawless acting and 95% accurate.
","Having read most of the reputable books on Hitler's final days ie, Hugh Trevor Ropers ""The Last Days of Hitler,"" ""The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich"" by William L. Shirer and ""Inside the Third Reich"" by Albert Speer to name a few, as well as majoring in History, I can attest that this film is THE most unbelievably accurate portrayal of the Third Reich's final days we are ever likely to see, and since most of the first hand observers are dead or in their final days it is very unlikely that any subsequent film will surpass this one. Time has a way of bending history to sway public opinion and suit current needs, and the more time passes, the more embellishments and subjective opinion can be inserted to distort true facts.<br/><br/>As the other reviewer mentioned, the acting is A+ and there is no need to reiterate what has already been said regarding plot.<br/><br/>I found a several points to be inaccurate. I will mention a few here: 1. Some of the timing of the events portrayed are inaccurate ie Hitler's visit to the garden to give the Iron Cross to the Hitler Youth fighting the the ""Volkstuurm."" 2. According to all who witnessed, Dr.Goebbels did not shoot his wife and then himself, he had an adjutant shoot the both of them in the back of the heads. 3. Bormann did not carry Eva Brauns body all the way up the stairs to the garden, Kempka did. 4. Also, and VERY importantly, German radio did not announce that the Führer committed suicide but quite the opposite,that he died a heroes death fighting at the head of his troops. This radio announcement was made by Doenitz (who at the time did not know how Hitler had died). This is a BLARING MISTAKE that the filmmaker should have known."

","This is surely one of the best, not to mention bravest World War II movies ever made; worthy of mention alongside Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan. <br/><br/>The last few days of Hitler and his followers as the Third Reich collapses around them have been captured in chilling detail. <br/><br/>The performances are excellent all round, especially from Bruno Ganz as Hitler, who achieves the maniacal tyranny of his character without turning it into a comical caricature.<br/><br/>The director brilliantly re-creates the claustrophobic, surreal atmosphere of the underground Fuhrerbunker, where SS guards drink themselves insensible, while outside soldiers and civilians alike are slaughtered by the thousand, hospitals overflow and children are used as cannon-fodder.<br/><br/>The chaos, carnage, and above all, the futility of war has rarely been better described. I would recommend this film to anyone.<br/><br/>The only criticism I have is with the DVD version available in the UK. The English subtitles are presented in the 'hard of hearing' format only. This means that they don't just translate the dialogue (which is of course in German) but they describe everything else that goes on as well: When a gun is fired the word 'shot' appears on the screen; when a telephone rings the words 'phone rings' appear, and so on and so forth. After a while this gets quite irritating and detracts from the overall dramatic effect of the film. I think it's a shame that the producers/distributors couldn't have included basic dialogue subtitles as well."

"Enchorde","9","0","1","20 September 2005"," Very interesting
","Recap: We get to see how the finals days leading up to Hitler's suicide from a couple of different perspectives, mostly that of Traudl Junge, Hitler's personal secretary. The pressure and angst keep keep building up as the enemy, mostly the soviets keep getting closer. A lot of officers react differently to the situation and Hitler himself seen to live in an fantasy world of his own.<br/><br/>Comment: A very interesting movie, and important as well, since the generation that can tell first hand what happened is slowly getting fewer. There has been many war-movies that focus on the horrors of the front for the soldiers or the terrible fates of innocent civilians. This is the first movie I have seen that entirely focuses upon the officers (Nazi) and Hitlers actions. That means, there is very little scenes of action or actual fighting in the movie. The war is mostly noticed through the sound of impacting artillery shells. I sincerely hopes that the movie is meant to be as accurate as possible, because it gives the impression to be, and from what I can read it seems accurate enough. The actors gives great performances as they play very different roles. There are those characters that are actually quite human and thinks of the bystanders, the people and the victims, then there are those, including Hitler and Goebbels, that are frighteningly evil. But all are convincingly played by the actors. It feels odd to discuss the entertainment value of the movie, since I'm not sure it is meant to have one. And true enough, it is not the kind of movie you laugh about or feel good after seeing. On the other hand it is very interesting and although it is fairly long and slow paced, there was not a single moment I felt like the move came to a halt or was boring. So, this is a highly recommended movie, maybe not for a more weekend-movie intended to cheer you up, but for a movie to make you feel and think.<br/><br/>9/10"

","This film is set in the Berlin bunkers where Hitler took refuge in the closing days of the second world war. We see what happened down there in those last days of the war and Hitlers life. The story is multi-linear and shows different people's perspective. We see from Hitler's perspective, his personal secretary and from some of his generals.<br/><br/>This isn't like other war movies. instead of the fighting taking place in battle fields, the fights are in tiny claustrophobic rooms. The fights are psychological, not physical. As its set in a bunker, it has this suffocating feel the whole way through.<br/><br/>The acting in downfall is just awesome. Bruno Ganz who played Hitler did the most mind blowing performance i have ever seen. it was scary how much he got the idiosyncrasies of Hitler so right. He even had the same power and passion Hitler put into his speech's, and when someone argued with him, i wouldn't want to be on his bad side. But Bruno brought another side to Hitler we haven't seen. At times we see he was a human, he still was caring and sympathetic; not this Satan figure all the time.<br/><br/>The last half hour of downfall though is so depressing that it is hard to watch. It gets so down right depressing you think you'll never be happy again. i really felt like leaving it was that hard to watch. that has never happened in any other movie i have watched. just all the suicide and genocide that went on was so bleak and depressing. When they started kill the children i nearly broke down crying. But thats why its so great. movies that can take hold of our emotions and rip them apart should be praised, as they have mastered the art of cinema, and this does it perfectly.<br/><br/>if you get the chance see this in the cinema, watching it at home wont create the same atmosphere"

","Downfall is one of the best World War II movies that I have ever seen. I like the fact that Downfall lets the viewer decide about the evilness of the characters by presenting them in a multi-dimensional manner. The way in which the characters are presented forces the viewer to analyze the motives and question themselves what others would do in a similar situation. The picture did an excellent job of showing the different types of followers, from the opportunistic, to those with a semblance of a conscience, to the blind devotee. Just an awesome portrayal of the conditions in Berlin at the war's end. The depth and complexity of the characters in the movie make this picture a must see for any movie lover."
"jpintar","10","0","1","8 September 2005"," What an achievement
","Downfall is an extremely compelling movie. This is a realistic view of the last days of the Third Reich, set mostly in Hitler's bunker. When you are watching scenes in the bunker, you feel a sense of claustrophobia with the bombs coming down on Berlin. Bruno Ganz is excellent as Hitler. He sees Hitler in a delusional fanatic convinced that the war can still be won and he will personally lead them to victory. The fact that most of his troops are dead or captured and entire armies have been destroyed does not seem to faze him. Anyone who does not fight to the death is a traitor and a coward to him. If he goes down, he thinks the entire German people should go down with him. You see this in the movie with a scene of boys 12-14 years old manning artillery guns, blinded by their loyalty to him. The film does an excellent job in showing how even toward the end, many Germans were blindly loyal to Hitler. They do want to see Germany after the fall of the Third Reich. They would rather commit suicide and even kill their own children to spare them the fall of the Third Reich. See this compelling movie, even though it is in German."

","Films about Hitler are always in the dilemma of how to show this inconceivable character, as a crazy maniac, a hatred low level or what ever, risking to make him look human or to blow the chance of showing him as he possibly was. The film sticks reasonably with the credentials given by Traudl Junge, Hitlers private secretary and other eye witnesses of the final days of Hitler. There are two levels of story telling here, on the one side the strange, unreal isolated world of the ""Bunker"" into which Hitler retreats when the Russians are taking Berlin, and, on the other hand, the real life, well depicted in gripping battle scenes, army hospitals and interwoven to a no longer ""civil"" life of people being forced to arms or being hanged or becoming ""collateral damage"" in the fight. Confronted are the end time mood dominating Hitlers bandwagon of Generals, Party Leaders and other strange fellows surrounding him against the useless death of regular soldiers, Volkssturm people and Hitler Youth, with their fanatical will to turn the tide that finally rolls over them. Bruno Ganz, naturally, has the ""best"" role here, showing Hitler in a variety, from going berserk on bad news to being almost private as well as tangling himself and his entourage into phantasm of Army groups to relieve him, which have long ceased to exist as fighting units. Also impressive a long cast of German character actors, Corinna Harfouch as the mother taking the live of their 5 children, which shall not face a time without Hitler and National Socialism certainly standing out. Highly impressive, very well done to the small details, this movie can well hold up against any American Movie of the same budget both in quality as well as box office value.

","Downfall, as it was titled in Britain, is an extraordinary balancing act that is somehow sensitive and brutal, exciting and depressing, numbing and inspirational. It is, admittedly, overlong and thus occasionally dull, but it is worth it all the same.<br/><br/>Like Das Boot and All Quiet on the Western Front, it is able to play your sympathy for the characters' humanity against your instinct that they (mostly) deserve to die. Every time a Nazi kills himself - and this happens on average once every fifteen minutes - you feel a mixture of sadness at the pointless loss of life and guilty satisfaction that it was self-delusion that got them there. How much sympathy and how much satisfaction depends on the character, and so you get the full range of emotions as they drop one by one.<br/><br/>The most poignant deaths are not those of Hitler and Goebbels, who deserve no sympathy, or, at the other extreme, non-combatant Berliners, but those in the middle. Eva Braun is clearly delusional, but does this excuse her guilt? Goebbel's children sing adoringly for the Fuhrer, but cannot be held responsible for their indoctrination.<br/><br/>The audience also has to question whether all Nazis lacked any moral fibre. How should we feel about Albert Speer, the Nazi who escaped death at Nuremberg because he apologised? Or the general who comes across as a professional soldier whose crime was to accept orders from a lunatic master.<br/><br/>The portrayal of the shelling of Berlin, where street combat goes hand in hand with decadent end-of-the-world partying, is equally intense. It is reminiscent of both Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan in its skillful combination grand scale and poignant detail.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that it is a about half an hour too long. The last reel, which is death after death after death, would have been all the more powerful if I wasn't wondering how much longer it would last.<br/><br/>This is fine film-making nonetheless, although I doubt I would ever want to watch it again."
"danfcon","10","0","1","24 August 2005"," a few hidden agendas among the ruins of the third Reich
","A great movie: a superb vehicle for recounting the History of the end of Nazi Germany through the eyes of one of Hitler's secretaries, but take it with a few grains of salt. The producers described as History a number of THEORIES concerning the end of the Nazis. The doctor who mixed the knockout drug Finodin that Magda Goebbles gave to her children before killing them was named by the producers as Stumpfnegger, who committed suicide with Bormann. However, much evidence, including a deposition I have personally read in the US National Archives in College Park MD, names someone else (who denied involvement). Herman Fegelein is shown as having been arrested drunk in a hotel room (the Adlon?) and shot for desertion, though he was actually hanged for espionage, a much more involved and interesting albeit detracting story. Eva Braun, portrayed for the first time NOT as a cardboard character, when confronted with evidence of Fegelein's espionage, in fact supported the execution, but this was not portrayed. However, what the producers got right compensates for these nagging errors. A great touch was denying any lines to the evil debauched parasite Goering. Goebbles, Hasse, Shenk, Moenhke, Burgdorf, Krebs, and Weidling were portrayed masterfully. Even Bormann was portrayed as forgettable background furniture, a skilled ironic touch. The most successful technique: The set design often reproduced in exacting detail famous stills taken during the fall of Berlin. I often caught myself thinking, ""I remember that,"" though I was never there."
"gradyharp","10","0","1","5 August 2005"," An Unstintingly Realistic Examination of the Final Days of Adolf Hitler
","DER UNTERGANG (DOWNFALL) is not only a brilliant film in its close-up dissection of the mind of a lunatic, it is an important historical document that at last gives us as realistic view as possible of the last days of the Third Reich. Written by Bernd Eichinger who based his screenplay on memoirs by Traudl Junge and Melissa Müller ('Bis zur letzten Stunde') and Joachim Fest, directed by Oliver Hirschbiegel, and acted by an all-German cast, this is about as frightening as a story can get - yet a seemingly authentic one.<br/><br/>Bruno Ganz gives a searingly vivid performance as Hitler, and while some are enraged that the film shows too much of the human side of Hitler (as though this could make him seem less horrid!), Ganz finds that fine line of presenting Hitler as a delusional underachiever who will go to any lengths to fake a 'caring man' to some while always being short-fused into irrational rages to others. The film takes place in the final 12 days of Hitler's life while he is living in an underground bunker surrounded by many of his fellow ghouls as Russian troops rapidly advance to stamp out his existence. There is condescension as well as blind devotion among the ranks. Hitler marries Eva Braun, informs his confidants that he will never surrender (nor should they) and then proceeds on his plans to commit suicide with Eva, having extracted a promise that their bodies be burned beyond recognition to prevent desecration by the Allies and encroaching Russians. How this grand final plan is carried out is terrifying, especially watching Frau Goebbels (Corinna Harfouch) sedate then poison all her children, and quietly placing herself in front of the firing squad.<br/><br/>The spectrum of the horror of Hitler's atrocities is not diminished by this so-called 'humanizing' film: quite the contrary - Bruno Ganz inhabits the role with a verismo that makes Hitler even more terrifying in being a credible mind gone mad. The entire cast of this claustrophobic underground bunker team is superb and the direction makes the 156 minutes speed by. The minimalist musical score by Stephan Zacharias lends just the right tone of eeriness and the cinematography by Rainer Klausmann (shot in St Petersburg and Munich) is stunning. The film opens and closes with the elderly Traudl Junge (the 'secretary' author of the book on which the film is based) commenting on the terrible tragedy in which she took part. The effect is devastating. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, August 05"

","One will be amazed at the historical accuracy of this masterpiece. Anyone who is a Nazi Germany buff would agree it would be hard to find anything that would be considered off track. The acting was phenomenal. The world was very lucky to have Frau Junge alive for so many years allowing the world to hear the story of the last weird days of the 3rd Reich. At no time did this viewer move from the screen. The director captured all aspects of the horror related to the Russian attack on Berlin. This film is highly recommended to anyone to has any interest in the last historical days of Nazi Germany during world war II. And if you don't have any interest, view it anyway, you won't be disappointed."

"chn65","10","0","1","29 May 2005"," A must-see
","The underlying point is the crimes, that Adolf Hitler committed against his own people as well as what we have already seen him do to other nation's people.<br/><br/>There are so many historic details, which are more clear, if you have seen miles of documentary. As an example: When Eva Braun states, that she will stay with Hitler, he kisses her in public. This is the only time he ever done that - he never showed any devotion or love previously. When Hitler kills himself, one of Goebbel's children says ""Volltreffer"" (clean hit) - which was a remark often used, when the Russian artillery played their music.<br/><br/>There is a long scene, where you see the madness in the streets of Berlin, while you hear the voice of Eva Braun writing a letter to her sister. You hear her tell about her jewelry, while Germans are killing Germans, because Adolf Hitler said, that if you become scared and flee, you should be arrested and shot. A 14-year German soldier-boy kills his fellow 14-year soldier, and then kills himself ...<br/><br/>Much of the film takes place in the bunker, but we also follow a small (fictious?) boy, who fights the Russians and even receives acknowledgment from Hitler personally - only to find his family shot later by the Nazis, because they did something wrong.<br/><br/>You almost never see the Russian soldiers, which is a good effect. The Russian soldiers were not the enemy. You see the enemy all the time, the enemy being the Nazi spirit. You see Germans killing Germans, you see the madness of Goebbels, who is unable to exist without his Fuhrer. He and his wife are so dependent on Hitler, that they choose to kill their own six children. The scene (and the scenes leading up to it) is indescribable - watch the film. Many other high-ranking Nazis kill them selves, when they hear, that the entire thing is over, the capitulation is a fact, and the fighting has stopped.<br/><br/>I have read some other comments, and some of them point out some interesting things. There is a reference to Bach's mass in b minor, the ""Crucifixus"" part when showing Adolf Hitler. There are other musical quotes, which of course are chosen deliberately. There are also remarks made by various people, which are related to quotes from Jesus facing crucification.<br/><br/>I do not see that as any glorification of the Nazis. The film only shows, that the Nazis thought themselves as the ones, who were going to save Europe - now only death awaits.<br/><br/>The film both starts and ends with some quotes from Traudl Junge (the real person speaking), which leaves no doubt, that this film is intended to warn people against people like Adolf Hitler.<br/><br/>A film like this should be made by Germans in Germany. It could never have been realistic and mind-blowing, if they had been English-speaking actors with a funny German-sounding accent.<br/><br/>And there are no one-liners, even though there is some very dark humor in the film - as the end approaches, and the people in the bunker awaits the end. The film is not entertainment, it is honest, dead-serious and black.<br/><br/>A true must-see, it should be mandatory to watch this film in the schools."
"p-spence","10","0","2","26 April 2005"," Did you feel emotional after viewing 'the passion of the Christ'? if you did then you may experience a similar experience after watching downfall 1
","In my opinion 'Downfall' visually complements two books I have read on the last days of the 'Third Reich'. The authors being Joachim Fest and Albert Spier. As far as I recall, all details in the film are same as the descriptions contained within the books from the authors, in other words the film conforms to the accuracies portrayed in the books. The film portrays the last days of Hitler and his confidantes, who retreated to the Berlin 'bunker'to avoid shelling from the Red Army. The film manages to capture within the bunker the bleakness, the hellhole, and the madness that much of the Nazi topbrass experienced toward the end. If you know your WWII history and the enigma of Hitler, his idealism, his imperialistic ambitions then you will be able to sense the absolute madness and emotions he and his entourage people were feeling. What is that old saying .....'the higher you fly the harder you fall' ? Compelling"
"johnmbale","10","0","1","23 April 2005"," Devastating and Powerful. A Must See Film.
","Devastatingly realistic this ultimate film about the last days of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich, as seen through the eyes of his young secretary Traudl Junge, is a chilling but awesome experience rather than sheer entertainment. Bruno Ganz gives his finest performance as the crazed Dictator, who is more usually portrayed as either as a comic figure (Charles Chaplin) or a raving lunatic. Ganz brings depth and humanity to the character like never before, one minute compassionate to his staff, the next screaming retribution in some manic outburst. This is surely the definitive Hitler, probably as close to the true character as we'll ever get. His decent into despair and delusion is magnificently conveyed. A supporting cast of great strength gives added impact to the claustrophobic Bunker scenes, notably Ulrich Matthes (Joseph Goebbels) Corinna Harfouch (Magda Goebbels), Alexandra Maria Lara (Traudl Junge), and Juliane Kohler (Eva Braun). Perhaps the most disturbing sequence is when fanatical Magda Goebbels sets about poisoning her children, we the audience are never let off the hook by director Oliver Hirschbiegel. With superb photography recreating the grim effects of the war on Berlin, this is a standout film, all the more remarkable being made by a German film group. A must for those interested in one of the most horrific yet fascinating figures in recent history."
"kaibab1","10","0","1","23 April 2005"," Extraordinary chronicle of the demise history's ueber-evildoers
","Words fail to capture the power of this documentary-style re-enactment of the last days of Hitler and the coterie of criminals that made up the upper echelons of ""The Thousand Year Reich."" The performances are phenomenal and marked by a total lack of caricature --straightforward performances suffice to depict the insanity of Nazi criminocracy. The superb cinematography avoids gratuitous violence and gore. In short, this is a film that has to be seen to be believed about times that, unfortunately, cannot be forgotten.<br/><br/>Lead actor Bruno Ganz delivers a seamless interpretation of Hitler's last, deranged moments, as he swung from hysterics to introspection. The photography places the viewer alternately inside the dank and narrow confinements of the bomb-proof bunker in Berlin, and the devastated urban landscape of a once great capital... all metaphors for the illogic carnage delivered by Hitler and company."
"adrianj","9","0","1","20 April 2005"," Extraordinary, Impressive and Disturbing
","This extraordinary film presents in chilling detail the affect of the failure of Hitler's Third Reich. By keeping a close focus on Hitler's bunker and the government district of Berlin we can concentrate on who these people around him were and how they reacted to him and the imminent collapse of the Nazi dream.<br/><br/>The acting and direction are assured and the visual impact of the film, both in the claustrophobic bunker and the ruins of Berlin itself, is impressively realised. Part of the horror of the film is that it does all seem so very real - these are real people in a real situation - and that is terrifying.<br/><br/>For me though, the most disturbing thing is that although the film recreates specific events of World War II, it stands as a warning to us, today.<br/><br/>Hitler, Goebbels et al, had a vision. A vision of purity and truth, a vision that millions of people took to be real, genuine and achievable. The problem with all such visions of purity and truth are that they require absolute fanaticism. For the Nazis there was no alternative, like for Magda Goebbels who could not see any future for her or her children without the Fuhrer. For these fanatics, if you cannot live up to the dream you have failed, and there is no compassion for failure.<br/><br/>The truly terrifying thing is that the world is still full of fanatics - be they al-Qaeda, born-again fundamentalists or Balkan nationalists. They have no place for non-believers, and should they ever gain the support that Germany gave Hitler, we risk being plunged into the dark ages again.<br/><br/>Traudl Junge's final words of the film are a chilling reminder for all of us, that no one can be 'innocent' when the fanatic calls."
"davidpentecost","10","0","1","20 April 2005"," Stunning
","A German film about the last days of the Nazi regime has to be of potential interest. This amounts to a lot more than that. I think it an must see film. The construction of the film is amazing it attempts to cover huge ground in the space available to it pulling together threads which include: the impact of the final days on ordinary citizens, the organisation and hierarchy surrounding the fuhrer, a depiction of Hitler that goes beyond caricature and a real sense of the 'dream' of the third Reich finally folding into a nightmare. Performances all round were excellent. There is depth and intelligence at work here..do not let it pass you by. I would add a word of caution that the scene depicting the deaths of the Geobbals children is truly harrowing and has stayed with me for weeks."

","Being a history student and someone who has read a lot about WWII, this movie struck be as being very accurate. I think Ganz's depiction of Hitler is quick remarkable. Portraying the definition of evil while at the same time showing other emotions must have been quite a challenge. The directors choice of someone 10 years older than Hitler was at the time was also interesting. Also, both the Goebbles were chilling P.S. I did not find that the Nazi's were in anyway glorified or justified. The fact he did not give them horns or a pitch-fork tail does not lessen the message that Hirschbiegel wanted to deliver. The Nazi's were human, and they came from human conditions."

","This is very beautiful movie, especially if you had the chance to see the movie/interview with Traudl Junge and also had a chance to familiarize yourself with the story of Sophie Scholl, her brother and a group of young Germans executed in 1942, the year the film begins. The White Rose is a movie about them. The downfall is captivating, showing how human beings can become so entangled in ideology that will make them do things you would never think of doing in your right mind. But how horrible it must have been for Bruno Ganz to decide to play Hitler! Yes, the National-socialists are all human beings, showing them as alien monsters does not help understanding how WWII and the concentration camps came about..."

","This is one of the finest renditions I have ever seen of the other side of World War II; and everything in it is very accurate, I was surprised by how the filmmakers did not shy away from some of the more powerful moments, such as Magda Goebbels poisoning her children, or Hitler testing the poison on Blondi. All that DID happen, and Hitler really was that erratic in the Bunker; read the standard books on the subject,and you'll find that this Hitler's performance matches exactly that of the real one who committed suicide in 1945.<br/><br/>It's one thing to read about Hitler ranting and raving in a history book, and another to see him ranting on a theater screen, the spittle flying out of his mouth; Also, the Generals' reactions to Hitler's outbursts were accurate; none of the high ranking Generals in the German Army did not want another November 1918 to happen again."

Those who didn't believe Hitler lived in fear and those who believed had no sense for reality, where mislead or where on a pursuit for love, family and a better life without knowing what war really does. ""Untergang"" displayed psychopaths at it's best. Bruno Ganz (who played Goethes Faust in a 22 hour stageplay), one of the most variable actors of our time, played a perfect Hitler, as we know him from audio/visual documents. He even imitated his voice, walk and mimic frighteningly perfect. This movie is quite dangerous for less educated people, because it could be misunderstood.
