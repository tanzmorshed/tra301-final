","Even before the final credits rolled, I strongly suspected this movie would end up on my Top 20; in fact, perhaps even my Top 10. A teenage boy, his hearing impaired from having just been at the site of a bombing, and a young woman clutching at him, the two of them stumbling and sludging through a slimy, smelly bog. A stork in the woods as it rains. A cluster of dolls piled up on the floor with flies buzzing all over the room. You don't need vast, elaborately choreographed battle scenes to bring home the message of the senselessness and pain of war. Reading viewers' comments on the movie, it seems that most found the second half  which admittedly contained some of the most powerful massacre scenes ever filmed  as the most ""satisfying"". A few other viewers seem to imply the movie doesn't really get going until the second half. For me, it was the first half that got under my skin the most, for its cinematic originality, poetry and symbolic power. War is experienced by civilians as well as by soldiers: this may seem like an obvious statement, but it's only after watching Come and See that you realise how few war movies are truly about the suffering of the ordinary man and woman, defenseless child and frail senior citizen. Also, never before had I seen the plight of raped women in war so powerfully conveyed, and all this without the movie ever being voyeuristic or graphic. In cinema, rape is often portrayed as something that looks like rough sex. It isn't always quite clear why women get so upset over it. In Come and See, rape is shown as nothing but pure, unadulterated, hate-fuelled violence with only a superficial, external resemblance to sex. Unlike other raped women on film, you cannot imagine those in Come and See ever healing from their scars. <br/><br/>On another subject, whoever thinks this movie contains ""propaganda"" is obviously prejudiced against the movie simply because it's a Soviet production, and should think things over a little more carefully. It's astonishing how you can still find little traces of the Cold War mentality surviving to this day, even in younger viewers... The fact that as detractors of Come and See claim, Stalin ""was no better than Hitler"" has nothing to do with anything at all, in this movie's context - Klimov's picture is NOT about nationalistic oneupmanship on who had the worst tyrant - it's about the basic suffering of ordinary humanity in war - ANY war, though this one happened to be going on in Bielorussia. There was in fact ten times more propaganda in ten minutes of Saving Private Ryan than the whole of Come and See. This is painful, sublime cinema. I've always believed there's something special about Russians when it comes to producing art, especially literature - this movie goes some way towards reinforcing that impression in me."
"FilmFlaneur","10","399","456","29 December 2004"," One of the greatest wars films ever made
","One of the greatest of all war films, Klimov's stunning work stands amongst such works in which the horror and sorrow of conflict are made fresh over again for the viewer, left to stumble numb from the cinema thereafter. Produced for the 40th anniversary of Russia's triumph over the German invaders in WW2, based upon a novella by a writer who was a teenage partisan during the war, the propagandist use to which it was later put - when the GDR was still in the Eastern Bloc, citizens were forced to watch this to warn them of another rise of fascism - does not impair its effect today at all. It echoes intensity found in another masterpiece by the director. Klimov's shorter Larissa (1980) is a remorseful elegy to his late wife. Poetic and very personal, its sense of shock anticipates the heightened anguish that ultimately reverberates through Come And See. Through his images, the director stares uncomprehendingly at a world where lives are removed cruelly and without reason, if on this occasion not just one, but thousands.<br/><br/>At the heart of the narrative is Floyra, both viewer and victim of the appalling events making up the film's narrative, his history a horrendous coming-of-age story. It begins with him laboriously digging out a weapon to use and much changed at the end, he finally uses one. As he travels from initial innocence, through devastating experience, on to stunned hatred, in a remarkable process he ages before our eyes, both inside and out. His fresh face grows perceptibly more haggard as the film progresses, frequently staring straight back at the camera, as if challenging the viewer to keep watching; or while holding his numbed head, apparently close to mental collapse. Often shot directly at the boy or from his point of view, the formal quality of Klimov's film owes something to Tarkovsky's use of the camera in Ivan's Childhood, although the context is entirely different.<br/><br/>The film's title is from the Book of Revelations, referring to the summoning of witnesses to the devastation brought by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. 'Come and See' is an invitation for its youthful protagonist to arm up and investigate the war, but also one for the audience to tread a similarly terrible path, witnessing with vivid immediacy the Belorussion holocaust at close hand. Here, the intensity of what is on offer justifies amplification by the use of a travelling camera, point-of-view shots, and some startlingly surreal effects pointing up unnatural events: the small animal clinging nervously to the German commander's arm for instance, soundtrack distortions, or the mock Hitler sculpted out of clay and skull.<br/><br/>Main character Floyra is the director's witness to events, a horrified visitor forced, like us to 'see' - even if full comprehension understandably follows more slowly. For instance during their return to the village, there is some doubt as to if Floyra is yet, or will be ever, able to fully acknowledge the nature of surrounding events. In one of the most disturbing scenes out of a film full of them, Glasha's reaction to off-screen smells and sights is profoundly blithe and unsettling. So much so, we wonder for a brief while if the youngsters really know what is going on. Its a watershed of innocence: one look back as the two leave and the reality of the situation would surely overwhelm Floyra - just as later, more explicit horrors do the viewer.<br/><br/>Come And See was not an easy shoot. It lasted over nine months and during the course of the action the young cast were called upon to perform some unpleasant tasks including, at one point, wading up to their necks through a freezing swamp. Kravchenko's face is unforgettable during this and other experiences, and there are claims that he was hypnotised in order to simulate the proper degree of shell shock during one of the major early sequences. The sonic distortion created on the soundtrack at this point later appeared to a lesser extent in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, as did elements of a much-commented scene where a cow is caught in murderous crossfire. Klimov's camera ranges through and around the atrocities, although one doubts that a steady cam was available. By the end Florya is isolated from humanity, technically as well as mentally, by a striking shot that excludes the middle foreground. Disturbingly expressionistic though these scenes are, others such as the scene where Florya and the partisan girl Rose visit the forest after the bombing, achieve an eerie lyricism that are however entirely missing from the Hollywood production. And whereas Spielberg's work concludes with a dramatic irony that's perhaps a little too neat, contrived for different audience tastes, Klimov's less accommodating epic finishes on a unique, cathartic moment - no doubt partly chosen to avoid any bathos after events just witnessed, but one which sends real blame back generations.<br/><br/>Hallucinatory, heartrending, traumatic and uncompromising, such a movie will not to be all tastes. It certainly does not make for relaxing viewing, although those who see it often say it remains with them for years after. This was Klimov's last film for, as he said afterwards ""I lost interest in making films. Everything that was possible I felt had already been done,"" no doubt referring to the emotional intensity of his masterpiece, which would be hard to top. By the end of their own viewing, any audience ought to be shocked enough to pick up a rifle themselves and vengefully join the home army setting out to fight the Great Patriotic War - a necessarily stalwart response without limit of participation, symbolised by the director who tracks a camera through the dense forest before finally rejoining a column of soldiers heading to the front. If you feel, like I do, that any real war film should succeed in conveying the power and pity of it all, then Come And See is an absolute go and watch."

","The best true-to-life war movie I have ever seen, and possibly the best movie I have ever seen. My eyes were opened when I saw this for the first time a few days ago. It made me realise what I miss 99% of the time when watching movies. So few affect me like this one did.<br/><br/>No special effects of note, no big budget, no set-pieces of note, no heroes, no redemption. I feel quite sure the director has really captured what war 'feels' like - unlike Spielberg and Coppola's depictions of war, this director lived through WW2 and the horrific siege of Stalingrad, as well as spending many months researching the massacres in Belarus, one of which he depicts in this film (this from the DVD extras, well worth watching).<br/><br/>The direction, cinematography, soundtrack and AMAZING acting by a first-time untrained actor in the main role are faultless, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>I found this film depressing and emotionally draining, but cannot wait to watch it again."

"paulmartin177","10","166","197","12 May 2006"," I saw a film today , oh boy...
","I have a bad habit of reading too many reviews and comments about a film before I've seen it, mainly to get an idea about whether it's going to be worth a couple of hours of my time watching it. As a result, I am often slightly disappointed with much of what I see, as all the hype that I've read about a film kind of blows my expectations out of all proportion. I had a feeling this would be the case with Elem Klimov's 'Come and See', a film I'd read a lot about, particularly here on the IMDb. (Imagine my ""excitement"" when, having tried to see the film for nearly a year, I discovered it was to be released on DVD a week or two ago from today!) Well, I finally watched the film yesterday and... well, nothing could have prepared me for the sheer intensity and unflinching visceral horror of the atrocities that 'Come and See' invites us to... come and see. (Has anyone commented before on what a clever title that actually is...?) This is one of those films, like, say, 'Requiem For A Dream' or 'The Magdalene Sisters' (both of which, though great films, are simply not in the same league as Klimov's film), that one does not (obviously) so much enjoy as submit oneself to. By the end of such films we are left numbed and shell-shocked, wondering what we are supposed to do with the intense emotions that have been evoked within us. Yes, I felt like the ground had been pulled from beneath me; yes, what I saw in that film made my blood boil, my head hurt and my heart pound; and, yes, it showed me things I'd seen before but to a degree of intensity and detail that I had not experienced before. The point though, I guess, is that the role of cinema (and art in general) is not to offer answers or tell us what to think but to simply show us particular events and characters and allow us to come to our own decisions about what those things 'mean'. I'm rambling now, but I'll simply end by saying that 'Come and See' is, with its outstanding technical and artistic credentials aside, a film whose very title alone demands that it be seen. It is the work of a visionary, a cry of despair from the depths of hell, and an important reminder of humanity's capacity for inhumanity Go and see..."
"vlad_reven","10","133","159","22 March 2008"," a brief comment on some comments
","What most of the foreign viewers perhaps don't understand is that the factual side of the movie has always been a common knowledge among millions of Russians especially those of older generations. People like me, who were born 10-15 years after the war ended, knew it all along first hand from the stories told by parents and grandparents actually living through those times and events. My own mother at the age of seven was thrown by German soldiers into a barn that got lit, her front teeth were knocked out by the butt of a German soldier's rifle and she, along with tenth of other village kids, was saved by my grand-mother and other villagers only because some partisans had chosen to attack and deliberate the village that day. What most of Western viewers find horrifying, shocking and disturbing is nothing but the truth being accurately depicted by some later movie makers. This movie is pretty much like a documentary that could actually be shot with the help of some sort of a ""time machine"" in case there was one in 1985 when the movie got filmed."
"vbz","9","148","180","5 January 2000"," Apocalypse Then
","In all fairness, this Belorussian-made World War II picture detailing Nazi atrocities, holds a special distinction in world cinema: it is by far the most brutal and emotionally draining of all - in fact, a viewer whose senses have not been properly trained would most likely find it unwatchable. Those brave souls willing to be put through an ordeal of almost 2 1/2 hours will find themselves deeply immersed in an absolutely horrifying experience that will not easily subside whether they want it to or not.<br/><br/>The title, ""Come and See"", taken from the frequently repeating lines of the book of Revelation, clearly dares the audience to assume the role of St. John, witnessing the Apocalypse, or rather one of the darkest periods in the history of humankind. What we are assaulted with, plays somewhat like a demented version of ""Modern Times"" transpiring across the panel of Brueghel's ""Trimuph of Death"", if such a combination is possible. The camera is consistently filtered through a murky, slightly unfocused gaze, and the sound is often heard through shellshocked ears. This tends to eirly distance the events, yet make them even more frightening and unsettling. Much of the dialogue lacks specific meaning or even concrete sentences - it is replaced by subhuman growling, wailing and other spine-chilling, gluttural sounds of the war. What the director prepares is something Spielberg would never even dream of - no sign of compromise with the audience. A crowd of civilian villagers locked up in a barn by Nazi soldiers is not spared at the last minute like ""Schindler List's"" Jews- they are burned alive, and we get to watch all of it.<br/><br/>Unlike most of the films in this genre, ""Come and see"" relies mainly on images and sounds instead of a coherent plot, which is not necesserily a weakness, since the sheer terror distorts time and space into a kind of hallucinatory blur, clearly intentional and understandable. But this incredible level of bleak intensity in the long run, has a negative effect on the film: the viewers have to desensitize themselves just so they can keep watching, so the most harrowing scenes are sat through in numbness.<br/><br/>Another questionable move on the director's part is his occasional use of surrealism. While some visuals are painfully believable, while others are simply baffling: crazed villages consructing an effigy of Hitler, a pensive German commander with a pet slender loris (a rare African primate) on his shoulder, a female Nazi eating raw red lobster, not even mentioning a bizzare final montage wich is both inexplicable and obvious, ending with a real-life photograph that is perhaps the most terrifying of all in its implications. <br/><br/>Yes, at times the movie overachieves its goals and seems almost like the footage in ""The Clockwork Orange"" that they made Alex watch to cure him of ""ultraviolent"" behaviour; yet other times it delivers the kind of jolts those accustomed to mainstream cinema could only wish they had. The face of a youth who had lost all sanity and aged many decades over several days, will be etched for an indefinite amount of time into the memory of anyone who has seen this film."
"LSigno","10","141","172","25 June 2001"," Death, destruction and despair
","There's not much one can say about this movie, besides ""Be warned, it's going to hurt you - a lot"". The story is simple: Byelorussia in 1943 and it's Hell on the Earth. The Nazis are fighting a no-quarter-given-or-asked war against huge Soviet partisan units, and the population is caught in between (historically the German security forces destroyed hundred of Byelorussian villages murdering most of the population in the effort to ""clear"" the rear of Third Panzer Army). Those who haven't been deported or killed by the Nazis are trying to join the partisans. One of them is Florya, a young boy - and in his quest to ""join the fight"" he get much more he had bargained for. It's a movie about an apocalyptic world (the title is taken from the Book of Revelation, a most of the movie looks like it has been filmed on another planet), but unfortunately it was all-real. The emotional centre of the movie is a lengthy sequence involving the destruction of a village, with all the sickening (but not exploitative) details shown with cold determination. There's no catharsis (this is not Schindler's List!), no hope, no redemption - even the eventual revenge against the village's destroyers become just a sad and murderous business. ""Come And See"" is a difficult, violent and surprisingly poetic movie, compared to which even classics like ""Saving Private Ryan"" (Spielberg payed a homage to this movie on SPR's beginning) or ""The Thin Red Line"" seems just artificial. This is the real thing!"
"JAM-31","Null","132","162","11 December 2001"," Possibly the definitive Russian front film
","""Come and See"" is bizarre, disturbing, and haunting.  It is more moving and enlightening than all of the other (mostly disappointing) films I have seen depicting the Russian front in World War II.  Strangely enough, the Red Army is entirely absent from the movie.<br/><br/>As a Russian film, it begins less conventionally than most films produced in the west.  It starts off very surreal, and it is difficult at some points to understand what is going on or what certain characters are doing.  This gives the theme a foreign and realistic feel.  We follow the life of a peasant boy in Byleorussia in 1943, as he joins the partisans.  Certain events involving his family and his introduction to the partisans (especially one involving a young girl) make his fight more personal. Strange interactions between characters and Director Elem Klimov's follow tracking shots dominate the film, and give it a unique method of storytelling.  Then the nightmare begins.<br/><br/>The destruction of a Russian village is the horrific centerpiece of the story.  It is brutally realistic, with more tracking shots that hold for long periods of time without cutting.  We see the German Wehrmacht burn a barn loaded with civilians to the ground as these soldiers clap, smile, and embrace each other.  The chaotic action involves many scenes that are sporadic (flames burning out of control, a German soldier accidently shoved into the barn house with the victims) and possibly improvised, which lend a great authenticity to the material.  The images are unforgettable, and will stay with you long after you've seen the film.  Klimov has succeeded in putting the viewer in the village.  Surprisingly, despite coming out of the Soviet Union in 1985, ""Come and See"" never felt to me like propaganda. There was no communist rhetoric, and the heroes were all partisans, many of which were flawed.  The Germans aren't caricatures at the same time they commit acts of evil, and view their actions in a banal way.  When one of them defends the atrocities of his platoon, he states, ""inferior races spread the microbes of communism.""  The character delivers this line not with fierce anger, but with nonchalance, as if it were common knowledge, not something that he needs to explain to anyone. <br/><br/>Some reviews have criticized the ""afterthought,"" a rewind of the Nazi rise to power and invasion of Europe, as unnecessary.  It may be, but it is still powerful.  Other ""flaws"" people find with the movie are all characteristics of the director's style, therefore I don't find them flaws.  ""Come and See"" is a great, very different, and very moving film.  Grade: ""A-"""
"maurernh1","9","33","38","29 April 2006"," Quite possibly the most powerful film I have ever seen.
","Come and See is one of the rare films that I can remember being emotionally drained upon its conclusion. The expression on my face as I sat there watching the credits scroll by seemed as worn and broken as that of the protagonist, Florya.<br/><br/>The film follows Florya as he ""joins"" (i.e. obtains a gun) a partisan group resisting the German advancements in the forests of his native Byelorussia during World War II. What he witnesses at the ripe age of 12 changes a once open-eyed, smiling face into a weathered, traumatized one that has experienced the unimaginable.<br/><br/>And of course the unimaginable were the Nazi atrocities committed during the war. Come and See does not focus on what the German Army did to the Jewish population but rather what they did to the native Soviet population. The Nazis were not only concerned with the utter destruction of the Jews but of the Bolshevik Party as well. And to Hitler that meant any man, woman, or child living under communist rule. And this ""cleansing"" fell into the hands of the SS who, as depicted in the movie, literally destroyed every sign of life.<br/><br/>Florya is able to escape death, unlike the rest of his family, but serves as a witness to the destruction and in this sense ""dies"" as his innocence and youth is lost. Klimov does a masterful job and depicting this slow death by concentrating on the facial expressions of Florya versus that of the Germans and both of their transformations over time. Klimov's Hitler montage at the end is especially moving and puts an interesting spin on the whole ""what if"" question.<br/><br/>This is the most historically accurate war movie I have ever seen and would highly recommend it to any war/history enthusiast. But I would also recommend it to any film watcher that realizes the goal of the medium which is to evoke emotion in the audience, and Come and See does just that."
"notoriousCASK","10","48","57","25 September 2017"," One of the finest films of all time.
","World War II in Belarus, in the region near the Polish borders. Compelled by patriotism and youthful idealism one young boy (Aleksei Kravchenko) leaves his village to fight with the Soviet partisan resistance against the Nazi invasion. Within minutes his innocence is stripped away and the premature knowledge of war is revealed to him. He gets away from his unit and returns home, only to find the whole village including his family slaughtered and their bodies stacked behind an old farm!<br/><br/>The horrendous depiction of war that Klimov creates is unique in the history of cinema. There is no plot, only a terrifying wandering in the nature, as the boy comes face to face with constant terrorizing and horrendous scenarios. Heroisms and sacrifices do not exist, nor inspiring speeches that excite the people to resist and fight the enemy. There is only the unexpected, death, violence and victims! A poem of a nightmare, relentlessly grim, deeply disturbing, and made unquestionably more dread-inducing by the fact that almost everything depicted really happened, it is a depressing but necessary reminder of one of the darkest chapters in human history. Idi i Smotri also manages to be both poetic and realistic and that is a supreme accomplishment on the part of the director.<br/><br/>The film depicts real and surreal images that only war can justify. Transporting us back to World War II setting with its aptly-chosen locations and era-appropriate set pieces Alexei Rodionov's documentarian cinematography incorporates a lot of steady-cam and captures the events without any interruptions by employing long takes, and stands as one of the best films to use it as extensively as this one does, while desaturated colour tones add an urgency and bleak feel to its aura. The imagery at times is darkly psychedelic and truly arouses a sense of fear within the viewer because Fliora's surroundings are often made to seem out of this world. Such an image is the one where a soldier of the resistance, using mud, pieces of wood and a Nazi uniform, creates a German soldier totem. The widows and the mothers attack the totem and destroy it in a primitive act of violence and catharsis. There are moments in which the film is depicted through the eyes of the protagonist, and all sounds collapse into oblivion, reinforcing his deafness after the bombs' explosions.<br/><br/>Come and See is one of the most affecting and confrontational war films ever made. The majority of war films claiming to be anti-war, show heroic acts with weapons and very capable soldiers that can save the day. Come and see does not offer such relief and comfort. It shows that in the war there are only victims. Though no one could possibly describe the experience of watching Come and See as a fun time, the film is nonetheless a masterpiece, worthy of consideration as not just the best war movie ever made, but also one of the greatest films ever made. Come and See is an enduring landmark of Soviet cinema whose potency and relevance will never be diminished by the test of time."
"MacAindrais","10","93","120","25 September 2006"," And I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder...
","Come and See (1985)**** <br/><br/>I first saw this movie a couple of years ago. I didn't really know what to think of it at first. The soundtrack on the DVD is a little messy and the acting was a bit strange. I knew it had affected me though in a way that not many other movies had. As time went by I began to realize just how much of an impact the movie had on me. It really, really stuck with me. One night, while writing a review of Errol Morris's latest documentary ""Fog of War"", I found myself thinking more and more about Come and See, and decided that I had to watch it again immediately. I ran out after midnight and rented it, and watched it 3 times or so over the next week. I started to see why the film had been haunting me and sticking around my thoughts. The reason was that this movie is simply a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Elem Klimov directs the film, starring Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya, a young boy who desires to fight with the Partisan's army against the invading Nazi army. He digs until he finds a rifle, then the next day he is off to a camp in the middle of the woods. The scene is chaotic it seems and unorganized. The fighters try to take a photo that takes about 5 minutes to accomplish because everyone keeps messing up their positions. Florya spots Glasha (Olga Mironova), a young girl, who has the younger fighters swooning over her, and who also seems to have some sort of relationship with the leader of the camp. What that relationship is exactly we never find out. Florya gets left behind on the attack because he is perhaps too young, and besides another older fighter needs some new boots, and swaps with the new kid. .<br/><br/>The anxious Florya is upset by this decision and he takes to the woods for some solitude, he cries and then discovers that near by Glasha is also crying at being left at the camp, more so for being left alone than behind. The two begin to bond and end up in an open field when German planes attack and begin to bomb the encampment. The scenes that follow next teeter on the brink of madness on film. Come and See is likely one of the most maddening films ever made for that matter. The key is the soundtrack. Florya is struck deaf for a few moments by the bombs. Sounds are muffled, but not like anything you've ever seen in a Hollywood film. The soundtrack is a mix of strange ringing and sounds and music, adding to the atmosphere of chaos that the two youngsters have now been thrown into. Much of the film has this style of soundtrack, which makes the Florya's descent into madness much more poignant.<br/><br/>The film movies forward from here back to Florya's village which has now been deserted. The two head to an island on the other side of a bog where Florya believes the town is hiding along with his mother and sisters. The scene where they climb through the mud is another example of Florya losing his mind. The soundtrack again becomes ambient and menacing in its strange blends of sounds. They eventually find some villagers and Florya now even more loses his sanity, along with some of his hair, which is given to recreate a statue of Hitler. This will be the last time we see Glasha in the movie, as Florya goes with a party to collect food for the starving people.<br/><br/>The most famous scene, and the one that will likely never leave you, is of a village being ransacked by Nazi soldiers. The scene is chaotic and culminates in a barn stuffed with the townspeople being burned and shot apart. Another one of the most famous shots from the movie is of Florya shooting a photo of Hitler, each bullet making time reverse. The photo goes back in time until it is a picture of Hitler as a baby on his mothers lap. He is an innocent infant, and Florya cannot bring himself to fire another shot. These shots are incredibly powerful and they stick in your mind.<br/><br/>Obviously, Come and See was filmed with influences of Soviet Propaganda in it, but it hardly matters because it is so well made and so maddening you can't help but be totally absorbed by the experience. The movie has a hypnotic quality about it, and without being horrifying because it's a jump out of your seat surprise bloodbath, it is horrifying in its representation of the cruelty people are capable of in war.<br/><br/>I can't remember ever seeing another film that expressed the descent into madness any better and being so involving as Come and See. By the end of the film, you feel like you've just experienced what it must be like to lose your mind. The film never goes into the desensitizing of violence in war. Instead it focuses on the violence which causes those who witness to become desensitized from the madness of its cruelty.<br/><br/>Elem Klimov created this film out of his actors and their emotions, and essentially used the viewer as another character. This movie draws you in and makes you experience exactly what the characters must. There are few other films that do that to you, especially to the extent that this one does it. And for that, Come and See is not only a masterpiece, it's really one of the best films you'll ever see. Find it, but don't just watch it. Allow it to take you in; even if that means you have to see it a couple times. Let it take you in, and you're in for an experience rarely found in cinema anymore"

","Come and See , well if you hate violence and brutality then you certainly wont want to see this. This Picture set in 1943 occupied Byelorussia is most probably the most true to life war movie ever, only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can come close. What is amazing in this picture , is how the director uses a child's perspective and view in circumstances that you can only describe as evil. The director pulls no punches in how bad times actually were for peasents and partisans alike as German and collaborators show the viewer how low and depraved a fascist military machine actually is.<br/><br/>
I dont want to go into the plot , as this film is a MUST for anyone who considers themselves a film buff. Disturbing and terrifying scenes do not in anyway spoil the flow of the film , but when viewing this film , please desist from seeing this movie in the early evening , as you wont sleep.<br/><br/>The acting accolades of course goes to the main characters , but I wish to give a special mention for the Russian Partisan Commander , who was just simply , superb. Everything about him was what you'd expect a Red Army Officer to be. The looks , the attitude and the steely determination is simply a credit to the actor. The best scene involving the Red Army Commander was when they had captured an Einsatgruppen Unit , and the SS soldier , who knew they were facing death was allowed to speak , after there own Commanding Officer was pleading pitifully for his own life. The SS soldier tells his captors that they are sub-human and that there peasent belief in Marxism was grounds enough that they should be eradicated. The Red Army Commander then in just a few words tells his men , that they are not just fighting for Socialism , but also the right to exist.What happens after...well you'll have to see.<br/><br/>Come and See is nothing short of disturbing, awesome, powerful and brutal. This is the best film I have ever seen regarding films portraying the Eastern Front 1941-1945 war. This film should be engraved in gold as the standard for any budding war film director. Only Saving Private Ryan and Schindlers List can be put in the same League table."

The racial policy of the Nazis was to eliminate all ""inferior races"" such as Jews and Slavs from Eastern Europe and to make land available for German settlement in the east (Lebensraum). Because of the importance of Eastern Europe to Nazi policy the bulk of the German Army was sent to the eastern rather than the western front. Estimated that 20 million or more Russians (by Russians I mean the people of many nationalities that included Russians, Ukrainians, Byelorussians, Jews and many others who used to live on the Soviet territories occupied by Germans during 1941-1943) died fighting Hitler (recent estimates place figure 25-30 million). Units of the SS (Schutzstaffel) and SD (Sicherheitsdienst) were used to carry out the genocide. The SD was separated from the main body of the German Army (Wehrmacht) and made up of fanatical Nazis and fascist East European (often from the Baltic) collaborators.""<br/><br/>Elem Klimov's and Ales Adamovich's Film is perhaps one of the most powerful and horrifying films about the war (I would add Tarkovsky's ""The Childhood of Ivan"" aka ""Ivanovo Detstvo"" and Mikhail Romm's documentary ""Obyknovenny Fascism"" aka ""Ordinary Fascism"" aka ""Triumph Over Violence""). <br/><br/>Not for a moment would the film let the viewer relax. With each scene, the feeling of horror increases. We are transformed into the main character, 16 year old boy Florya. We are forced to see with his eyes, to hear with his ears. In the beginning of the film, Florya is a child. At the end, after having witnessed the unspeakable terrors of the fascists, he becomes an adult, and not just an adult  an old man. His face is the face of War  and it is to us, the viewers, authors say  come and look in this face if you dare. <br/><br/>War unmistakably selects as its victims the weakest, the youngest and the tenderest - the authors could not go against this truth. In the military camp, Florya meets the young girl, Glasha. Together, they try to make their way to the village where his family lived. But no one is there, it is empty - it is burnt out. <br/><br/>And again some force pushes Florya, Glasha and us to go further. But where? To the shed where the women and the children are burning alive? Into the hands of the rapists- fascists? Or to be photographed with the revolver put at your temple, surrounded by the laughing SS-men? Is there any way out of the Inferno of War? <br/><br/>The mystery of the final episode Florya can not force himself to shoot the child at the photograph sitting at his mother's lap. Even if the child's name is Adolph Hitler. Florya puts his rifle down. The clear blue sky is above him. Sounds Mozart's ""Requiem"". What is this? Victory? Or defeat? Did Florya survive or did he perish like millions and millions during the endless days, months, and years of the worst war the humankind had known? Even if survived physically, he is a changed forever man, the man who looked triumphant death and horror in the eye for too long to ever forget them."
"matjusm","10","19","23","27 January 2007"," Very powerful
","This is just about as powerful as a war film can get.<br/><br/>The year is 1943. A teenage Belorussian boy by the name of Florya finds a rifle and then joins the resistance to fight the Germans. On the way he sees all the horrors of war and thats what this film is really about.<br/><br/>This is one of the most powerful war films I've seen and I have seen a lot. The events aren't dramatized too much and the film manages to keep a good sense of realism. At the same time however it achieves an excellent surrealistic atmosphere by contrasting this young boy to the horrors of war that surround him. The soundtrack helps a lot in this area by not really providing music in the traditional sense but rather these very tense and powerful, slightly ambient noises. Reminded me a lot of the sound that an orchestra makes when they're getting ready right before the start of a concert. Now the film was made during Soviet times so it does show the Germans in a bad light and as very cruel but to a large extent, thats how things were. Aleksei Kravchenko, the actor portraying Florya, pulls the job off well despite his young age. He doesn't have much dialog to say and this really is more of a visual film.<br/><br/>To add to the artistic qualities of this film, there is also an excellent technical side. In addition to the soundtrack which I mentioned before, this film has some of the best cinematography I've seen in a long time. Director Elem Klimov makes excellent use of the steadycam with which he follows his characters as they go from one place to another and without cutting away. There are two excellent examples of this: First is when Florya comes back to his village and the camera follows him as he comes down a hill, goes into his yard and then into his house. The second is the last shot in the film which follows a collumn of soldiers, then takes a brief detour (which is more of a shortcut actually) into a forest and then rejoins that group of soldiers some time later. Simply awesome. The battle scenes are very intense, especially one of a group of German soldiers taking out a village. What I really liked was that everything seemed genuine. During one scene where a bomber bombed a forest, you could really see the dirt being kicked up and trees falling down.<br/><br/>An absolute must see film."

","Elem Klimov and Aleksei Rodionov's handheld cinematography, present the viewer with the mental and physical destruction of a boy who changes in front of your eyes beyond recognition.<br/><br/>Cacophoneous, industrial sounds and sometimes cryptic story-elements (for as far as there is a story) contribute to this ruthlessly escalating history lesson about Nazi's who burned down hundreds of villages in 1943 in Russia. The realism makes you wonder how many people were harmed making the film, while the score represents the mindnumbing experiences of Florya, a tour-de-force performance by Aleksei Kravchenko (16 at the time).  All along, somehow Klimov knows very well how to prevent the audience from becoming numb.<br/><br/>ILM's specialFX are smoother, but the FX here in 'Come and see' are so realistic, it's almost unreal: reminiscent of the first 30 min of Saving private Ryan, Thin red line (watch the animals), Apocalypse Now and the painstaking 'Band of brothers'.  Indeed forget about the rest of 'SPR', Platoon and even Full Metal Jacket.  However, I would like to recommend Deer Hunter (Cimino, 1978) and Hotaru no haka (1988).  But I never suspected there was something massive like this.  10/10"

","This is the greatest war movie ever. The best way to describe it, I reckon, is to pass on a newspaper article written by Ilya Ehrenburg during World War II when all the things which happen in ""Come and See"" were happening:<br/><br/>NIKOLAI VLADIMIROVICH -- ONE YEAR OLD Red Star, November 30 1943<br/><br/>How much the Germans have taken from us! They have taken from us not only loved ones, homes, and possessions. Life was complicated. There were dreams, joys, people, many books, many countries. But now everything in me is unchangeably focused on one thing: on the German. I see him -- blue-eyed and inhuman. He walks and kills, he sings and kills, he laughs and kills.<br/><br/>Among the papers of the town head of the village of Vyazovaya, recently liberated from the Germans, was found the following document:<br/><br/>""List of executed residents of the village of Vyazovaya, Uzninskaya region:<br/><br/>1) Muzalevskaya Natalia Ivanovna. 43 years old. 2) Muzalevskaya Natalia Nikolaevna. 18 years old. 3) Muzalevskaya Diana Nikolaevna. 16 years old. 4) Muzalevsky Lev Nikolaevich. 13 years old. 5) Muzalevskaya Valentina Nikolaevna. 9 years old. 6) Muzalevskaya Tamara Nikolaevna. 5 years old. 7) Muzalevskaya Rima Nikolaevna. 3 years old. 8) Davydov Vladimir Ilych. 35 years old. 9) Davydov Anatoli Vladimirovich. 8 years old. 10) Davydov Victor Vladimirovich. 5 years old. 11) Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich. 1 year old. 12) Pryadochkina Maria Petrovna. 60 years old.<br/><br/>19 September 1942. Town head Muzalev.""<br/><br/>Can this be forgotten? Is it possible to live knowing that people are walking the earth who shot Davydov Nikolai Vladimirovich to death, one year old, an infant, the baby Kolya, shot him and ordered his name entered into a list? It is hard to talk about it, but impossible to forget. We still have a long way to go. But we will get there. We will find them. We will find them under their beds, in their vegetarian cafeterias, at the ends of the Earth. We will remember the one-year-old Kolya Davydov. We will remember much. **********<br/><br/>The director, Klimov, concentrates on faces. From the faces you can see what they saw. Come. Come and see what this war was about in the Soviet Union. This was a war to the death; the Soviets knew and the Germans knew it. The Germans knew it because their leaders declared it so and 23 million Soviets paid with their lives. Ten million Germans also paid the price of that sale. The seller pays the price of the sale."
"terrywunder","10","38","52","16 December 2007"," Come and See why this Movie Breaks the War Movie Rules
","Come and See<br/><br/>Growing up watching war movies from Apocalypse Now to Black Hawk Down, I thought I knew what war movies are. Apparently, I was wrong. Come and See is not like those films. It does have soldiers, explosions, and people dying. However, Come and See doesn't have John Williams making you feel like storming the beaches of Normandy is somehow best expressed by French horn. What makes Come and See so interesting are 3 basic elements: 1. We experience war through the eyes of a teenager, 2. It doesn't follow a formulaic approach and 3. It's brutally real.<br/><br/>First of all, war movies are typically seen (in America) through the eyes of some brave (almost always white) man heading off to the glory of the war. Ben Affleck in Pearl Harbor, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, Tom Sizemore in every major American war movie or TV Show since 1989 (including the two aforementioned). In Come and See, our protagonist Florya is a teenager who eagerly jumps at the chance to fight with the Russians against the Nazi invasion. His youth and innocence at the beginning is just like the audiences. He believes he knows what war looks like, but when confronted with the reality of it he, along with the audiences, slowly loses his mind and his prefabricated ideals. He (and we) become lost in this seemingly alien world of war that had previously been a clear vision to us. Our joint progression is a testament to Klimov's smart design. <br/><br/>What I cannot stand about American war movies is the obviousness of plot. That doesn't mean all American war films are bad, but I do believe they follow a very specific pattern. Here it is: Someone goes off to war; they battle, lose a friend, gain some friends, recover from loss, learn some important lesson, and come home. Saving Private Ryan's title character (Matt Damon), Pearl Harbor's Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett), Jarhead's Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) all follow this line. In Come and See, Florya does go off to war with some ideals, he makes and loses some friends, but he never comes home. Also, he's not doing it in any cookie-cutter/Michael Bay way. He is literally destroyed of all his innocence, family, self- worth, and judgment. He never recovers from his losses, he simply pushes them deeper within or ignores them (which could be argued is the same thing), he never learns lessons from his experiences (he becomes angry and disavowed with own thoughts and ethics), and he never comes home, because he doesn't have a home anymore and he wants to keep fighting (I also understand that ""war"" and ""The Army"" could be his home, but I disagree with that. I feel his home is truly destroyed, when his innocence is destroyed). <br/><br/>Lastly, Come and See's realistic approach to filming is remarkable and startling. There are no sweeping shots of the horizon and the soldiers walking through vast fields, epic crane moves around the statuesque protags (a la every Michael Bay-type war film), or funky color separation or manipulation. It is really is 2 hours of hand-held camera, live ammunition and explosions, real color, and original WWII uniforms. Come and See is an intelligent exploitation of your senses and emotions that are clearly visible in the young actors own minds. When Florya stands next to the nearly leaded cow you see his real fear just like the guy watching the film next to you. Some documentaries are a cleaner look at war than Klimov's film."
"Artimidor","10","9","10","20 April 2013"," Come and see... the horsemen of the apocalypse
","The horror first rears its ugly head only in the corner of an eye in Elem Klimov's shocking WW II masterpiece. Almost as if it isn't real, just an illusion, a dark thought, maybe an omen, but nothing more - how could years and years of family and village life be torn away in the maelstrom of one disturbing instance? This particular shot lasts only a moment, just one character observes the irrevocable truth and there are no words to describe it. By not talking about it maybe it will all be muted, made untrue forever - for that one person and for everyone. But the brutal war reality that strikes a young Belorussian boy and his girlfriend doesn't stop at that, it is merely beginning...<br/><br/>""Come and see"", a passage from the ""Book of Revelations"", is indeed an apt title for a film that makes it clear that the end of the world as we know it has come upon us: Welcome to the theater of war, to the shocking and unremitting images of the horsemen of the apocalypse sweeping over Belarus as if there is no tomorrow. ""If we show the brutal truth, people won't see the film,"" Klimov warned his writer Ales Adamovich, but got countered with: ""This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace."" Klimov himself didn't make another film after this one. He said it all here. Right. As this is not a film about soldiers fighting bravely and earning their medals, a tragic story with an optional melancholic undertone to it that makes you sigh and move on. This picture is about the innocent victims, the shameless atrocities committed to them, the dilemma of the few survivors who are forced to fight for their mere existence. This is the unvarnished documentation of a nightmare, shot in earthy tones between beautiful idyll and the grisly aesthetics of war. It is merciless, haunting, traumatizing, not to be forgotten. With non-professionals in the lead Klimov uses close-ups upon close-ups to get in their eyes, the mirrors of their souls, where unparalleled devastation lingers. Come and see the raw cataclysm of a doomed generation living not too long ago, back then when the unspeakable happened, still present in the corner of your eye. Be prepared."

","This movie has had to restrain itself from showing the true level of German atrocities in Belarus and Russia, in order not to be distracting. But what is shown is enough, and the movie is beautifully done. The director did not make any more movies because he said everything he wanted to say.<br/><br/>This is war movie like no other. If you want to understand what happened, this is a must see. There are so many movies about Holocaust, but the level of suffering on the Eastern front is unfortunately for political reasons severely underplayed in the West. 20 million Russian and Soviet civilians died from the Nazi hand. <br/><br/>The decency with which this movie tells the truth about the war is really worthy of greatest respect. There is not a second that is fake in this movie, it is pure, distilled soul of the Soviet people and their struggle against Hitler. If you want substance, look no further. There has been no other movie like this."
"AdmiralCallum","10","15","19","4 September 2012"," Truly the most powerful film you will ever see.
","I consider my self to be a real war buff. I Have watched a HUGE number of war movies in my time. My library of books on the subject of war dwarfs that of my local library. I have visited many battlefields and have spent many hours conversing with veterans. However after seeing this film I realised I knew NOTHING of war. <br/><br/>the sense of loss, of sadness, of destruction is overpowering. I have never cried after seeing a film. In fact I find it very difficult to cry in general. But about an hour after seeing this film I broke down and cried like never before in my life. That is true art. <br/><br/>Saving Private Ryan has often been sited as being in the same league as this in other reviews here. I find this insulting. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely loved SPR, but to mention it in the same breath as this is just wrong. <br/><br/>An event in my life recently reminded me quite strongly of Come And See. There is a beautiful forested aria not far from where I live. An aria of outstanding natural beauty. I have gone for walks there since I was a child, and continued to do so for many years. Some of my happiest memories are of the beauty and tranquillity of that forest. Then about a year ago there was a forest fire. My beautiful forest was gone. Come And See evoked the same feelings of loss and sadness but more intensely. Those were only trees -beautiful although they were- but these were real people. Although Come And See is not based on a true story per se, it is firmly grounded in history, with 628 similar instances. If this film touched you as deeply as it did me, I would recommend a trip to the Khatyn Memorial in Belarus."
"Theo Robertson","9","21","28","28 January 2010"," Once Seen Never Ever Forgotten
","Elem Klimov's COME AND SEE is a film best remembered for one scene and it'd probably be wrong to say it should be remembered for more that since THAT scene is one of the most disturbing and harrowing ever committed to celluloid . It also means the rest of the movie struggles hard to make up for it even though it tries . In many ways it's a throwback to the Soviet Home Front type of war movie mixed with Tarkovsky . Nature in all its imagery features prominently throughout the film . Forests are beautiful , green and silent on the surface but feature filthy , stinking swamps where a human can drown in . Man is also a hostage to the elements where rain soaks the skin and causes a human being to shiver . Man is not as fortunate as a bird who evolution has blessed with feathers and can sit on a swamp without sinking <br/><br/>Like Andrie's Tarkovsky' 1962 film IVAN'S CHILDHOOD the story revolves around an older child - Florya - who finds himself caught up in the insanity of war in Byelorussia . While nature is cruel there's nothing more cruel than human tribalism coupled with unthinking ideology , a lesson Florya and the audience will find out later in the film . Until then the film concentrates on Florya's almost naive sense of adventure . The partisans leave him behind as they go to fight the Nazis so Florya wanders through the deep forests with his companion , an older girl called Glasha , perhaps blissfully unaware what the future holds for them both <br/><br/>The film climaxes with an atrocity brought upon a village occupied by a Nazi death squad Einsatzkommando unit . People often use SCHINDLER'S LIST as the one film to show the brutality of the Nazi regime but to be honest the impact of Nazi atrocities may have a stronger impact here . There's a clinical ,impersonal feel to humans being murdered by zyklon B in gas chambers but to watch people being burned alive while the perpetrators laugh and treat the massacre as a nice day out does chill the blood . Worse still it's all based on truth . COME AND SEE finishes with a caption that 626 Byelorussian villages and their inhabitants were burnt to the ground . This was only in Bylorussia . This isn't counting the towns in Russia , Ukraine and other places in the USSR that was visited by Nazi murder squads . Disgracefully Mel Gibson recreated this very scene in THE PATRIOT where the British red coats committed an identical act even though there's no record of anything similar having happened during the American war of independence <br/><br/>In conclusion COME AND SEE is a film that deserves to be seen by everyone even though it's sometimes distressing . It's this nihilistic and horrifying , brutal impact war has upon people in general and the young in particular that makes it a must see movie . It's also the last film director ElemKlimov ever made which is possibly just as well since it's the one one film a director should be remembered for . Such great talent going to Hollywood making romantic comedies and action blockbusters would have been such a waste"
"ackstasis","10","19","25","4 July 2007"," Harrowingly realistic; the true horrors of war
","Russian director Elem Klimov's final film, 'Idi i smotri {Come and See},' is a masterpiece of the genre, a war film so disturbingly intense that it strays into the realms of psychological horror. Set in 1943, during the Nazi occupation of Belarus, the film follows the fate of a young boy, Florya Gaishun (Aleksei Kravchenko), who joins the Soviet partisan army. As the horrors of war unfold before him, Florya loses his idealistic preconceptions of combat, becoming confused and psychologically unstable. The entire film is witnessed through his young eyes, as his civilised world is thrown into turmoil and those that he loves perish at the hands of a merciless enemy.<br/><br/>Much like Francis Ford Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now,' the film is almost surrealistic in its exploration of the horrors of war, constructing a hallucinatory nightmare of escalating confusion, fear, death and madness. And yet, despite this, the film manages to come across as being frighteningly realistic. Perhaps this surrealistic approach is also, paradoxically, the most realistic depiction of war. Young Florya is cast into a hellish world he simply can't comprehend; placed in the same position, I imagine, the experience would strike us as being one long, distressing and horrible dream. Florya seemingly even treats it all as such. With the ghastly events happening all about him, he can do nothing but stare with petrified shock and awe, as one who expects to wake up at any moment.<br/><br/>'Come and See' boasts a string of remarkable sequences which will resonate with viewers for a long time after they see it. A series of bomb strikes tear apart a Russian forest, silently obliterating the mature trees as a shell-shocked Florya hears only the maddening ringing in his ears; Florya attempts to clamber through a thick, murky bog, feeling with each step as though he is getting nowhere; he awakens in the midst of a thick mist, his head resting on the carcass of a dead cow. Perhaps the most lasting scene is one in which an entire population of villagers is herded into a barn, and then consequently set alight. Words fail to describe the horror of watching the flaming barn doors still flapping wildly as the inhabitants fight with their last breaths to save themselves and their families. Meanwhile, Florya just stares, his blank, disbelieving expression infinitely more effective than any other actions would have been.<br/><br/>Inexperienced teenager Aleksei Kravchenko is excellent in the lead role, which the director subsequently described as ""a very difficult role with extreme emotional states."" So arduous were the emotional burdens of the film that Klimov later expressed surprise and relief that young Kravchenko did not suffer any adverse psychological trauma during and after filming, which notably employed the use of live ammunition to maximise authenticity. His character is placed in situations that are, to us, simply impossible to fathom, and Florya reacts to these changes in his life with a sort of awed silence, sometimes anger. Young actress Olga Mironova, apparently in her only film role, plays a pivotal role as Glasha, whom Florya befriends in the early part of the film.<br/><br/>The film ends with a simple but very disturbing montage of archive footage. As Florya attempts to symbolically destroy Adolf Hitler by firing bullets at his portrait, the black-and-white World War II footage rapidly rewinds: we see corpses at a concentration camp, a 1930s Nazi party rally, Hitler's services during World War I. As Florya fires more and more bullets, the images continue to reverse themselves, as though eradicating the history from existence. Finally, we arrive at a photograph of Adolf Hitler sitting on his mother's lap as a young baby. Unlike the Nazi savages who felt no remorse in torching entire villages to the ground, Florya cannot bring himself to symbolically murder this innocent child, even with the knowledge of the horrors he would later orchestrate. Is this morality the reason why wars are an inevitable consequence of human existence?<br/><br/>Though the final reel does undoubtedly stray towards propaganda (the Russian citizens are clearly shown to possess superior morals to those of the evil, fiendish Germans), the entire film is executed so disturbingly perfectly that you are too engrossed in the spectacle to really notice at all. There is no clear resolution to the story. Of course, the valiant Soviets successfully triumph over the company of Nazis, but they then strike off for another confrontation. The War will go on forever, and Florya will never be given a reprieve from all the horrors he has witnessed. The original working title of the film had been ""Kill Hitler,"" not specifically referring to the infamous dictator, but with a more general meaning. As Klimov explains in the DVD preface to his film, he meant the title to suggest that we should kill the ""Hitler"" within ourselves, ""because we all have our demons in this or that measure."" However, after the title was deemed inappropriate, another was chosen from chapter 6 the Book of Revelations: ""...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, ""Come and see!""""<br/><br/>'Come and See' was the final film that Klimov ever directed. Having experienced World War II with his own eyes as a child, he felt that it was a film that he needed to make, and, after doing so, he was no longer compelled to continue directing. The director comments, once again on the DVD preface: ""I don't regret that I made that film. It had a difficult pre-history and history. But one has to make it a difference once in a while, to commit something worthy. Herein lies the sense of creative work, when you can offer to people something real serious, real meaningful"" Simply put, this is the masterpiece that he was born to make, and a single viewing will ultimately change the way that you view war."
"Pau-palero97","10","5","5","2 May 2017"," A True War Film
","We live in a time where war movies are always about a hero. They show how a soldier risked their life to save a friend how heroic they truly are. This movie whether we like it or not, glorify war. They make it seem like a good option for someone to thanks part of, they basically say ""Hey there might me death but hey you will be a hero at the end!"" and we know that is now hoe it goes. Some of these movies could even be called war propaganda in a way. They paint war as a glorifying moment in a soldier's life but it is extremely weird for a movie to show the other side of the war. Not the soldiers who trained and became heroes but the people who suffered because of war and this is exactly what Come and See does.<br/><br/>Come and See is a movie that I could not get out of my mind for a moth. This is a masterpiece with a deep antiwar message. In the movie, we follow Florya a young Russian guy who decided to join the military during the Second World War. He does not become a hero at the end but a victim, what most people who go to war are. We follow Florya through a period of time where he lives the most terrible things a human being could possible experience. He is forced into situations no one should be put through. His life becomes a tragedy in its purest way. Not in a single moment of the film do you see a hero or you feel like Florya might have a good life after. This movie focuses on the real side of war, the bad side, the terrible side which most people in war experience. This is what I would call a war film, and the best one I have seen. It opposes war in all of its aspects not separating the good or the bad side but simply showing the bad that war does to people."
"Pkleddick","10","5","5","24 July 2012"," Not your average Hollywood war film.
","Before viewing this film, I wasn't sure what to expect, but I knew it was not going to be like many of the other war movies out there. So many of the American war movies lean so much closer to the formalism aspect of the scale compared to realism, and as many say they are so ""Hollywood"". Klimov did an amazing job of keeping his film out of that category. I have never really been able to empathize with characters in a war movie the way I have with this film. It was not so much that I have personally endured what Flyora went through, but that he was such a young boy being forced into a grown world. I think the part of this film that affected me so much was watching this boy age physically and mentally so much in such a short period of time. The visual aspect of Flyora's transformation really hit me as the viewer emotionally. Comparing him from the start of the film as a fairly healthy and happy young boy, to a white haired, bags under his eyes, wrinkled boy who's soul has been sucked out of him, is hard to accept even just as a viewer to this movie. This film was so realistic, with no CGI and rawness, it seeped into my thoughts more so than many Hollywood films I have ever seen."
"signe-elvin-nowak","10","5","5","4 June 2012"," Everything is real
","Come and See is probably the best World War 2 movie I have ever seen. It is also the movie that has affected me the most, leaving me with a feeling of unease for days afterwards. And this is not a bad thing, that is exactly how a movie about war should be. What is impressive about this movie is that it is 100% real, everything that happens is real and that is very obvious to the viewer which is why it is so beyond moving. This is a movie that will not leave anyone unaffected seeing that, even though it is fictional, all of what happens in this movie actually happened in history, but in an even bigger scale. This is what is frightening and what creates the feeling of unease. Klemov does not leave anything to the imagination of the viewer but show in a brutal way just what the Nazis did to the villages and the people in Byelorussia at the time which is a clever way to prevent the reader from ever being completely able to think that ""this is just a movie"". Horrible, clever, beautiful, frightening, real, absolutely beyond excellent - I cannot praise this movie enough."
"oshapiro24","10","5","5","9 February 2012"," A true story of World War II
","If there was a single movie that showed so much emotion, hardships, pain mentally and physically it was ""Come and See"". This movie truly showed the world how eastern Europeans fought and what they endured in order to protect their land from the Nazis. Taking place in Belarus, Florya did not show himself as a heroic soldier who fought for freedom and justice. Rather the 13 year old boy showed the audience what it means to be a boy in war torn Belarus. There was no heroism, no dramatic or artificial killing scenes done by Florya. He simply displayed the psychological and emotional pain that he endured as did the many other villagers. The goal of the movie was not to lavishly portray the Russians and fellow eastern Europeans defeating the Germans but rather show the fight that each soldier had on and off the battlefield. Both of my grandfathers served in the Red Army and fought in Belarus. This movie had one of the biggest impact of my life. I felt proud to be a native Russian because this movie was not propaganda movie. This movie showed the fighting spirit in an average boy. If I were to place myself in the same situation, I suspect I would be no different than Florya. Elem Klimov said : ""I understood that this would be a very brutal film and that it was unlikely that people would be able to watch it. I told this to my screenplay coauthor, the writer Ales Adamovich. But he replied: ""Let them not watch it, then. This is something we must leave after us. As evidence of war, and as a plea for peace."" One must never forget the tragedy and the great costs that took defending one's land from invaders. This movie calls for peace because in such a situation a young boy loses his innocence, his childhood in a brutalizing way. We must never forget the horrors. ""Come and See"" truly gave the world the true perspective of how people fought and the costs that they had to pay to be free. For me personally, this movie will always be engraved in my heart and mind."

","At first, Elem Klimov might seem a bit crazy to make such a film. Come and See is uncommon in the fact that its a war movie that doesn't glorify war like most films do. Come and See is set in Byelorussia during WWII. It depicts the terrible massacre that Nazi Germany carries out as they try to force their way through Byelorussia. Like most kids at that time, a young boy named Florya visions glory in protecting his land and fighting against the Nazis. After finding a gun, he leaves his family and joins a local amateur militia that dedicate themselves to protecting their land. As he gets involved in the war he soon realizes that war isn't as glorious as he thought it would be. Not until he finally is directly affected by the war he regrets ever being involved. As horrible as it might sound, I enjoyed the film. I didn't enjoy the gruesome damage that the Nazis left, but the fact that it didn't glorify war and that it isn't like most war movies. Klimov was genius enough to make this film even though it doesn't seem like it would be something that moviegoers would pay to watch. This film makes you feel as if you can almost smell the rotting corpses depicted within the film. Its easy to see that the film wasn't into the project for the money, but he was into it for the purpose of telling this terrible story. This is a film that I would recommend to a mature audience only due to the realistic blood and gore in the film."
"willied_kid","10","5","5","9 February 2011"," Come and See
","In the wake of Mikhail Gorbachev's watchwords ""Glasnost"" and ""Perestroika"" comes a film from director Elem Klimov, Come and See. This is one of the most gruesome war films ever made. It is an exceptionally powerful film that does not in any way glorify the horrors people experience in war.<br/><br/>Set in Byelorussia, a small country that experienced mass killings in over five hundred villages during the Second World War. In one village, a young boy called Florya (Aleksey Kravchenko) joins with the partisan army to fight the Nazi invaders.<br/><br/>The film starts with Florya digging around in old trenches. An old man screams out in anguish that he must stop; however, blinded by his dream to become a soldier, Florya eventually finds a weapon. This discovery triggers his village's ""participation"" in the war.<br/><br/>The importance of not glorifying the concept of war is present as the movie is shot on real locations, without any special effects, and the actors are really on location when the action is going on. This provides a very explicit depiction of the war's many horrors, which makes you want to take cover behind your seat.<br/><br/>The portrayal of Florya's transformation through the one of two weeks this story spans is an amazing cinematic accomplishment. By the end of it all, Florya looks to have aged at least thirty years, and the soldiers that at first only referred to him as the ""newcomer"" have now accepted him as a fellow soldier. The fate of his family, the old man and the rest of his village are all very moving, it will remain with you for a very long time.<br/><br/>It is also fascinating how Mikhail Gorbachev chooses to portray the Nazis in this film. Their inhumane actions speak for themselves but yet he gives them such a menacing touch. It is almost as if their side of the war is one big celebration. They seem to have a good time together and are fully enjoying themselves as they massacre people. Shooting, burning and sexually and mentally abusing their enemies, this under constant laughter and cheering.<br/><br/>But wait there is more. Mikhail Gorbachev is not done with you just yet; he actually finds a way to masterfully affect all of senses through both visual and auditory means. At one point, due to the bombs, Florya loses his hearing. When he gets his hearing back and from this point on there is an almost constant background sound playing. This adds to the feeling of shell-shock and that he is now almost apathetic. This together with the very realistic violence and psychological terrors this kid is exposed to makes you turn in your seat in unease several times.<br/><br/>It is not my intention to scare anyone away from watching this film, on the contrary. I do wish that people would dedicate some time to watch this, and perhaps you will also be able to break free from the shackles of Hollywood's glorification of war. I feel that no review could ever do justice to this legendary work of art. You really have to experience it."
"gutierrez_garrett_an","10","16","21","9 February 2011"," Absolutely haunting, possibly traumatizing
","If any movie can induce PTSD or reduce one's expected lifespan simply by viewing it, this is that film. I am not usually in favor of restricting movie viewership, but this is one film that I cannot rightfully recommend to any person under the age of 18. If I had watched this film when I was 12, I would have either created some sort of psychological barrier and have been unable to fully comprehend the events taking place, or I would have been emotionally damaged for life. Possibly both. After viewing ""Come and See"", I am a changed man. Though it contains no graphic sex, outright gore, or extensive vulgarity, ""Come and See"" is so powerful it's haunted me long after it ended. I've seen many horror movies (and even more war movies throughout my life, but no film I've ever seen even holds a candle to ""Come and See"" in terms of psychological trauma. I've heard stories about the horrors of the holocaust and of WWII, my grandfather was even in a concentration camp in Poland during the war- at the tender age of 14, about the same age as the main character in the film. I've read ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel, and I have seen ""Schindler's List,"" and though I felt great sorrow for the pain of those who lived through such terrible ordeals, at the end of the day all of the stories I'd heard resonated with me as just that; stories (very real stories, but stories nonetheless). This was not the case with ""Come and See."" Klimov's brilliant directing style is somehow capable of pulling you in and making you feel absolutely helpless against the surrounding evils. Not just sorrow and remorse for the characters, but complete empathy for their pain in a way that is indescribable. ""Schindler's List"" might be hard to get through at times, but you still remain fully cognizant of the screen separating you from the death and suffering you see. ""Come and See"" destroys that protective mechanism. As an audience member, you have no feelings of ""seeing"" the film through a lens, but you ""experience"" it like you might experience the effects of a hallucinogenic substance that latches onto your brain and changes the very chemicals that determine the way you view the world- in a way I would imagine that is similar to an LSD trip gone horribly wrong. I now have even greater compassion for my grandfather's ordeals, and cannot imagine what I would have done were I in the same position as he. The film raises serious questions about whether or not it is truly ""better"" to survive a massacre than die in it. Even if you walk out of this film, it's too late. Closing your eyes, covering your ears; all attempts at ignorance are pointless -because ""Come and See"" goes past your vision and hearing- it penetrates your very consciousness. If you've seen enough to want to turn off the film, it's already too late and you've already felt the film's power. By the end of it, there is no way you'll ever look at war the same way again, and you'll likely remember this film and its lessons for years to come. Every single person considering joining the military, and every single person capable of voting should watch this film, because I guarantee it will cause you to deeply reconsider the choices that could easily send thousands of men into similar situations you see unfolding in ""Come and See."" Though I am always in favor of watching all great movies at least twice, and though ""Come and See"" is nothing less than great (if not spectacular), it is one film I dread watching a second time. Be sure to have a pack of cigarettes, black coffee, and/or a stiff drink ready in hand before viewing this film."
"Bullet_Dodger","10","14","18","11 December 2011"," Come and see the masterpiece.
","There exist movies that within few opening scenes make me forget that I am watching a movie, that it is all make-believe, and that those are not real people but simply actors performing their craft. This movie is not one of those – it is beyond it. There are parts of it during which I caught myself stepping back from the immersion and almost forcefully suspending the suspension of disbelief. Such is the torment in it, but then again, that was the idea behind making this movie – to capture the horror of WWII and help us understand the scale of human destruction, physical as well as mental. I believe that there is no other movie in existence that does this better. I do not make this statement lightly. <br/><br/>Set in small Byelorussian village in 1943, a minuscule part of Soviet Union, the atrocities committed in it, combined with a statistic shown at the end of the movie will help you understand just how it is possible that tens of millions of people died, in Soviet Union alone. To try and imagine, to picture, one million people in front of you is daunting. Thirty million seems like a distant theoretical concept at best, of which our cognitive grasp is fully incapable. And yet, it happened. <br/><br/>Florian, a young boy – barely a teenager, is recruited by Soviet Partisans. Full of innocence, enthusiasm, and eagerness as only a young man can be, he says goodbye to his family, and walks as if on clouds, to join the rest of his garrison. Through his eyes and the rest of the senses, one by one, those traits will be viciously taken away, until the only thing left is a shell, the boy is long gone, and the person than stands before us is barely recognizable. But this new shell has a will of steel; to defend and fight back – to survive. <br/><br/>The story and the level of acting are not the only impressive components of this 1985 film. The way it is shot and its unique sound complete the elements that are required of every epic. In his introduction of this film to us, my film professor stated that in watching it, you will be able to smell, almost taste, the gore. I, of course, did not say anything, simply thought that perhaps he is slightly exaggerating, trying to get us to pay closer attention to the film. Two things – I was wrong; if anything he undersold it, and two – a great deal of concentration, in a way, is not really necessary for this film. Even if you are an average movie-lover, rest assured that this masterpiece will grab a hold of you until it possesses you fully, and then not let go for next two hours. <br/><br/>All of you are familiar with ""Saving private Ryan."" Most of you will remember the great scene where true burden of war presents itself – Tom Hanks' character loses any remaining sanity, goes deaf, and starts shooting his small Colt handgun at an oncoming German Tiger tank. Guess where Steven Spielberg got the inspiration for that scene? Yep, you guessed right. Now imagine the psychological and emotional level of that twenty-minute scene spread out to two thirds of a movie. Guess in which movie this actually happens? Right again.<br/><br/>""Come and See"" is easily one of the greatest films ever made. With any great film that scars me, I ponder the meaning of its title. While it contains biblical references, in writing this review, I realized its, oh so simple, meaning. ""Come and See"" what war is really like. ""Come and See"" what it really does to men. <br/><br/>Finally, this film succinctly illustrates the reason behind my eternal gratefulness that Hollywood is not the only worldly entity making movies. Because, and let's get this clear, this movie could have never ever come from Hollywood, and yes, they really killed a cow."
"tieman64","Null","40","60","11 July 2007"," Makes Schindler's List look like Sesame Street
","Elem Klimov directs ""Come and See"". While the film predominantly follows the rites-of-passage journey of a young boy, it is remarkable how often and effortlessly Klimov shifts visual perspective, offering us the objective and subjective states of a wide range of characters and objects. <br/><br/>For example, in one of the films most surreal scenes, several characters are shown guiding a cow across what seems to be open and unguarded terrain. Suddenly a series of intense firefights break out. Several characters are killed, but it is the fate of the cow with which the film is most preoccupied.<br/><br/>The images of the cow standing untouched by the raging skirmish, then struck by a barrage of bullets, and finally of its eyes rapidly shifting and dilating before death, are indicative of ""Come and See's"" ability to produce indelible images from what are often quite standard war film situations. Like Malick, Klimov is as much interested in the landscape (and the objects and people that inhabit it), as he is in representing the minutiae and widening horror of his protagonist's journey from home to the multiple sites of slaughter and genocide that mar his countryside.<br/><br/>The journey of a wide-eyed innocent across apocalyptic terrain is common territory for the war film (Ichikawa's ""The Burmese Harp"", Tarkovsky's ""Ivan's Childhood"", ""The Human Condition"" etc), but Klimov is going for a much more macabre tone, bludgeoning us with the sheer intensity and sick morbidity of his images.<br/><br/>Unlike, say, ""Schindler's List"", ""Come and See"" is also remarkable for its use of abstract colour and sound. This is not a realist film; its shocks and effects are more dreamlike, from the mutedness of its burnished cinematography, to the extraordinary close-ups of several of its characters' impossibly aged faces, to the hyper expressive performances of many of its actors, to the impressionistic and at times almost expressionistic use of sound. <br/><br/>In this context, the title of the film is not just a call for audiences to bear witness, to ""see"" that which is not imaginable, that which has little visual record, and to get a sense of the physical conditions (the ""come"" of the title) experienced by those during the war, but a description or pointer towards the more spectatorial expectations of the film. Of course the order ""come and see"" also functions as an exploitative challenge; ""Come and see if you dare!"" Indeed, many Chinese war-porn/propaganda films feature eerily similar titles.<br/><br/>The film is essentially an epic journey and many of its images possess an almost Dantesque quality. It can also be seen as a ""coming of age"" film, a remarkable ""coming"" or progression (or is it regression?) that is etched upon the utterly transformed face of its central character. <br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, Spielberg screened ""Come and See"" several times for cast and crew prior to shooting his Holocaust film. ""See"" would prove a huge influence on Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"", ""Schindler's List"", ""Wr Horse"" and ""Private Ryan"", in its mixture of child-like innocence (lots of dollying in to the shocked children's faces) and brutality. This is the worst aspect of Klimov's legacy, his film opening the doorway for an onslaught of other shock-porn movies - all the way to Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" - all of which pretend to be history lessons and important ""humane"" testimonies, when in reality they simply use progressions in technology to escalate violence levels, push tolerance levels and are built around a primary need to jolt apathetic, desensitised audiences. Hilariously, as war-porn gets more hard-core, in real life the numbers of genocides, wars and atrocities demonstrably increase, whilst media coverage decreases and public apathy increases. This is the mistake of all ""war films"": people don't repeat because they forget (the implication being that we must therefore shock ourselves into awareness), we forget because we repeat (see ""The Shining""). The human animal needs denial more than food.<br/><br/>So while ""Come and See"" and its Spielberg imitators lack any real historical depth, complexity, nuance, understanding of human beings, and trade in simple exploitation, they also possess a kind of psychological naivety, perhaps best exemplified by Klimov's final scene, in which a kid essentially refuses to shoot a young Hitler. WW2's engine had little to do with Hitler, but here he's reduced to the genesis of evil, the seed from which WW2 blossoms.<br/><br/>Though commissioned by the Soviet Union as a propaganda piece, ""Come and See"" was made shortly prior to the fall of the Iron Curtain, a period in which artists had a certain amount of freedom. Klimov's films is thus at times self consciously a meditation on Stalinist war films. In this regard the film literally begins upon the beach where Tarkovsky's ""Ivan"" ends, from where it attempts to create a new ""war narrative"", shunting aside Stalinist glorification for a kind of psychological shell shock. The result, though, is basically a Soviet version of ""Men Behind the Sun"", the infamous Chinese propaganda film in which we're called to bear witness to the activities of sadistic Japanese soldiers. In Klimov's case - the film focuses on the Nazi atrocities in Byelorussia - we leer at sadistic, vile, rapacious, murderous and cowardly Nazis while Communist partisans are portrayed as playful, comradely and righteous people. If a countries leadership willingly sided with the Germans from 1939-41, invaded countries (Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Finland etc) carried out numerous atrocities against other nations and their own people and supported the Gulag system, then the viewer needs to be extremely careful when they view material that has been officially sanctioned by that leadership.<br/><br/>8/10 - Worth one viewing."
"MrVibrating","10","22","31","2 November 2006"," Depressing, mind-boggling and unique
","Idri I Smotri is the most horrifying war movie you'll ever see. No, I have not seen every war movie but I've seen many and none of them were remotely close to this.<br/><br/>If an American war movie is considered anti-war, you usually see really gruesome stuff happening to soldiers. American movie wars are fought in computer servers, a totally unpopulated battlefield were the troops can run around and kill each other. If a movie shows bad stuff happening to civilians, it's always limited and often implied.<br/><br/>Idri I Smotri goes all out and shows you the whole thing. Rape, murder, massacre, brutality in every way imaginable. There is very little plot, a tool to further show the randomness and confusion of war. The happenings on screen are often bizarre and unexpected, and dialog is confused, desperate, hopeless and often barely human.<br/><br/>On top of the ghastly pictures is a whine, drone, noise, call it what you will. I'm guessing someone call's it ""soundtrack"" but that's too generous. It's nauseating, and very effective.<br/><br/>Acting is extremely believable, characters feel real as life. That doesn't mean they are likable, rational or enjoyable, but they're undoubtedly there, experiencing first-hand what we are seeing filtered through or TV screen.<br/><br/>I will never forget this movie. It leaves a mental scar in your mind which takes a few days to recover from and you'll probably never recover fully. If you've seen movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or ""We were soldiers"" and felt they were too strong, DON'T watch this movie. If you never feel terribly affected by movies, well, you'll soon know what it's like."
"EVOL666","9","23","33","16 July 2006"," One Of THE Most Powerful Films I've Ever Seen...
","First off - I will readily admit my ""ignorance"" to the actual historical facts of the state-of-affairs in Europe and Russia during the time-frame in which COME AND SEE is set. I do know ""some"" of what was going on during WWII (as I'm not a completely illiterate moron...) but I won't even begin to try to come off as erudite as some reviewers who obviously know FAR more about world-history than I do. Instead - I will approach this review strictly from the viewpoint of a film-fan. That said - COME AND SEE is definitely one of the most harrowing films that I've ever come across. Being mainly an ""underground"" horror fan - I've made it my life's work to seek out the most sickening, disturbing, twisted, nihilistic films that could possibly be laid to film - and honestly - the few films that have actually ""touched a nerve"" with me, typically are not by definition ""horror"" films at all - but then again - if these types of films can't be considered in the realm of ""horror"" - then what truly can??? <br/><br/>COME AND SEE revolves around Flor - a young boy living in Beylorussia during WWII. We learn early on that Flor is eager to ""fight the good fight"" of his countrymen against the pending onslaught of German invading soldiers, but unfortunately for Flor - he is unexpectedly thrust into situations that he could not have possibly been ready for - as I'm sure is the case in reality for anyone who experiences war first-hand. To avoid spoiling any of the truly memorable scenes - I will just say that the rest of the film is spent following Flor as he single-handedly escapes his own death numerous times until the conclusion, where he meets back up with his comrades...<br/><br/>I don't even know where to begin with all the good points about COME AND SEE. The acting is INCREDIBLE by everyone involved - more-so than I would have ever thought possible from such young actors (particularly) portraying such complicated and devastating roles and situations. The cinematography is incredibly bleak and perfectly captures the hopeless and helpless environs of war-torn Russia (at least I guess they do - as I wasn't there...) - there is not one second in the film where you question the authenticity of the surroundings. There is really no ""gore"" to speak of - but the more ""horrifying"" scenes are captured so perfectly, that no amount of ""blood-n-guts"" could have really made the film better (and this coming from a certifiable gore/sleaze-head). If I had to pick ANY negative issues with the film - I would say that there are scenes in the beginning that are SO haunting, that towards the middle the film loses a bit of momentum, causing even some of the stronger end-scenes to not have as much ""power"". I also feel that the very last sequence (shooting the Hitler picture mixed with actual Holocaust footage) was a bit of propaganda-overkill that was unnecessary as I felt that I had already CLEARLY gotten the message. Those two aspects alone drop COME AND SEE a half point in my book. But regardless - this is an ABSOLUTELY incredible film that I can't recommend enough - just understand that you will most likely come away from it emotionally drained - which to me is one of the highest achievements that cinema can provide...9.5/10"

"david-byrne","10","9","11","20 December 2011"," A truly outstanding film
","Rarely does a film like this come along. In fact, it puts a whole new dimension in film making. Although the film starts out somewhat slow, the viewer is immersed into the realism of rural life and partisans in Belorussia during WW2. As the film evolves, the viewer experiences to some extent the bleakness created by the German invasion of the Soviet Union. The bleakness suddenly turns to chaos and then a level of brutality only a Hun could be proud of, where all senses of morality and decency are absent. The acting in superb, even down to the facial expressions of the partisans. Rarely do you find such fine acting, even in the West. But of course one must consider most of actors would be well educated in the Nazi occupation of Belorussia and the evil unleashed from the monsters who killed off a third of the population of Belorussia. A sense of anger and even hopelessness is felt watching this intense war film. The film exposes in a very bad light another chapter of German crimes against humanity few in the West have learned of, crimes for which Germany can never repay now or in the future. The camera work is brilliant in the film, where the bleakness is highlighted in dull tones throughout. I would strongly advise children do not watch this film - it is simply too disturbing, to the extent it makes Saving Private Ryan look like a G-rated cartoon show. Even adults with a conscience would have difficulty coming to terms with the brutality of war as shown in this film. I suggest too the viewer researches further the German atrocities in Russia in World War 2."
"dbborroughs","9","21","30","19 January 2008"," One of the greatest war films ever made
","I needed to have two hours and twenty odd minutes to watch this with out interruption. I didn't want to break it for any real reason or for any real length of time other than to change the disc (more on that later).<br/><br/>I had the time so I watched the movie.<br/><br/>I could argue that with two small flaws this is one of the greatest anti-war films ever made.<br/><br/>This is the SUBJECTIVE story of a boy who joins the partisans during the German invasion of Russian and his decent into hell.<br/><br/>This is a tough movie. its in your face and everyone else's, literally as we see everyone and everything that our hero does even to the point that if he's talking to someone the camera will hold on them as they speak with no cut aways. We learn everything about people by their faces since we have the time to study them. This is simply one of the few times where even if the film had had a different aspect ratio other than 1.33 (tv shape) I would rally to have it full screen rather than letterbox simply because for this movie you MUST lose yourself in what you see and hear. Having someone facing you, looking at you is more powerful when all you can see is their face. Faces are a landscape in this film.<br/><br/>This is especially true of Floyra, our hero who's stunned expression at all that happens around him is a constant source of wonderment.As we as shocked and rattled by what we see we know that he is even more rattled because he is there and he is expressing it on his face. Its said he was hypnotized to be able to get the right expressions, and seeing the pain on his face I believe it since you could only express what he is by living through it... Wide eyed numbness his mouth sometimes agape we watch as he tries to just get on...<br/><br/>The film as I said is subjective and we see and hear, literally, what Floyra does. When his hearing is thrown askew by shelling what we hear becomes less distinct. Sound will drift in and out and we get a sense of being there. The camera also holds on some scenes at times Not cutting away for better angles simply because Floyra doesn't have them.<br/><br/>This film will rock your world and then some.<br/><br/>I want to tell you everything about the film but at the same time fear that doing so will set up expectations as to what happens. Reading the material on the film and seeing the trailer set up some expectations in my mind, some of which was right and some was wrong. I would like to have you see the film knowing as little about what actually happens as possible so you experience the film straight. I lost my expectations the minute the film began and I was wondering what was going on... I was hooked as the long strange trip took over. I'm certain that once the film stats you will be free of expectations too but, at the same time I think if I told you too much it would ruin the what happens next.<br/><br/>This is GREAT film making.<br/><br/>That said there are two small flaws.<br/><br/>First, as some reviews have said the Germans, when they finally show up on screen are just a tad cartoony. menacing but slightly cartoonish...I could be wrong... but regardless through it all Floyra's pained expression cuts the cartoon away and reminds us this is bad stuff going down.<br/><br/>The second flaw is a montage of actual footage used near the very end. I know why it was done, or can guess, but its too long. It breaks the spell in some ways... I think it would have been more apt had the film had the original desired title of ""Kill Hitler"".<br/><br/>The last point I want to make is the fact the film is on two DVDs. Released two years ago there is no logical reason for the film to be broken into two parts, the tape is a single cassette release, except that like many films from the Russian Film Council its loaded with subtitles, 13 languages and three audio options. There is also other extras like an introduction by the film maker that runs 20 minutes, documentary footage and an interview with the lead actor. But I digress....<br/><br/>I'm certain that the film doesn't really need to be in two parts for any reason other than a technical one... except that in a strange way the break sort of works for the film if you watch it straight through taking only a break to switch discs. Call me crazy but the break is perfectly placed at the mid point to the story. Not only that the film changes from first half to second half. The tone , even though continuous in action, is different as the second disc begins. Its almost as if we are back at the beginning of the film at a peak that slowly slides downward. Time wise the two halves are different with the action taking place over a couple of jumbled days while the second is one continuous series of events over two days.<br/><br/>In the end all that matters is the film.<br/><br/>And here the film is absolutely great.<br/><br/>See it and be moved.<br/><br/>----------------------------------- random thoughts In its way its comparable to grave of fireflies The film that many people compare it to, Destiny of a Man, is a relation but not direct ancestor of it simply because the films are very different, Destiny taking place over years in Flashback, Come and See is happening here and now over weeks. They share themes and elements but the thrust and points are different, especially in the end..."

","I saw this movie many years ago and scenes still remain imprinted on my mind. Though it was still made in the USSR, in was made when the winds of glasnost were starting to well and truly blow. The movie whilst still sticking to the maxim that the Soviets were the good guys, nevertheless portrays the casual brutality of partisan warfare in a realistic unromantic way.<br/><br/>The SS ""action"" in the Belarussian village is one of the most disturbing depictions of the second world war ever directed outside of the real footage of these things. The SS troops are on a anti-partisan operation and enter the Belarussian village. The next 10-15 minutes remained in my memory for many years after. Though the suffering of the occupied peoples under Nazi's was often used for pro-Soviet propaganda in art and film, even if it was the case in this film, the sheer horror of these scenes transcends the political.<br/><br/>2 scenes are particularly powerful in this section of the film:<br/><br/>The scene were the SS officer lunches in a village hut, in front of a cowering peasant family, desperate to placate the soldiers, is quite terrifying and suspenseful and all the more effective for the violence that does eventually occur.<br/><br/>Secondly, at the end of the slaughter,the Nazi soldiers are seen laughing carry out on a bed an old bedridden blind babushka lady from a burning farmhouse. They make some horrible joke about saving her to be a breeder, and as the village burns behind her she is observed blindly staring into the smoke filled sky full of incomphrehensible terror.<br/><br/>From memory the movie does lapse into propaganda abit heavily at the end. Nevertheless at the end of the film the credits list the number of Belarussian villages destroyed (buildings and people)....I cant remember the exact number but it was hundreds and it is quite a sobering figure....regardless of the Soviet spin the film is valuable in shining a light into a dark corner of mans inhumanity to fellow man."

(by JSwallowX1 from Ireland)<br/><br/>So, we can sum it all up in the lines below (adding some groovy spice will also help).<br/><br/>Being a piece of blunt Soviet propaganda, the film is devoid of any historical accuracy and artistic merit. It's dull and tedious with an uninteresting main character (who has absolutely no background and is free from any development – either physical or mental). Who cares about some kid during the war times? Give us a HERO, not a whimpering child! This ""war"" flick is neither entertaining nor serious. Its fictional happenings (women and children burnt in the barns by the Nazis? come on, in reality it was vice versa! read the historical documents!) pump up to the levels of ""Star Wars"" with one serious difference: ""Star Wars"" was at least thought-provoking and shocking. There is no decent music in the movie at all and the whole soundtrack cries out to get turned off. The last straw that could break any camel's back (i.e. insult any viewer's ears) was some cheap melody at the end of the flick. The whole movie is boring to such degree that any normal human being will yawn and fall asleep during the initial 10 minutes. If you want to see a real feat for the eyes and ears, watch the documentary ""Der Ewige Jude"", which IS a masterpiece at all levels and on top of everything has realistic cow scenes (unlike this one). Watch any USA picture with the WWII topic – they are not many, but at least they represent the historical facts and show us WHO won the World War II and at WHAT unspeakable price... The Russians exaggerate things immensely, making the events going on on their territory look like some kind of annihilation. Nonsense. The Germans were never cruel during the WWII on the USSR territory and they always behaved in a most decent manner. It was Russian troops who were deranged killers (there is even a historically accurate photo of a Russian soldier bullying a poor German woman and robbing her of her bicycle! and it happened in the streets of Berlin when the war was over! Check out the I-net archive footage if you don't believe! just imagine WHAT was happening during the war days!). The verdict: if you are a sane civilized and thinking European, stay far away from this schmoopy fantasy.<br/><br/>Do You agree? What do You know about the WWII? How empty is Your vision? To which extent are Your brains brainwashed and ""freed""?<br/><br/>Any further comment is superfluous. Actually, this movie does not need any review or comment. But our today's way of life needs it badly. And today's cinema.<br/><br/>Thank you for attention."

"itzelcastillo84","10","4","4","10 February 2012"," A movie about the people behind war. not war itself
","There have been few films that have left me pondering for days after and which have left my heart pounding incessantly hours after watching it. This has been one of those few films and it brought this reaction because of the incredible way in which it made the audience use all of their senses. From the beginning, you begin to wonder what is this movie about? All you see are two boys playing in the sand and pretending to be soldiers and you might think that it will be a movie about war. And then, Flor finds that rifle and you see the Nazi plane flying overhead and you realize that this is not just a war movie; it is a movie about the loss of innocence and the tragedy and horror that war brings to everyone – whether they chose to be a part of it or not.<br/><br/>And we see that Flor chose to become a part of the partisans in their fight against Hitler and once again, we begin to think: perhaps the film will be about Flor and the horror he goes through as he fights in the battlefield. However, once again, when Flor is left behind, we see that this film will not be in the battlefield. Instead, we get to see all of the pain that Flor must go through as he returns home, as he realizes what he has lost, and as he fights to stay alive. And up to a point, we see that Flor is still smiling. Though we see and feel his pain, we see him still laughing as him and his 'friend' go to still a cow. To me, this was one of the most important scenes, because throughout this whole instance, we only see Flor as he laughs and is joyful about they have just done. The camera work done as they show the point of view of the friend as he sees Flor in one continues long take was incredible to me. It showed how much innocence and happiness this small boy still felt even after having gone through the horror he had already seem. And yet, this is the last instance in which we see Flor smile and laugh.<br/><br/>After this, everything else makes you feel the war as if you were there. You can feel and touch and smell everything that is happening to the point that, for me, perhaps you cannot fathom how humans can ever commit such atrocities. The burning villages brought back to me images from one other film that has had effects like these on me – Schindler's List. For a few seconds after seeing that, all I could think of were the faces and corpses of the Jewish population who fell victim to the Nazis – images which were then imprinted onto my mind when Flor shoots Hitler's picture. From the whole movie, this last scene to me, was the most powerful. It made me even more aware of the humanity that this small, innocent boy had lost because of war. And what made this more powerful was how he aged so fast in this film, because it was true. By the end of this movie, he was no longer a boy. He was a grown man who had seen and felt far more than what any of us could imagine."
"milkandtea","10","4","4","9 February 2011"," Haunting yet thought provoking
","Prior to watching this movie, I was told to prepare to be shocked. Now that I've watched it, I realized why I was warned about this movie.<br/><br/>This film embarks on Florya's journey of WWII Byelorrusia in the most astound way possible. The film begins with an opening line of ""Are you crazy?"", a question the audience will subconsciously ask over the course of the movie. Klimov does not glorify war in the movie; depictions of pain, suffering and agony is shown in the film. Our emotions are instantly indulged into the screen through the stylistic use of overloading our senses along with the soundtrack. As I watched the scene of Florya and Glasha walking through the swamp, I felt as if I was struggling in the dirty mud with them. For such a simple act of walking through a swamp, Klimov made the scene haunting for the audience, among with many other horrific scenes. From the glimpse of the piles of dead bodies to the bombs accompanied with silence, I felt a sense of uneasiness, literally as if I was in a nightmare.<br/><br/>As Florya's life as a soldier is exposed, we see him age significantly. This transition contrasts with his introduction, where he is shown as a naive kid. During this stage, close-up reaction shots of his face are shown where he stares into the camera, as if he was looking through the camera lens. He almost looks like he's in trance, thus evoking an uneasy, odd feeling in the audience. We see the terror of war affecting him even more as he loses his humanity along the way. When he spots an woman in agony, he doesn't help her, but fixes his gun instead. As an audience, we question whether or not Florya should have listened to his mother. Is his journey on war worth affecting his sanity and humanity?<br/><br/>No, The swamp scene was not easy for me to watch. Did I want to see piled up dead bodies behind Florya's house? No, I did not. Though it was unappealing, those moments were powerful and truthful. The shock and disturbance instantly made the movie unforgettable and evoke a splurge of emotions at the same time. The graphic depiction is not glamorized in a formulaic way, therefore an aspect of realism is injected. As a result, I was able to understand the true nature of war.<br/><br/>For instance, the most meaningful scene of the movie was shown at the end when Florya shoots at a portrait of Hiltler as an act of a symbolic purge. Through the gunshots, a montage of Hitler is shown. We first see corpses in concentration camps and a marching sea of Nazis. It eventually transcends back into Hitler's early life as a child, then finally a shot of him as a baby on his mother's lap. He then stops shooting as he realizes that Hitler was once a child and retains a sense his humanism. At this point, I asked myself again: Is his journey on war worth affecting his sanity and humanism? Is it worth it to go through all that violence?<br/><br/>Well, the question is answered when he makes the choice to join the Partisians at the end. It was surprising at first that anyone would join the war again after all that trauma, however I finally understood the message. The cyclical nature of Florya is shown as he transitions from a boy to an adult in the war, consequently making his own conscious decision. Although Klimov shows the cruelty of war, the point was not to discourage the audience to join the army, but rather expose the reality of war so that the right decision can be made. If one is to join, one must understand that suffering is inevitable, therefore we must have a purpose. This powerful message enforced on me even more as I saw the juxtaposition of the Nazis drinking and applauding in contrast with the villagers were being burnt, almost treating it like a party rather than acting upon for a purpose. This movie was a wake up call as the message was universal - the war did not only happen in Byelorrusia. War still happens at the present day. While I was thankful that I did not go through that terror, the reality is that those in WWII did. The fundamental message does not only impact Florya, but to the audience as well, especially those interested in being an army solider. We finally understand that if we choose to go through brutality and suffering, we must be willing to fight for a cause."

""Empire of sun"", is directed by Steven Spielberg, is similar narrative structure with ""come and see"" like child's growing up, but ""Come and See"" show more realistic and we can feel how war is worst thing. Obviously, this film focuses on Florya. All directing factors like sound, shooting, editing, and location relate in him. Also, during his close up shot, usually he looked at to audience. It looks like he said that we should recognize how war is bad ""Come and See"" is masterpiece of War film, but it is not good with girlfriend or family."

It clearly deserves a 10 out of 10, but at the same time it's such an assault on your senses that it's almost un-watchable. And it's a long movie. I had to watch it in two parts over two evenings. I couldn't handle the whole movie in one sitting. I felt like Alex in A Clockwork Orange. Throughout the entire movie I never stopped thinking, ""What the F#ck?"" because everything the Nazis did was What The F#ck. Schindler's List was an assault on your heart. Come and See is an assault on your mind. The protagonist lives from one WTF moment to the next and you wonder how anyone wouldn't lose their mind. I kept thinking, ""What the f#ck am I watching?

This change, makes this 12-13 year old boyage about 40 years in a matter of a few days. To endure such horror and atrocity, would definitely create such a drastic distortion to anyone. To have a film, that has the ability to even convey such profound and surreal emotionmaking us, the audience, able to feel, hear, smell and perhaps taste.. is quite daunting. One must realize, that the story line perishes, and we literally feel as if we are trapped in a nightmare, in which there is no escape. Klimov's micro cosmic approach to this specific war, was quite intense; to even think he only showed one village, out of the 628 that were brutally executedto put simplyis incredibly agonizing. I recommend this movie to all, because it will truly leave an imprint on your views towards war, and violence or humanity overall."
"xenia-shin","10","8","10","10 February 2012"," ""Why? Why?""
","I am always haunted by the idea that torture, murder, rape, war -- these thefts upon human dignity -- are of a surety happening now, simultaneously, somewhere in the world, but the illusion of distance makes it so that the reality of their existence does not intrude upon our thoughts as we go about our day. For the majority of us in the USA, our struggles are rarely near the thin line of life and death. <br/><br/>Even though the SS invasion of Byelorussia and the genocidal extermination of its people by the Nazis happened in 1943, Klimov's film Come and See encapsulates war so realistically that it tears down that very illusion of distance. Ripping away the curtain of reality and ""sanity,"" we are faced with the very real issue of life and death -- that thing which we are hardwired to avoid. After watching Come and See and ""staring death in the face,"" as Yeats put it, I was enveloped in a mood which ultimately made feel the preciousness of life and peace.<br/><br/>If you see the film it may make you seriously consider whether it would not be better to be dead than to live and to witness the absolute desecration of the human image (particularly in the famous scene when the peasants are herded into a church and burned alive by the Nazis). This is magnified by the fact that we see the events through the eyes of a boy turning into a man, the 13-year old boy Florya. As the film unfolds his eyes look as though they cannot take anymore -- yet there is more and he, we, are forced to go beyond this limit. At one point, eyes full of agony, he clutches his head as though it would explode. Yet there is nowhere for him to hide -- and perhaps something does explode within that shell of a body...<br/><br/>Some elements of the film which lingered long after its viewing included the leitmotif of the Nazi fighter plane - it is hypnotic the way the plane flies overhead, a symbol of strength, almost cleanliness, of technology, impersonal and god-like and untouchable in its power to destroy (we do see one grounded later on however). Its removal from us on the ground, in the mud, who are fighting for life which it has the power to give and take away. Its constant accompanying hum, in some distant way reminiscent of the sound of the flies that hover around the kitchen when Florya returns to his home. The hum of the plane was so otherworldly it gets inside your body and makes you feel war's unrelenting tension and fear.<br/><br/>Another scene that stayed with me: the cow that Florya steals is gunned down and he falls asleep next to it in the night after the deadly onslaught of machine gun fire -- one could almost feel the warmth and safety of that dead carcass. The way you see the white hairs on the cow in the light of the morning when Florya wakes up the next day. A moment of respite with the world upside down as Florya tries to tear the cow apart.<br/><br/>I have seen some reviews comment on the ""reversal footage"" scene of Hitler as a failure, yet I think that if you look at it not as a segment in itself but as part of the sequence preceding it and continuing into the next, then it is necessary: It is preceded by the villagers shooting the Nazis rather than torturing them, hence holding on to their humanity, and then you also see Flyora refrain from shooting the infant Hitler. Those acts are the only thing I think that can allow for one to imagine peace for those thousands who were killed.<br/><br/>There is the slightest solace at the end, with the sight of the snow in the forest (a symbol of the coming defeat of the Nazis) and the music as the camera moves through the forest. In fact, the film made me listen to Mozart's Lacrimosa in a completely different way - though familiar with the music I don't believe I had ever perceived the absolute scale of this composition before, but as it plays and you yourself remember the nameless, numberless thousands that were killed in this way, you felt its greatness in speaking for you, that it can contain all these images of suffering and so beautifully plead to give the dead rest."
"username-taken","10","8","10","11 December 2011"," The PERFECT war movie
","Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is the brilliant film that pioneered the use of cinematic tools to replicate shockingly realistic elements in many war movies and video games that fascinate us today. <br/><br/>Klimov omits the juvenile use of musical tracks, and instead opts to use amplified sound effects ─ most intriguingly during the bombing scene in Act 1 where Klimov simulates the main character's deafness through manipulated magnetic tape. <br/><br/>As hyperbolic as it might sound, the movie is even more brutal than ""Schindler's List"". Klimov follows the main character's transition from fragile, innocent teenager, to a psychologically disturbed, traumatized, terrified young man after enduring the horrors of war. <br/><br/>""Come and See"" commemorates the 40th anniversary of Russia's victory against the Nazis. Interestingly, what is most attractive about this film is how Klimov stays clear of the over-romanticized ""war hero"" plot in an effort to articulate the need for peace, as opposed to glorify the synthetic triumphs of war.<br/><br/>The film is truly progressive in style without sacrificing its dramatic value, on the contrary, enhancing it. It is without exaggeration among the best movies I have ever seen."

Having grown up in a war zone, I was taken back to those days. I knew the look in Florya's eyes. I had seen it in the eyes of people I grew up with. I recognized his responses, as they were so very similar to the ones taken by the survivors around me. I felt the heaviness in the atmosphere, felt the moments laden with life or death for simple actions. Not many words in this film, yet so expressive. It takes you into the life of a young adolescent and you get to live his life and the horrors that he goes through. You see him age before your very eyes. It's not about the physical aspects of war, not about the artillery, the noise, the heroes, but its effects on the soul. That's what stays with you."

The regiment was commanded by notorious alcoholic sadist, murderer and pervert Oskar Dirlewanger, who was (probably) beaten to death by his guards in 1945.<br/><br/>Mainly from the POV of Florian, a twelve(?)-year-old boy who digs up a rifle in order to join the Soviet partisans.

What's left to your imagination - including the obvious multiple rape of the young heroine Rose, destroying any idea Florian had of a heroic partisan romance - is more than enough.<br/><br/>Towards the end, we see the rise of Hitler in reverse, which owes something to its Soviet propaganda origins, but this doesn't detract from the sheer emotional power of the whole film.

"julie-913","10","6","7","26 July 2012"," The Spirit Of Russia & The Microcosm Of A Childs Innocence
","""Come and See"", a film directed by Elem Klimov is the paradigm of anti-war films; brutal, sober, and gut-wrenching. From the darkest moments of the film (The Church being burnt to ashes) to the ""lightest"" moments of the film (Flyora and Glasha laughing at each other), Klimov never lets go of the hell bound gas pedal.<br/><br/>Director: Elem Klimov, born July 9th, 1933, lived during the Battle of Stalingrad. In fact, his mother, her baby, and himself, had to evacuate from their home on a makeshift raft in order to survive (Wikipedia). Klimovs experience with this displacement is very apparent in Flyoras attempt to survive; florya is constantly leaving new friends and safe places in order to survive at all costs. Yet, what truly makes Klimov a special director is his unusual attempts to eek every last drop of acting out of Flyora and Glasha. For instance, Klimov has allegedly hypnotized Kravchenko to make him gaze empty looks of depression and hopelessness. As well, in the scene where Flyora and Glasha attempt to cross the boggy swamp, Klimov allegedly told the child actors to attempt to cross and all he would do is roll the camera. Talk about method direction! <br/><br/>Sound Track: Although most amateur directors think capturing images is the most important part of the film, what you hear is just as important. Of course, images from ""Come and See"" are astounding (Such as the long take of them walking across the swamp), but in that scene, it is the soundtrack that makes it even more dramatic and sensational. The swelling of low frequencies and the rumbling of muddy sounds feed off an eerie vibe that this swamp is not your average swamp; it is a death trap, sucking in hopeless children closer and closer to their death. And without the shrieks and moans of Glasha -- the yelps for parents that are dead, the moans for Gods that aren't there, the cries for friends that are murdered -- Come and See would not be the riveting and disturbing film it is. The sound track sets a tone of discomfort, where sitting in my chair watching the movie, it was the deep haunting frequencies that chilled my bones just as much as the fear stricken Russians.<br/><br/>Acting: Just as Italian Neo-Realist used amateur actors to convey a more gritty realism (Such as in films like the Bicycle Thieves directed by Vittorio De Sica), Klimov pulled Flyora and Glasha from Russias streets to star in his daunting epic. While this may seem crazy -- the idea of giving two amateur child actors the lead in a film -- the soul of Russia and real knowledge of the Mother countries sufferings translated seamlessly to their characters actions. In fact, Kravchenkos acting was so ""method"" that his hair turned blonde during filmmaking, and once again, he was under hypnosis nearly 50% of the time. While most people can easily look ""scared"" or ""depressed"" if they are an experienced actor, the gut feeling and soul feeling of knowing the unimaginable terror of war seen through the eyes can only be accomplished by either the $20 million dollar actors or the real actors who know the Russian war story. <br/><br/>Cinematography: The cinematography in ""Come and See"" is miraculous. At least every frame in the film deals with one of the five senses; smell, touch, taste, sight, hearing. Obviously, hearing and seeing are the easiest, but it the smell, touch, and taste that are more difficult to come by. In one scene where Flyora is back in his home and after it has been raided by Germans, he sits down at his table and eats food. Yet, it is clear to Glasha, and unclear to him, that his family has been kidnapped as everything in the house is thrown around and flies buzz in every corner. In this moment, viewers can smell the rotten stench of sweat, tears, spit, blood, and bad food just from the buzzing of flies, the eerie colors of the house, and the bloodied teddy bears strewn on the floor. When Glasha and Flyora walk through the swamp, viewers can almost touch the swamp, feeling the sticky and disgusting feel of thick mud encompassing their tiny bodies and wrapping around them, sucking them down into dirty brown water as it seeps through their childish pores. Even more, you can taste the burnt flesh of the village farmer as he lays on the ground with his skin rotting away and burnt to shreds. These scenes are not just haunting for their images, but for how the cinematography interacts with more than 3 of viewers senses at all times.<br/><br/>Overall, Come and See is a brilliant war story that never truly leaves the viewer for years to come. Nothing has ever scarred my mind and changed my views on war than ""Come and See"". To physically watch the life be sucked out of a child, not just in film, but in reality as well, is the most disturbing and saddening faucets of life. Eat before you see the film, because ""Come and See"" will definitely take you down a haunting, chilling, journey into the world of death and the city of hell."

","THE terrible central event of ''Come and See,'' which takes up about a quarter of the 2-hour, 22-minute Soviet movie, is the burning of a Byelorussian village by German invaders in 1943. A line on the screen tells us that hundreds of villages in the Soviet republic east of Poland were destroyed, their people annihilated. The history is harrowing and the presentation is graphic; you feel it through your body as villagers are packed into a barn to be incinerated. <br/><br/>Powerful material, powerfully rendered by the director and co-writer Elem Klimov, yet the scene goes on for so long with such heavy-handed intrusions that you are left with a feeling of being worked on - which means the effects have stopped working. So it is with the movie as a whole, which won a grand prize at the 1985 Moscow international film festival. <br/><br/>In episodes that shift, sometimes subtly, sometimes startlingly, from down-in-the-mud realism to a dreamlike state, a boy named Florya endures the German invasion. His family is slaughtered; a friend, a beautiful young woman who wants only love and babies, is raped; he joins the partisans, is captured and nearly killed. He is our witness to the savagery of the Nazi onslaught against the peoples of Eastern Europe. But it becomes evident early on that young Florya, played by a grimacing Aleksei Kravchenko, serves Mr. Klimov mainly as a body through which he can display his directorial powers. <br/><br/>The inherent conflict between the director and the character with whom the audience is expected to identify becomes most troubling in a climactic scene that is poundingly effective taken by itself but makes no sense at all from Florya's point of view. We are asked to believe he has a vision of Hitler's career, running backward in time, from the German invasion to Adolf as babe in arms. You don't have to be unduly literal minded to realize as the newsreels are driving in reverse that this is not the vision of a peasant lad who hasn't been to the movies much. It's a movie maker's tour de force. <br/><br/>After years of running into troubles with his country's film authorities, Mr. Klimov was elected president of the Soviet Film Makers Union, a beneficiary of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's experiment in glasnost, or openness. Possibly the unorthodox style of ''Come and See'' would bother some cultural commissar, but there is little in its content to offend the authorized Soviet view of World War II. The partisans are comradely; the Germans are pulp villains, sadistic, cowardly, fanatic. ''Inferior races spread the microbe of Communism,'' declares one whose particular mission is to kill Russian infants. Not only does an SS officer drag a woman by her hair on the way to her fate worse than death but he also pauses to light a cigarette. Mr. Klimov can't leave bad enough alone. <br/><br/>The ending is a dose of instant inspirationalism. The camera makes its way through the forest to the accompaniment of a choir that soars and soars until we get a glimpse of the heavens, not the most original moment in the movie. Yet scene for scene, Mr. Klimov proves a master of a sort of unreal realism that seeks to get at events terrible beyond comprehension. He shows what he can do particularly after Florya has been deafened by bombs and we seem to be inside the boy's head, with the sounds of the outside world overwhelmed by his panting breaths; everything turns distant and ominous. Ominous enough without Mr. Klimov's intrusions, at the expense of his own unquestionable talent."

The answer to the last two questions was yes, and the answer to the first was because it would truly be the most unforgettable film that I would ever see up to that point. The anxiety and depression that I experienced after the film was unbelievable-how could a film stir such a reaction from a person? I was in tears as I told my mother about the film. I couldn't stop thinking about it for several days, and I couldn't get Mozart's Requiem out of my head for a while.

But if there was one possible way for the director to make us feel what he felt the director provided it for us, If there was one, and only one way for the movie to be directed and it definitely did that. There were points in the movie to where I had to turn my face away because the cruelty was just too much. He didn't even have to tells us, hey look at what these people did don't you hate them.

And germinates those first seeds of anger which reside in all of us.<br/><br/>So this film is both timeless and universal.

"johnnyboyz","8","7","9","5 June 2007"," This film packs just about everything into an Eastern front war film but uses older techniques to put across the disturbance.
","Although seemingly a war film, Come and See really presents itself as a drama of sorts centring around one person and their horrific journey through a wartime period. The fact that this protagonist is, indeed, a 'fish out of water' adds to this theory. He doesn't seem to have a particular set mission and once the film gets to its hour and three quarter mark, the only mission aim I could see was: just damn-well survive!<br/><br/>Very rarely do we get to see films about the Second World War, set on the Eastern front and made by the Eastern Europeans themselves. When we do, it would seem; we are royally treated. Back in the 1920s, something known as 'Soviet Montage' was the Soviets finding their film form. This is put across most notably in 'Strike!' and 'Battleship Potemkin'. In Come and See, despite being made in the 1980s, there are numerous Soviet Montage references that proves at least to me that director Elem Klimov knows his stuff. A series of disturbing images is put across to us without much in the way of dialogue but also relying heavily on music of the classical variety  this is Soviet montage and this is what happens during the truly memorable moments in Come and See. <br/><br/>The film begins on a light-hearted note of two children 'playing' wars on a battlefield that has recently been fought for but this is only the hint at what's to come  one of these children is going to wish it had stayed a game. Then, he his taken from his home and tossed into the Eastern front. This event setting up a fascinating twenty-five or so minute sequence set around a woodland base where he meets other soldiers, gets his picture taken and indulges in some good old fashioned propaganda  he also accidentally yet seemingly randomly steps on a nest full of eggs when out on patrol; I feel this is an indication to the death and the crushing of the innocents to come.<br/><br/>The film cleverly moves from one thing to another be it bedded down in a woodland base camp, taking cover in a field during a gun fight between two sides he is, quite literally, stuck in the middle of or perhaps the most famous: stumbling across a small town that the Nazis have targeting for utter eradication. It's no secret that the Germans destroyed villages by killing the inhabitants, destroying the buildings and then burying absolutely everything to cover up evidence and what happens in Come and See is as close to that as I have ever seen in any other film  maybe no other film with a better example even exists. <br/><br/>With regards to the Soviet Montage references, when Come and See was made; Russia as we know it now was still the Soviet Union and its depiction of events is not only shocking and disturbing but also loud and forced upon you  such is war to a young man without too much life experience. From the fact an actual skeleton is dressed up to look like Adolf Hitler; just so it can be blown up again, seeing burnt out corpses lying there to music of some kind to the overuse of faces and peoples reactions in close up and, more importantly, montage format is enough evidence to suggest this is not only a modern, mind numbing war film but also a throwback to the old days of Soviet film-making. <br/><br/>What also works is the constant use of horrible, horrible sound. The loud, disturbing noise the aeroplane makes when it hovers overhead constantly reminds us and the lead character of the first time it happened when bombs were dropped relatively close by; thus rendering him (and us) temporarily deaf. It is a nasty reminder of the psychological effects of war. The way the town is dealt with through suspense and screams is particularly horrible as is the way the Nazis merely leave alá the Vikings did centuries ago. They came, they burnt, they pillaged and then they left  torches aloft just like the Germans in Come and See.<br/><br/>Come and See is not for the feint hearted nor is it for people who aren't heavily into film. At over two hours long, it's difficult to sit through and concentrate on fully all the time but not only this, it presents some of the most disturbing scenes in the eeriest of ways I've ever seen in a war film. Truly memorable film-making."
"lukedela","10","7","9","7 July 2006"," A Must See
","Put simply, 'Come and See' is one of the best films I have ever seen. It is also one of the most effective anti-war statements ever produced and many of its images still resonate today, particularly the dark and bleak ending. It works better as an experience rather than as entertainment and should definitely be watched in a single sitting.<br/><br/>Amazingly shot, filmed and acted, it serves as one of the pinnacles of Russian Cinema. That being said, it is not a film for the faint of heart. Althrough the actual atrocities in the film make up only a small part of the film, the scene is unrelentingly brutal and there is a prevailing sense of dread throughout the film.<br/><br/>Also, there is much controversy about the ending sequence of the film and many people view the film as anti-German and merely Russian propaganda. Personally, I view the film, at face value, as a warning about the dangers of fascism rather than being anti-German. 'Come and See' is not simply a case of condemning Nazism but rather a wider view that everybody has the capacity to do what Hitler did.<br/><br/>'Come and See' cannot fail but provoke a reaction in an audience, which very few films actually do and because of this it is universally worth seeing. It is definitely a film that lingers in the memory."

","This film was no fun to watch, nor should it have been considering it is about the Nazi atrocities in Belarus during WWII--as seen through the eyes of a young recruit for the partisans. This young boy appears to be about 12 or maybe 13, though through the course of the film, he ages what appears to be many years, though the action that occurs seemed to take place over just a few days. The movie was a solid recreation of the horrors and is good because it makes the faces and lives affected by this sick war so very real. Because of its content, it is not a film for children, though it probably is okay for teens provided you discuss the movie with them afterwards. No serious complaints about the movie at all, though it would have been nice if the German planes they used in the film weren't the same FW-189 reconnaissance aircraft over and over again--but this is the most minor of complaints--it was a great picture overall."
"macunak20o","10","7","9","24 May 2003"," view from within
","Being from the country, where the movie story took place, sharing the same cultural background gives probably bias to my comment, but it also touches me deeper. When I was a child Belarus was still in USSR and they used to show many war films on TV. I saw this movie also, but I didn't really like it. There was not much of war for me at that time, lack of skirmish. Ironically, at those times it was not the best movie to show to soviet people. The screen play was written by Ales Adamovich, belarusan writer, who didn't stand a high esteem of soviet government. Some scenes in this movie tell about things which were forbidden by soviet propaganda machine (that actually ukrainians collaborators, not (only) germans burned the people, how partisans were ""heating up"" - acting in in police uniforme, things about belarusan collaboration, about ""samaachova"" etc). The WW2 in USSR was something holy, and only one version of it existed, the government one.<br/><br/>So, for movie to exist, and to come to audience, Elem Klimov had to have some ""right propaganda"" things in there. This is there irony is - now, then Belarus is independent, the scene with shooting Hitler's portrait looks ""toooo"" propaganda. and  now this is also not the best war movie in political point of view. But don't take me wrong, Klimov could actually believe in those things, and there is nothing to condemn here.<br/><br/>And the movie. Unfortunately, there are many things which hardly can be understood if you are not from Belarus. The way Florya Gaishun speaks, faces, houses. and pain, and fear and degradation, and ambiguity. ambiguity people had on occupied territory, ambiguity of times when movie was made. but the movie is not a propaganda of any kind, if one can go above he and she will see - it is on psychology of civil people during the frightful war. Camera and its dynamism in the movie are just great.<br/><br/>A year ago, I saw the movie 2nd time and now on the big screen. After my friend and I went off the cinema, i could not speak, i could just walk. there was nothing to speak about. ___________________<br/><br/>to Daniel Karlsson - common, Klimov did NOT want to be Tarkovsky. this is an absolutely different type of movie, different directoring. this is YOU who sees here shadow of the most ""pop on west"" soviet director. this is not the tarkovsky type of art, but it should not be of this type to be a genuine thing."

","The Director here is a champion of what I call the camera sweep. At times the camera travels as if bound to a drone flying long and slow over rural Russia taking in the landscape and the effects of war. It's such a mesmerising tactic, making the viewer an eyewitness. The other technique used is the framing of the shots and the concentration on faces, in particular the boy whose life during the war we follow intimately. There are other techniques, such as the use of animals to show suffering and shock, brilliantly effective and very moving. The use of mists was terrifically atmospheric, and contained an impression of being on the edge of danger, which, of course, it was. There is still more genius though, as some sequences are shown just beyond forest lines, creating a sort of outrage, as well as a true sense of partisan warfare. As well as this, one comes to realise a really true picture of the Russian farming life, poor yet happy, cruelly upset in gradually increasing violence, and thus more outrage for the viewer. I don't know if this movie was intended as a tragedy involving a boy or a broader indictment of war and its ravages, but both have been indelibly achieved. It's true at times there is a certain weirdness to behaviours, and certainly some licence was taken, but again the Director has purpose. I can't go into specifics without using spoilers, but the initial return to home was one case in point. Again I consider this technique genius. The closing sequence is also a stroke of genius. I consider this movie to be seminal, along with The Grey Zone, Schindler's List and The City of Life and Death. Easily one of the most authentic and heart-breaking war movies I have ever seen."

Very similar topic if you watch closely. They are not just propaganda war films, as were so many USSR features describing the horrors of the Russian front. COME AND SEE and THE ASCENT just told the real truth about the atrocities that the Nazis commited. Because I consider that showing the regular German and Russian armies fighting against each other on the front doesn't require to point out who are the good and who are the evil guys. That's my own opinion. How could we here showing the Russian partisans as the bad and the Einsatzgruppen the good ones?"

"classicsoncall","10","3","3","20 November 2017"," ""You didn't know it would turn out like this, did you?""
","It's probably a good thing that we have movies like this that show the brutality and evil of war, but I don't know if the mass of humanity ever learns from them. In recent days I've watched this movie and ""The Battle of Algiers"", and if you look at present day headlines and follow news of terrorism around the world, one must concede that the aggressive use of force is a distinct part of Man's nature. This is a viscerally disturbing film to watch, with scene after scene of intense brutality that would render a normal person who experienced it dysfunctional and mentally unhinged from reality.<br/><br/>It's those utterly insane things that young Florya Gaishun (Aleksey Kravchenko) experiences after he quite enthusiastically joins the war effort against the Nazis in his home country of Byelorussia. The most disturbing scene for this viewer occurred when the German soldiers herded the citizens of Perekhody into a barn and set it on fire. A rationale offered later by a young captured German soldier reflected a hideous ideology, that all Russians needed to be exterminated and children had to die because 'the trouble starts with them'. To claim that this warped Nazi thinking belonged to butchers is an understatement; that's too kind a word to apply to the monsters that they were.<br/><br/>I'm appreciative for having watched this movie, it's story and images will remain with me a long time. Some consider it the greatest war movie of all time, and though I would disagree, I would point to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" as another film with a similar emotional impact and rates a similar rating to this one on IMDb, the point of difference being that 'All Quiet' was made in 1930 and relates the horror that took place during World War I. Both films ought to be a timely reminder that war is hell, and can turn one's life into something unimaginable in an instant."

","""Come and See"" was on a list of the 10 most disturbing films you will ever see. It deserves to be.<br/><br/>Not that it is full of gratuitous gore; much of the horror is just glimpsed; dolls discarded on the floor of a deserted house; a pile of bodies briefly seen at a distance. Much of the horror simply plays out on the face of Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko), the teenage boy at the centre of the story.<br/><br/>I was stunned by the film, and there is not much to add to the many thoughtful IMDb reviews here; only a few comments on the technique of this film that makes it so compelling.<br/><br/>Critic Tim Lott wrote in 2009 that the film ""makes Apocalypse Now look lightweight"". It's an interesting association, because other critics pointed out similarities in the structure of the two films. Both are journeys where the central character experiences events that escalate until the true horror overwhelms them. Captain Willard's journey into the 'heart of darkness' is not that different to Florya's; both see things along the way that violate their senses.<br/><br/>A great deal of ""Come and See"" has a lyrical quality, especially Florya's brief stay in the forest with Glasha (Olga Mironova) - it's troubling that the girl who is taken by the Nazis at the end looks so much like her. However, all the while, there is that ominous, shapeless hum on the soundtrack. You sense everything is not well and soon you will see things you cannot unsee. <br/><br/>So much is told through those close up faces. But it is the face of Florya, aging before our eyes, which reaches into the soul.<br/><br/>Although the film was made a few years before the end of the Soviet regime, one can't detect too much of a political agenda in the way the story plays out - the events it portrays are well documented and disturbingly true. Maybe the retribution handed out to the captured Nazis at the end symbolises what happened in the war - what was done going East was repaid as the war headed West.<br/><br/>This masterful film doesn't really fit the definition of a standard war film; it is more of a cautionary tale. To paraphrase George Orwell a little, when people start to feel 'more equal than others', it opens the way for evil to happen."

","Drive-ins & youth. Today Google's opening page honors Drive-in's 79th anniversary with a bubble-gum pink 'Admit One' ticket see-sawing in front of a sign that reads oogle. Last night I saw one of the most unforgettable films of my viewing life, which got me to thinking.<br/><br/>The power of film! I am still reeling from an unconventional movie made in 1985 called ""Come and See."" Not since my younger brother and teenage me saw Jaws at a Galveston drive-in (double-billed with Capone) and next day had to build courage to step into the Gulf, has a film disturbed me so.<br/><br/>I gave the film a chance because 1) It was on the AFI top 250 list and I never heard of it, 2) The filmmaker tells the story of a young boy. Ever since Mark Twain and Harper Lee, I'm a fan of stories told from a child's point of view about adult experiences. Come and See is a startling tell.<br/><br/>After a vile runt of a boy shouts invectives to his tall likable friend, the camera rolls with two excited Russian boys as they search for a forgotten battlefield. They pull up war gear and rifles deep from the sands of an overrun Russian position of the unstoppable German invasion of 1941. The runt dons found Nazi battle gear, imitating a meanness that he believes will suit the German occupiers he later meets. The eldest boy carries home a Russian rifle to join the Partisans. He charms away his little twin sisters and anxious mother to run off a meet them. The Partisans reject the hopeful lad along with their favorite pretty girl mascot. Sending the innocents home from their forest camp, the Partisans head for the front. The boy and girl share disappointment of their rejection. The next day, left alone, they enjoy an idyllic time until the look to the sky. Strange parachutes open, the SS descend, and the boy and girl face their helpless fate together.<br/><br/>At first it is uncomfortable to see actors and actresses emote deadpan, full frame, directly into the lens. But the director does not want you to be comfortable with the subject - and focuses us on this - one extermination of over six hundred villages in Belorussia. The focal length is short, making the actress cross-eyed, adding a sense of idiocy to her naivety of the world.<br/><br/>You can forgive the film for some too-long takes because the pacing sets you up for a final thirty minute run which is perhaps the most breathtaking, non-stop war scene ever filmed. The uniforms and obscure gear are entirely authentic of 1943. Some of the scenes are genius - a flash that we see with the girl that would mean everything to the boy as they are fleeing. After some courage, she utters the image in short words. The rolling camera has more juice than the napalm & helicopter Ride-of-the-Valkyries vertical assault in Apocalypse Now!, or the terror of the Omaha Beach landing in Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers. The camera rolls and floats with the endless victory of cruelty, shear madness, and horror that a few actors actually experienced in the invasion of their homeland in World War Two.<br/><br/>There are few predictable moments. Sometimes you get stuck in a scene with a Quentin Tarantino cruelty we must endure. At other moments there is a Fellini-esque vitality of raw moments that I have never seen in a Hollywood depiction of war. There is no stand-out villain Nazi like Christoph Waltz in Inglourious Basterds, the entire mixed-German platoon wheels an invisible zeal of distinct beer house characters - except they are dead sober, being at war for years. The film is a marvelous intertwining of direction (Elem Klimov), writing (Ales Adamovich), and cinematography (Alexei Rodionov). The actors may have been over their heads, for how can a boy credibly act, react, and emote such witness. The unsettling soundtrack and original music complete the film's psychological pacing. I admire a film shown from a young boy's point of view that avoids the easy way out of first person narrative overdubs. Raw images, raw acting all the way. This is a cinema experience no US teenager will ever experience from a car seat. And that is unfortunate, not because this is one of the early heroic uses of a steadicam when they weighed 100 pounds, but because you walk away feeling in your gut the horror of something that really happened to us, the human race."

","Without question this has easily made my top five for the most powerful film I have seen. Excluding any amount of exaggeration I can honestly say that even having done extensive research on the subject of the film for various school projects I did truly understand the brutality of the situation until Come and See. It is a truly a film that should be shown in history classes. It is filled to the brim with absolutely unforgettable images. <br/><br/>The key to Come and See being absolutely so powerful of a film comes from the use of little to no visual affects and attention to detail. It is blatantly obvious that live fire and explosives were used in the filming of Come and See. This was so affective that I found myself almost searching for an error in there accuracy because I could almost not believe this could have actually happened. through all my searching I only came across one error in the use of a gun that was not produced until after the time period in the film took place. However even with this I still was absolutely confused.<br/><br/>I say confused because the absolute horror of the images and the events is unquestionable in the film. Yet it is shot in such a beautiful way. The camera movement, the colors, the actors and actresses the are all beautiful visually. Still though I'm looking at murder and horrible conditions that people are surviving in. It is seemingly a catch twenty two however I believe the combination of these two is what makes this film great.<br/><br/>If the film had simply been ugly images of the death and hardships I may not have lasted through it. By mixing the the beauty in the visuals with the horror of the topic an amazing antiwar film is born."

","Wow. This film was the best depiction of War I've seen so far, in no way at all did this film glamorize it, if anything it gave the audience the closest look into what a country under attack goes through. Unlike other war films Come and See really depicted the life's of ordinary civilians in the time of war. The small town of Russia were Flor was from resembled the country itself, it was micro-cosmic view of the point of view of the Russians during world war II. The director Elem Klimov did an amazing job in getting the audience involved with almost your five senses, we can practically smell old meat when the cow that Flor was trying to take to the group dies for example. The sound of the constant Nazi planes watching over haunted us as much as Flor. I was recently part of a house fire and the scene when the German officers terrorize the Russian city and burn the building with all the townspeople was unforgettable, it gave me chills to remember my own close experience with the fire but seeing it in this film took it to another level. A few minutes ago before the fire we got to see the inside full with people who had done nothing wrong. The flames were no CGI which made the scene that much more intense. <br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes was when Flor finally got to use his gun that he carried through out the film, poor kid he had started out so cheerful and full of joy to become a soldier but to his dismay war was nothing like he thought it'd be. Like we said in class, he started off looking 13 years and ended the film as a 40 year old. The reason I really loved that scene was because it had so many images and symbols in one scene, to me it really summarized WW II. Going back through time every important step that lead to Hitler in power was so powerfully showed, with Flor shooting many times at Hitlers picture at the same time. Much like life if one of those things had gone slightly wrong it would have made a world of a difference. But at the same time it made me think that even if it wasn't Adolfo Hitler, maybe it was have been someone else? If his mom would have had that abortion, and had another child what guarantees it wouldn't have been that other child to become the next ""Htiler"" the world is full of crazy lunatics, but it is our job as society to try and stop them. Going back through time with Flor in that scene really for me showed All the people that could have Stoped it before it happened! <br/><br/>I'm sad to know this film isn't as known as it should be and deserves to be! I'm glad to see all of us who commented really inspired us to write a review and share our thoughts about this incredible film."

Not once has any other movie been able to captivate and shock and make me feel the way this movie has.<br/><br/>The movie tells the story of a young Belorussian boy who becomes a soldier in World War 2 - and it is everything other than what he would have expected it to be.<br/><br/>The story begins with two excited kids playing war, looking for and grabbing out a gun. This is the trigger for soldiers coming to the boy's family's house and taking him to recruit him as a soldier. While we see the devastated and crying mother with his two sisters, Flor excitedly goes along with the soldiers.<br/><br/>However, when the soldiers go out on their mission, he and a girl get left behind.

They force the whole village into a house, and ask anybody without kids to come out. This way Flor and another girl escape, and they become witness to the house being set on fire with the whole village captured inside and being burnt alive.<br/><br/>Flor sees the girl, after being raped, walking back, but having lost all his humanity, he doesn't go to help her. Instead, he helps some other villagers, who captured some of the German soldiers (and even some Russian collaborates), to shoot them and then burn their bodies. Then he savagely shoots a picture of Hitler.<br/><br/>The movie ends with Flor following the group of men going into battle.<br/><br/>This was the most extreme experience I have ever had when watching a movie. The movie seems so close and real, and it manages to involve all senses. It is an unusual and probably the most closest-to-reality depiction of war which you will probably never forget.<br/><br/>Following Flor on his way, experiencing everything through his eyes and senses, is shocking and devastating, and we feel as affected by everything that is happening as Flor does.<br/><br/>The images we are presented with are so real, and the movie excels as making us as paranoid as Flor when we hear the sound of motors coming closer. Also the fact that Klimov did not use any special affects makes everything seem incredibly and shockingly real and (too) close.<br/><br/>This is not a usual war movie. It does not in any way show heroic Russian soldiers. In opposite, it is the devastating story of what the war felt like for the civilians, and it affects the viewer to an extreme point. I believe this movie lingers in the heads of those who have seen it for a long time - it affects you emotionally, and lets you see once again how incredibly devastating war is. And it makes you ask once again: WHY do people do this to each other?!<br/><br/>An incredible and shocking movie-journey, which everybody should take. This movie will leave you changed, but I think it's important for everyone to see. Though it is intense, and I often felt like I couldn't take it anymore, I can only recommend seeing this movie! In fact, I hope everybody does."

","Do you like Thrill rides? Are you the kind of person who enjoys a theme park attraction? Were you blown away by Saving Private Ryan's first 20 minutes? If so, you'll have a larger than life smile attached to your face if you watch Come and See.<br/><br/>This movie about the Nazi occupation of Byelorussian SSR is one of the best war movies that you can find out there. Do you hate war movies?, well, this is also a horror story as well, one where you can smell gun powder, blood, burning flesh and mud, lots of mud.<br/><br/>This is one of those films you'll appreciate more if you go and watch it with little or no knowledge about it. The less you know of it the better. I know these kinds of movies are made to give you a more clear sense of what the war was all about and the reasons behind every character involved, but is definitely impossible no to feel angry against the Nazis and how these men brutally killed innocent Byelorussians while they were occupying their lands. If this movie doesn't make you think about how sick the world was (and still is) you're not a normal person.<br/><br/>The direction and the sound design are the best assets of this film. The sound is so layered you feel every single noise, the flies (a leitmotif used several times in the film), the bombs and the guns will make you ask for a rifle and a helmet to protect yourself just in case. All these elements combined creates a unique experience that makes you feel inside the war. Also there's a huge difference between European and US filmmaking. In here, the actors swim through real mud, they used real animals, and sometimes they don't end up well (Hello PETA, they don't care about you!), things that are big no no's for Hollywood and that sometimes it can heighten the sense of authenticity in a flick.<br/><br/>The journey of the main character is a sick and twisted one, I can't believe how an adolescent can grow surrounded by guns, death and blood, your eyes won't believe how he changes through the course of the film.<br/><br/>In several parts you'll say to yourself: ""It's only a movie"", ""It's only movie"", but then the director will remind you that sometimes fiction can be just as hard as real life.<br/><br/>Are you still reading? Run and watch this film."
"nathanseg","10","3","3","27 July 2011"," When films impact History
","Films such as"" Come and See"" can mark people's mind to the point of affecting a government's decision; thus it wouldn't be surprising if Klimov's brutal, breathtaking, and above all, truthful depiction of atrocities committed during the last World War influenced the Soviet leaders not to enter into a third World War at the time the movie was made. Klimov provides a sample of the horrors committed by the Nazis on Soviet civilians during their invasion; the dreadful experience of watching the film is fueled by Klimov's unsettling, but effective, mise en scene shaped by a Soviet approach to film making. Indeed, in order to reproduce historical events in a realist manner, Klimov has used unorthodox, but highly efficient methods, such as shooting animals or hypnotizing the main actor. The heritage of Soviet cinematographic philosophy is also present in a scene in which an ominous bird walks around the two young characters before the arrival of the Nazis; previous Soviet filmmaker such as Eisenstein understood that metaphorical images –such as a dreadful bird or the accidental crush of eggs –had as much impact on the audience as details advancing the plot. <br/><br/>""Come and See"" is particularly relevant to people considering joining the army or any person in favor of declaring war to another nation. Florya's experience is representative of what could be anyone's journey through war. First, the boy is excited at the idea of participating and has a glorified image of combat. Although he sets his mind to engage in battle, it is war that comes to him. Klimov shows us that, during War time, no component of one's life is spared: family, friendship, romantic love, even leadership are all pulverized by the atrocities of war. Thus, his mother and sisters are assassinated; his new comrades are killed by mines and sub gun machines; Glasha –like the second girl appearing in the film –is probably raped; even Kossach is haunted by atrocious nightmares. <br/><br/>As horrendous scenes unfold, the public cannot help but to ask: why such inhuman behavior? It is towards the end that Kossach, looking ""through"" the audience, tells us to ""listen attentively"". The answer comes from a Nazi who makes us understand that German treatments were devoid of humanity for the unconceivable, yet simple, reason that they did not see certain people –the communists in that case- as fellow human beings. <br/><br/>Symbolically, the last shot going upward starting from the bottom of the trees comes in contrast with the first shot of the trees going downward starting from the top ; these opposite camera movements contrast the Nazi invasion with the Soviet riposte. Indeed, the German soldiers were ordered by their leader to ""come down"" on the Soviet Union whereas the Soviet's counterattack is orchestrated by common men –such as Florya –eager to defeat the invaders –with the help from the blessed Russian snow, falling –in the last shot –in a holistic manner on the lens."
"MariaXtinaBenthall","9","3","3","25 July 2011"," Real Wartime
","There is this one shot in ""Come and See"" where Florya, the movie's main character steps on a nest of eggs and we are shown this short shot of dead wet chicks in the middle of the mud moss. This tiny maybe 3second shot was so unbelievably powerful I felt sick for the next ten minutes. I watched an interview with Director Elem Klimov after I watched the movie. There was no way that the male actor that played Florya was mentally stable after such a horrific journey of war in this movie - Klimov explained that he used hypnosis during filming to make sure the actors were not affected. It made me think how different the movie would be if it was made in now time - there would be restrictions, laws and Klimov would have probably had to restrain his creative urges. The other thing Klimov mentioned in the interview was that the movie was originally going to be called ""Kill Hitler"" - Hitler standing for your inner demons. This theme that every one has a Hitler inside them that they fight constantly every day. Each person with a different battle. ""Come and See"" is literally a descent to hell. It is the only war movie where I have wholly felt like I was there - experiencing this horrific real war time of Nazi hell. Klimov gives us this microscopic view - He shows us the scale of things and the reality check that war is for small villages. By the end of the movie we are shown that it is the rag tag armies of these villages who are the ones that defeated the Nazis. It was bizarre to me how I felt a sense of hope through this revelation at the end. When Mozart's ""Requiem"" is playing at the end and we are shown this shot of just snow I felt this huge sense of relief. The fact that there were no humans or any man-made object in the shot, just snow, made me feel like finally I could breathe. Rebirth. A new beginning. Another chance at life. My favorite aspect of the movie was the use of sound. The music was an interesting choice - Mozart is most often looked at as beautiful and calming which is the complete opposite of what is depicted in the movie. My personal association with Mozart was also peaceful and it bothered me when I realized Mozart's music was being used through this heart-wrenching sick war movie. About three quarters of the way through, I realized it was probably Mozart that got me through the movie - That helped me through war. There was also this very small and constant sound of a buzzing fly - I was constantly irritated by this. I know this is what Klimov was aiming for and so I applaud him for the effect but I felt like shooting someone myself! Klimov's bravery as a Director was phenomenal. There was no fear of the truth and there was no fear in shoving the truth down the viewer's throat. We are taken on a journey with Florya - Klimov gives his character a huge arch and by the end we too like Florya feel a reason to fight - a reason to join - an explanation of what victory is. I would recommend this movie for the tough-hearted or anyone that is searching for the truth of our world."
"gigiandjessi","10","3","3","11 February 2011"," Casualties of War
","This is a devastating film about the realities of war. Set in 1943, Byelorussia, we meet Florya (Aleksey Kravchenko) who at the ripe age of 14 is prepared to become a hero for his country. His mother begs him to stay, yet her cries fall on deaf ears. Florya is determined to fight at all cost. What follows are a series of events that are shocking to the senses in every possible way.<br/><br/>A heartbreaking scene is when Florya returns home in search of his family, in hopes of sharing a warm meal only to find a barren cabin. We are at once aware of his naivetè when he is convinced he knows where they are hiding. Which leads us to another grueling picture that only Glasha (Olga Mironova) and we, the audience are privy to. Our worst fear is revealed to us as we see, and almost smell corpses lying on top of one another, left there by the Nazis to rot.<br/><br/>Another image that will stay with me for life is where Florya and Glasha are trudging through a thick, disgusting muddy swamp, that seems to swallow them up like quick sand. I felt as if I was there sinking, fighting for my life alongside them. Still they make it to the other side only to find more tragedy. <br/><br/>Klimov, doesn't skip a beat in creating a full body experience for his viewers, and to further add to the intensity, there is a haunting soundtrack howling throughout the film that cuts through you. Sensory overload to say the least. <br/><br/>Despite the many close encounters with death Florya escapes every time, or does he? It's hard to imagine what his life will be like after witnessing the mass genocide committed by the Nazis. One can't help but wonder if he wouldn't be better off dead. Not having to live with the brokenness and painful memories brought on by this atrocious war.<br/><br/>It is my hope that many will be exposed to this film, that their eyes too will be opened to the harsh reality that is war."
"laydeejin","10","3","3","8 February 2011"," Excellent, brutal and mind throwing movie....
","""Come and See"" is by far one of my favorite movies from Klimov. In this movie, I felt that Klimov portrayed the brutality, the horror, and the grief of an teenager boy's (Floria) experience in a stunning manner. ""Come and See"" was one of the movies that left an unforgettable impression on me. <br/><br/>I felt that there were many significant meanings within the movie. In the beginning it was confusing because the audience is introduced to a teenage boy named Floria, who is excited to join his countrymen in the war against the Nazis. It got me thinking to why a young boy like him would desire to do such a thing when he is too young to know anything about what can happen to him in his future. <br/><br/>As the movie slowly unfolds his experience during the war, it makes a full 360 turn. I felt that Klimov was straight forward with his movie by showing the viewers the truth about what was happening during the war. The scene where the Nazis burned the innocent people and children in the barn made me clench my chest because it was so hard to watch. The scene where the people, including Floria's mother and sisters, piled up behind the house made me goosebumps on my skin appear while sending shivers down my back. It was so gruesome to see those people killed and piled up and it also made my hatred for the Nazis grow further more.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie has the be the last scene. It is when Floria stares at Hitler's portrait in the water and decides to shoot at it. This was a major significant scene for me because throughout the movie, we never see him fire shots from his gun. However, only in the last scene when he shoots at Hitler's portrait is the only time he decides to use his gun. Also, while he is doing so, Hitler's life is shown reversed back into time of when Hitler was a baby. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Come and See"" was an excellent Russian war movie that portrays the humanity of what the people during the war went through. It showed the audience the meaning of realism and the experiences of the people who served their time in the war. This movie is a real eye opener to people and one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone. Trust me, you will love it."

","I had a nightmare after watching this movie. With many shocking scenes, the movie describes the REAL. The movie absolutely is branded on your memory, and it doesn't let you go. This is something very important you should watch and understand before supporting the War in Iraq. This is absolute realism. On the other hand, you never meet such a movie in Hollywood. A young boy gradually understands the real during the war. What he experiences is pretty dramatic: death of his family, many of dead bodies, slaughter, rape, and many paralyzed hearts. His experience represents the victims. This is not a propaganda movie that make particular country look great, but tells that the war creates losses. The movie doesn't entertain you, but it educates and cultivates you."
"coldwaterpdh","10","3","3","9 September 2009"," INSANELY ahead of its time and brilliantly done.
","The reviews are right, this one is amazing. I was shocked at how well it is done.<br/><br/>Effectively portraying the Nazis for what they are and were, ""Come And See"" pits an innocent young boy against an animal movement that destroys his village, his entire family and his life for no real reason. He and his 'compatriots,' mostly farmers and other kids, try to do what they can against the invaders. He witnesses brutality and savagery at the hands of the Nazis in a swirl of confusion and exhaustion that is seemingly endless.<br/><br/>Not for the faint of heart, this one, like ""Schindler's List"" and ""The Pianist"" should go down as a World War Two film that must be seen to be believed. It is not funny or fun or light-hearted at all. It does not make a mockery of tragedy, nor does it glorify or simplify the actions of the SS; it paints a vivid portrait of destruction and death that becomes one boy's reality in the midst of what seems like a nightmare. The effect on the viewer is incredible and that makes this an important piece of film-making. It stuck with me for weeks and I will never forget seeing ""Come and See.""<br/><br/>The fact that the budget was probably minuscule in comparison to other films of this emotional magnitude says a great deal about the folks involved in the project. Plus the fact that it was made in 1985! Wow. A solid 10 out of 10, kids. See it."
"freemantle_uk","10","3","3","21 April 2009"," A Masterpiece
","Come and See is a bleak and violence look of the Second World War in the small nation of Belarussia in the USSR. It is a powerful, tough but rewarding watch.<br/><br/>The film focuses on Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko), a teenage boy, I guess around 16, who finds a Soviet rifle buried in his village. He is quickly recruited into the Soviet Partisans to join the fight against the Nazis. As the troops are about to leave their base in the forest Florya's commander decides to leave the young man behind. Florya befriends a young, but mad girl, Glasha (Olga Mironova) who was fancied by all the men in the base. Both head back to Florya's village but find that the whole population, including his family had been murdered by the Germans. Florya withdraws and joins a small platoon, leaving Glasha behind. After the platoon is killed Florya ends up in another village just in time for to the Nazis exterminate the population.<br/><br/>Come and See is a war film, but not in the traditional way. You don't see any set piece battles. The director, Elem Klimov, treats the film as an art house film, focusing on Florya's character, lost of innocent, and physical ageing. Many shots focuses on character faces and is shot in a grim style, a symbol of the war. The main theme of is the destruction and madness of war. It show how horrible the war on the Eastern front was, with massive civilian casualties. In historical terms the Germans scored a big own goal because the Soviet population hated Stalin and his regime. Their treated the Germans are liberators, but the Germans never used this public support and ended up killing a large proportion of the population. The character of Glasha to me represents the madness, but surprising incitement, of war. Compared to Florya who was innocent and looses it during the film. Their is also a religious subtext to the film. The title Come and See is a reference of 'The Apocalypse of John'. During the film the Horsemen of the Apocalypse are referenced. The title could also mean seeing the apocalypse that the Nazis were causing. Finally whilst watching the film it sort of reminded me of the Medieval period, with the Partisan forces living in a forest in wooden shacks, the villages being medieval in style, with technology and the wooden houses, to the athorities the Nazis forced on the locals.<br/><br/>It is a powerful film about the madness of war. A must see."

"myboigie","10","12","18","11 December 2005"," The Most Honest War Film
","Forget ""Saving Private Ryan"", this is the real-story of who fought and suffered the most during-WWII: ethnic-Slavs within the Soviet Union. Most Westerners have little-or-no idea about what the Russian-front was and what it means in the scope of human-history. Centered mostly around the experiences of a young Byelorussian-peasant, this is what war is. Klimov stated in interviews before his passing that a number of elements came from his own experiences, and that he left-out many horrors that were even-worse. Like Iraq, the invasion of the Soviet Union was passed-off as a ""preemptive"" strike to stop ""Bolshevik-terrorists"", when it was really about creating a German settler-state that had been wiped-clean of Slavs by the Einsatzgruppe. SS units often razed entire villages, leaving nobody alive. We see a bit of this early-on in the film when the young-Byelorussian returns to his village--to the sound of buzzing-flies. All of this was necessary to the National Socialist-hierarchy to pay-off reckless loans that were the backbone of the Nazi ""economic-miracle"". Taking territory, and exploiting it was the only way Hitler and the Nazis had to do this. There is a similar-dynamic to American-involvement in Iraq, right-now. Proportionally, we are doing the same-thing, for the same-reasons. Not all films are for entertainment, and Klimov wanted us to remember so there wouldn't be another ""Operation Barbarossa"".<br/><br/>Klimov shows us that depopulation, and genocide was the reality on-the-ground, and this created megadeaths on both-sides due to the chaos of death-on-death, a terrifying chain-reaction. An unspoken, ""take-no-prisoners"" policy became a reality on both-sides due to Nazi-brutality. As-many as 28 million Slavs were annihilated by Hitler's policy of ""lebensraum""(living-space). It is saddening that a film like this stands-out--we should not be shielded-from the realities of war, we should see it all so we know what war really is. This film captures the strange-beauty of chaos, too. There are moments that are shockingly-beautiful, even in war, which should give us pause. It is true that Klimov had his extras under the fire of real-bullets, which is crucial, and stunning. This was actually done in the early Warners gangster films, like ""Public Enemy Number One""! Nobody will ever know how truly-horrible it all was, and yet, it is hardly ever noted in the mainstream of Western culture. We should be ashamed of the Cold War for this, alone.<br/><br/>Director Klimov was a unique director in the Soviet system, a genuine maverick with a vision of history as fateful. This is what makes him one of the finest of Russian-filmmakers, because he strikes upon what is important to the Russian-experience; the ""Slavic-condition"", if I may be so bold. It says a lot that this was Klimov's final-film, and that he felt he had said all he needed to as a Russian-director. It is an amazing-testament, too, to what was actually possible under the Soviet system, it contradicts what we think we ""know"" about it. Are films not truncated, buried and suppressed in our system, economically? Definitely. Are/were we so very different? The human-condition is often a distressing one, and history should make us more-wary of violence of any-sort. Violence never solves a problem, it merely creates more of them. Boring-cynics will say this is not-possible, but there have been centuries of peace in human-history before. Watch this film, and ask yourself if you would like to be in-the-middle of a war.<br/><br/>1.21.06-PS: As the situation deteriorates in Iraq, and the President continues to spy-on Americans, we should be learning from a film like this--liberty is hard-won, and there is a price-to-pay. Can we avoid war? I think so, and it will be hard-work, but a way to honor the war-dead."

"Ricc0","10","5","6","3 December 2016"," Ruthless
","A Soviet drama war film directed by Elem Klimov, Come and See is considered as one of the best war films ever made. Its ruthless depiction of the human actions in WW2 makes it one of the strongest anti-war anti-fascist (as Klimov said he wanted it to be) films in cinema history. In many scenes you get the feeling that Klimov is trying to say that sometimes you're better off dead.. the horrors of war are unbearable.<br/><br/>The film opens with an ambiguous scene of a Belarusian young boy digging for something.. we know after a while that he is searching for a rifle to join the resistance against the Nazis. He then starts to witness the horrors and tragedies of war starting from the smallest incidents (such as having to switch his new shoes to old ruined ones) all the way to the massacres committed by the Nazi soldiers in Belarus.<br/><br/>The film's accuracy in depicting what really happened in that era (illuminating the Belarusian tragedy rarely shown) is one of its most important features.. and adding to its realism the surrealistic approach used by Klimov only makes it a piece of art. The two approaches are blended in a way that evokes intensity and emotions and masterfully displays the absurdity of human actions during war. The score also is used amazingly in a way to suit the tragic story. The animals' noises, dull hums, war sounds, classical music are all mixed together drawing more and more intensity. In an early scene the protagonist goes deaf leaving us to hear what he hears from noises (strengthening the disturbing atmosphere, especially that in this period he discovers what happened to his family - where he starts acting in a sort of denial). <br/><br/>The main subject of the film is the cottage scene in the village ""Perekhody"" where the Nazi soldiers put all the villagers in the cottage and burn it. Then they start shooting it while it is burning (showing excessive brutality or maybe absurdity). Before burning it they allow some to flee the cottage but without the children (in the execution scene a Nazi soldier explains the reason - he did not want this inferior race to continue!) and so the child of a young mother that tried to run away with him was taken from her and thrown again into the cottage and she was later raped (her screams were heard but nothing was shown). The protagonist was also allowed to flee and seemed to age throughout the film (pointing out how war kills innocence and how horrifying it is). The main character was a success in this film where the viewer can easily get emotionally attached to the terrified wandering kid.<br/><br/>The symbolic and memorable scenes in the film are many. A beautiful German soldier is seen lustily sucking food (linking lust to anger and war? or mocking the ""superior Aryan race""?) and after few scenes she is shown dead with one of her breasts visible. Another scene is the protagonist stepping on a bird's nest killing her babies still in eggs (implying that war gives birth to suffering - or that it kills innocence).. also the death of the cow (some say that Klimov was trying to show that death is sometimes incomprehensible).. the cruel Nazi commander with his unpleasant pet.. the raped young mother with her legs covered with blood and playing on a harmonica a dull and annoying music.. and above all the old peasant that was thrown out while still laying on her bed (the close ups on her face were so emotional and also symbolic). In fact all the close ups from the beginning to the end help the viewer to feel the tragedy and connect with the terrified characters.<br/><br/>The German soldiers responsible for the burning of the cottage are then executed.. some tried to burn them to avenge the villagers but few peasants shot them quickly. The scene leaves a lot to interpret but you can feel that even though justice was obtained, nothing could really take back what happened.<br/><br/>The best is left to the end where the protagonist for the ""first time"" uses his rifle only to shoot Hitler's picture thrown in mud.. and each shot inter-cut with an archival footage of Hitler that is moving backwards. At last when the archival footage comes to a scene where he (Hitler) is a baby in his mother's arms the protagonist could no longer shoot the rifle! The film then plays a classical music with the resistance going into the woods (implying that there is still hope) and the film ends with a shot of the sky. Some assume that the director is questioning God but since the title carries a name from the book of revelation this interpretation does not seem right.. the scene is more likely to be spiritual.<br/><br/>A masterpiece from a director that never made any film after it claiming that he did everything he could in that film (and without using even professional actors!)"
"edge547","10","5","6","29 August 2016"," It might ruin other movies for you
","Before watching Come and See, I read somewhere that it was the greatest war film ever made. I thought that this bold claim of greatness surely had to be an exaggeration. It was not. Technically, I supposed I haven't seen every war film, so I can't say that for sure, but it is without a doubt the best war film this boy has ever had the pleasure of watching.<br/><br/>This movie is so good because it feels very real. It's gritty and raw, and for those reasons it's a really great experience. There is none of the sappy sentimentality or symbolism that seem to be found in so many other films, even in other war films. As a matter of fact, after watching Come and See, I was forced to reevaluate many of my other favorite films that I had always thought did a good job of portraying realism on the screen. It was only upon seeing this film that I realized that, in comparison, none of the others had gotten it right. Come and See shows the chaos and misery of war in a straightforward, unadulterated manner, leaving its viewers to take from it what they will. Still, the images on the screen are so haunting and powerful that there is likely only one conclusion anyone can draw.<br/><br/>From the very first scene, everything feels very real. The actors used weren't professionals. They're not beautiful people; they're ugly and they're dirty and they're real, with crooked eyes and bald spots and missing teeth. They might be real farmers and soldiers and partisans, for all we can tell.<br/><br/>In one memorable scene, the lead character and his albino girlfriend make their way through a muddy bog. They sink deeper and deeper, get mud in their hair, and struggle to keep their heads above the surface. At one point I felt sure they were not going to make it. It's a very tense scene. I held my breath and waited for the camera to pan away or cut to a different angle. It did not. It stayed on them for what felt like several minutes. It was agonizing for the viewer, just as it was for the characters and must have been for the actors as well. But the agony was a good thing, because the pure intensity of it all made the experience so much better. It wasn't fake, the way we know it is in most other movies. It was so real that I could almost smell it. It couldn't have been safe for the actors, but that made the viewing experience so much more genuine.<br/><br/>Similarly, in the battle scenes, we can tell that the conditions were unsafe and the actors were surely at risk. Real explosions send entire tree trunks flying right past the actors' heads. The characters flee the chaos, and the ground where they'd been standing seconds earlier explodes. Real bullets fly over their heads. We see real fear in their eyes.<br/><br/>There's an effect used in the film in which several nearby explosions mess with the main character's hearing. The background sounds are muted and all we hear is an annoying, high-pitched ringing sound. This is similar to the effect used famously in Saving Private Ryan—which I believe borrowed it from this film—and countless others since then. Unlike in Saving Private Ryan, however, the ringing here is actually extremely disconcerting and agonizing. We want it to stop, just like the character must want it to stop. It's disorienting. It feels real. It's not polished and toned down to make for a better cinematic experience. It's loud and obnoxious, just as it should be, and that's what makes for a better experience.<br/><br/>The movie started out so strong and powerful that I kept waiting for it to fall on its face and get worse. I felt it couldn't sustain the momentum, but I was proved wrong when it just kept getting better and more intriguing, scene after scene, right up until the climax.<br/><br/>The story, while straightforward, feels a bit confusing at first, because it's not what we're used to. It does away with the symbolism and metaphors that are so prevalent in many films. That's not to say that there's not a clear message here; there is. And yes, certain things may be symbols—the way things are naturally in real life—but there is no symbolism forced upon us. The main character's transformation may come to represent the transformation of his people or the rain-drenched stork my represent whatever and blah blah blah, but not because the filmmakers chose to squeeze that into the story, but because that's what happened in the natural course of things, in the story just as easily as it may have in real life.<br/><br/>When the film was being made, the filmmakers predicted it would be a difficult film for people to watch. They knew there was a chance that no one would want to see it. It wasn't meant to be enjoyable. But it was extremely enjoyable, at least for me. The story isn't wrapped up neatly and doesn't give the characters any poetic justice; by attempting to tell a real story, the filmmakers opened up so many more possibilities and made a film that is completely honest and unpredictable. The main character goes from one chaotic battlefield to the next, never knowing what will happen. Likewise, the viewers never know what's coming and that makes the movie extremely fun and exciting to watch.<br/><br/>Come and See is not a perfect film, however. The acting is bad in spots, especially toward the beginning, and some of the makeup is shoddy. The final scene is a bit unconvincing and does perhaps try too hard to drive the film's message home. Despite these flaws, however, Come and See still does a much better job than almost every other film. It's a unique and wonderful experience and I wish there were more like it."
"OliverBagshaw","10","5","6","28 July 2016"," The Brutally Honest Definition of Terror.
","This is one film that truly understands the horrors and devastation of war. There's no sugar- coating here. It follows a young boy as he joins the Soviet Army and their efforts against the Nazis during WWII. The young boy, Florya Gaishun (played magnificently and masterfully by Aleksey Kravchenko at the age of 14 during filming), is the film's main focus, as his mentality slowly unravels the more he comes into contact with the grotesqueries of WWII. The representation of such grotesqueries is brutally honest, as his young Florya's reaction and acceptance of such horrors. The performance, for such a young actor, is mature and terrifying - it's disturbing how effectively young Aleksey managed to react as he did for this film.<br/><br/>The film does not allow for any sense of equilibrium; tension is constantly building and this is frequently due to the film's use of sound design. It's disturbing and unsettling, from the realistic sound of high-pitched drones and muffled dialogue during the aftermath of mortar, to the horrifying swelling and progression of droning sound that builds to a disturbing crescendo at certain scenes, an example of such a scene being Florya's discovery of what happened to the village he once resided in. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, the atmosphere of desperation and the aspect of survival managed to keep myself glued to the edge of my seat - every moment feels like it could be Florya's last. The efforts of the director, Elem Klimov, is admirable - his intention for the film was to be as realistic as possible, and he achieves this. The film is powerful: the events are dreadful yet engaging; the performances are genuine and brutally honest; the effects are not simple effects (the ammunition used in the film is genuine and can be seen chipping away at the trees in some scenes). If you have the chance of viewing this film, take it - it's breathtaking and bound to leave the viewer scarred."

What it does achieve and it does so humbly and without pretense, is to dissuade anyone from the perspective that war is something to be wanted and embraced. <br/><br/>The acting is superb and the story is, sadly, historically accurate.

","Come and See is clearly the most powerful and violent anti-war film ever made.<br/><br/>After a boy finds an old rifle, he decides to enter WW2. However, he finds that it is much more horrifying than he imagined and he experiences the horrors of it.<br/><br/>What really makes this film so violent is that a mostly young cast is experiencing and acting in this. This movie has some of the most powerful massacre sequences ever put on screen. Rape is often described as forcing someone to have sex in cinema. But this movie doesn't need to be graphic in order to be powerful. In this movie, it is seen as hate-fueled violence being committed against other people. Unlike other movies, you cannot imagine the women in Come and See ever healing from their scars.<br/><br/>This movie's ending is up for interpretation. It can be interpreted many ways. Viewed certain ways, it can be seen as one of the most powerful scenes in all of cinema history. It's great how it's open up for interpretation but I honestly wish that it made it more clear what its ending meant. Its ending was too thin. Movies don't need to make everything 100% clear but they should at least give clues so it doesn't leave the audience scratching their heads.<br/><br/>Going off topic for a bit, whoever thinks that this movie contains propaganda are clearly prejudiced against this movie simply because it was produced in the Soviet Union. Those people are the same ones who wouldn't raise a single finger if this was produced in their country. If you still think that this film is propaganda then you need to watch it with a far more critical eye. Propaganda films should make war look like fun. They should make people want to join the war. They should glorify the acts of killing and ridicule of the enemy. Kubrick even made a parody of this in 1987's Full Metal Jacket. There was probably much more propaganda in 10 minutes of Saving Private Ryan then there was in this entire movie which is nearly 2 ½ hours long. Come and See makes your stomach turn every second. It makes you feel disgusted just at the thought of war. It is by far the most effective anti-war film ever made.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, this movie is the most effective anti-war film of all time. Its ending is a bit too thin for my taste but everything else in the movie is masterly done. It displays some of the most powerful massacre scenes in cinema and it handles violence expertly."

","This movie was the perfect way to show the reality of what war is. It's not glorious; it's not all about being a hero for your country; and it's not about honor. It's extremely hostile, brutal, violent, traumatizing, and heart wrenching. As a regular citizen you only see the ""honorable"" side of it; but as soldier or even a family member of a soldier you know otherwise. <br/><br/>Personally I believe that a message Klimov was trying to send to his audience is that this war was purely created by Hitler and if he did not exist WWII would have never happened. I came to this conclusion based on the regressive montage that occurs at the end of the film with the protagonist. As he shoots a picture of Hitler the screen cuts to scenes of Hitler and the tragic events of the war played BACKWARDS. It continues go to further and further back through this wars history to the point where it is a picture of baby Hitler and his mother. <br/><br/>What's great about it is that you get to hear the story of World War II from the perspective of the Russians (something our American textbooks don't necessarily do) and what THEY went through. It strikes you emotionally not only because their experience of the war was extremely sad and traumatizing, but also because Klimov's cinematography sucks you into the situation and creates deep and true emotion within you. <br/><br/>deep and sympathetic emoti."

","Traumatizing. Blow after blow, this movie comes at you, if I may say, relentlessly. Everything by Klimov in this movie is done with an amazing amount of style; which makes the difference from a film being grotesque and being genius.<br/><br/>Every scene of the movie has an intention: most being the insight to characters' psyche or exploiting the audience's. Klimov loves playing with his spectators with astonishing techniques. We are reminded ourself that what we're watching is merely a movie, and make a conscious effort to detach ourselves from it. *SPOILER ALERT* The director acknowledges that in the instance of the burning barn yard full of people. After a long frame, fixated on the side of the burning building, the camera pans to the entrance, where we see the doors booming under the pounding of the desperate townsfolk. He keeps some of his graphic content short and sweet, to give us a startling effect that lasts longer (for instance when Glasha turns her head while running and lays her eyes on the mound of bodies behind Flor's house).<br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this movie and recommend it to everyone!"

","I have never really been a fan of older movies, but at no surprise to me now, ""Come and See"" has made it's way to the top of my All-Time Favorites List. This movie is psychologically mind-blowing, shocking, disturbing, disgusting, and it will make you cringe as you're sitting on the edge of your seat. It is one thing to know the facts about history, but it is an entirely different thing to see it, as realistically as you can in the form of a film or as realistically as you can without actually experiencing it - though after watching this film, it is debatable as to whether or not I was actually there experiencing the same trauma. After watching this film, I felt an overwhelming crush of defeat, as if all the problems of a world at peace were absolutely trivial in comparison to the horrid experiences these people had undergone. I found myself engulfed in the story, to the point that it no longer seemed to be a story, but my own reality. My own tension and sorrow began building up so quickly throughout the movie that once I saw the girl with the whistle walk out, raped and scarred for life, I snapped - I just lost it. One of the ideas flowing through my head was: ""If this is the world that MEN have created, then I no longer want to live in a world of men."" I would be lost in a suspension of disbelief for the next day and a half, hardly talking to anyone, staring at my food, with an absolute loss for words or even a peaceful thought. As of last week, this has become my favorite movie that I have seen thus far. <br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this to friends, family members, coworkers, professors, and even enemies.

","There are scenes in ""Come and See"" that I will never forget, and since first seeing the film, have not stopped thinking about. As the title suggests, we are subject to an insider view of what happened in just one of 628 Belorussian villages who were invaded by Nazi soldiers. This film feels real, and is so powerful because of the excellence in which it was made, but also for it's capturing a historical truth; this is not just a movie. The shot where Florya—already mentally damaged from the overwhelming horror of his surroundings—looks at a young girl, bloody from a sordid rape is one of many images that represent the scars of the nation as a whole. Florya physically and psychologically ages, and we see the raw nature of who he has understandably become. What he has experienced is relentlessly worn on his face. The incredible authenticity and stylized sound design adds to the intensity. A really significant element that I've never experienced fully from a film is how all five senses are involved, especially how tactilely is evoked."

","I am a sucker for good war movies. In other words, I am a sucker for war movies that do not star Nicolas Cage, or sometimes, Mel Gibson. I find this genre fascinating when I feel that the experience of war is accurately depicted with no overzealous glorification. Elem Klimov's Come and See adheres to that particular condition.<br/><br/>Come and See feels real because of the hardships the protagonist, Florya, must endure throughout the film. Florya is found trudging his way through swamps and dodging bullets. Unlike an American film, Come and See stays true to reality in that it is very violent towards the adolescent protagonist. This element of the film serves to remind the audience of the reality that war knows no age. <br/><br/>There is no glorification here. The movie serves as a reminder to what war really is. In this film, one can come and see that war is merely a undertaking of survival, not a game of planting a flag into the soil and declaring a nation conquered."

","Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is one of the most horrifying war movies you will ever see, and it is a film that will affect you emotionally and physically in a way that few movies ever will. The film follows 12-year-old Florya (executed brilliantly by newcomer Alexei Kravchenko), who anxiously awaits life as a soldier for the Russian Army in 1943 Byelorussia. However his fantasy rapidly comes to an end as he comes face to face with the brutal realities of war and bears witness to some of the most terrible atrocities imaginable. The film relies heavily around haunting images and sound, and Klimov so vividly portrays Florya's descent into madness that by the end of the film we ourselves feel as though we have lost our minds. Though emotionally draining, it is a very moving and powerful film well worth seeing, that will without a doubt stay with you for years to come."
"golfer06","8","5","6","15 December 2007"," Pure Realism
","""Come and See"" directed by Elem Klimov documents Nazi Germany's assault on Russia during World War II. The story centers around a young boy named Florya who has a dream-like idea about being a soldier and fighting for Russia, but his ideas of war are shattered when he gets a taste of the utter truths of what the war can entail. After seeing his family dead, he is utterly distraught and knows he cannot contain this child mentality of war anymore. We can see Florya age dramatically through the course of film, even though he is still the same boy from the beginning of the film. The experience has truly caused him to age and change and for the audience to get a new look at him at the movie's end. ""Come and See"" is truly an assault on our five senses, capturing the realistic feel in all aspects. Klimov does a fine job capturing the essence of the brutality of the war with little violence. Movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" documents more violence, blood, and SGI then actually capturing the true emotion and hardship. ""Come and See"" really focuses on emotion and the horrors of war. The scene which really is special is when Florya finally fires his gun to have a sort of epiphany and realization. Going backwards in the scene really makes it more captivating. Any of these events could be stopped if Hitler did not exist or was killed before he could let the horrendous events of the Hollacaust unfold. I really recommend this movie to truly reveal what the war is really about and how psychologically damaging it could be."

","Not many films can capture the bottom of the jar of realism. Come and See, directed by Elem Klimov is one of the most realistic films that captures the terror of World War II in Russia.

The story centrals on a young boy, Fleor, who witnesses his family's death, escapes dropping bombs, escapes a burning building, and still has his gun in the end.<br/><br/>Come and See is a kinetic piece of cinema that will stick with me for the rest of my life. After watching Spielberg's Schindler's List, I didn't think it was possible to be effected as I was. Klimov does a fantastic job in disturbing his audience by showing the true terrors of the war. He assaults the audience with his images of violence. He expresses the ""glee"" of the Nazi's to a perfect T. Yet, behind all the horror, Klimov centrals Come and See on a young boy who doesn't lose his soul in a time when it would be easy to give up. If you want to watch a film that will expose you to the actualities of the Nazi's, then watch this movie. Klimov's Come and See is a film that is in pursuit of something real, and it finds just that, if not more."

","I will not write about the movie per se. This is my answer to those reviewers who claim that the movie is unrealistic, Soviet propaganda and so on. I will tell one story I heard from the residents of the small Byelorussian town called Starodub. They told me that during German occupation German police caught a woman who supplied information to the local partisans. She was interrogated but kept silent. Then Germans brought her to the watch-tower at the local fire station so that she could see how they will burn her house. She had three kids. Germans told her that they will throw them into the fire and let her to watch it unless she will give information about the whereabouts of the partisans. And when she refused they tied her elderly son and threw him into the fire. After that the woman jumped down from the tower committing suicide and thus saving lives of the other two kids. It is up to you to believe this story or not but I don't see the reason why the residents of the town (not just one but several) would lie to me.

Elem Klimov managed to show the pure brutality and bestiality of war in the most incredible way I've ever seen. He not only made it possible for the audience to experience a sense of being deaf but furthermore he even makes you smell the smoke when ruthless German soldiers burn those innocent people. The most memorable scene for me was when Florya shoots at a picture of Hitler at the end thus using his pistol for the first time. After everything he had to endure this symbolic act was proof for me off how much he matured during only a few days. Ultimately he can't force himself to shoot at a picture of Hitler as a baby, which really makes you, the audience, think, not only about what would've happened if Hitler had never been born but also about the innocence of a baby and what must have happened to him in order to become such a monster.

","A common practice nowadays in cinema, both internationally and locally, is the method of surrealism. The ultra hype active and somewhat dizzy views of what would be a normal situation (or in most causes, a situation that has been unfortunate) has almost become staple for many Hollywood directors who want people to see a picture differently than how they should see it. Filmmakers like Terrance Malick and Tony Scott, who use fast paced editing and dramatic monologues in the middle of their films which at times seem unnecessary. But Surrealism is a sort of message, subtle sometimes, other times rather blunt, that speaks of an image that is quite obvious at time. Probably the best example of this is Elem Klimov's film.<br/><br/>The 1985 Soviet Union cinema-masterpiece, ""Come and See"", originally titled ""Idi i smotri"" (which loosely translates in Russian for ""Go and See"") is a story that sends a message out rather vaguely. In fact, there's no message. Or is there? We are sent back in time to 1943 in the middle of the carnage of Eastern Europe during World War II. In the country of Byelorussia (modern day Belarus), a young boy named Florya wants to join the peasants of the town to fight against the Nazi horde. At the very beginning, he is a young and naive boy. He digs in abandon battlefields with his friend, searching for a rifle so he can fight. He finds a dirty old Simonov AVS-36 which is highly unlikely that it will ever fire again. He then joins up with the ranks in the prehistoric forests which represent a type of surrealistic surge of unending confusion and lost. As the peasants march onto the next town, they leave Florya behind, probably for his own good. Crying and in despair, he meets a young girl, Glasha. She paints of picture of a life beautiful is all aspects, with hell being so close by. She tells Florya that he is ""blind and deaf, and cannot hear me"". Not long after, the Germans invade and the forests are bombed. Floyra goes temporarily deaf when a bomb hits nearby, a high pitch whine that streams his hearing (a method used later in Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan""). They make it back to Florya town, only to find that nobody is there. Florya goes under a midst of shock and denial, as he races toward a nearby swamp thinking his mother and two sisters are there hiding; unbeknowanced to him, but to Glasha, a quick disturbing glance shows Florya's mother and sisters are dead and their naked bodies, along with several other villagers, are merely disposed behind his house. Florya begins to loose his sanity, while keeping some intact. He and Glasha go to another good of peasants, searching for food as the Germans exiled them to the forest. Florya joins up with more fighters, but one by one they are all taken down. He wanders aimlessly until he comes across a town with SS stormtroopers invading, raping and pillaging all of the villagers. It is there when the surreal image becomes distorted and twisted, as the invaders gleefully set fire to a church full of civilians and applaud at the majesty of the chaos. At that point, Florya grows up and becomes man, but more a shell of a man. His image of maturity and adulthood has been shattered at the horror of war and the atrocities that follow. In the final scene, unable to bear anymore chaos, he takes his rifle (which he never shoots in the entire film) and fires away at a picture of Adolf Hitler, which reverses time and all of the events of WWII, all the way back to a picture of a baby Hitler, which Florya cannot bear to shoot.<br/><br/>Without of a doubt, ""Come and See"" is a film than can be analyzed and studied for days, even weeks. The image of Glasha as a innocent and beautiful peasant girl shows purity and calmness to the tense situation, while Florya is a brass and immature symbol. Klimov uses such imagery to shake the viewer into submission. The Nazi atrocities scenes are by far, the most disturbing that the viewer cannot bear to watch in one sitting (I found them far more horrifying than the ""liquadation"" scene in ""Schindler's List""), especially the aftermath, when the stormtroopers and officers are captured by the peasant; some of them plead that they were ""following orders"" (a subtle hint to the Nuremberg trials), others openly admit without flinching that they are here to ""extermanate the Bolsehvik race"". ""Come and See"" is horror, and not the type that you see in Wes Craven films; this is TRUE horror. The surrealistic vision of the nightmare is uninhabited and chaotic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let you go. Every scene, more and more tension builds.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is flawless, to a point where none of it seems like acting. Everyone seems burnt out and disturbed. Aleksei Kravchenko does a marvelous job as Florya, where his uncanny skills of growing up in a manner of the way on screen is brilliant. The rest of the cast is Russian, so you won't see any big names in her, nor will you recognize. But without a doubt, it's deep film. You must watch ""Come and See"", even if you're a film buff, a war buff, or simply looking for a lesson in history. Go and see...."

The film depicts many of Nazi Germany's horrific war crimes in the region including setting people on fire with gasoline and rounding up entire villages to be shot or burned. While the vast scale of Nazi Germany's atrocities are widely understood today, it is still deeply haunting to witness these atrocities on film. By the end of the film, the viewer will feel as they have aged considerably after witnessing such horrific deeds. Even the young boy ages on-screen.

"Quinoa1984","9","4","5","2 July 2015"," Horror by Stedicam in this near-masterpiece
","Come and See comes off almost like a post-apocalyptic film, far more than what you typically may associate with a world war two spectacle. Of course director Francois Truffaut once said that you can't make a war film as 'anti'-war because of the excitement of the violence. Aside from many other examples refuting this, Come and See isn't simply anti-war, that would be too easy. Director Elem Klimov (in what turned out to be his final film) lays on the brutality and the barbarism so thick and with such force and magnified wrath that you'll never want to watch another war film as long as you live - and really, how can you go back to watching a regular ol' shoot-em-up-let's-kill-bad-guys war flick after this? You're basically put in the position as the audience member of the main character, the boy Florya (Kravchenko), and you are witness to see ALL of the devastation that the Nazis levy on the Belarussians. In other words, if you find this 'exciting', you may need to check your head.<br/><br/>I should note the filmmakers don't go right away into the horror and death. They do give a few moments at the start to show how Florya gets into this - he gets brought on to fight in the army (against his mother's wishes, and at this point Florya hasn't gone through anything yet to feel either way about it). He gets left behind by the troop to guard the base, what little there is, and we get a moment to know this character alongside a young woman named Glasha (Mironova). It feels like from this scene the doom is already pending - what do these two have really, at this moment, but each other - and characters address the camera head-on (think how Demme does it), and it's startling. But then come the bombs and explosions. For a good long while, Florya thinks he's deaf. It's just the beginning of his troubles.<br/><br/>No family (all dead), no hope, no future except for the struggle to survive. If one weren't thinking that this was set so squarely in 1943 Eastern Europe, one might confuse the backdrop as the bleakest post-apocalyptic drama ever made; The Road looks nearly weak by comparison to Come and See. Florya, as played by this actor, spends practically most of the rest of the film in a state of shell-shock - it also appears he's ages older as it goes on, looking like an old man by the moment he plugs bullets into a particular painting - and while it may not allow for the greatest 'character development' or whatnot (and early on a scene where he's cleaning a pot that'll be used to cook meat by the troops is a little on-the-nose metaphorically), we're with this kid all the way. He's meant to be us, and really if there's any purpose to something as unrelentingly bleak and punishing as this film it's to get us to feel SOMETHING from scene to scene.<br/><br/>And what makes the film so effective in large part is that the filmmaker doesn't, much as he can, look away from destruction with the stedicam. Shots can go on for a while if you got a good guy behind leading away on the camera, and in Come and See the epic vision of apocalypse comes thanks to a composition that doesn't waver to another cut when it doesn't have to. By following along we get caught up more in the action (think back to The Shining, which was another film that masterfully utilized the stedicam for such an effect). And what happens because of this is that when it comes time for the filmmakers to really unleash it all - a sequence that seems to last a half an hour in the second half of the film, where the Nazis gather up a village and, well, guess what Nazis do - the effect is tumultuous.<br/><br/>I had the feeling near the end of almost, just a tiny bit, being exploited by the filmmakers; not that I was looking for a ton of nuance with, you know, foot soldiers of a Jew-hating mass-murderer like Hitler, but the tone is so relentless in what it's set after it leaves little room by to be distraught. I found myself saying out-loud more than once, ""Jesus Christ!"" One may want to criticize a young actor like Kravchenko for having the same pained expression through much of the film, but can you blame him? Is it even acting after a certain point? The soundtrack, too, I should mention, adds to the uneasiness and surreal nightmare of the production, making moments like crawling through mud or watching a cow's last moments via its eyeball all the more horrific - it even brings in some Mozart, at one point sort of (I think) ironically, and then by the end it's just good ol' Requiem.<br/><br/>Come and See is not something you'll ""Want"" to watch, but as something to ""Need"" to watch, it's not dishonest about its intentions. It doesn't wave false patriotism, and through all of the images of the Nazi machine in the final reel (most notably a black and white montage of backwards propaganda film), this could be any people being subjected to murder and warfare. I don't know when I'd watch it again, but I'm glad I did for its artistry and the simple fact that it shows what 'Things That Go Boom' *really* do to people . 9.5/10"
"begob","9","4","5","27 October 2014"," Surprising
","I heard this was a great anti-war film and that it was brutal.<br/><br/>Compared to a slasher movie not at all brutal. And I'm not sure it was anti-war, but more a grim picaresque story in the middle of conflict.<br/><br/>I loved the stumbling from one bizarre scene to the next. That makes it better than Private Ryan - in that film there's one scene where the soldiers come across a family living on the top floor of a house that's been cut in half, open to the elements, and I remember wishing there were more scenes like it. Come and See is stuffed with that kind of detail, including one with a cow and tracer bullets.<br/><br/>Plus there's quite a lot of humour. One brilliant scene is of a group photo near the beginning full of laughter and energy, then a weird sequence with an effigy of Hitler made from a skull, a German police officer who basically acts like a rodeo clown, a dotty old woman who smiles when the killers leave her alive for breeding, and plenty of earthy jokes.<br/><br/>So it comes across with a touch of the hallucinations. But then the action scenes are obviously very dangerous for the actors, so that creates a sense of reality. You can see that in the next group scene, when an einsatz squad emerges from the mist to burn down a village. This is the cruellest part of the film, but even then there's great energy and enjoyment amongst the killers - a strange effect.<br/><br/>The story is told entirely from the POV of the young hero, and I'm not sure he carries it off completely. There's an awkward scene between him and Glashsa in the first act, where they really force the laughter. But that's OK, doesn't harm the overall effect.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is mostly excellent: a constant background of eerie, scratchy noises, and some very effective music.<br/><br/>Pity it wasn't shot in widescreen (or did I see a pan & scan version?). The final sequence, while interesting in its reversal of historical scenes, didn't do it for me (although it answers the question, Would you strangle Hitler at birth?), so I should mark it down a point but I won't.<br/><br/>This is powerful, and the humour and the two group scenes will stay with me. So it's a 9."

","I've seen my fair share of films about the first and second World Wars, but none quite like ""Come and See."" This film tells the story of a boy of fourteen years, Florya , who joins the Russian army in their efforts to defeat the Nazis. His excitement at going to war in the beginning of the film is enough to make you want to get out of your chair, somehow penetrate the screen, and slap him into realizing what he's about to have to witness—and worse—do. <br/><br/>Florya's excitement, however, doesn't last long. Over the remaining two hours, we (the viewers) watch as the hands of war reach inside his very core to steal what's left of his innocent soul. With every image of Florya's perpetually aging face, we are reminded that he is just one of thousands of young boys who faced the same fate—fighting to survive. <br/><br/>Klimov's film only depicts the fate of one Byelorussian town—there were six hundred in total! Truthfully, after watching the film, I was speechless. I didn't want to talk to anyone and I didn't want to think. I wanted to go home, crawl into my bed and hope that the ruthless brutality that had played out in the film wouldn't terrorize me in my dreams. <br/><br/>Intense, I know.<br/><br/>This film is a must-see. Although very difficult to watch at times, it's important that we expose ourselves to that which makes us uncomfortable; to that which we sometimes just want to forget."

","Just for starters, this is a movie that is actually painful to watch, and one of a few that made me look away from the screen several times. However, it carries a strong message and is filmed in a way that makes it feel incredibly real. Things I read and heard such as the guns being fired with live ammunition strengthens the realism even more. I also appreciated details such as when the protagonist Florya goes deaf from explosions and the way the director lets us understand it. All in all an incredibly good movie about an incredibly horrible time of which we all bear a responsibility of never forgetting. If you are to only see one WWII movie, choose this one. PS. I felt sorry for the cow."
"Brittan09","10","4","5","7 June 2010"," My thoughts about the film:
","This film is one of my favorite films I have ever seen because it has left a lasting impression on me. While I don't particularly enjoy war movies, finding the violence often to intense to find anything worth fill in watching it, this movie was different because it was not centered around the actual physical brutality of war, but the mental impact it has on the soldiers. In most war movies I have seen the typical soldier is portrayed as a desensitized character who does not seem to be effected by the murdering and the cruelty of war, which is very unrealistic and a unhealthy message to send to society. What is particularity nice to see in this film are the steps the Flior goes threw to become dehumanized, which is more true to reality in my opinion. Kilmov does an excellent job at making the viewer not only see but also experience the realities of war and the anguish it leaves our soldiers in. In many scenes of the film the viewer experiences the events with Flior through their own senses. For example, when Flior crawls threw the mud pond I felt like I was there with him smelling the mud and it made me actually cringe. Also, the scene when the cow is shot and we watch it die I felt a sense of loneliness and it pained me to watch it. However, this could have been attributed to the fact that I am not accustomed to watching the actual murder of animals, as their deaths are usually faked. At first I thought this movie was an anti-war film, however, the more I reflect I believe that in this case the movie tells us that the war was completely necessary and sought to reveal the courage the people of the Soviet army revealed under such grotesque circumstances."

And the music is equatable to taking shelter from an earthquake in an amplifier.<br/><br/>This film will change your life. There can't possibly be a better compliment than that."
"sober_samuel","9","4","5","16 December 2007"," Horror and Hope
","Klimov's ""Come and See"" is the one of the greatest World War II films that has been released to date. The film begins with the young Florya ( Aleksei Kravchenko ) searching an old battle ground for a discarded rifle that he hopes to use in the fight against the invading Nazi army. His dreams are nothing more than a child wanting to play soldier. His innocence warms our hearts and yet frightens us because we know this inexperienced young boy can't stand against Hitler's ruthless regime.<br/><br/>Klimov's direction not only makes us sympathize with the young Florya, he makes us become Florya. When a bomb explodes next to Florya, the audio dampens, causing both Florya and ourselves to lose our hearing. When Florya returns back to his home village, we know just as Florya does, that his entire family has been slaughtered but we both refuse to mean it. <br/><br/>I am sure we have all read in our history textbooks the atrocities that the Nazi party brought down upon Europe. We have watched documentaries, gone to museums, perhaps have a relative who lived through the war. But, I guarantee you, nothing will cause your blood to boil and anger to rise up in you than what you see in Klimov's ""Come and See"". But also, there is a more important message of hope in this film. Florya witnesses countless horrors, and he still refuses to lie down. This film reminds all of us of that (as cliché as it may sound) evil prevails where good people fail to act."

","It is a disservice to call what the actors in this movie do ""acting""; they are LIVING the movie, and because of this it feels as if you are really watching what the Eastern front must have been like in 1943. The main character, in particular, actually ages VISIBLY over the course of the film, his youthfull face aging into a reflection of all the horrors he has seen.<br/><br/>The film is full of memorable moments, and will definitely hold your interest.

","Come & See is without doubt one of the most beautiful and horrific war films ever mean. It is in many ways a Europeon Apocolpyse Now, just as with that film the central character is as more an observer of the war rather than a participant in it, Come & See's hero, Florya finds a rifle in the films opening scenes, which he carries throughout but only fires in the films final scene, and even then only a picture of Hitler. Floya though is a child, making the film a rite of passage as much as it is a war film. If this film can truly be called such, as it lacks any of the conventions and cliques of any Hollywood war film. In it there is no sense of war being in way heroic or noble. There are no action scenes or fire fights here, the casualties are all unarmed and even the Nazis who die are executed. It, unlike any of Speilbergs films in this genre, offers no rousing speeches at the end to give us some hope.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes, especially the final 'battle,' are hard to watch, horrific in fact, but they all beautifully shoot, making the film mesmerizing as it is shocking."

Germans killed his cousin near that place. So, he walked into the forest and I followed him. Suddenly my father turned to me, trying to not show me the grave: «Do not go farther. You should not». I am only noticed, that the water in the creek was red and crows flied up There was so many crows, that I shouted And my daddy can not eat for several days. And if he spotted crow, then he run home and he was all trembling, just like he had some fever... Nina Yaroshevich, 9 years old<br/><br/>«German truck stopped near our home.

Night fell and it was dark. Suddenly my mom breaking into the room, took me by the hand and run from home. Our yard is empty, and we did not know, where we can hide. And we crawled under the truck They came from home after us, but they did not find us. Mom was lying on me and I heard her teeth clattering... In the morning we returned to our home, after Germans leaved it. We entered home and found our grandma on the bed. She lied, tied to it Naked! Grandma... My grandma... I shouted in fear and mom expelled me from home. And I shouted and shouted and can not stop...» Luda Andreeva, 5 years old<br/><br/>They took 13 children, everyone they managed to find and set us in the head of the convoy because they were afraid of the mines, set by partisans. We walked and they ride after us on tracks. If they need water, they send one of us. Boys were not afraid, but girls cried. I remember it was early spring and we were barefoot Germans walked around the village, entering all homes in turn and they herd all parents, they suspected that thy have children fighting as partisan... And they behead them in the center of the village... They ordered: «Look». They did not find anyone in one house and they caught and hanged their cat. It pouched like little child».

I looked in the window and found that they were heading to our neighbors. Me and one of my brothers run into the mud room and fasten the door by hook. Then we sat on to the chest near our mother. The hook was feeble and German broke it in one moment. He overstep the threshold and shoot at us salvo fire. I had not time even to discern, is he young or old. All of us fell onto the floor and I fell behind the chest... When I came back to consciences, I feel something dropping on me It was dropping and dropping, just like water. I raised my head and found that it was my mother's blood and mom is lying killed. I crawled under the bed and all the floor was covered by blood. And I was wet of blood...

It makes you understand that the expression ""ethnic cleansing"" is just a politically correct expression that takes you away from reality. In fact the expression is cleaning the conversations. This scene shows you human nature at it's worst. And you sure don't forget. Yes, it's propaganda as the ""Rise of the third Reich in reverse"" scene clearly demonstrates. But the film was made in 1985 and depicts events that happened in 1942, so I can live with that. This movie will change you. This is how powerful it is. Don't expect action packed spectacular scenes, you'll be sorely disappointed. Like a lot of Russian movies, this is more intellectual.

","Theodor Adorno in an instructive essay titled ""Education After Auschwitz"", claims that all education should be geared towards identifying and understanding the social causes that led to the immense catastrophe of WWII. In other words, through critical theory he wishes to negate in a determinate way the Holocaust in order to both avoide a similar event in the future, but also to create the conditions for the emancipation of humanity from barbarism. Elem Klimov's film points to this direction. The Nazis are portrayed as total beasts for the reason that these collective atrocities transcend individual character. Cyclical camera - movement creates appropriate disorienting effects that match the inferno of war, while hand-held camera gives this horrific experience an immediacy that most films lack. Klimov celebrates in a lyrical way the power of nature and innocence in contrast to the Nero-like scortching of the Byelorussian village. The dialectic between terror and visual splendoour in not resolved in favour of the latter. Rather, Klimov uses superb visuals in order to emphasize the political dimension of the film without resorting into a sterile aestheticization of war and violence, a vice that permeates most Hollywood productions. Overtly influenced by Bergman's ""The Shame"", ""Come and See"" keeps the memory of these atrocities alive; that in itself is the most noble political function that great art can offer!"

","What is it, where is it, how will it affect me? After finding an old rifle, a young boy joins the Soviet Army and experience the horrors of World War II. There's a popular story that's told regarding this film. It goes as follows: at a premier, there was an elderly German woman seated near the back of the audience who, half way through the screening, stood up and boldly declared: ""I was a Wehrmacht officer during the invasion of the Soviet Union, and I can declare that everything you see in this film is completely true!"". In studying war films, realism is a factor that features heavily in dictating the acclaim a film is given, and to what extent it can be a true success of the genre. Idi I Smorti's raw, sombre, horrifying, damaging and empirically sound content elevate it to divine upper reaches amidst the 'war film' niche to any historian or intellectual immediately. About a third of the way through the film Klimov, a Stanlingrad survivor, juxtaposes the historical face of dismay that the newly deafened young protagonist conjures, something that could speak louder than the script of any American take at the unparalleled devastation war brings, with a solemn, indifferent and colourful stalk (crane-like bird) that followers him through the deadpan lowland setting. It's a piece of camera work that brought me trauma and introspection. Stylistically, Idi I Smorti is superior to its western peers of the era, even though it is shot in a grainy aspect ratio, this only intensifies what Klimov is trying to accomplish with his work. In terms of substance, the way Klimov uses two strangers: a teenage boy and a teenage girl, their families ravaged and piled naked behind their home, cling together under mosses and ferns in a marshland forest, whilst the thick drones of German aircraft fly noir overhead, is something that hits especially hard to all that witness it. Following the boy's journey, through constant loss, fugue, blood, wrath and decadence is perfectly formed and perfectly balanced, all the way up to the final scene, where he shoots a series of portraits of Hitler as a series of montages display a rewind in his advance, starting with the burning villages of the boy's homeland and distancing further and further from such local horrors. But after what he occur has seen across rural Belarus, he cannot bring himself to shoot the portrait of the infant Hitler on his mother's lap. We feel at one with the character at this moment and his experiences of war are hammered home harder than any moment in any film that has ever produced. Idi I Smorti is real, undisturbed, pure film making that the likes of 'The Godfather' and 'Citizen Kane' can't match."

The movie starts very unspectacular somewhere in Byelorussia and while the war is somewhere around, it is not that present. The situation seems to be ok. As the movie progresses, the situation portrayed in the movie just gets worse and more dire. No happy end and no heroes to be found here. 
The movie will also leave you alone with certain situations, as not everything is explained or answered. Some questions remain unanswered and it is up to your imagination and interpretation. <br/><br/>I rewatched the movie 3 times, and it only left me with more questions. This movie deserves much more publicity than it has."

","Come and see is a movie that grasps you by the throat and make you see war is not Heroic as many of the western/Hollywood movies seem to portray it. Of course, being a 1985 Soviet movie, it will put in some propagandistic elements and simple elements and sometimes poor acting. But also symbolism that sometimes will not be understood. What is this stork doing in the movie and why is it relevant we ask ourselves (e.g. a Russian friend explained me once that woodpecker ticking on a house means someone from the house will die soon). Not to mention that storks usually do not live in a forest, let alone build a nest on the ground.<br/><br/>What we are to believe from most western WWII movies is that is was, at least at the front, a pretty clean and honest fight. With hero's, bad guys and action. This movie shows that on the eastern front things were much different. Question is why this was so, was it that the Russians themselves were not like western soldiers/civilians and the Germans took the same approach? One of the most shocking parts in the movie is when the boy returns home with his girl after being bombarded in a camp. They sit and eat before they realize what is wrong. But also the actions of the Germans in the other village are shocking and we are engulfed with the fear of the people.<br/><br/>No this is not a fun movie but it is a class apart from many other WWII movies."

Klimov did a fantastic job on letting us the viewers experience almost the same exact senses and feelings the protagonist experienced in the film. I felt as if I was actually living at the same time and place that the film was taking place and it frightened me a bit that I had also believed I was right next to Florya hearing, smelling, and feeling what he did. I think that the main content that made me experience these feelings was Klimov's soundtrack. The sound design made things feel surreal and the use of Mozart's Lacrimosa was like icing on a cake."

","Come and See, directed by Elem Klimov, is a film that displays what the Russians experienced during World War II. Far from propaganda, the film instills the horrors of war. It is a chilling reality of what war is actually like. Flor, the protagonist, like many, sees war as a fun experience, an experience that could be boasted to friends and family. But with Flor we learn the truth of such an experience; war is hell on earth.<br/><br/>The first time Flor shoots his rifle is at Hitler's image through a repressive and symbolic montage. He shoots at the every regressive image of Hitler that appears on the screen except for the last image of Hitler as a baby in his mother's arms. Klimov is letting us know that we can't undo history. What is written can't be taken back yet it can only be learned from. Flor loses his innocence through his experience of war but learns the cause for fighting. This, among other advantages, helped the Russians defeat Nazi Germany in World War II."

","This is one of those films that leaves you remembering it, most specifically scenes that are almost traumatizing that you try to convince yourself that it's only a movie. It's quite the history lesson too, where I've never heard the side of what the Russians went through during WWII. Every time there's a bit of relief or some hope, it's immediately crushed, so much stress that the main character faces, that it starts to put you in that state and even worried if the next scene that if he'll even make it or if there will be something else horrific. The fact that this young boy sought out this gun and carried with him almost throughout the film, it was like his curse. When he finally fires, you get to experience an aggressive montage with a final image that most people haven't seen and its amazing the way it was put together. It's a true dark war film that shows the inhumanity of the Nazis, one that really sticks to your mind."

This film shows how propaganda gets under your skin and how an ideal ruins people slower then a butter knife. Slowly watching a child become a man and a dream become a nightmare I reflect on myself all too much. The film spoke to me so clearly in its message so concise in its roots. I can smell the passion see the passion and feel the passion. As the child watches things blow up, people die, and his life draw to a possible close every scene, he looks into the lens! The most amazing technique I've seen in film that has brought me close to the subject matter and characters, the moments where they look at me in the eye and say there lines to me but look as though they are truly in grave danger.

"ckbrew","10","2","2","27 July 2012"," One of the Best Films I've Ever Seen
","Firstly, I seen my share of crappy films. Just to get that out the way. Now, this particular film is like a masterpiece that should be stored and saved for years and years for generations to see. This film steadily kept my attention from beginning to end (even though it wasn't in English). ""Witnessing"" Coming and See (and it's a film you are forced to witness from Klimov), serves as a painful reminder though that the reality of war is hell. In the case of Russia, a very cold hell. There is no innocence or sympathy for anyone. All soldiers are equal. In the movie I thought, ""but hes just a young boy!"" Without doubt Come and See is one of the most powerful film i have seen so far. Though this film is emotionally draining, there are so many scenes that are like turning the page of a storybook. At the end of the film, the protagonist makes another shift in character (in my opinion) during the regressive montage where he is shooting a picture of Hitler. When he gets to the baby picture and doesn't shoot it shows that the protagonist still has some shred of morality. As a solider you are given orders without question. The first character change was when his parents were killed. I believe the character ""snapped"" into reality and consequently losing his innocence and his mind."
"ropkee","9","2","2","31 May 2012"," Come and See
","First of all I could mention that the movie itself was one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. From the first part of the movie, we see main character struggling to find a weapon, that he will use to join militia forces. Sound of a plane and a plane itself that appears during that scene creates absolutely intense and scary feeling, creating strange feeling towards his choice to join militia. <br/><br/>Second of all movie's plot points and acts are unpredictable. At first you might think that after joining militia, he and he alone will save the Belarussians from terrible life that they're in. Fortunately story shifts so powerfully that every single step is absolutely shocking. When I saw the scene in woods, after main character met the girl, for one second only, I thought this is going towards Hollywood love story. But what happened next absolutely demolished any ideas of boy and girl being together. One more thing - special effects - the way they present the explosions is incredibly realistic and can be put in documentary category. <br/><br/>The acting in the film is astonishing. The idea that the actors are always close to the explosions is very terrifying. And of course the scene with the swamp is one of the best struggle scenes ever. No one really knew what is inside the swamp and what might happened. The scene is presented in such a realistic way, that sometimes I felt like being there and seeing them. <br/><br/>The last thing that I would like to mention is the whole story of a movie. Although the movie is about one boy, who becomes a man, while trying to survive, we constantly feel the pain of people that suffered consequences of the war. I am from country that is incredibly close to the Belarussia and I have always heard the stories and learned the facts and numbers about what happened and thanks to this movie, people that were not aware of what was happening in that part of the world were introduced to the pain and suffer that Belarussians went through."

","COME AND SEE, with its documentary approach to storytelling, puts the viewer right in the middle of unrelenting horror; drags us, kicking and screaming, from one nightmare scenario to another. When our young hero gets shellshocked, we voyeurs are likewise shellshocked- and the depiction of shellshock has never, as far as I know, been so realistically conveyed. (We've seen it to a lesser degree SINCE, in movies like SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but never, to my knowledge, has it been handled so believably nor so uncompromisingly: the use of drifting, almost dreamlike, camera-work and uncomfortably muffled sound effects and music, combine to give us the impression WE have been shellshocked. One of the great strengths of this part of the film is its DURATION: it's not just done for a few minutes to get the idea across and then dumped: it drags on the way it would in Real Life, for fully a third of the movie.) If you have the stomach for some in-your-face Real World horror, I suggest you COME AND SEE."

One such part in the film was when Florya and Glasha were running away from the village and then the camera shows all of the bodies piled behind the house. At that moment I almost felt as if I were Florya and I had just realized that my entire family, and village, had been massacred.<br/><br/>Another part in the film where I inadvertently placed myself in Florya's position was towards that end. After having witnessed all that he did, I really felt as if Florya was going to want to get out of it, I know I would have. What shocked me was when he decided to go back into the fight. I could not fathom what must have been going through his mind.<br/><br/>To obvious reasons for anyone who has seen this film, it was emotionally and at some points physically draining. Throughout the entire film I was immersed into the situation that Florya was in. There were I was completely astonished by Florya's tenacity. Maybe it is so draining because somewhere deep inside I realize that if I were actually in his situation, I would not have the strength to continue. The reason I like this film so much is because it pushes me beyond what I know I could handle by making Florya's struggles so tangible."

The soundtrack meshes perfectly with the mood of the film and only heighten the experience. This film is taxing both emotionally and psychologically. By the end of the film our young and naive star has aged what looks to be about 30 years or more. Does this represent him growing into a man?

""Come and See"" is a film I strongly recommend to somewhat experience the internal feelings and struggles of any person who was trying to survive this time of Communism.<br/><br/>""Come and See"" is a very thought-provoking movie that makes you contemplate, ""What can make a person cause this pain unto others?"" It's not necessarily how can Hitler be so cruel to Jews, more like, what caused Hitler to become like this? It really made me think about the latter question instead.

"Bubblesniffer","Null","2","2","27 July 2011"," When all is lost...
","It is the year 1943 in Soviet Russia where war against the Nazi-Germany is at its most brutal. The protagonist, young boy name Fljora, is eager to take part in ""The Great Patriotic War"" to fight with the partisans against Nazis. Fljora, naïve and inexperienced in life, thinks he is going on a great adventure, but soon he realizes he has made the biggest mistake of his life. Fljora has gone on a journey to the darkest corners of the human mind and into a living hell. That also marks the end of his childhood.<br/><br/>Elem Klimov's masterpiece Come and See is an absolute anti-war film. There is no sign of the glamour of war that we are so used to seeing in Hollywood films – this is war as it really is. Klimov shows us the worst of humanity and it isn't a pretty sight. Some of the images shown to us are literally so penetrating and horrifying that they will likely be imprinted on our minds forever. Klimov attacks all our senses: you can feel it, hear it, see it, sometimes smell it, and almost even touch it. Largely this is due to the spectacular formalist soundtrack that is so impeccably constructed - the viewer is being made to hear exactly what Fljora hears. The intensity of these sounds heightens all other senses so much so that you almost forget you are watching the movie in the comfort of your own living room.<br/><br/>The most stagnating and unforgettable scene in the movie is the burning of a barn in a little village – with the villagers inside it. The Nazis show no remorse - they laugh at it. At this point, after losing his family and having already witnessed too much death, Fljora, who also witnessed the burning of the barn, has become a ghost of himself. The boy in the beginning is no more and we can visibly see how much he has aged – not in years, but in mind. Towards the end of the movie, Fljora is nothing but a frail human body. His mind is lost to cruelties and he is beyond salvation: the future, if there is one for him, is dictated for him already – all hope is lost.<br/><br/>Come And See deserves all the praise it has gotten since its release in 1985 and it can be considered one of the most important war films ever. For it says that there is nothing admirable, understandable and exciting about war. War takes away the humanity of people and in the midst of all it all, we forget who were are. People become savages who do unspeakable things in the name of ideologies. There is no room for love in war."
"tianafeghali","10","2","2","25 July 2011"," Best War Movie Ever!
","Come and See directed by Elem Klimov is by far one of the most powerfully captured, heartbreaking, and eye-opening films I have ever seen. It made me sleep with unease for 3 nights straight. Klimov captured every emotion out of me in: I laughed, I cried, I screamed, I yelled, I clenched my teeth. This movie also teased my 5 senses: I tasted the mud in the swamp as Florya and Glasha were struggling to get across. I smelt the fire from barn in the small village, while people were burning inside, and Nazis were laughing. I heard the flies buzzing around Florya's home giving off a sense of death, decay, and abandonment. I saw Florya go from the primal immature young boy, to an old man in a matter of days. I could feel the hardship, the sadness, the love that Florya felt for Glasha, and the Resistance coming to life. <br/><br/>Klimov's timing in making this movie is very pertinent because in 1985 the world was amidst a Nuclear Holocaust. This movie helps to show the reality of war, the resistance against war, and the toll that it has on every person. Aleksei Rodionov's cinematic elements really brought this movie alive. Each shot was filmed so impressively with illustrations and truth brought out in a significant matter. The death of the cow, the bombs falling out of the sky, the transformation of Florya was all captured effectively. Klimov was not afraid of exposing the truth no matter how foul and dehumanizing it was. Having Rodionov as his cinematographer helped assure that the story would not miss guide the viewer, rather assure the audience of the Nazi cruelty and the Russian Resistance. One scene in particular that was very emotional was the burning of the people in the small village. At that moment I had to hide my face and say to myself, ""this is just a moviethis is just a movie."" Right as I turned back the camera zooms to the door and people are knocking at it vigorously, showing the reality of the situation and that people were actually in there. If Rodionov had not panned to the door, I could have blocked out the memory and the pain rather than having to feel even more uncomfortable and shocked, as they wanted us to feel. You can see the recklessness of the Nazi's and their inhuman ways in multiple encounters in this movie; they treat the Russians like animals, like scum on their feet. However the Resistance Movement of Russian comes to beat them. The last scene was cinematography at its finest, with the camera taking its own path to find snow on the ground assuring the audience of the defeat, because Russian's always win war when winter comes along. <br/><br/>Florya played brilliantly by Aleksey Kravchenko is an interesting character. He passionately wanted a gun, and to fight in the war but is left behind. The war breaks out in front of him anyway and ends up changing his life forever. I don't think he realizes exactly why he wanted to fight until he saw in his very own eyes what had been happening. The Nazi's felt nothing from this little boy, as they felt for the old lady however he was a big part to their downfall and deaths. He never shoots his gun until the end when he fervently shoots the Hitler photo. All of his anger and rage came out in that last moment, which also showed a reverse montage of Hitler taking him back to when he was a kid, explaining that being a child is how everything starts. Florya is no longer was the 'newcomer' and after this long painful experience he decides to go with this people and continue the fight. The musical score and sound track also was a masterpiece in itself. The flies buzzing, the sound of the bombs stinging in Florya's ears, and taking the music from the beautiful Mozart to create an essence of dramatic cinema and is purely accomplished. <br/><br/>This movie is by far a must seeIf you thought you have seen the best of war films, think again. I highly recommend Come and See, to wake up your mind and realize the reality of the war."
"arianna-shapiro","10","2","2","9 February 2011"," Epic Apocalypse
","The Biblical reference to Revelation 6, ""Come and See"" could not be more appropriate in describing the apocalyptical detriment that 192 Byelorussian villages experienced at the hands of German Nazis. The intrinsically detailed account of the psychological damage inflicted upon a young boy's mind allows us to delve into the unknown. Florya willingly joins the Soviet partisans without knowing the devastating casualties of war which allows viewers to be immersed into this tragic loss of innocence and freedom while witnessing the affects of such atrocities on the lives of innocent people.<br/><br/>There are several memorable scenes that are vividly engrained in my mind while I recount my experience with this movie in particular. For instance, the scene where Florya and Glasha return to the Florya's ransacked village only to find the remains of Florya's mother and two sisters implied to be made into three dolls and the vivid sound of buzzing flies. Another scene that we literally see for a split second are the piles of bodies behind the barn as Florya and Glasha flee the village causing Glasha to retch uncontrollably. Then the scene after that where we see Glasha and Florya struggle through the mud was actually shot in one long take and made in such a natural, animalistic way that we literally feel the desperate struggle to survive the trenches of war. <br/><br/>Also, there are several instances of symbols used to convey a deeper message. For instance, the stork is said to bring happiness and prosperity to families in particular by providing children and are also supposed to represent anti-satanism. The stork appears in the forrest after Glasha and Florya survive the bombing. Children were the main target for German Nazis because they wished to annihilate the future generation of Russians thus the stork is used to symbolize hope. <br/><br/>The plane flying overhead also can be identified as the light motif which appears during transitions. I thought the plane was important because it signified the new troubles that would arise in the future and the ever present continuity of time. <br/><br/>The scene that most shocked me was when the German Nazis corralled the Byelorussians into barns, men separate from women and children and set the barns on fire. Besides Florya and another woman, who is later seen after being brutally raped by a number of Nazis, they are believed to be the only survivors of this horrific massacre. In the end, the Nazis are corralled much like the Byelorussians were in the barns, underneath a bridge and are defending themselves against persecution. The climactic scene is when the Byelorussians choose to extinguish the torch, even though they have already drenched them in kerosene. In their own way they chose to deter from the path of their masochistic evil enemies and preserve the dignity of humanity. <br/><br/>The face of Florya, aged in such a short while by the excruciating pain of loss and engrained detrimental memories, will not easily be forgotten."

","Directed by Elem Klimov in 1985 for the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of WWII. The name COME AND SEE is taken from a biblical quote. The film is a visual nightmare about the Soviets battle to defeat the Nazi's during WWII. The movie takes place in Byelorussia in 1943. The first words, ""Are you crazy?"" ring out as 2 young children are seen digging in the sand. The story centers on Florya, a twelve-year-old boy that wants to join the partisans. His dad warns him not to dig in the sand because bad things would happen. This sets the tone for Florya's survival through out the rest of the film. <br/><br/>The soundtrack complements the subjective point of view. Elem Klimov directs the story in contrast to ""cause and effect"" and shows the effect that leads to the cause. His honesty revealed the behavior of the Byelorussia's and how, at times, they aren't perfect and often mistreat each other. <br/><br/>Throughout the movie Klimov uses many close up and extreme close ups. His stylistic trait, having the actors looking through the lens thus created a hypnotic trance like feeling. How does one actually survive the horrors of such abominations to one's race without going crazy? Chills ran through my body numerous times while watching and I actually felt sick as bombs dropped around Florya and a young girl, Glasha, in the forest. Florya decides to continue the journey with the partisans and the movie ends with a cyclical theme by introducing a new young boy who joins the partisans, it's Florya so to speak - a few weeks earlier."
"shawnashamoeil","10","2","2","6 February 2011"," Come and See
","Klimov's film Come and See is a Soviet war movie that takes place in Belorussia and is hands down the most visually powerful and intense movie I have ever seen about the Second World War. Growing up learning about my Jewish history, automatically I connect World War II with the holocaust. This movie did a great job in reminding me and making people aware that the Jews in the Holocaust were not the only people devastated by the horrific acts of the Nazis. Watching this movie, I certainly was unable to keep my eyes open 40% of the time due to terrible things we had to witness! It all begins with a naive young boy named Florya who is ignorantly excited about going to serve in the war simply because he wants to shoot a gun, just like any typical young boy would. As the film continues, Florya is in for a rude awakening and learns that war is not at all heroic nor is it glorious (like Hollywood tends to portray it to be). <br/><br/>Florya first arrives to the camp as a ""new comer"" and is not only humiliated but also devastated that he is asked to stay behind and give his shoes to an older man. When Florya is left behind, he wanders around and faces an encounter with Glasha, who has also been left behind by her boyfriend who went to fight in the war. Glasha and Florya are equally as heartbroken as the other, and in this scene where they both begin crying in agony and end with laughter you begin to feel there emotions as well. What stood out to me was when Glasha says ""I want to Love... I want to have babies,"" for the reason that they are words that symbolize hope, and wishes for a future to come. Most people would lose this sense of hope and faith in such a situation where their entire existence is being threatened. Sure enough, right after the two meet, a bomb falls over them and they both survive.<br/><br/>Another significant factor in this film is the gun that Florya had been carrying since the beginning of the film with so much pride. Although he has been dying to use it, he hadn't shot it a single time. The only time when he finally uses his gun is in the very end of the film which becomes one of the most memorable and symbolic scenes of the entire movie. Right before they were about to leave the horrific village which had been destroyed by the Nazis, Florya spots a portrait of Hitler within the ruins of the town. <br/><br/>In this montage-like scene, Florya's mind is tracing back the most significant events of the Second World War. As his mind is racing through these mental images of Hitler, he is shooting his gun at the portrait recklessly, with so much rage and agony on his face. The images go all the way back to a picture of Hitler as an infant, sitting in his mother's lap, where Florya freezes and does not shoot his gun but stares at Hitler as a baby. Here, Klimov gives us time to reflect and interpret the meaning of Florya not shooting on our own. <br/><br/>This scene instantly connects back to the scene when the Nazi's locked hundreds of people in a room and lit them up in flames. Right before they lit the room, a Nazi soldiers says, ""Those without children can leave, It all starts when you are a child."" To me, Florya's choice to not kill the infant Hitler shows the bit of dignity and decency that he had left in him, not allowing him to stoop down to the immoral level of the Nazi's."

This moment for me is pure art of cinema, the director did a great job of expressing all these fellings and emotions. To fully understand what I mean, a person has to see this great film."

","I was in the war when I watch this film. this film has powerful images to attract people not to stop the movie in spite of tragic war we were watching. why people start war? I think this movie is telling us the tragedy of the war, and I really felt the message from the change of boy's expression. First scene, he was smiling and happy to join the army, however, his expression is gradually changing into old, tragedy, a lot of wrinkle through the war. it represents the tragedy of the war and human being become tragedy through. We have to face that the war is occurring right now. if you watch this film, you can experience the war, at least about 2 hours, and you will see the meaning, result of the war."

","It's a saddens me that i can openly acknowledge the disdain I have for my country. Even if they were to disregard all the negative political and economical aspects of my country, a profound social burden weighs down upon my heart. The mere title of my analysis alone has sparked this somber realization of our inevitable downfall. ""13 Going On 30"". What a paradox to this movie. Awwww this poor little girl has some issues so she wishes she could be older, awwww.<br/><br/>But what about Florya? What about the whole generation of children who lost their innocence that Florya represents? Where's THEIR birthday wish, so they can do the exact opposite and wish to be young again before any of this ever happened?! We are so pathetic. You might be thinking this paradox is induced by only but a title, but I'm sorry there are too many things wrong with my country to not be a pessimist.<br/><br/>At any rate, this movie is the best war movie I have ever seen; which is why I gave it a 10/10. I cannot at all relate to Florya, which is also why i give Klimov a 10/10 in directing this film; for here i perch, an American on his excessive Redwood, some 60 years later, amorously indignant from a bunch of pictures juxtaposed a certain way in order to suspend my reality for 2 hours. KUDOS Klimov, kudos."

","Come and See is a great movie about an event of our past, which formed our history and future. WWII might be something that many want to forget, but it is actually something that we all should remember in honor to those who lost their lives in the insane and tragic event. The acting in this movie is amazing and convincing in an emotional way, it is like experiencing the event when watching the movie. For Aleksey Kravchenko, being a young boy acting in such circumstances, carrying on the emotional and painfully feelings of the main character Florya, he did an amazing job, I really believed his pain. The movie succeeded in capturing how much people change both physically and psychologically by events like war. What war really do to you and how it changes people. A really good movie based on an unforgettable event in our history. Watch it if you haven't already done so!"
"toqtaqiya2","9","2","2","12 October 2010"," ""...and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, ""Come and see!""
","Come And See is a one-of-a-kind film. It's a film that shows the brutality and horror of war without hesitation. Its reputation has grown considerably since its release, mostly by word of mouth. The film was even included in Channel 4's list of 50 Films to See Before You Die. Come And See is a psychological horror drama about and occurring during the Nazi German occupation of the Belarussian SSR, in 1943.<br/><br/>The film has to be seen, that's all there is to it. There is no other anti-war film as effective as this one. Taken together, it's a series of horrifying events in which Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) gets involved in. What sets these scenes apart from, for example Hollywood films, is that they realistically portray what it would have been like to live in fear during the total war in the USSR. For example, in one scene German soldiers parachute into a forest during sunset. Florya and a girl his age are there too. They hide, observing the soldiers. The soldiers pass, some distance away. There is some firing. Bullets hit trees, splinters fly. The soldiers' faces can't be seen. Florya and the girl are obviously terrified. The soldiers are like an unstoppable force which will devour them if it sees them. Music is used to great effect too. But it's not uplifting music (though there is a scene where partisans listen to Sacred War) or horror movie music. It's rhythmically amorphous mostly, and it's the sort of sounds you may hear when you're in awe or when you're preoccupied with something and can't hear what else is going on around you.<br/><br/>The Red Army isn't present in the film. Partisans are present sometimes. Come And See is no documentary film. I should note that some people may find it strange or hard to watch, but it leads to a finale that is both awesome and disturbing. The war that Adolf Hitler began in Russia, a war of brutality and no consideration for human life, is shown in all its effects in the Belarussian countryside. In the end it's shown that all this hate and suffering was begun by a man who was once a boy, a boy with a mother. What's interesting is how different Come And See is from other Soviet films. Soviet films are typically about bravery and liberation, but Come And See is clearly anti-war though some war images in the film are some of the most impressive I have ever seen. Elem Klimov, the director, lived through the World War II, and this one film he made clearly shows that there's more to war than soldiers fighting. Come And See is a masterpiece. It's also one of the great war films."
"rudysspam","10","2","2","1 August 2010"," Definitely Come and See this movie
","I have always been fascinated by war, specifically World War II. It's something I always enjoy learning more about through any means such as fictional movies or stories and also documentaries and non-fiction stories. I love watching movies that deal with dogfights in the skies, stories about Holocaust survivors, the multiple point of views of those involved or basically anything that occurred during the war and the events that led to the war. This movie seemed perfect to watch since it was about a POV that I hadn't gotten the chance of seeing. I was told before watching the movie that my entire view of war would change. It did, it surely did change.<br/><br/>The movie didn't necessarily make me hate war, it made me realize that wars with no purpose are the wars to hate. This movie just showed me that World War II can be justified because it had a purpose. It was a unified quest by multiple countries to stop the power hungry Nazi Germany, Japan and the countries involved with the Axis powers. There definitely was other goals set by the Allied powers that were set with anything but good intention but overall they were on a mission to dismantle the Axis powers. They wanted to stop the atrocious acts that were being committed by the Nazis. We see an example of the inhumane acts carried out by the Nazis in Come and See when they set fire to the building with the villagers stuck inside. This scene filled me with anger and disgust. I might have been the only one during the screening who wanted the Russians to torture the captured Nazis. This is a movie that moves you in many ways. In some parts of the movie you feel joy then all of a sudden your turning away from the screen in disgust.<br/><br/>For me the acts carried out by the Nazis wasn't what change my mind of war. Its the experience of Florya during the Nazi invasion of Belorussia. This is a kid who joins the army because he is fascinated with the war and army. He thinks it'll be a bang bang type of action but soon realizes the horrors of war. He's a 15 year old who ages in a matter of days. He's been bombed,shot at,saw the burning of a building filled with people,had a gun pointed at his head,and countless other things. I was surprised that at the end of the movie he still decides to stay in the army, of course this time more mature than at the beginning of the movie. This time around he understands that war isn't a game and knows the purpose of war.<br/><br/>Klimov does an excellent job displaying the psychological effects of war on Floyra. The use of music fits perfectly with the movie. The moment the Nazis bomb the area Florya was first stationed we hear this deafening noise. I look around because I was unaware the deafening sound was coming from the movie. The sound was frightening and I couldn't imagined how Florya or anyone could react when all they hear is a loud ringing in their ears. Another scene were Klimov does an fantastic job of incorporating the audience through their senses is as Florya and Glasha walk through the dirty swamp. You see them walking with mud all over there face and its hard to imagine just what exactly is in the water. Every sense a person has reacts to this scene. Klimov throughout the movie does not show excessive violence or gore. When Glasha and Florya return to Florya's village, Klimov didn't right away give away that Florya family and village had been entirely killed. He didn't have blood all over the floor, all he had to show that something was wrong was use a bunch of flies. Flies were everywhere in the village. You hear the buzzing and that's when you know something is not right then all of a sudden as Glasha turns back as she runs out the village we catch a short but powerful shot that displays the horror that took place. <br/><br/>One of the most powerful scenes in the movie is at the end when Florya shoots his gun for the first time at a picture of Hitler. A montage the shows the reverse chronological events that led to Hitler's rise to power. The montage ends with a picture of baby Hitler. The one line from the movie that explains why they stop at the picture of baby Hitler is said by one of the SS soldiers and it is, ""It all starts with the children."" This is somewhat true, Hitler did have a troublesome childhood that played a role in his outlook on life and people.<br/><br/>Overall, Klimov directed one of the most magnificent war movies to come out. It will change people's views of war and make people see it in a new light. Wars don't affect only those in the army but everyone is at danger during war."
"luis-k310","10","2","2","1 August 2010"," Suddenly I've changed my mind, f**k wars man!
","Don't hesitate! this film is amazing, After so many World War 2 movies i thought 'Come and See' would be like the rest, boy was I dead wrong! There is an eerie feel throughout the movie, i found it very haunting. It quickly became one of my favorite foreign movies. Overall my favorite scene was that of Florya and Glasha in the Forrest from their weird cry/laugh to their dancing in the rain, it all seemed so surreal. These two kids in the middle of War. Another thing I admire about Klimov's 'come and see' is that the movie is not about a victory, but one of a Belorussian village being burnt to the ground. Overall, Florya went through more than he had bargained for, hopefully one day he saw and end to that hell."
"clope020","9","2","2","31 July 2010"," A life-changing story of a boy and his horrific experiences during WWII
","""Come and See"" is a story about a young boy who decides to join the German forces during World War II in Byelorussia. His name is Florya and before leaving for war, his mom desperately begs him to stay but he refuses without thoroughly thinking about it first. In my mind, he seems to have that mentality that he can handle any situation and before he knows it, he puts himself in a very deep rut like going to war, and he experiences horrific events. Such events include the burning of a whole village and innocent men, women and children inside it. Punishment in this country is run by drunken German soldiers who only focus on their military careers and sweeping people out by killing and torturing them. Elem Klimov's story of this experience during World War II has given me a broader perspective on how people should be treated and how important humanity is in our every day life. Not only this story has given me a drive to learn more about similar stories, but I have also learned more about the camera elements of it.<br/><br/>I notice that the film includes never ending moments of long takes, indicating the emotional or even deep meaning of what is going through Florya's head. Floyra facing these events, in my opinion, is traumatic, but at the same time it can be a way of learning to not repeat the actions or intentions that the German soldiers cowardly acted upon. He never would have thought that going to war was going to affect him mentally in the end. Before the film ends, German forces take over and Adolf Hitler becomes politically successful. Florya finds a framed picture of Hitler and he begins shooting it numerous of times symbolizing all the emotions, whether it is anger, lust, fear, envy etc. Anyone should never be exposed to such massacres and what I have taken from this story is that it does not matter how old a person is or what race because we all should be treated like human beings under no circumstances. These victims are treated worse than animals with cruelty and such hatred. Nevertheless, I feel Florya is affected the most because he witnesses it and has to bear it all without having a say. He is oppressed because he is young as well as the other victims because of age, social status, race etc. When watching this film, I was on the edge of my seat, not because I was angry, but because I was in deep thought into figuring out why these soldiers committed demonic actions and one day I would like to know what their stories are because every person has a story to why they do certain things. Overall, this story is life-changing and extraordinary."
"yenypalacios","10","2","2","31 July 2010"," Assalt on the senses
","Before seeing the movie, the Film Studies professor told the students: ""It is an assault on the senses"", but nothing could have prepared me to deal with mixed feelings that the film produced. Floyra, the child that the story revolves, ages just in front of the viewer's eyes. He ages based on the most frightening experiences one can imagine. The responsible for the terrible injuries in soul and body are other human beings for the ones that not descriptions exist. I could use the word beast to describe them, but animals do not act like they do. The Nazi soldiers attack Floyra's village, subdue, torture and murder its inhabitants. Entire families are burned alive and soldiers rejoice in their work. Most of the perpetrators are drunk. This can be considered a sign of humanity that can speak of the desire to numb and even block the conscience to commit such barbarism. Nature embodies degradation as well. What was green and lush is transformed, by the grace of the German bombs, in bleak remains of trunks and bare branches, a metaphor for the condition of this young soul. The bomb that deafens to Floyra echoes in the audience. The buzz is part of the assault to the senses about professor spoke before the film opened. It is particularly disturbing the scene about cow that is stolen by Floyra and his comrades not to eat, but to provide milk to the hungry people who remain hidden in the outskirts of the village. An initial burst of bullets kills his comrades and the second wounds and kills the animal. Its eyes show the agony and it is impossible to look, you must close your eyes to avoid those feelings. Exhausted, Florya falls asleep under the heat of the dying animal and wakes up with the coldness of death only to rise up and think how to drag the animal to where his people are, but it is impossible. The viewer lives Floyra's experiences. Stress is not just emotional, the body is stiff and there is nothing to mitigate the feeling until the end of the film, even when those who commanded the massacre were captured by the guerrillas and are subjected to a sort of trial that ends with a benign death sentence. Instead of burning them alive, as it was the first intention, they are put to death with bullets. Floyra's revenge is different; he shoots Hitler's photograph and as clear demonstration of the resilience of the human being, he picks up his rifle and joined his comrades. He is not longer the rookie in search of adventure. Now he is a man readily participating in this awful cycle. I like this movie. I highly recommend it. Director Elem Klimov shows us a harsh vision of war and, it's a very persuasive message against any confrontation."
"mark-tordai","9","2","2","30 July 2010"," Come and See By Try to Look Away
","I've been watching war movies ever since I was 8 years old. My uncle is a big John Wayne fan and ever since the 3rd Grade we'd watch movies such as The Sands of Iwo Jima and The Longest Day. When I was 13 years old I saw a movie that broke those raw-raw, American war stereotypes and it was Oliver Stone's Platoon. Since then I've never been the same as far as my love of war movies.<br/><br/>I saw Come and See recently and might I start by saying that this movie is nothing like anything I've ever seen before. While Platoon is still my favorite movie of all time, due to its power, individualization of soldiers and for not glamorizing war, Come and See is a different kind of war movie with a different feel. Come and See is not a violent movie nor is it gory but it might make you feel sick. Come and See is a deep, psychological horror movie seen through the eyes of a 15-year-old Belo Russian partisan in 1943 when the Nazi's were storming through Byelorussia.<br/><br/>The brilliant Russian director Elem Klimov allows the viewer to feel the madness, anger and frustration of seeing the enemy storm through your homeland and rape it blind. Psychologically speaking, Klimov allows us to see the damage war does on the human mind and soul. He does this by using close ups that focus on the innocent facial features of the young 15 year old main character. By the end of the film, the close ups actually become quite disturbing to watch as our main character become worn and tiresome. It's actually very hard to watch this poor boy become so diminished.<br/><br/>At the end, I only had one word that could describe this film, intense. Come and See is the most psychologically intense and profound film I've ever seen. I encourage people to watch this film but try not to take your eyes of the screen, even though it can be hard."
"pincomet","10","2","2","30 July 2010"," A Great War Film
","Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is a very moving film about the Nazi German's trying to take over Belarussia in 1943. it impacts the viewer with shocking images of a burning image that makes you wonder if it's actually happening for real. <br/><br/>The protagonist Floyra is a young boy, who joins the Partisans army. he desires to fight because he wants to do what everybody else is doing. But what he sees during his time in the army is enough to scar him forever. Even though Florya doesn't say much throughout the movie, his expression says everything. By the end of the movie Floyra ages like 30 years. It shows how he has lost his innocence, but has not yet lost his humanity. <br/><br/>In the last scene when Floyra shoots Hitler's picture it seems like he finally gets his revenge for what Hitler and all the German's have done. When he shoots the picture and he gets to the part with the baby, it really makes you think. It made me think about how you never know what a baby might grow up to do and if you had a chance to stop it from when he was a baby, would you do it?"
"SMCfilm","10","2","2","9 June 2010"," Reviews don't do this film justice, you must see it to judge for yourself.
","I am not the type of person to watch a film about war. I would have never chosen to see this film on my own accord had it not been for my International Film class as I tend to stay toward happier and uplifting films, but I would have to say this is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen and for good reason. Having seen this film over a month ago, I can honestly say that it has truly reverberated with me as its message is so powerful. All five senses are impeccably impacted, whether by choice or not. This is the only film I have ever seen where sight, hearing, touch, taste and even smell has practically jumped off screen, impacting me in the most profound way. I felt as though my own nose was smelling the soup that Flyora and Glasha ate, just as I felt as though I was trekking through the swamp filled with sewage and bodies, just trying to make it across. This film is definitely not for those with weak stomachs, as there are many gruesome scenes. Although horrific, these scenes are what make the movie so real and honest. This is an honest portrayal of war and what happens, not the Hollywood version of it. Watching Flyora's transformation on screen from young boy to WWII Byelorussia war veteran, we see a complete alteration of him as a person. Midway through the film, we encounter his shift as he no longer looks like a boy, but weathered man with a constant stare on his face, as though he is no longer fazed by anything, be it life or death. The most horrific scenes in this film are the most powerful, from the burning of the shed to Flyora's dying father, this film does a wonderful job of evoking human emotion and sentiment. I believe that the most powerful scene however is when Flyora uses his gun for the first time throughout his entire journey, and that it is not aimed at a physical person. This film is extremely raw and stuns you as the movie continues. I was not able to comprehend some of the scenes that were occurring as they are so different from my day to day life, but they opened my eyes to the reality that is war. The soundtrack was almost eerie at times, mimicking the eerie scenes on screen. As Mozart's ""Requiem"" played, I couldn't help but be thankful that this is not my life, but merely a portrayal of someone else's, expressing the resilience and steadfast sense of purpose that those in combat must continue to have. I think that although I wasn't able to grasp the depth of some of the scenes as they were occurring, I was able to long after the film had ended, proving the immense impact it had on me personally. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this film as that is not the correct word, but I was more entranced by not only its message but also its images. This is a must see for anyone, especially anyone interested in joining the army, as it gives an unfiltered perspective that is bound to impact you in one way or another."
"disc00","10","2","2","7 June 2010"," potential insomnia
","If you get scared easily, do not watch this film alone at night. Especially if you plan on getting a relatively decent amount of sleep. But if you're not as easily shaken up as I am, any hour of the day will suit you just fine! Although it's not my first-choice genre, I have seen quite a few war movies over the years. I often find even the mildest displays of violence and gore too bothersome for me to keep my eyes open, but compared to this film, those are all ""Hollywood"" style war depictions, glamorizing the concept of battle in order to ensure a decent range of viewers. ""Come and See,"" or ""Idi I Smotri"" is haunting yet captivating at the same time. As much as I didn't want to view the atrocious acts I knew were coming, I could not permit myself to move my eyes from the screen. Following Florya through this rendition of Russia in World War II is an experience that carries out beyond the image on the screen. It really pulls you into the action, causing the viewer to forget they are just watching a movie. The incredible images of Florya's surroundings in ruins, and the overwhelming sense of realism from the focus on each of the five senses, make Klimov's ""Come and See"" the most unique war film I have ever seen. There is no attractive hero, no romantic storyline, and no Hollywood typical ending, which separates this film from the genre-oriented industry. If you're sick of seeing the same movies over and over again, but with different titles and (sometimes) different actors, I would highly recommend giving ""Come and See"" a shot. This film cannot simply be read about for one to understand its powerful essence; it has to be witnessed firsthand. As Florya discovers the horrific reality of war, I felt as though I was discovering it with him. At the start of his journey, this young boy is very naive of this reality, but seems to ""age"" significantly from experiencing it. It's almost as though he sees the ""Hollywood"" version of war in his head, as he excitedly leaves home to join the soldiers in the woods. The happy look on his face is something I can recall, but can no longer imagine. After you witness his intensely horrified gaze, it doesn't leave your mind. You feel as though you're right there with him as he watches a church full of people burn to the ground, refuses to accept that his family has been murdered, and finally, when he intensely stares down Hitler's photo and fires his gun for the first time. Rather than feeling simply disturbed after this experience, I felt both enlightened and guilty. I learned a lot from this film, about both techniques in film making and the reality of WWII, which left me to my thoughts for quite a while after watching it. The feeling of guilt is due to the fact that I was watching this poor boy go through such terrible atrocities, and it truly felt as though I was a quiet bystander. It's easy to lose awareness that this boy is not really going through these things, and his captivating expressions, along with the incredible sound effects, are what made this so real to me. If this film was able to affect me so much from simply viewing it, I cannot even imagine what the real-life experience of WWII in Russia must have been like. Overall, it was worth being a little scared after watching this film. I know it's one of the few I will never forget, and an important one to have seen for anyone who's interested in an aspect of film."
"Kat_Wilkins","10","2","2","7 June 2010"," Klimov is a cinematic master!!!
","I will never be able to forget this movie hard as I try to erase it from my memory, it remains in the back of my mind, popping up every now and again to remind me that it was not just some war movie. I felt a terror that I can only imagine is infinitesimal compared to those who lived, and died, during the Nazi occupation of Byelorussia. <br/><br/>The movie follows the naïve Florya, a boy around 13 or 14, who joins the Byelorussian partisans in the war in 1943. Throughout the movie he ages and looses his innocence through the disturbing reality of war. <br/><br/>It was so beautiful in the most demented way possible. I don't mean to say it is ""beautiful"" to see Nazi's running around killing everyone in sight. It's beauty lies in it's affect on the human psyche. However unsettling, I feel changed, renewed, different, although I can't put my finger on it, the world seems more beautiful, more resilient and more terrible than before. The few who lived through that war haunt my dreams and my nightmares. A close friend of my family survived that; he was able to survive war and desolation, the murder of his family, the oppression of his people, yet he was taken easily by cancer last February. <br/><br/>This movie is the same morbid poetry that true life is made off. In my favorite scene, Florya and Glasha, survive a bombing on their camp, and are alone in the forest. They have gone temporarily insane but are so overjoyed to be alive, they can do nothing but dance the Charleston and laugh hysterically in the rain. <br/><br/>While watching I wasn't thinking, ""hmm, that's an interesting angle"" or ""did that cow really just get shot?"" I was just in horror, not blinking, not moving, not thinking. Finally towards the end I decided I would just close my eyes until it was all over, I didn't want to believe any of it was real anymore. But I couldn't. I just sat, catatonic in horror, more afraid to look away than to continue. If I closed my eyes, I would be betraying Klimov and everyone that lived that horror. I owed it to them, all of them, to watch and see what we humans are capable of—both survivors and destroyers. <br/><br/>After the movie ended I didn't speak. It wasn't until a the next morning that I could tell my mother why I cried myself to sleep. <br/><br/>This movie will stay with you. It will make you wish you had never watched it, yet at the same time you'll be thankful that you did. It made me feel crazy, hopeful, furious, happy, hopeless, vengeful, and many other emotions I can't even begin to identify. This is cinematic art-sound, cinematography, location, and acting all work so effectively together, we can feel freezing rain and the putrid swamp squishing between our toes. We can smell the bodies burning, and know numb terror of the young girl with blood running down her legs. I hope someday I'll be able to will myself to watch it again so I can pay more attention to Klimov's artistry and skill as a filmmaker."

Slowly throughout the film, you see Florya go through hardening situations that force him to grow up quickly. I was in total shock and awe of how Florya's face aged so rapidly at the end of the film. His face was filled with shock, terror, anger and absolute sadness of not only what he had gone through but what he has seen. The movie is a gripping experience in that takes you by the shoulders and shakes you to see what war really is, pure chaos.

"sampen_ashley","10","2","2","6 June 2010"," Intense but gratifying movie with a message
","""Come and See"" is a very memorable movie for me. I can't help but picture the scenes that I'll never forget over and over again. It has so many elements that makes this movie as strong as it is. The message I got from this movie is the realities of war are not what is shown in ""Hollywood"" movies. This movie sheds the light on the truths of war so creatively that as a viewer, you can't help but feel like you are there with Florya, enduring all that he endures. Florya starts out so naive and innocent to the horrors of war, like most recruits of the military are. His face of sublime happiness when the soldiers come to take him to the camp set up in the woods is frightening. He only sees the glory and fame that war can offer while his mother, who is sobbing uncontrollably, knows what could happen to him as well as to her self and her twin daughters. This moment touched me because I have a little brother who will have to enlist soon but thankful he is not blind to the truth of war. I couldn't promise that I wouldn't sob like Florya's mother if my brother had to go war. Florya then meets Glasha, a beautiful woman who seems to be the lover or perhaps ex-lover of Koshach, the commander of the soldiers. Glasha is a pivotal character for Florya because she seems to represent all woman for Florya. Florya's humanity is also seen when he cares and builds a shelter for Glasha. Glasha eventually becomes all that Florya must protect because he loses his mother and twin sisters. The scene where the audience discovers the death of Florya's family is so heartbreaking and I found myself silently hoping and praying that maybe his mother and twin sisters are on that island in the middle of the bog. I knew deep down that there was no chance that they survived but I couldn't bring myself to abandon hope. This film definitely made me feel for the characters and that is what makes it so intense, at least for me. These characters could be people today. Glasha is a girl who wants to be loved but is rejected by the man she wants. Florya is a boy trying to prove he's a man by using combat. This film is very realistic and I think it is amazing that the director used actual bombs and gunfire for authenticity. ""Come and See"" does a great job of showing the audience what war is really like and I believe that is important because so many people are disillusioned by movies that glamorize war when the truth is there is no real victory in war. I like how this film starts Florya out in a sort of peaceful camp site where the soldiers of the partisan are gathered then the audience is thrusted into real warfare, shown by the used of real bombs dropped near the Florya and Glasha when an air attack begins. The scenes that were most brutal for me were the barn-burning scene, and the girl rape at the end. Even though the actress who played Glasha isn't the actress who played the girl who was raped at the end, I couldn't help but connect the two. although Glasha's fate is never revealed in the film, she probably ended up just like that girl at the end because she was pretty and couldn't fight back an army of Nazis by herself. In conclusion I definitely recommend this film but be forewarned that it's not exactly easy to watch."

","When you hear a movie you're going to watch is a war movie, you expect exciting gun battles, spectacular explosions, and maybe a few depressing scenes towards the end that ultimately give you that warm patriotic feeling inside. In ""Come and See"", you'll only see depressing scenes that will fill you with nothing but sorrow and anger.<br/><br/>Of all of the holocaust/ World War II movies I've seen, nothing has made me feel such anger towards the actions of the Nazis like this movie has. Most war movies portray Nazis as mindless killing machines that are hard to hate since they appear to be the mechanical dogs of Hitler. In this film, the German characters had a real human side to them which made them much easier to hate when they would go out of their way to make sure Russian peasants suffered some of the most excruciating deaths possible for means of entertainment for the Nazis.<br/><br/>Every character in this film is very real and the young protagonist will certainly leave an impression on you long after you have viewed this film. This is a powerful movie that will stick with you, but I advise the reader to watch it at a strategic time because it will definitely wreck the rest of your day when you see it."
"loganx-2","10","2","2","9 May 2010"," Seeing Is Believing (The Best War Film Ever Made)
","Come And See is the best war film ever made. Throughout the film we watch a young boy enthusiastically dig out a gun buried in the earth and join up with his countrymen to fight off the Nazi invasion, only to have his boyhood fantasies of heroism, literally burnt alive.<br/><br/>The young actor Aleksei Kravchenko looks nearly unrecognizable by film's end; the bags under his eyes have bags under their eyes. We observe the war entirely from his position, where a girl majestically dancing in a rainstorm can transition without warning to bombs falling on a forest camp.The boy tries to leave his company at one point, and return to his village. When he left his mother gave him his rifle and said, ""You might as well shoot us now. We'll die if you leave."" Though we never find out one way or the other, his house is abandoned and he assumes the worst. The boy's ears are damaged from the bombs and going deaf and perhaps mad with grief, he wades out into a bog.He finds himself in another village where he hides amongst a group of farmers he was planning to rob. The Nazis show up and begin the round up for a massacre. We watch what happens first hand, like a Nazi officer's girlfriend shown eating lobster as a barn full of people is set on fire. The boy gets a chance at revenge, but it doesn't change anything. The film closes with the boy firing at a statue of Hitler, and here the film plays documentary footage of the war flowing backward, the bombs go back into the sky, the people come out of the cattle cars, the goose-stepping parades flow in reverse, until finally we reach an image of Hitler as a baby.<br/><br/>The next shot is of the boys withered face as if hes looking at the photograph too, realizing that even Hitler was young and innocent as he was once, and likewise Once Upon A Time went off to fight for country. No war film has ever left me so drained, and the only other film that goes into as much brutal detail of victimization is maybe Gaspar Noe's Irreversible (love it or hate it, in that film you go through an emotional experience). The Russian's suffered the greatest casualties in WW2, more than any of the allies or the Axis powers and depending on how you arrange them, more than some nations put together.Their tightening cultural grip came as the result of the tremendous scar of the War, much the way Germany became brutal after their losses in World War 1.<br/><br/>Elem Klimov captures war as a universal psychological scar, where demonization and glorification only amount to momentary denials of its terrible scale and depth. There was no place to root for the hero, only a skeletal hope that he would survive, though at times you think he might be better off if he didn't. Visually it's similar to a Andrei Tarkovsky or Bella Tar over the shoulder long walks and slow pans style. There are no real shoot outs; the war is a presence either felt as sudden bombs or swarms of Nazi's barking command. Come and See is a surreal, disturbing, and intense coming of age film, hypnotic and horrific in equal parts. Director Elem Klimov never made another film after it saying, ""everything you could do with cinema I had already done."" Though at the other end of the spectrum Quinten Tarantino's Inglorious Bustards shows you can teach an old dog some new tricks, Come and See is for realistic war films as good as I could possibly imagine a World War 2 or any War film could be."
"decembernaghi","10","2","2","8 August 2009"," Utterly stunning in its mesmerizing storytelling
","Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" is possibly the most moving film I have ever seen. As a war movie, it is unique in its genre in my opinion. It engages the audience with all five senses in its nightmarish reality. The war came to life right in front of my eyes. When the first bombs erupted around Florya and Glasha, the use of sound made me feel like I was right there. I smelled the rotting bodies when Florya came back to his hometown and all he saw was flies and bowls of soup. I felt the slimy grip of the marshes when he dragged Glasha through them as he fought the idea that his entire family was dead. During the most harrowing and excruciatingly miserable part of the movie, when the Russian village was burned to the ground with the people inside, I felt the fear and pain and panicked helplessness. I wanted to cry out, to scream, to run. In the burning farmhouse, I wanted to claw my way out. I felt the terrifying responsibility of having to decide whether to take the chance to jump out the window or risk staying inside. My throat was dry, my body went from hot to cold to hot again. I shivered and I felt the burn of heat. While the disconcerting use of close-ups made it almost painfully intimate, the movie was all the more haunting because Florya was only one of thousands experiencing the same and worse. By the time Florya was shooting the picture of Hitler and using his gun for the first time, I felt battered and burned, exhausted and deeply disturbed, but also oddly satisfied. Though shooting Hitler's picture was just a symbol, it really made me think. What if Hitler had been killed as a baby? Would that be wrong? It made the film feel more well-rounded. I felt like I'd lived an entire lifetime in the space of a few hours. It was a truly remarkable film. I've never seen anything like it, and I don't think I ever will again."

","First of all I just want to say that I thank God that I have never been and never would want to be in a horrific situation in my life like the Russians did in Byelorussia. The handful difficult situations and sufferings that I have been through in my lifetime does not even compare to what these poor people had to go through. It is awful, horrible and traumatizing and those survivors' hearts and souls are marked for a lifetime. That memory of the act of inhumanity by the Nazis will never go away from their minds. It just brings about so many questions. Why did the Nazis think they were better than anybody else and have to commit murder? Why did Hitler come up with this ridiculous idea? It just makes me so angry to know that there are people that have this mentality of being better than others and have to kill them in a brutal way. The film was very difficult to watch because there is no happiness what so ever and its very disturbing and full of tragedy. To me the filmmaker obviously made this film because this tragedy remains in his mind and it has not been forgotten. It is a historical film for all who know about it and for the newcomers that are arriving into this world."

","This is a war movie without battles yet probably the visually strongest and most interesting movie ever told about the Second World War. The movie too making you aware of that the Holocaust was not the whole story about World War II. Watching this movie, you certainly will use all of your five senses! The movie starts with a very powerful scene where Florya is taken away to a camp in a Belarussian village to serve in the war. Florya is naively excited about going out in the war but as the story progress he comes to understand that war is not at all heroic, neither about glory, but about suffering and death. When Florya comes to the camp as a ""new comer"" he is humiliated by that he cannot go out in the war and needs to leave his shoes to someone that needs them better. After the soldiers left the camp, he walks into the wood and cries, and meets Glasha who just been left by her boyfriend that is going out in the war. Glosha is as heartbroken as Florya is and in this emotionally loaded scene, Glosha says ""I want to Love"" I want to have babies"" , which are words that capture something that many people probably lost- their hopes and wishes about life and love. Right after they meet, a bomb falls over them. They survive but stick together as long as possible. The morning after, they go home to Florya to find that his sisters and his mother have been killed along with hundreds of other people of the village, lying in a stack just outside his house. It is a horrible scene, hard to stop think about even after the movie is over. Florya not only grows up emotionally but is aging several years in a two days time! The gun that he so proudly carried in the beginning hasn't been used a single time, except in the very last sequence of the film where he founds a portrait of Hitler in the ruins of the village. Here, a montage like scene is tracing back the most significant events of the Second World War, all the way back to when Hitler was an infant in his mother's lap. This is a very memorable scene and the fact that Florya doesn't shoot may have multiple interpretations, especially since the time is meant for us to reflect over this ourselves. However, seeing this scene, you instantly thinking back to the scene in where hundreds of people were locked in a building and killed but a comment from a soldiers says: ""Those without children can leave"", ""It all starts when you are a child"", may suggest that Florya's choose to not kill the infant Hitler which would essentially go against such a revelation."
"jimmyd1988","10","2","2","3 August 2009"," Appealing to the Senses!
","""Come and See"" was brilliant in that it really had a way of capturing all five of our senses - we could smell the filthy bog, hear the explosions of the bombs dropped by planes, feel the heat from the raging fires, taste the leftover soup from Florya's abandoned house, and see the brutal acts of the Nazi's. By the end of this film, I could only have more sympathy for the victims of this world war, and even far less sympathy towards the Nazi's.<br/><br/>My particularly favorite scene would have to have been when Florya continuously shoots the picture of Hitler in an attempt to undo all that has happened under his rule; but is stopped short when we are shown a curious image of Hitler as a baby. At this point, one can only wonder how such an innocent looking baby could be the cause of so much bloodshed and suffering, and if we were in Florya's shoes, could we have pulled the trigger ourselves?"

","The reality of this film is amazing. I felt as if I were in the scenes, whether it was an explosion, a love scene, or death scene, you were shown the results of these events happening as if it were happening to you. The use of the hand held camera made me feel as if I were actually following the protagonist step by step. The disappointment the protagonist feels when he could not deliver the cow to feed his people, I was saddened because he tried so hard and had gotten so far. The scene were the chapel is being burned down, was so emotional and scared me. Seeing this happen right before my eyes and the idea that this happened is truly tragic. The actors performances were so real. Glasha's character going crazy not knowing how to feel, act, or what to do. The protagonist not only mentally but had physical changes through out the movie. He started out as this naive boy and grew into a man who has seen everything. This film was possible because of perestroika and glasnost and marks a new beginning for Russian film making. I am glad I got to see it."
"sandylieu","Null","2","2","2 August 2009"," A Must See Touching Film
","Elem Klimov's Come and See is a tremendous Russian story about a boy battling WWII in Byleorussia. Towards the end of the movie, we will learn that the boy, Aleksei Kravchenko (Florya Gaishun) will evolve into a whole new person after he witnesses such tragic events. In one scene, he has to overcome a feeling of losing his whole entire family, which in many people's eyes is not an easy thing to do, obviously. There are many scenes, however, that may be horrifying to some viewers. During certain points of the movie, I would have to admit, I sat up on the edge of my seat, anticipating on what was going to happen next because I was in total shock. In the beginning of the film, we meet Olga Mironova (Glasha), who we see is a unique character. At one point, we learn that she is the woman who cries, and then laughs. But her doing so, brings the audience at ease because we get a sense of humor for just a few seconds.<br/><br/>Within this film, one thing that I've learned is that they were looking beyond the camera. They use a wide-angle lens, which puts the camera right up to their faces. This effect makes you feel as if you are right in front of them, looking at every movement they are making. But that's the awesome part about Klimov's directing skills. This is a must see movie for viewers trying to understand what I am trying to convey, especially the cow scene."

","In 'Come and See', one could watch the ugliness of war through the main character Floyra. For instance, after the bombs dropped in the forest, Florya lost his hearing. The audience hears the sound perspective of Florya when there is a loud ringing noise and muted sound of words. Other sounds the audience hears are echoing words and/or erratic noises. It feels dream like with muffled noise and bits of music here and there. Surprisingly enough, there is no voice over narrative (because we are so in tune to Florya and his experience).<br/><br/>In addition, the characters were was dimensional and interesting. When Glasha was dancing on the box in the forest, it seemed theater like. One conjures up a life of hers before the war, working on a vaudeville type stage. She also seemed to have knowledge beyond her years. Maybe from working? Or from her experience of war time. She says the general will die, as if she has seen death before. This is in contrast to Florya's character who is so innocent and ignorant of evil in the world.<br/><br/>Other contrasts in the movie are when a man holds a sign that says, ""Hitler the Liberator,"" right before the town massacre. Another contrasting shot during the rape and pillage of the town is of a Nazi lady who calmly eats lobster while she plays classical music. The very next shot is of the church in flames, burning people alive. Most shocking and horrific is the long shot and close up of the girl who was brutally beaten and raped by a truck load of Nazis. Again the terror of it all is manifested on Florya's point of view shots and the look on his aging face.<br/><br/>Toward the end of the film Florya shoots at Hitler's picture with the slogan of liberation. Then, young boy who is dressed like Floyra in the beginning of the movie appears. He is the ""new comer"" and Floyra is now the experienced one. The toll of war is written all over his face with wrinkles and tears. With this Florya is still telling us his story.<br/><br/>The end is very poetic. There is a long take of the beautiful forest and gentle snow falling. Then the audience sees the triumph of human spirit of Floyra, and the rag tag band that drove the Nazis out of the Soviet Union, moving out. This is accompanied by a swelling Mozart score. The band and Florya, our now grown up protagonist and character narrator to the story, march out of sight."

","This is a war movie unlike any other I have seen. What makes this movie different from other war movies that have been produced recently, is that this movie relies on its sheer power and message to move the viewer as opposed to blood, gore and explosions. This is not to say that the movie does not have any substantial explosions or scenes that would certainly keep you up at night, the scene that comes to mind for me is the burning barn scene. Yet the beauty and genius lies in the way the director Elem Klimov demonstrates restraint in what he shows his audience. By leaving certain things for the audience to make out for themselves, he makes this movie much more painful yet powerful.<br/><br/>During the Second World War, Flor, a young Byelorussian boy finds a buried gun from WWI near his village, which allows him to take part in the war. Against his mothers wishes, he leaves her and his two younger sisters to take part in what he thinks will be an amazing and enjoyable adventure. Yet in reality he is walking into a traumatizing experience that will forever change and age him both psychologically and physically.<br/><br/>We follow him throughout a series of painful experiences that would leave anybody scarred for the rest of their lives. Just observing all of the horrid things this poor young boy had to survive through made me cringe. Towards the end I felt so emotionally and mentaly drained that I found myself wishing that Flor would finally just be allowed to die so he would not have to suffer anymore. Overally an excellent film."

","Klimov's Idi i Smotri, or Come and See, is a unparalleled psychotropic anti-war film. It follows a boy through his induction into the partisans of Belorussia during WWII and their resistance to Nazi occupation. What is most effective about the message of this anti-war film is that there is not a single moment which glorifies or glamorizes violence. Instead, Klimov shows the actual effect of the war on one person in one village. Both are microcosms of the effect the war had on many people and places. To see this awful tale unfold, and then to know that this was but one of so many, is utterly haunting. Of course, to draw the viewer into the world of Florya, the young boy we follow, Klimov must tackle and take hostage our disassociation with the film.<br/><br/>To pull us into a suspension of disbelief, Klimov evokes the five senses, thereby, taking the viewer into the past. He manipulates sound to make us feel powerless, taste to disgust us, smell to perturb us, sight to horrify us, and touch to connect us.<br/><br/>From the moment it begins you feel unsettled by a young boy, with the raspy voice of an old man, helping another boy, Florya, to find a gun. The one he locates is still attached to a corpse. His grueling transformation leaves him like the young boy who helps him in the first scene, a boy with the literal and figurative wrinkles of the elderly.<br/><br/>I have seen this film four times and recommend it to every person who is interested in film. Albeit disturbing and morose, I cannot shake its effect. I find it difficult to use a word to describe it. It is a phenomenal picture, but to say it is wonderful is awkward. What it depicts is too atrocious to call it a wonderful film. It is a necessary film, one which should be watched. What I can say to complement it is that the techniques are groundbreaking and the rhetoric is flawless."

","This film was heartbreaking in the way it showed this wide eyed, child turn into an old man due to the violence and cruelty he witnesses. The expressions on his face as the movie progresses go beyond make up and it's clear that his soul, as well as his face, age drastically through each horrific experience he has to endure. The film made me feel anxious, especially the scene where Florya and Glasha are left behind as the rebels march off to ATTEMPT to battle and defeat the Germans. As soon as the bombs go off and we, as the audience, hear as Florya hear, the ringing and terror and isolation set in. It made me feel as though I were experiencing it firsthand for myself. It only got more intense for me as the movie goes on. It had a crazed, manic feel to it, and I couldn't stand Glasha's insanity, I truly despised her character. Two of the most horrific scenes for me, were when Glasha and Florya return to his village and Glasha looks back to see almost the entire population of the small community massacred, with their bodies piled on top one another like animals. That scene was nothing however, to the image of the young blonde woman who, in another doomed village, had been gang raped by the German soldiers after she had been dragged by the hair into the back of their military vehicle. I will never forget the image of that woman walking awkwardly toward Florya while blowing a whistle hanging out of her mouth, with blood running down her legs and her mouth bruised and bloody. I couldn't help but think that her fellow neighbors had had a more merciful death burning with each other in the town hall. Seeing her, all alone, completely out of it and obviously not being able to process what had just happened to her was too much to bear. All I could think as I watched this scene was that at least they had died with each other, and here was this poor woman, who had not only been repeatedly violated, but had been witness to her children, neighbors and family murdered, and it is she that is one of the only ones left alive, albeit barely, to bear the burden of these losses."

","The lead in this movie is a young boy named Florian who joins the Partisans against the will of his mother. When the Partisans go to war, he is ordered to stay back at their camp with the women and elderly. He meets a girl named Glasha who also stays behind. Both of them get into a bomb attack but miraculously survive. Florian finally leads Glasha back to his village to seek rescue at his mother's place but finds it deserted. He decides that his family must have sought refuge in the nearby forest.<br/><br/>When Florian and Glasha arrive in the forest, they run into a group of survivors. He finds out that his family and most of the villagers have been murdered. Florian wants to help but after a failed attempt, he watches how the survivors are forced into a church to be burned alive. Florian was fortunate enough to escape, but the traumatizing experiences let him age within a short period of time. Florian's wrinkled face in the end of the movie is the face of the war.<br/><br/>Klimov gives us no information about specific places or events. Even though he gives the SS Commander a historical name, and the German soldiers are played by German actors, it doesn't make a difference for the movie because everything that happens is directly affecting our protagonist, Florian. It appears that Klimov's ""Come and See"" doesn't just represent WW2 but stands for all wars.<br/><br/>""Come and See"" is by far one of the most shocking, horrifying and visually stunning anti-war movies that I have ever seen.

"ktrinh925","9","2","2","30 December 2008"," Witnessing the time of war in Soviet Russia
","Kilmov's 1985 film ''Idi i smotri'' or the American title ''Come and See'' does a extraordinary job of not only inviting the audience to witness the time of war in Soviet Russia but to understand and feel how it affected one through the eyes of a young boy named Florya(Sonny in English subtitles). <br/><br/>The film opens with a scene where a Partisan is yelling followed by Florya digging painstakingly on the ground for weapons with another boy. The day after, Partisans come to Florya's home and take him with them to start organizing for the Nazi confrontation, while the Florya's mother is left in tears. Soon after joining the Partisans to face the Nazi's, Florya is left behind, as well as a girl named Glasha.<br/><br/>Through the film, the audience is able to experience the brutality of human beings towards one another. At times it is hard to understand what is happening precisely, perhaps one of the reason is because there is not a lot of straight forward dialogue. For instance, I feel the movie instead reaches out to the audience through the use of graphic demonstrations of the plot rather than explanations from the characters.<br/><br/>One of the most crucial moments is when the Nazis moved forced villagers into a wooden church only to demolish it. Florya was one of many that were mixed into the crowds and fatefully fled when the Nazis gave mercy for those who did not have children. There is a scene where a woman was able to leave the wooden church but her baby was thrown carelessly back into the church.<br/><br/>Although towards the end of the film Florya barely speaks, one can define his emotions by his facial expressions. As his experience during the Soviet War progresses, so does his age. At the beginning of the film he looks healthy and around thirteen years old. By the end of the film, he looks as if he has aged twice his own age, but still had some sanity with the exception of his condition. When Florya meets Glasha again, they both look almost as if under psychological trauma and there is a sense of understanding through their silence.<br/><br/>In the scene where Florya's mother pleads the Partisans to not take her son to go fight and says that he is a good polite boy and would never hurt anybody. Florya took his revenge through art. In his revenge scene, which is considered to be the most memorable and powerful scene in the film, shows Florya shooting at a Adolf Hitler painting, which was carried earlier in the film by someone. Within every few seconds of him destroying the painting, there are flashback clips of dead bodies at the concentration camp, Hitler giving regards to a German boy, the Nazi party, and many other Hitler moments. As each of these images unwind, Florya viciously shoots the painting. He does not shoot when the image of Hitler as a baby in his mother's lap appears, which shows a kind of purity and innocence for which he protects. His little sisters and mother may be one of many personal reasons he wanted to join the Partisans. I feel he wanted to protect his family and he wanted to make sure his siblings were going to be able to have a future.<br/><br/>Come and See definitely sets the bar at being one of the most crucial, disturbing, and unforgettable films. Klimov allowed many of the rifle shots heard throughout the film to be real. Apparently, one of the bullets was only seven inches away from the head of the boy who played the character Florya. Klimov did this to give the film a more authentic feel within the set. With this extremely risky technique and the works of a brilliant director, the final product and outcome were all done precisely, leaving a long lasting impression on the audience as if they were there."

","A remarkable war film so different and so intense as no ordinary work can truly be. It is an experience and a unique approach to show a part of humanity affected by a horrible war, a war not only on the outside, but deep at the heart of human emotions. The lively and atypical sequence of the story rather than plot driven has touched me profoundly. The portrayal of suffering is very vivid because we see, we smell, we feel as if we were there. Florya finds himself in the middle of growing up and consequently the rapid worn out of his life caused by the horrors of the war. We see him age so quickly in front of our eyes and with the sound, it makes it more haunting. To lose your mind, to age so so fast is just unbelievable. The long take shots and the very realistic actions leaves us in awe. It is a trauma that in the end doesn't really have an ending, a film that could always have the same impact anywhere, anytime."

The sound effect expressed his mental confusion.<br/><br/>Next, Nazi's terrible massacre of many people in a village was very realistic, so I could not keep watching the scenes that many citizens were killed in a large burning house.<br/><br/>Even though ""Come and See"" is a masterpiece of war movie, I would not like to watch that again."
"Dominic-Berlemann","10","2","2","28 October 2007"," Deeply disturbing tour de force into the abyss of the Nazi's war of annihilation in the Eastern theater
","Once you've seen this 1985 movie by Elem Klimov, you'll never be able to forget it. The reasons for this are to be seen both in the aesthetic quality of the realization of the script, to which Ales Adamovich contributed as well as the director, and in the extraordinary sujet, the brutal elimination of a Belorussian village and its inhabitants at the hands of the SS in 1943, something that happened to 628 villages in Belarus alone between 1941 and 1944. Partisan warfare behind the front-lines forms the background of this profoundly shocking and deeply moving drama. The pubescent protagonist of the movie, the 14 year-old Flyora, against the will of his mother stubbornly and somewhat naively insists to be allowed to join the ranks of the Soviet partisans operating from the relative security of the impenetrable woods in the area of his native village. The partisans, however, don't think young Flyora to be of much use, and therefore give him only minor tasks like standing on guard. At the partisan encampment he meets Glasha, a girl romantically linked with Kasatch, the leader of the partisan unit. In the course of the film, the almost extra-terrestrial beauty of the girl sharply contrasts with the ever-increasing brutalities of war. After an air raid on the partisan camp, Flyora and Glasha decide to make it for the boy's nearby home village. However, the villagers have all been executed, quite likely because despite all precautions it must have become known to the German occupiers that a boy from the village had joined the guerilla forces. Their bodies can be seen for the fraction of a second piled up like culled cattle behind a wooden house. Flyora feels guilty for what happened and heads back to his fellow partisans, leaving behind Glasha. Shortly after that, the boy tries to steal a cow from another village in order to support his unit, yet Flyora is spotted by the German troops that happen to be in the place at the same time. With difficulty, Flyora manages to escape and to disguise himself as an innocent farm-boy, but his actions trigger off an unimaginable act of revenge on the part of the SS men. The following part of the movie will definitely make some viewers TURN OFF their TVs, as it realistically depicts in great detail the slaughtering of the village people by sadistic and partly intoxicated SS troops going on about their deadly 'business' in what seems to be unscrupulous routine fashion, standard procedure. At the same time, the movie's aesthetic foundation undergoes a radical change: After the poetic, neo-expressionistic start to the movie which in many respects like its heavy symbolism is typical of 1970s and 1980s Soviet art cinema, the director switches to a purely naturalistic mode of presentation which lets the horrible facts speak for themselves. Those who manage to endure this part of the movie right to the end at least are rewarded with the almost cathartic arrest and subsequent execution of the SS unit's leaders and their Belorussian accomplices responsible for these horrific atrocities. At the end, it becomes clear that the experiences of the boy have deeply etched themselves into his soul and his face, which is disfigured by wrinkles making him look like an old man by the end of the movie. All in all, this is a true masterpiece which delineates the dreadful historical truth in an adequate artistic fashion bare of propagandistic tendencies."

","I have never been so affected by a film. At no point in my life have I hated war as much as I did throughout the watching of this film.  Now I understand why Come and See was used to educate East German students as a sort of ""Just Say No"" propaganda film against neo-Fascism.   However, while I watched it not once was there a moment of self-reference in relation to the film or intellectualizing over the mise en scÃ¨ne.  This is owed completely to the effectiveness of Elem Klimov's intentions.  The title, ""Come and See,""  is his direct invitation to the audience to join in the horrors of 1943 Byelorussia. We are not permitted any moment to wander through the scenery.  This is a polar contrast with Tarkovsky, who gives us the gift of time and silent contemplation as if we were reading a spiritual text.  With this film every moment is charged with a negative beat tied to an even more negative beat looming on the horizon. The sequence in the forest with Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) and the girl (Olga Mironova) is an ominous allusion to innocent love, yet through sound and the handling of the camera we are not allowed to relax in the children's fantasy.  It suggests a traditional youth-in-love sequence, but a constant unsteadiness of camera and a cacophony of discomforting sounds mocks the viewer.  We are not allowed to find solace in their relationship, because the viewer possesses a sober omniscience of what is likely to come thus separating us from their delusion. Klimov uses unsteadiness of camera and erratic panning to keep the viewer dreading the coming events.  Even when the subject is not moving through the scene there is a subtle chaotic motion of the camera, contributing to the feeling that the very air that the characters inhabit is thick and unbearable, that to move through nature is to traverse a battlefield."

","The tag line of another great war drama Casualties of war seemed to me as the most appropriate line to describe Elem Klimov's poetic war drama COME AND SEE(Idi i Smotri).Unlike many traditional war films,'Come and See'-has no heroic catharsis or narrative symmetry .Instead Klimov's apocalyptic vision ,which mixes poetic and brutal imagery,focuses on the destruction of a young life and the horrors of war.I am glad that this movie finally made into the top 250 list but i personally wish that a movie of such a calibre should easily make to top 5 ,if not the best. Most war movies deal with the heroic deeds of a single or a group of soldiers ,but what attracted me most about Come and See is the fact that the two main characters of the movie are SOUND and VISION.I never believed before watching this movie that a wonder can be created without the help of any war hero.It remains the best war movie i have watched till date taking into consideration the likes of Appocalypse Now ,Saving Private Ryan,Glory,Platoon,Patton ."

","I habitually use the IMDb to find treasures I might not have seen in my day-to-day movie watching, but am rarely as pleased as I was when I found this film.<br/><br/>Come and See is the story of a young man who joins the Byelorussian partisans in their resistance to the invading fascist hordes during World War II. The title comes from the Book of Revelations, according to the director in an introductory interviewed contained in the two-disc DVD I saw.<br/><br/>The film is based on a group of incidents observed by A. Adamovich during his youth. Director Klimov also grew up during the Patriotic War, but in the Stalingrad area.<br/><br/>Filmed exclusively in Byelorussia, the movie has a wonderful feeling of versimilitude, due to the real locations, the naturalistic acting, the wonderful costumes (many of which are authentic WWII issue uniforms, apparently), and the overall somber tone. Special effects are minimal, most are ""in camera."" Most effective of all may be the scene in which the boy hero and his mentor steal a cow and are then shot at by the Germans -- who are never seen until the final forty minutes or so of the film.<br/><br/>Highly recommended, especially if your notion of the War on the Eastern Front is derived from ""Hogan's Heroes"" reruns -- with the comedic threats of getting Sergeant Schultz sent to the Eastern Front as punishment. Even _Stalingrad_ was not as gritty and real as this film."

This movie loves the land that's being destroyed around it, the trees and the birds and the sounds, and with long smooth tracking shots it seems to suck in the idea of beauty everywhere it goes... even if the camera is focusing on the charred remains of a still-living but barely comprehensible human being who was torched by the Nazi army.<br/><br/>It's also a very subjective based film, dealing almost entirely through the eyes of the young boy who is perfectly acted by a kid much younger than me! In order to increase the pov feel of this film, much time is spent having the characters or faces looking directly into the camera and talking to the audience, something that is effective in a lot of situations anyway but in this film basically traps the audience Clockwork Orange style into sitting and watching every minute of it.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","I stumbled upon this film when it was screened one evening a few months back on the CUNY TV channel. Ever since then, I cannot get some of the images out of my head. For me, this is one sign of great film making. In particular, there is a scene in which the protagonist and another partisan steal a cow late at night from a farmer who is (apparently) collaborating with the Germans. The farmer discovers the theft before they have had time to get very far and summons the Germans. The Germans can barely make out the silhouette of the cow in the distance across the vast Belorussian fields (close to a mile away or more!) and begin firing. The pair takes cover behind the cow as numerous tracers fly horrifyingly close overhead. Eventually the tracers depress closer and closer to the ground and the cow is hit by a number of them and goes down. The camera hovers over the cow's eye as the life runs out of it. I am convinced that real ammunition was used and a live cow was actually shot on camera. I cannot adequately convey the surreal horror depicted in this scene. Nor can I quite put my finger on why the scene struck me so powerfully. It has remained with me ever since. There are numerous other moments like that throughout this masterwork, which linger in the memory. I cannot recommend this film highly enough, although it is not for the faint-of-heart. If you have the chance to see it on the big screen especially, DO NOT pass it up! Be forewarned though--you will be utterly shaken to the core. This film may be unrivaled in its depiction of the absolute horror and futility of war."

Surely Steven Spielberg must have studied this one before making Schindler's List for it's portrayal of the systematic, town by town liquidation, of jews, gypsies, woman, children... in bellarusse during WWII, and it is absolutely devastating.  Spielberg's film feels like hollywood hokum by comparison, and i really liked Schindler's List, or rather, i thought it was a great and powerful movie.  but there are so many unforgettable images in this movie, images that will forever haunt me, from the opening scene where young boys pry rifles from dead soldier's cold fingers, to the roving eyeball of a dying cow.

"gbill-74877","9","3","4","5 February 2020"," Masterpiece
","There's a moment in 'Come and See' when director Elem Klimov directly references Tarkovsky's classic 'Ivan's Childhood' - it's when the boy peers down into a well and sees his reflection in the water - and there are probably all sorts of other parallels as well, such as that beautiful scene when he's in the forest shaking the tall trees with the girl to make the water splash down. It really made me want to see the films back to back and compare them in their imagery, camera technique, and what they tell us about the Russian experience during the war. This film is certainly darker (much darker, my god), and a part of me thinks that Klimov was building on the great Tarkovsky's work and saying that this was Ivan's real childhood, a nightmare of apocalyptic proportions.<br/><br/>I don't think anyone who watches the film can ever forget the horrifying images of the German army running amok over a Byelorussia village and burning its people alive. That it's accurate - and just one of 628 such atrocities - is truly mind-numbing. But Klimov also gives us indelible visuals earlier in the film, such as the when the boy and girl run down the muddy road in search of his family, and she looks back to see a pile of corpses against the house, or later when they wade through the muck of a bog that comes up to their chests and looks like it might drag them down to their deaths. The scene in the fog on the farm as they scavenge for food and steal a cow is memorable too. The German army is distant for much of the film, bombing from above in the forest scene (for which the audio effects are extraordinary), shooting from afar, and driving troop trucks by in the mist. They're distant, that is, until they're not, and then it's overwhelming.<br/><br/>The Soviet Union made some tremendous films about the war ('The Ascent', a film from Klimov's wife, the great Larisa Shepitko, also comes to mind), and this is certainly one of the very best; it has to be on a short list for greatest war movies of all time. There is a patriotic feeling to the film in the stern look the partisan leader gives the Germans and a pride in the perseverance of the Russian people, but mostly this is a sorrowful film about the horror of war coupled with a desire to never let what happened be forgotten. It certainly succeeds in that, because that's what this film is - unforgettable.<br/><br/>Quote, from Revelation 6:7-8:
""And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth beast say, Come and see. And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the beasts of the earth."""

","Elem Klimov's final film is a devastating look at the horrors of war through the eyes of a teenage boy who joins the partisans in Belarus (then the Byelorussian SSR or White Russian SSR). Much like Mike Nichols's ""Catch-22"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Idi i smotri"" (""Come and See"" in English) makes you feel as if the war is hitting you directly. And this movie leaves little to the imagination in showing the Nazis' brutality. Probably the most famous scene is when the Nazis burn down a house. There's music playing the entire time to ensure that the noise doesn't stop. You have rarely seen something as intense as this on screen.<br/><br/>Klimov's wife Larisa Shepitko directed the equally intense movie ""The Ascent"", about some Soviet troops who try to defend a house from the Nazis (Shepitko got killed in a car wreck a few years later). The important thing to remember is that the Soviet Union lost almost 27 million people fighting the Nazis, more than any other country (it probably would've been more if the winter hadn't held the Nazis back). There's a reason why Russians still refer to the Great Patriotic War, as opposed to simply World War II. And this is one of the many movies that emphasize it. Definitely watch it."

The next day, partisans arrive at Flyora's house and conscript him. Flyora becomes a low-rank militiaman and is ordered to perform menial tasks. When the partisans are ready to move on, their commander, Kosach, orders Flyora to remain behind at the camp. Bitterly disappointed, Flyora walks into the forest weeping and meets Glafira (or Glasha), a beautiful girl infatuated with Kosach. Glasha becomes delusional and, thinking he is Kosach, kisses Flyora. Suddenly, the camp is attacked by German parachutists, and Flyora goes deaf from the heavy artillery fire.<br/><br/>After hiding in the forest, Flyora and Glasha return to his house to find it deserted and covered in flies. Denying that his family is dead, Flyora believes that they are hiding on a nearby island across a bog. As they run from the village, Glasha sees a pile of bodies stacked behind the house, but doesn't tell him of it. Unable to accept the truth, Flyora becomes hysterical as he and Glasha wade through the bog. At the island, they meet a resistance fighter, Roubej, who takes the pair to a large group of villagers who have fled the Germans. Flyora sees Yustin, an elderly villager who had been doused in petrol and burnt by the Germans, and accepts that his family is dead and blames himself for the tragedy."

It's a harrowing portrayal of war, and every single frame of this film is haunting to the point of it potentially damaging the viewer.<br/><br/>But it's not the on screen atrocities that affect the viewer, it's also a terrifying aural experience too. Dogs barking, strange Polka music, laughter whilst killing, and a strange buzzing sound depicting deafness assaults the senses as much as the visuals.<br/><br/>The final third is almost unbearable to watch, but what I found really disturbing was the use of the actors looking into the camera, right at you, as almost to say, 'are you seeing this?'. When Floyra first meets Glasha properly, they are both crying, but then the crying turns to laughter, almost maniacal laughter, and it reminded me of a piece I saw at the Tate Modern, two faces saying the same words, but in ever going states of emotion.<br/><br/>It's not an easy film to watch, and some may even call it propaganda, but unlike some exploitation films that are unbearable on the verge of offensive, this is an important piece of cinema, it really puts you in the middle of a losing battle, knowing that major atrocities are happening all around you, but all you can do is watch.<br/><br/>It's a beautiful piece of cinema, everyone should seek it out, but I have no intention of seeing it again.<br/><br/>Heartbreaking."

Florya gets a rude awakening when he experiences what war is really about and to see all the death at a very young age. Even though some scenes in the film are graphic, the director did a great job in making the death seem so real that as if you could actually smell the blood. The film was raw and making scenes so traumatic that they become embedded in your mind. Also the use of long continuous time takes allowed some scenes to be even more intense, for example when Florya and Glasha are in the mud pool and to see their struggle, their expressions made it even more real that it made you want help to pull them out. This film definitely makes the point across that it's not about the plot, but of the horrors of war. But to also see how young Florya aged through the film was amazing. To see his innocence in the beginning of the film and by the end it has diminished. War has literally stolen the life out of him. This film is brutal, raw but definitely amazing. Highly recommend"

","""Come and See"" is unbelievably powerful. No film has ever explored the horrors of war so relentlessly and realistically as this film, and I don't know if I'll ever watch it again, yet I think everyone should watch it once.<br/><br/>When a young boy finds an old rifle, he decides to join the war against Nazi Germany. He is as naive as any boy at his age, and much to his mother's dismay, he joins, not really knowing what to expect.<br/><br/>He is left behind by the army, because they know how young and foolish he is. He is left with a girl, who he comes to care about. They experience a terrifying and incredibly realistic looking (and sounding) bombing, seemingly out of no where, with only a glimpse of a plane beforehand to warn them. The boy remains hopeful that he can save her and find his family, and the boy and girl both begin to laugh and dance to distract themselves from the horror that they are in the midst of. Then they get back to the boys home.<br/><br/>The town seems abandoned. The boy goes into his house to find his sisters' dolls splayed out on the floor with bugs buzzing around them. He finds food in the oven and remains hopeful that they are just off somewhere else. The girl sees the dolls and is disturbed. The boy is terrified but comes back and continues to convince himself his family is just off somewhere.<br/><br/>Then we see them dead. All of them. Leaning against the back of the house. Only the girl does however, so the boy keeps running. He gets to a thick bog. He slowly treks along the bog. He struggles and struggles and struggles with the girl holding onto the back of him for what seemed like minutes, probably do to the long slow single shot it was filmed in. Then they arrive at the other end, and the boy must finally face the fact his parents are dead.<br/><br/>He blames himself for all of this, and as devastating as this is for him, he still clings desperately to his rifle. He is therefore brought along on a trip to get food and milk. He begins to laugh again. Harder than ever, trying to shield himself from the horrors of his situation. In another reminder of his reality, 2 of the three men he is with are killed by bombs (once again, with the menacing plane warning only seconds before). They continue however, and after stealing the cow successfully (in a long, long POV shot), the boy and the last remaining member have their last moment of joy together, drinking the milk from the cow, laughing, and forgetting about everything but that moment. Then more bombs hit, and more gunfire starts. From this point on, there is no laughing, and no joy left in the movie. Even after he finds out he is alone, he still clings to the cow as his last hope. Then the cow dies.<br/><br/>The boy finds a horse and a man, but is eventually captured by Nazis. This whole, next 45 minutes is comprised of almost exclusively long shots, unflinching lyrics staring at the absolute horror of the moment. Words cannot describe it. The boy survives, barely, but the final shot of the scene is worse than death with the boy face down in the dirt, empty, and practically dead inside, or wishing he was.<br/><br/>The boy is picked up by the resistance, and we get a disturbing shot of a woman with a white face, bloody lips, and bloody legs, showing the absolute destruction of any thing that was once peaceful or beautiful. The men almost burn the Nazis, but instead men jump in and shoot them last second, showing that they are better than them, even in their most vengeful moments. But this truly means nothing, as we see next. The boy finds a portrait of Adolph Hitler in a wet ditch. He shoots it over and over, as videos of what he has done are reversed, showing how badly he wants to take back what Hitler's done. Then there is a picture of a mother and child. He stops. He realizes no matter what they do at this point, they can never take back what Hitler has done, and that is the depressing and horrifying fact of the Holocaust. The boy may be alive, but, like his gun, he is broken, and always will be, and you can see it in his now deranged face."

While I can see that choice underscoring the innocence that war crushes...or the notion of serving one's motherland, at times my connection to Aleksei Kravchenko as Florya faltered. His trembling, frazzled face...and the camera lingering on it...odd moments of petulance...but then maybe I'm not *supposed* to relate to him, as who really can?

At one point, there's a shot where he's scouring a large pot, and it's as if he is being cooked alive.<br/><br/>Still I felt an older actor might have delivered a more nuanced performance, hell Kravchenko was less than 16 years old when he made this. I see he is still making films to this day, so maybe I need to see his body of work.

I know of course she was meant to be real, but something about her felt like an externalized innocence that was trying to keep Florya afloat, and alive. A sweet self-defense mechanism?<br/><br/>The film though is filled with tragical magical realism. The Hitler hominid that the Russians hump about. Glasha's singing and dancing in the rain, the bog crawl.<br/><br/>Ultimately I walked away reminded that war, any war, is such a failure of us as humans.

","This is probably the most harrowing war movie ever made...I can't think of any other war film that hits you over the head and stomps on your guts as much.  It is a very Russian movie, I can't think of another part of the world where a movie like this would be made in that style.<br/><br/>For me, some scenes stand out because I have never seen anything like them. The boy in the woods concussed from the explosions as the German paratroopers arrive.  The soundtrack goes to a high pitched ringing.  The two children running through a deserted village, they stop at a house to eat a cake left in the kitchen.  All around are flies, but where do they come from?  They run out of the house and out of the village; in the background, you see why there are so many flies; the bodies of the villagers are just piled high against a building, but the children don't notice them.  The Germans herding the villagers into a barn and burning it.  Later, the Nazis are herded themselves by Russians and douse themselves with petrol as they go mad.  The effigy of Hitler made out of mud and grass.<br/><br/>
Apparently, this movie was originally planned to have been directed by Klimov's wife; the brilliant Larissa Shepitko (who directed ""The Ascent"") who died in a car crash before the project got going.  ""The Ascent"" deals with a lot of similar themes and shares the same premise of partisans struggling to survive under Nazi invasion, but goes into the human side a lot more."

","In recently becoming interested in films and mini-series centered on fictitious or historical characters in World War II, I ran across this title on several top 50 or 100 war films lists. I was rather keen to see it, especially given the reviews which called it ""chilling"" or lauded it as one of the top war films of all time. Forgive me for being a killjoy here, but after viewing this film, I was simply left with a feeling of ""Really?"". The character of the boy doesn't seem developed enough and the imagery presented in some so-called ""intense"" scenes did not truly attract my attention nor made me empathize with the character. Some scenes also appeared to drag on too long without any meaning or added effect. In short, I would probably put this on my ""Top 50 War Films to Pass On"" list. I should have simply watched another coming-of-age war film that is an outstanding film: ""Europa Europa."""

","""Come and See"" is unique in style, particularly the use of sound, as in the first half of the film when the boy is shell-shocked and deafened and hears a surreal mixture of the natural world and his own thoughts and memories. It was haunting to say the least, especially as it is counterpointed by an idyllic interlude with the girl in the forest before the Nazis arrive in earnest.  <br/><br/>What is not unique about the film is its ""How bad were the Nazis?"" portrayal of the casual evil of atrocity and murder.  It is shocking even as it is trite, the horrendous violence that was perpetrated with an almost incomprehensible and unanimous joy.  The whole world seems unable to get enough of the recreation of this time of plague of human evil, even after 60 years, and some things should never be forgotten, the sacrifice and nobility of the martyrs and resisters especially.  ""Come and See"" has plenty of that spirit, of the outnumbered rag-tag Russian fighters, and its nationalist pride is understandable.  <br/><br/>But it is the nihilistic, crushing aspect of war, no matter who the combatants, that make this and all films about war so meaningful, regardless of the historical setting."

","I have never been in a war zone, and am poorly informed about the horrors experienced by the Soviet people at the hands of the Nazis. Doubtless I have much to learn, but could not learn it from this film.<br/><br/>This movie, which is like a parody of a late Goya painting set in the forests and villages of Russia, was very hard to watch. The difficulty is not so much the brutality of the events depicted as the relentless overacting and completely unnatural performances of the actors. Everyone behaves as if they were psychotic in almost every scene, and the camera is often positioned right in front of their faces. Their expressions are, like their mannerisms, so over the top as to make the film difficult to take seriously. As if this weren't enough, the music -- interspersed with snippets of military songs or anthems -- continually makes the emphatic statement IN ALL CAPS that we are watching crazy people enduring unbearable conditions.<br/><br/>To my way of thinking, this film is trying much too hard to make its point. I felt that it could have said much more, with much less. Even the film's length, at nearly 2 1/2 hours long, goes overboard; it could have benefited from some serious editing. Bludgeoning its audience, it mistakes brute force for tragedy, falling well short of its own ambitions."

","Soviet cinema is unique for creating some of the most true to life World War II films in the world. Considering the Soviet form of government, this is surprising. Come and See, however, opines to avoid the bombastic battle scenes of most war movies and instead chooses a more ethereal reflection to depict the Second World War as none of us have ever seen before.<br/><br/>The film follows Florya, an adolescent and naive partisan trying to do his part in the fight against the German onslaught. But, seen as too young to offer substantial aid, the grizzled veterans decide to leave him to watch the camp. What occurs over the next 146 minutes is not unlike what occurs in Homer's fable. He roams the countryside, meets those of his age and older and tries to endure in this hellish inferno. By the end, Florya is not the same boy he and the audience sees at the beginning. The message is direct; there are seldom any heroes in war, just death and survival.<br/><br/>Almost immediately, one will notice the uncommon cinematography utilized throughout the movie. Steadicam shots are in ample supply here and are normally not this well done. A verbal plot is nearly non-existent, the images alone carry most of the film's weight. And while Florya, acted by Aleksei Kravchenko, was in his mid-teens at the time, his realism and emotion are beyond his years.<br/><br/>One of the best, if not the best, war movies I've ever seen."

","Set in Nazi occupied Belorussia during WW2 ""Come and See"" tells the story of one boy who joins the Soviet partisans, of his mother's despairing appeals for him not to, of his whole family's death in the Nazi reprisals on his village and his struggle with hate, guilt and the extremities of mental stress in its wake. In an amazing, almost surreal, piece of cinema technique the effect of being deafened and shocked by an artillery barrage is portrayed in the soundtrack, muffled and indistinct noises emerging from moving mouths. Apart from this personal story this piece of late Soviet film-making attempts to capture a ""typical"" atrocity of those times in the fate of another village, and largely succeeds. It ranges from the black comedy which the Soviets found in the behavior of their oppressors, a German motorcycle rides through the village with a corpse with a sign on it warning of the fate of partisans; but no-one sees it because it's raining and everyone's indoors; through exacting military historical detail - a Focke Wulf ""Owl"" reconnaissance plane slowly tracking through the sky is the recurrent motif signifying German presence - down to collaboration and partisan atrocities in turn.

The film is very interesting in the way it was made, it is so unconventional that it is hard to relate to it.  It actually gave me the feeling that I was a witness to an event that was absolutely intolerable and despicable.  Watching this film was like being there yet your mind cannot take the pain and torture so it becomes a dreamy nightmare that one cannot escape from until wakened by the live reversing footage of Hitler's Europe imploding at the end of the film.

","Overall, I enjoyed (if that is the word) ""Idi i smotri."" The imagery is powerful, the scenery is magnificent, the military hardware is an anorak's dream, the overall plot is gripping and the climactic points in the action are nothing short of terrifying. In depicting the gruesomeness of war, this film pulls no punches whatsoever, and from that it derives a lot of its power. Even if you've seen ""Schindler's List,"" ""Saving Private Ryan,"" etc., this film will still shock you. The characters' motivations and thought processes are often somewhat incomprehensible, but given the situations in which they find themselves, this is understandable. However, the film is significantly longer than it needs to be, mostly because a great many scenes drag on well past the point of annoyance. Watching this film on DVD, I was mercifully able to fast forward through segments where nothing would happen for minutes at a time. Another point that niggles is the behavior of the Germans. Their almost casual brutality, even towards the Byelorussian police and militia collaborating with them, is perfectly credible. But there is a point in the film prior to which the Germans' behavior is cold and methodical (""grÃ¼ndlich""). Then, from one moment to the next (at the start of chapter 11 on the DVD), all discipline goes out the window and they start behaving as if they're at Club Med instead of in territory crawling with hostile partisans. This is rather jarring, and detracts somewhat from the film's credibility. All told, though, I thoroughly recommend this film, albeit it primarily to war movie buffs."

Not even though you've suffered so much by the monstrosities it has produced as a grown up man. In some way it's defeatist. It says that the victims will remain victimized and the perpetrators will keep perpetrating. But how can we preserve our humanism if in the name of stopping a monster we become the monster itself? Otherwise, there is horror. Some of it might appear over the top at certain moments. It's the style present in many Russian movies about the Second Word War.

The story of Florya Gaishun is told in a way I've never seen before. it cannot be compared equally to any movie I've ever seen (and being a devote student of film that's plenty). This is not what war is like through this boy's eyes it is what war is like through his mind. As he goes through his journey we come face to face not always with the images that the characters see but with every time with the emotion that the characters go through. This leaves the senses numb from trauma and the soul shaken but encouragingly resolved.<br/><br/>It begins with Flor in Belorussia Russia in WWII digging up a rifle from a shallow grave of a soldier to join the Partisans. He plunges into the ranks and at his arrival at base he drifts through camp greeting comrades with a smile that has never meet the grisly face of battle. As the Commander orders the troops out the boy's almost unconscious beam remains. But he does not get to march off into battle with the other men as he expected. He is ordered to trade his new boots with an older soldier and to stay behind to man the camp. Only during his patrol around the camp when drudging through a bog does his smile fade into a sobbing lips wet with homesick tears. He is crying but he is not broken. Not yet. He encounters the girlfriend of the Commander crying nearby and directs his longing into bringing a smile to her face. They enjoy a strange and intimate moment that ends at the sight of German paratroopers gliding from the sky. As they rush to the safety of the base the forest around them erupts into a deafening array of explosions that level their camp. It leaves the boy nearly deaf and dull to his surroundings. The girl frantically tries to guide them to out of harm shortly Flor regains his perception and he tries to make it back to his home village. His flawless image of war has been shattered. This is only the beginning.<br/><br/>During Flor's odyssey he ages from a naÃ¯ve romantic boy to a worn haggard and steeled man. Through what seems to be a life shattering experience after another his glorified idea of a war of brave heroes and the evil enemy is killed and then reborn, not as the polished luminous ideal it once was, but as a rough grim but necessary undertaking.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so harrowing yet wonderful is that it does not simply deplore the horrors of war. The terrors that crush Flor's senses and his world cast him into a soldier firm in his commitment to smashing the furiously racist imperialist system that is capitalism in crisis: Fascism. Though his newfound political convictions came from blunt experience and were born from the ashes of worn down emotions and not political struggle it does not weaken the message that the fight against fascism must be a mass armed struggle. It is for this reason that the movie is so remarkable and important. >"

However, it is not remotely as good as people seem to think it is. I found it terribly mediocre and extremely boring. The characters lacked real emotion and the sadness seemed really forced, each character behaved in a very strange manner and nobody looked like real people. Instead they moved around like corpses without emotion.<br/><br/>Also, the cinematography looks very amateurish, as if I had shoot this film at my backyard. The soundtrack is boring, without any decent music at all.<br/><br/>And I liked some Russian movies, like those by Tarkovsky, which are monumental pieces of art.<br/><br/>Besides being a failure as a film it is also a piece of Soviet propaganda. Indeed, it shows WW2 as ""the nice Soviets versus the evil Germans"", however, that is ludicrous. They depict the German soldiers as Nazi devils without any hint of humanity and driven by the sole purpose of exterminating the Soviet population. However, the truth is that German soldiers were people just like the Soviet civilians and while there were a few psychopaths in the SS, the vast majority were normal people.<br/><br/>Indeed, this is not a realistic film in any way, shape or form. Saving Private Ryan is also very unrealistic, but in another way. Both films fail to attain realism and depict the war in a satisfactory way. Both firms have an anti-German bias and a nationalistic bias. The general problem with WW2 films is that any film made in a country that won the war tends to have nationalistic biases and so they tend to be really offensive and become implicit propaganda. This movie is not implicit propaganda, it is explicit propaganda of the Soviet regime, which had Joseph Stalin at its helm at the time, a murderous regime equal to Nazi Germany in their lack of humanity.<br/><br/>The good WW2 films are always German or Japanese. Since losing the war make them more humble and they don't tend to depict their enemies as inhuman monsters.<br/><br/>Its propaganda, devoid of any artistic merit.

","If there were ever a film that could be called the ultimate anti-war film which shows the horrors of war and the dehumanization of its main characters in such a disturbing way that it will leave an absolutely depressing impact on you it is definitely Elem Klimov's Come and See. <br/><br/>Most of the time we see this film from Florya's point of view ( A teenage boy ) to show us truly how the war impacts those that were full of innocence before it started. The first half hour or more of the film consists of setting up his character, his connection with his family and with the young woman Glasha later on. It is a bit of the odd man out in the film as while still being depicted as grim it is not a very disturbing or depressing start. However, when the first bombs fall, you are immediately into this highly powerful and immersive masterpiece, because of things such as letting us hear the temporary deafening situation of our main character by letting us hear it with the audio, and deafening out all other sounds so we truly also begin to feel it as if it were happening to the audience. Also noticeable is the frequent use of extended trackingshots shot with a steadicam which are ofcourse always a great addition to improve immersion because in a long continuous take we can see everything our characters are doing, and are not subjected to constant different angles which always take a couple of seconds ( or less, but still, it takes time ) to keep that immersion.<br/><br/>The acting is of top notch quality the entire movie, and especially the teenage main character Florya played by Aleksey Kravchenko is exceptional with his desperate facial expressions and his increasing dehumanization throughout the film. The violence is so powerful in this film because anything bad could happen to our main character at any time and primarily because Klimov allows us to see the incredibly disturbing facial expressions of Florya in silence after such an event numerous times, so we can truly reflect on how terrible these events were, and to show how further down the path to madness he was getting. The soundtrack is haunting and eerie ever since the first bombs fall in the film, and all this makes gives it a kind of horror esque feeling which doesn't happen all that often in war films. Platoon is often called a great anti-war statement, but Platoon has lighthearted scenes with some witty dialogue, whereas when the violence starts in Come and See, it is basically one ride akin to peering into the depths of hell itself.<br/><br/>I would say the later chapter of the film is a bit too focused on trying too hard to let us hate the Germans while creating a bit of a lack of characterization, yet the entire village burning scene is so emotionally draining to the extreme, edited so well and filmed with such grace that this doesn't truly matter to the overall quality of the film. The visuals also speak for themselves, with one hellish picture after another when the violence starts bursting out, and this is enhanced by the incredible use of sound and sound editing to create a narrative in itself. However, this doesn't mean that the film doesn't have a narrative, as this is established so well in the first half hour or forty five minutes of the film.<br/><br/>This all sums up Come and See as one of the most powerful of all war films, due to its ability to show violence as such an inhumane action due to its incredible visuals, sound, facial expressions & acting. It is highly disturbing and it is not for the faint hearted, as its depressing nature and soundtrack and realistic portrayal of the brutality of war result in a terrifying experience, yet it is also one of the few war films that is able to truly move you with its honesty and brutality."

Scenes of tenderness and sadism are well blended.<br/><br/>There is no caricatures, not for the soviets, not for the Nazis. There is no ""we are the best army in the world"" message (as many American films do), but a delicate patriotic message.<br/><br/>If you want to spend two hours watching something unusual but yet very touching, please watch this piece.

","Unfortunately for myself, I was not effected by this movie like most people were. When I saw this movie the audience thought it was the most intense movie they had ever seen, but for me it had no effect; I feel that it's because I have seen this story and cinematics done time and time again. Perhaps if I would have seen this movie before I saw the other countless war movies I would have had a different reaction. <br/><br/>Regardless, I can appreciate this film; Klimov has a great message about Russian spirit during the war in this movie, he showed the bravery of the people from these small towns, and how they were able to fight off the Nazi's despite their inferior weapons and training. <br/><br/>Anyone who likes war movies with a great story and message should watch this movie."
"StephenBradleyJones","10","2","3","27 July 2011"," Why I like Come and See
","The movie Come and See by Elen Klemov is quite an experience to watch. It takes place in Belorussia during World War II. The film was made to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the end of WWII. Klemov made the project in the midst of reforms from hard line communism in 1985. The title itself is a reference to the book of Revelation in the Bible which is fitting since this film is about fighting your own demons and the end of the world in wartime.<br/><br/>The main protagonist is Florya (played by A. Kravchenko), a boy about 15 years old. Florya is about as naive as they come and he is easy to root for. He's the quintessential symbol of innocence, and has bought into a glamorized view of war. Florya is conscripted into the Partisan movement resisting the Nazi advance. Florya makes many friends along the way, which he loses in the course of battle. The moral ambiguities that he is faced with really display the wearing down effect that constant battle will have on the human soul. He goes through hell, with brief light moments with the closest thing he has to a love interest in the character Glasha (played by O. Mironova). It is important to note that nowhere in this film is the Red Army ever shown. This is probably due to the fact that Stalin had placed higher priorities on fighting for other regions of the Soviet Union. More Russians were actually killed under the Stalinist regime than by the Nazis. This movie doesn't celebrate the Red Army, rather it highlights the fact that the Partisans, a ragtag paramilitary group at best, were able to help defeat the most dominant military power in the world. Feeling Florya's exhaustion from his character journey between boy to old man in small span of time, I was right there with him. By the end of the film, he's mentally an old man, but in actuality he is still in his teens. There is a terrible scene in which the Nazis assemble a group of citizens and humiliate them before jamming them into a barn, which they set on fire. Klemov cleverly anticipates that the viewers will instinctively say to them selves 'it's only a movie'. Right about that time, he pans the camera left to the barn door which is being heaved outward against the bar as they scream in agony. The Nazis blared classical music while forcing citizens to proclaim their allegiance to Hitler. It was essentially a party for them; all the while terrified citizens cooperated with this in hopes that they would be left alive. Florya escapes the barn and is further tormented, though randomly allowed to live. He later catches up with the enemy units, who have been ambushed by the Partisans. They have been assembled underneath a bridge and the emotionally detached Partisans listen to the varying responses from the soldiers. Some of whom waver in their furor, claiming they hold no ill will towards the Partisans while some are hard line zealots to the end, with downright frightening resolve even in the face of certain death. As in life, people have differing degrees of conviction, even warped convictions like the Nazis in the movie hold.<br/><br/>One character in particular spits out venom to the end, stating that the Russians were simply vermin to be exterminated. The General of the Partisans tells everyone to listen very carefully to what he just stated. This is where it is clear that the Nazis have no reason to fight, while the Partisans have every reason to fight them off. The General gives the order to simply shoot them and move on as opposed to lowering to the level of cruelty that they just witnessed. Florya has a cathartic moment shooting a picture of Hitler, and with each successive shot, he sends him farther back in time. The images of Hitler stroking children's cheeks and the gradual rise of the Nazi party flash onto the screen, everything seems to be in reverse order. This happens all the way to a picture of Hitler as a child on his Mother's lap, a chilling image when you reflect that child's future. His mother probably held high hopes for him that he would turn out happy and productive. At this moment, Florya can't seem to bring himself to 'kill' the child and walks away to join the Partisans; now with a real reason to fight.<br/><br/>This film is a masterfully done cinematic piece, as the shots that Klemov chooses are quite effective. The characters are constantly in a trancelike state, looking through the camera, as opposed to breaking the fourth wall (and our suspension of disbelief) and looking into the camera.This movie is very draining, and serves as a cautionary tale against war period. I feel it was also specifically a cautionary tale against the genocidal possibilities of nuclear war. There are some disturbing scenes of POWs that were so emaciated I could not watch them. We also learn that villages were burned in this awful manner hundreds of times during the war. The constant musical score of Mozart stands out in contrast to the absolute horror that Florya and his companions are exposed to."
"samuraisahsah","7","2","3","9 February 2011"," less violence is more film
","Come and See was unlike any other ""war movie"" I've ever seen. There was no gratuitous and glory-filled banquets of violence dripping down the screen, in fact, considering this is a WWII film it's shocking that Klimov could create this film with such a minimalist approach and yet still have it be so powerful and shocking. Instead of just making your average war film stuffed with violence they fill this film with emotion, which one can clearly see in the lines etched into our protagonist's face by the end of the film. When a violent act is happening, like in the case of the barn being burned with the town's children inside, we don't even see what's happening. All we get is the view from the outside, which when taking into account the joyous time the Germans are having, has the atmosphere of a light hearted social occasion, a birthday perhaps. What makes the scene horribly all-too memorable is the shrieks and cries erupting from within, along with the urgent shaking and banging on the door one could only imagine would be the product of children being burned alive. Even when stacked up against the most gruesome of cinema's war scenes, for instance when the American troops rush the beaches of Normandy in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and blood is running in rivers down the beach, ""Come and See"" manages to leave a more deeply penetrating effect, really driving the message of humanity's potential for incomprehensible atrocity towards the darkest depths of our psyche. I couldn't forget those cries and small clenched fists banging on the wooden doors if i tried precisely because Klimov left what was going on behind those doors to the viewers imagination, something two dimensional images projected on a screen can never compete with."

","This movie is frightening in a way that audiences don't get to see much of anymore. A boy thrust into smaller WWII battles after literally being a child the day before. This movie, as stated in a film class I recently took, should be seen by any and all people considering joining the military. The boy, joins the movement against Hitler and is thrown on a few day journey in which he ages grossly. The scenes are frightening as is the landscape which is at times scarier than the battle scenes which is partly what makes this film so unique. It is the sound effects as well as the locations and the scenery. The movie shows great and brilliant taste at times as well, like at the end where the boy shoots a pictures of Hitler repeatedly instead of partaking fully in killing captured Nazis."

","This film was truly unlike any film I have ever seen. This Great European ""Auteur"" was a heart- wrenching coming of age story of a boy Florya; from leaving his mother to joining the partisan soldiers to falling in love. Florya starts off as a boy playing in the sand looking for guns yet as the movie progresses he has to use the gun for more then just play. The aging of Florya can be seen on the boys face through out the movie and is made even more apparent with close up shots of Florya staring straight into the camera. The camera movements can be disconcerting but it only adds to the emotions running rampant within Florya. He seems to almost go crazy at points. This movie left me in a quite shock. Its images where haunting and powerful."

","One of the things that amuse me was that how this movie is connected to the real history. I really felt how people back then were feeling about war. At the first, the main character, kid, was really exciting to into the army. However, it gets worse and worse, the war makes him deaf, and he lost his family. At the end of the movie, he made a lot of shoot to Hitler's picture. I really thought that because Hitler was Russia's enemy, that is because he does not want war anymore. I think he was not shooting Hitler, but he was shooting was selves. I have seen a lot of war movie, but this movie is one of the most impact war movies ever to me."
"sungmini89","7","2","3","14 December 2007"," general thought of this movie,,,
","This film, personally for me, while watching, got me frustrated in general. Frankly because I had no control over what was happening while the movie was going on, especially, when the German Nazi soldiers were almost harassing the Russian civilians. This film in general made me really despise the Nazis more than any other films that I've seen that has to do with the Nazis. The movie had very realistic camera angle, as well as the story line. It generally gave me an idea of how much people went through during the times of World War II. My favorite part of the movie was the very last scene, where the Russian soldiers were marching on to fight against the Nazis; it generally gave the audience hope as to what's going to happen; also, when the main character steps into the crowd of the other soldiers, it reminded of the ending from the ""Bicycle Thief"" because it felt like he just moved in and disappeared into the crowd. The little hope at the very end of the movie, really, watching the horror for about 2 hours, gave me a real hope at the end."
"k_imdb-296","9","2","3","13 December 2006"," One stunning tribute..
","What a stunning film.. Brutal, ever so realistic, a long painful glance through the eyes of the casualties and victims of the Third Reich's evil, ultimately naive inhumane campaign of annihilation in the East. To witness a boy age visibly and lose his innocence and mind faced with such madness, hysteria and desperation was disturbing and touching and forged an empathy with the protagonist from start to end. A tribute to the true warriors and brave partisans who opposed the onslaught of the delusional evil nation, once you savour this highly underrated masterpiece, you won't want to ever waste your time again with all the omnipresent, mainstream ""glammed up"" surreal cinematic fodder. This is right up there, nestled amongst my top 10 films of all time..superb."
"jd_joslin","Null","2","3","27 February 2006"," Beylorussian WWII Hell Brilliantly Communicated
","This excellent film has a haunting and surreal quality that is difficult to describe. The setting is 1943 in Belorussia behind the Russian-German lines. The Germans are carrying out their policy of annihilating the Slavic races. The Nazis seem to have their evil eyes everywhere symbolized by a forked-tailed reconnaissance plane that flies periodically over the landscape.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses death appears inescapable as the protagonist, a young Beylorussian boy who joins the partisans, returns home after being left behind on a partisan raid. He and Glasha, a young woman he's with, discover that his village's population has been slaughtered. His twin younger sisters who were introduced earlier are especially cute and delightful kids. Their deaths and that of his mother, who had berated him for taking a risk in joining the Partisans, is made to look Kafkan in its incomprehensible and inescapable evil.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is the sickening scene of the Nazis SD troops torching a farm house after forcing all of another village's inhabitants inside. The scene ends with yodeling music as the troops continue a pillaging rampage with flamethrowers. One shot which sears ones mind is a close up of one Nazis infantryman rapidly shaking his head back and forth jiggling his cheeks as if he has just taken a shot of whiskey. While enjoying the intense high of the slaughter he smiles at the camera. This is the all too human serial murderer's psycho-sexual high captured in a nutshell on film.<br/><br/>However, for some reason another scene sticks out most in my mind. This is the scene shot from behind of a German motorcycle with attached sidecar in a dawn fog putting along a dirt road leading into the soon to be torched village. The motorcycle is carrying a dead villager with a sign that says ""I insulted a German soldier"". Klimov does a great job at building a feeling of impending doom. You just know that when the fog lifts that day there is going to be hell to pay. I wonder how many of those German motorcycles with sidecars and accompanying machine guns traveled down dirt roads in Russia and the rest of occupied Europe in WW II (many thousands no doubt). They must have often brought just this since of impending doom captured in the film.<br/><br/>The partisans ambush the Nazi SD troops in a wood after they leave the village. Somehow this act appears sordid and mundane as does the village slaughter and it does not give a vindication as would a Robert Mitchum or John Wayne movie. Klimov has certainly brilliantly captured the horror and brutality of war in ""Come and See""."
"wellgamertutos","10","1","1","4 May 2020"," Try to escape the close-ups of this movie!!!
","It is impossible to escape the close-ups in this work by Elem Klimov, who prints his stories on the faces of the characters.<br/><br/>As the plot unfolds, smiles that were once so common are almost entirely suppressed from the faces, leaving for this gesture a new meaning that differs from joy. The looks now show the horror, instead of curiosity. The scars start to get more and more recurrent.<br/><br/>The experience of watching this film and the protagonist's journey are proportionate challenges, as we are as affected by the image and sound of this Soviet classic as Florya who inhabits this terrible reality that is translated to us from what his eyes and his mind see - that remains evident when we observe the surreal tone of the film. The camera movements are almost always subjective and reinforce the documentary aesthetics of the film. The sound is deafening.<br/><br/>The bombs fall with roars so powerful that they may only have been seen before in ""Apocalypse Now""."

"mylkione","9","1","1","11 April 2020"," Debasement and Moral Penury
","Come and See<br/><br/>The study of history asks a prescient question of its representation in media. Every sentence, documentary or film about a particular event removes some layer of epistemological truth from its location in time. To effect, this sometimes informs upon the event, bringing a renewed sense of interest, if not objectivity, to the moment. However, the question of authorship remains a dilemma for any historical study.<br/><br/>Rarely does the depiction of an historical period transcend both the practice and medium. Elem Klimov's 1985 bildungsroman 'Come and See' achieves this transformation, surpassing its aesthetical limitations to inform and illuminate the German occupation of Soviet Belorussia in 1943.<br/><br/>The viewer enters upon a depleted landscape as two youths dig for guns in sand. The nature of the earth confirms the abasement we will see further on. We soon learn one must provide their own weapon to join local partisans fighting the Nazi invasion. As Flyora, the young teenager at the center of the film's narrative, leaves his home to join the fighters, the audience doesn't yet know, upon his return, nothing will ever be the same again.<br/><br/>Once in the forest with the partisans, the director deploys the camera in two distinct modes. The initial offers us witness, as the merry group poses heroically in front of a photographer, awaiting battle. We will see this again from the German side. The other, more common treatment seen throughout the film, involves Klimov turning the camera upon a principal actor and, in return, that character confronting the viewer. The director's adversarial use of the lens confirms the nature of the story and provides a direct emotional link to the two main characters and their utterly abject edification.<br/><br/>In the forest, Flyora meets his female counterpart, Glasha. As they play amongst the trees, the horror of war besets their pastoral harmony. They are soon forced on an odyssey of complete physical and emotional penury.<br/><br/>The film's corrupted landscape echoes the scabrous topography of moral depravity. Even the film stock, defused of color, pale and sallow like the characters, plays to this aesthetical anemia.<br/><br/>The use of sound and its elision also reinforces the nuanced destruction of warfare. After a bombardment shatters the two teenagers' frolic in the forest, Flyora's deafness permeates the soundtrack. We are left with the piercing pitch of aural trauma and the fuzzy static of a muted world.<br/><br/>The narrative reaches its licentious climax as Germans commit a 'pogrom' against the Jews of a Belorussian village. Klimov blends hyper-real images, searing their ghastly certainty deep into the viewers' minds, with completely absurd surrealism. Never has war looked so absolute and horrifying. The other-worldly feeling of the film washes upon the screen like a diaphanous cloud dissected by the violence of sunlight. It is a liminal reality in which the two main protagonists disappear.<br/><br/>By the film's end, Flyora stands unrecognizable. Klimov's elision of time casts our teenager as an old-man, visible wrinkles and scars appearing from nowhere. Likewise, once an image of innocent beauty in a flowing green dress, Glasha reappears, blood running the length of her inner thighs, her physical violation reflecting her emotional depredation. Gone are any traces of the characters' former selves. In their place lie the type of fragments only war's monstrosity provides.<br/><br/>We are finally left with a curious interweaving of stock footage, deployed by Klimov in a radical 'de-aging' of Hitler to the moment of his childhood. As Flyora stares at the non-diegetic image of Hitler as a child in his mother's arms, the viewer recalls a man's warning at the beginning of the film: Do not dig! It starts with children. He soon disappears into a mass of partisans as they traverse a forest. He has achieved his desire...He is now a soldier."

"maria_isabee","8","1","1","14 November 2015"," Come and See
","The 1985 Soviet war film entitled ""Come and See,"" directed by Elem Klimov revolving around the Nazi German occupation of the Byelorussian SSR. As watching this film Andrei Tarkovsky's ""Ivan's Childhood"" came to mind. Although the two are quite similar as both depict a child in war they couldn't be far different in delivery. Klimov's film doesn't center around the psychologically events war has on children as much as Ivan's Childhood does. We have far more aspects of war that are being shown such as the separation of families, the portrayal of manslaughter, we even see the German's celebrating after essentially burning an entire village. Klimov takes an entirely new portrayal of soviet war films that is both haunting and shocking. Klimov's usage of cinematic tools that makes viewers feel like they themselves are experiencing the same volatile environment that Florya is confronted with which makes this film all the more difficult to watch. There is one particular scene that is almost a mirror image of a scene in Ivan's Childhood where Florya is looking over a well while searching for his family just as what Ivan does. The image of Florya that is reflected in this scene doesn't appear as that of a child in fact this scene is most likely the beginning of when we begin to see Florya start to age rapidly as hinted with the absence of hair that is shown in his reflection. You see Florya as someone who is actively trying to avoid the horrible truth; we see this clearly when Florya is always covering his ears. The contrast in characters between Glasha who sees death everywhere and Florya who avoids this is also portrayed in the scene were Florya refuses to believe that his family was killed and rushes to a nearby island in search for them not taking notice of the mass number of dead bodies behind his house. The scene were the bog that Glasha and Florya are trying to cross is noticeable dense but the drastic change in consistency that happens a few minutes later most likely serves as Florya's difficulty in accepting the reality-coming to terms that his family was killed. The conclusion of the film where Florya comes upon the portrait of Hitler is an impactful moment where Florya seeks to undo all the terrific horror events that all of Europe has suffered at the hands of Hitler. Every shot attempts to erase Hitler's existence."

","This movie was a really good movie about war. I enjoyed the realistic point of view made by Klimov throughout. There were many points throughout the movie that I greatly enjoyed. One was where the two main characters are crossing a very thick swamp filled with mud. This scene was very realistic (because the actors actually did this while they were being filmed) and it spoke a lot about how desperate times call for desperate measures. Just prior to this, when they were running to the swamp, there was a quick shot of a lot of dead bodies in Florya's neighborhood. This shows how cruel times of war are and even though the shot was very short, the impact was immense. The ending of this movie was very interesting to me as well. When Florya started shooting the picture of Hitler and having flashbacks on certain things throughout the history of Germany, I was surprised that the montage was going backwards instead of forwards. Also, it was a very deep scene because it showed the hatred towards Hitler and it showed that the whole reason why they were in that position was because of Hitler. I thought that when Florya joined the army again after shooting the picture proved the brotherhood of the army and how once you're sucked in, it's difficult to leave. After that, the ending was amazing to be. The shot of the snow in the middle of the forest with the very powerful music in the background made it even more important than any normal ending. The snow represented the downfall of Germany, because the winters are what got the Russians the victory over Germany and the music just added a lot of mood to that scene. I would definitely recommend this movie to many people, especially those who like war movies and those who want to go to war to see what it actually is like."
"LightZ88","9","1","1","27 July 2012"," One of the Best War Movies Ever
","I loved this movie because it was the kind of war movie I had been looking for because of its gripping events that happens in war. Klimov does an epic job in showing what the Russians had to go through with survival and the gripping physiological hardships of what not only adults, but what children had to endure. Before I could only imagine the implications of a society where the survival of the fittest is the bottom line, and this movie helped me institutionalize it. The feeling of being on your own in wartime, and losing all you have, including your sanity, is greatly hinted in this movie for you. At the end, feel for the kid that had to endure everything in addition to his aging. I think that. Basically, it is a powerful reminder of war being hell where it is worth emphasizing in ways like this."

How quickly the film becomes a downward spiral and cinematically an amazing one. The explosions gave me sorrow the sound, gave me chills, and the story left me shook. A moving film for sure, and a pleasure to watch. I emotionally am attached to this film at this point and can truly say it is one of my favorites."

","Watching the film ""Come and See"" is a real powerful film that what expressed to me of what people in reality suffered during that time and they went through. What emotionally affected me was to see the fact of how back in the day people got killed. It was hard for to see that because people were judgmental for belonging to a certain class or race. While watching the film it reminded me of how unfortunately similar situations happen in today's society and the results are deaths of innocents. The wars and violence that exist in countries only causes more deaths and hatred especially for the innocents of children. What the film really told to me was about the innocence of the people is that the thought that of how there is no humanity or empathy of people."
"lexismilisic","9","1","1","26 July 2012"," Aleksey's performance
","I was deeply affected by Aleksey Kravchenko's (Florya) performance in Elem Klimoc's film ""Come and See"". From the beginning of the story, we see an innocent boy, somewhat emotionally foreign from the direct contact of savages and war. His naive eyes sparkle and show interest toward the idea of war, yet he has no idea as to the trouble that is about to drop dead before him. As he is introduced to the turmoil that his country and people are going through, his innocence diminishes and with him we begin to experience Florya's journey into adulthood. Throughout the movie, Florya detachment from his youth is heartbreaking; he is immediately thrown into the cruel world of men and machinery. The character Florya, along with Klimoc's stylistic approaches, drew me in and made me feel emotionally involved from beginning to end. This is one of the most powerful war films I have ever seen."

","It is always tragic when a child is forced to mature be their time. This movie had me psychologically arrested, longing for a hero to emerge to save a people from mass annihilation. After witnessing mass murder by the hands of the Germany Army, Florya, is compelled to be a defending solider (first), rather than a preteen, or a man. After watching this movie, i tried to place myself in Florya's position. I could not. It's far too easy to look at someone else situation or circumstance and say what you would have or could have done in retrospect. The truth is, you cannot say how you would responded. Psychologically, Florya was far more advanced then my present thought process in trying to rationalize or justify what i would have done. It is sad that life is indiscriminate to tragic situations and circumstances. 10 stars for reality check-life and freedom is cherished."
"kyle-oloughlin89","9","1","1","24 July 2012"," Stumped
","Where to start? The way Klimov depicted war in this film is astonishing. This is one of the first war movies that I have personally viewed that did not include the normal glorification of war. It did not have a real ""Hero"", although I would say that the child that this movie follows is a real hero going through the trials and tribulations throughout this movie. I was blown away by the acting in this film. The child stars shine brightly through this dim and gloomy film. I walked out after seeing this movie rethinking the lives of all those affected by war. This gave me such a new appreciation for the struggles for families involved in combat. I was filled with sadness and confusion on how some of the people in this world can view another human being as nothing more than a pawn in a chess game. I feel that this movie has opened my eyes to things I would have never thought about before. Definitely recommended but prepare to be shocked and saddened by this one."
"bradwilcox","9","1","1","8 June 2012"," Come and see... the brutal truth of war
","The brutalities of war are not glamorized in Come and See; they are thrust into your face with all the subtlety of an unexpected land mine. ""Powerful"" and ""haunting"" are both over-used words in film reviews, but they should have new definitions since the making of this film and critics should not be allowed to use them in regards to most other movies.<br/><br/>It starts innocently enough with what might be a film about boys being mischievous and their coming of age. Then a pretty girl enters the picture and we think perhaps it will be a romance, with the young boy going off to war and pining for his lover. True, there most certainly is a coming of age, but it is a violent and horrific one that will never be looked back at with even the slightest laughter or fondness. And romance is just not in the cards for these two young unfortunates.<br/><br/>Aleksei Kravchenko, who plays Florya, was not an actor when he was cast in the lead role. He was a 14 year old boy and was apparently under hypnosis for the filming of Come and See. Whatever the case, the performance he gives is astounding and real. Perhaps, because of the hypnosis, he actually believed what was going on around him, hence his seemingly natural and mesmerizing ability. It is amazing to watch the transformation of Florya from a boy, who is thrilled to sign up to fight Nazis, to the torn down, desperate man he becomes by the end. <br/><br/>There are few breaks in Come and See, so if you are looking for some fun, fast-paced explosions or a nice hero story, look elsewhere. This film is a giant warning sign (intentionally so, according to director Elem Klimov), a beacon to the world, calling all those despots and tyrants and even ""world police"" (and more importantly, the citizens of these countries) to wake up and see what war is really like. Far more disturbing than this film is discovering that the atrocities displayed on the screen happened, in reality, hundreds of times over all across Byelorussia alone, not to mention the other countries the Nazis invaded.<br/><br/>There is also a beauty to this film, perhaps surprisingly. Amidst the chaos and blood, the horrifying disregard of human life, there is a poetry, a kind of fluid, nail-scraping, tortuous beauty. It makes you stare agape in horror at the depravity of humankind, and at the same time appreciate the preciousness of our brief existence here."
"zaragibbon","9","1","1","6 June 2012"," Painful but unforgettable
","Come and See is a movie I'll never forget - because it attacked my senses for almost 2.5 hours. Jarring sounds pierced my ears and made me uncomfortable, gruesome images in brown and grey burned their way onto my memory. I felt cold, felt hungry, felt hurt (not just emotionally, but physically) as I watched the story unfold. I was smelling and tasting the thick, rancid air that fill the space between dead bodies and burnt wood, and from the start I longed for it to be over -- but I'm glad I saw it, and wouldn't have wanted it to be any shorter or less graphic.<br/><br/>Elem Klimoff paints a very true picture of the devastation war brings that I think we all should see. Set in 1943, this movie tells the story of a village (one of 628) in Byelorussia that was mercilessly destroyed by German soldiers during World War 2. It is a tale of the slow torture to the soul a village boy endures after he joins the fight against the Germans trespassers. In an ironic exchange for witnessing pain, suffering and death at every turn, he gets to keep his life – forever marred by the fact that his family, the rest of his village, and many other innocent people he came to know were brutally massacred.<br/><br/>Though this movie is specifically about the Nazi invasion of Byelorussia, it applies to any and all wars. It shows war for what it is for most – not some glorious battle of strength and manhood, but an intensely painful period of suffering and confusion with irreparable consequences. Come and See is a very powerful and honest depiction of war, and a truly brilliant film in the way it uses each of the senses to stir up raw emotion inside of the viewer."
"red_poppypolka","9","1","1","6 June 2012"," What Real Hardship Is...
","""Come and See"" is an astounding film that transfixes you into silence. Set in the Soviet Union during WWII, it tosses aside the common frivolous stylizations of war dramas, and instead paints a raw picture of a population's dying morale. The transitions in the film are shockingly stark, especially with the trials and tribulations Flyora suffers throughout the film. Living in a simple and quaint village, he has a good life but is restless and itching to get out of an unadventurous environment. Naïve but full of vigor, he joins the army in the hopes of joining a camaraderie. What he finds instead, is more than he bargained for. As the atrocities unfold, it's shocking to see his appearance change from a vibrant albeit immature boy of 15, to a terrorized and insipid war victim who looks aged well beyond his years.<br/><br/>The film also haunts with it's looming calamities by quick second-flashing imagery; with a relentless swarm of flies occupying the house where Flyora and Glasha are consuming a eerily still-warm meal, the young teenagers -oblivious and uncorrupted yet by the horrors of war- wonder where the village people have inexplicably vanished to. As fear and the nefarious truth takes hold of them, all they can do is simply run from it, with Dasha catching a menacing glimpse of death piled against the house. All it takes is just those few seconds in an inexplicit form to imprint a lasting and sickening image of brutality. When Flyora is led to a village's famished survivors, he is so overcome by the occupation's aftermath that he buries his head in the marsh, trying to block out the horrors he's experiencing. It's easy to feel the anguish that's taking a hold of him, as it finally permeates through his emotions.<br/><br/>The burning barn is an another powerful scene, when the Nazis depravity is fully exposed as they hastily round up the country town's people like cattle and confine them to their death. The target of children combined with one Nazi carelessly throwing a child back into the barn as if an inanimate object, is a primitive act overshadowed by shamelessness. Most importantly, the film does not sugarcoat and lingers with you long after you've seen it."

","A glance into the underbelly of the Nazi regime during World War II, this is not your typical war movie. It plays on your psychology and bring the forefront what really happened when the Nazi's invaded Eastern Europe. The overall struggle of the Byaloorussian people and their will to survive is an amazing story.<br/><br/>I think this is one of the few films that literally kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The direction is amazing and the acting, especially from Florya, was even better. There is not a single moment that I did not feel like I was a part of this story. Klimov keeps you in tune with mindset of a teenage soldier, who seems to age decades by the end of it. Understandably so after seeing his family and multiple villages destroyed, along with the genocide that we experience.<br/><br/>The score of the film keeps you psychologically involved at all times. The symbolism of the airplane flying over head throughout the movie, puts the same fear in your mind as it does the main characters."

","Directed by Elem Klimov, ""Come and See"" gave me a new perspective on World War 2, that of the Russians and the villages that were slaughtered by the Germans. This film is a psychological horror drama that evokes the person inside us who wants to fight against evil. It offers a different view point of war in general, of how brutal it can be. While watching this picture, you can't tell yourself 'it's just a movie' because it actually happened. <br/><br/>The story follows a coming of age Russian, Flyora, who became a soldier overnight. His mother begs for him to stay at home with her and his two sisters but comes to no avail. He finds himself in the forest, holding down the camp site under the orders of Kosach, his leader. Flyora meets Glasho, a tag-along who longs for Kosach but for the time being, settles with the young soldier. After kissing, laughing, telling stories of old, the forest gets bombed by the German's and they experience heavy artillery fire. <br/><br/>Flyora and Glasho make their way to Flora's village. Upon arrival, something is mysteriously wrong and dampening. Flyora's mom, two sisters, and the rest of the village are nowhere to be found. Flyora decides to head towards a nearby island under the suspicion that he'll find his family there. As they leave, Glasho looks back at a house apart of the village and sees multiple bodies piled on each other.<br/><br/>After reaching the island, Flyora separates from Glasho to find food and water for the survivors of his village. His journey is cut short by a German invasion of another village. He witnesses hundreds of people who are burned alive and by the slimmest of margins, avoids this tragedy. Kosach and the rest of the soldiers hunt down the Germans and get their revenge. Living through these acts of evil, a part of Flyora has died along with his mom and two sisters (the kid within himself). After bandaging his wounded rifle, he rejoins his troops for the first time, not as a boy, but as a soldier. <br/><br/>This films effect on me will last a life time. When Glasho turns back to see the dead bodies piled on each other, I immediately knew I'd never forget it. Most people are aware of how costly World War 2 was, the persecution of the Jews, and the American soldiers that were lost... ""Come and See"" will fill in the blank for the unknown, leaving its audiences in shock of the pasts haunting reality."

I don't know what i would have done if i was the kid in the movie, everything he did was the right thing, if he would have changed anything he probably wouldn't be alive at the end of the movie, but after everything that is happen to him i don't think he is alive anymore. The worst part of the movie that made me extremely sad was when they gather all the people in the village and put them in the barn and then light them on fire.

","This film is not to the faint of heart or weak of stomachs. This is a very realistic war film, that is very unlike the mainstream Hollywood war films that are made today. There are no heroes in this film, just a young boy trying to survive through many horrific situations. There are no special effects and no stunt men. This film sent me through and emotional roller coaster the whole time I was watching it, and made me question whether I would be able to go through these same situations and still have the will to live. For me, this film border lines a horror film, mainly because it is very haunting and scary. The scene where the Nazis are torching the homes with the people inside were particularly scary to me because I have a huge fear of fire. But at the same time, it could have been just as scary to come out of the house because the torture could have been just as bad or worse. It was moments like these that made me think about war, its purpose and the sacrifices or decisions that people who are in it make. Although this film is meant to be realistic, it can become hard to continue watching. There are no moments of hope or happiness, and watching Flyora age so quickly through out the movie is very disturbing. Still, in contrast to the typical war films that are made today that glamorize war and the military, I am happy that this film was made because it shows what war really is, a truly horrifying event."

","I must say I jumped quite a bit through this film, though I am not easily startled. Being a combat veteran, this film brought the realist intensity of war that I have ever seen. The point of view camera angles made me feel as if I were truly there. I caught myself trying to make my own schemes of operating in those conditions. It was a n incredible feeling to be so involved throughout this entire viewing. Though the most important aspect of the film to me, was not the film itself but how it affected those watching it around me. They were experiencing war for the first time. And for the first time it was not a story of heroism, nor glory, but instead survival. War is a hell of a thing based around decisions, that you make and decisions that you will live with. I think it is important that people understand it is not a game. And that this is what really happens. I appreciate the awareness of war that this movie created for the people I was viewing it with because I think it is so easy not think about it when its not around you. But it is taking place everyday. By the end, everyone was startled and feeling uneasy. I laughed. That was only two hours. That wasn't real. I get to go home now. These people only got a taste. That left me with a good feeling."

I didn't want to speak to anyone or interact with another human being for the rest of the day. Although this may seem negative, I only say all this because the film really spoke to me. It left me feeling that the concerns I have in everyday life were nothing compared to the struggles, pain, and lives that were lost in this film. This film was powerful, and honestly the word ""powerful"" doesn't do it justice. Please see this film. You will not be the same after it."

","Come and see is a tragedy movie filling with a gray tone both on the screen and the story. Via Florya and Glasha's sad experience, Elem has given audience the ruthlessness and impacts of war addressed on the Jews in WWII.<br/><br/>To me, the relationship between Florya and Glasha is meaningless to the story because of Florya's reaction looks like there is no struggle in his when losing his love. In the movie, Florya's has been dreaming as a warrior. He met his love at the beginning of the movie. Perhaps, that relationship is not very deep. This movie, in the middle point, has created a weird feeling that Florya seem never ever hesitated to leave his love to fight back Nazi after he was under attack at the warehouse.<br/><br/>The most impressive scene in the movie would be the burning warehouse. It shifted my anger the most via the scene showing the cruel of the Nazi army. Burning people, torturing, and raping the women have angered me. Couple with the applause and laugh after the warehouse was fully burned, the scene has greatly expressed the ugly, cruel, and the truth side of the Nazi or war. I got to admit I even was inspired to trying to get into the screen and beat them with my hands.<br/><br/>As those soldiers were caught up at the end, they were all blaming each other and finding excuse even they all know what they have done was really wrong. The action that one of the soldiers poured the oil he was given to his teammates has impressed me the ugliness of war and immorality within those soldiers. As we are told long ago that war has no wrong or right. This movie, however, is seem giving out a message to mirror a phenomenon that war is ugly and wrong when people don't respect lives."
"sd-777","9","1","1","5 June 2012"," Great Cautionary Movie about war and what it is
","I think this movie brings to the viewers attention the destruction of war on a civilization. That war only brings with it death and the abuse of power. For example the scene where they burn the people in the house unless they leave their children behind is just cruel punishment that no one deserves. That there is never a need for war or violence.<br/><br/>That many innocent people die only because someone is willing to follow orders. This is shown when some of the captured soldiers are told to burn them and two men say ""they forced us to"". In reality no one forced you to pick up a weapon and kill you choose to. Just as others choose to die with their families rather then join in on pure evil.<br/><br/>I think it is a real example of what war is and not what movies in todays world perceive as. It a grim and dark world that the youth should be pointed away from and not encouraged to join. A gun and saying you killed the enemy doest not make you a man."

When watching, you notice how the director used specific angles and shots to actually make you believe everything you see is real. In a scene from this movie, there is a barn burning to the ground with dozens of people inside it. As you see this barn burning you see the doors being banged on from the inside. With all of these people being slaughtered and burned alive it flashes to a female German officer in her car. The camera makes eye contact with her. You see her look at the chaos and destruction and you see grin and eat a shrimp cocktail. Upon seeing that i was filled with rage.I wanted nothing more then to throw her in the burning building.

These film, while all very telling, are not ""Come and See.""<br/><br/>Directed by Elem Klimov, this tale which follows a boy, Floria, as he discovers and entrenches himself in the perils of World War 2 is not for the faint of heart or the casual mind. Shot against a backdrop of World War 2 Russia, this film will show you everything the aforementioned American made films do not and likely won't ever. Very dark by nature, immaculately styled, and grim in authenticity, this film combines some of the best qualities of cinema and slaps you in the face for two and a half hours.<br/><br/>Many time during the film did I cringe as I felt as if I were growing up through the war-torn eyes of Floria. I felt for him, yet I also felt my soul harden as his had. A female character, Glasha, also had me mesmerized in such a gruesome, uncomfortable way.<br/><br/>This film is not the most touched I have ever been by a film of this genre, but I could definitely feel the nuances of finding your way through a battlefield the first time. It is something I doubt I will ever feel again from a film. It does lack the typical Hollywood overly eccentric, dumbed-detail version of war- the kind of script that has you crying because three Ryan Brothers have given way to war and only one remains.

"sarah_bt93","9","1","1","4 June 2012"," Disturbing at times but is a must-see. Powerful
","Come and See is a very powerful movie, it affected me deeply. <br/><br/>The movie starts off simply with a young 12 year old boy wanting to join the battle against the Nazis. He was excited to be part of the movement, to be able to fight for his people, his face expressions were so unbelievably positive as he left his village. As soon as he reaches camp, reality strikes him. The first bomb is hit and Florya is left speechless, stunned, and the look in his eye changes. The movie then follows Florya as he travels back to his village only to find his people brutally murdered, only he is blind to that. That is when the most powerful scene in the movie occurred, being only 1.5 seconds long, it affected me deeply; the bodies of his family and the people in his village. However, Florya does not notice, he keeps moving and experiences so many traumatizing moments that leave him out of his mind. Another powerful scene was when Florya arrived to a village just as soon as the Nazis arrived to. We see the poor innocent children with their parents being put into a house and burned to the ground, loud screams were all that was shown. We see the Germans laughing around as if nothing was going on while the expression on Florya's face is so strong. Florya, even though being psychologically bruised still moves on to join the soldiers against the Nazis. He picks up his gun, with the strongest look in his eyes and shoots a picture of Hitler. He shoots and shoots while we see shots of Hitler's laugh backwards. Florya sees a shot and shoots. The point was for us to see the gradual change of Florya from an innocent 12 year old boy to an innerly scarred human being. The movie ends with the a change in time to the winter, with snow falling as a symbol of hope. The movie is so vivid and disturbing yet we are given hope in the end because the scene of snow meant the time period when the Nazis were taken down. <br/><br/>Come and See shows us the reality of how war really is, that it has been going on since then and is still going on now. I have seen so many movies about World War II but never more powerful and expressive than this. It is a must see and will keep you hanging minute by minute."
"a_Fuhri","8","1","1","4 June 2012"," Confrontational war movie.
","Come and See is a very impressive film that almost literally leaves you shaking after the camera tilts up to the sky in the final shot. It proves that war movies can only be made effectively when they are not visually and narratively sugar coated. For one, because this is cinematically more interesting and relevant, but more importantly because it does more justice to the people that underwent the atrocities of that particular war. ""Come and see"" is a tribute to the people in the former Soviet Union that were affected by Nazi atrocities. A tribute to those who died and to the survivors of the Nazi invasion. Visually it is a raw movie, allowing us to see what this war and war in general is like. It warns us how people can follow evil blindly and become dehumanized killing machines. And by showing this in every ugly detail we actually come as close as possible to knowing what went on in this Belarusian village. It does justice to those that died and suffered. Just as ""Schindler's List"" pays tribute to the six million Jews that were killed by the Nazis. Just as ""The Deer Hunter"" did justice to the soldiers that came back from Vietnam with post traumatic stress disorder. The point is that these movies were dramatic, but not melodramatic in its depiction of the premise to allow the viewer as accurate a depiction of the events that took place as is possible. ""Come and See"" is a very powerful movie that depicts the resiliency of a lesser equipped Partisan force that beat the Nazis. It also shows us that war can make numb, but that numb doesn't mean dehumanized. This shows in how Flyora shoots at the the portrait of Hitler in the montage sequence, but finally cannot pull the trigger when his thoughts portray Hitler as a baby. Klimov's message is that Flyora becomes the same as the Nazis if he'd shoot the baby picture, just like the general is saying in the scene before when he decides that the Nazis shouldn't be burned. They would stoop down to the animalistic level of the Nazis that we saw in the barn scene. Flyora joins the Partisans as a boy that is hardened by life, but still a human thinker fighting for a just cause. ""Come And See"" is a must see movie both for the messages that it conveys to us, but also because it is a very well crafted movie by a smart director."

(I had to walk out of the room when I felt I was running out of air) Florya's scared look as he saw his people being burned in that barn just made my head hurt.

","This was by far the most raunchy and gruesome WWII film I have ever seen. It was a fantastic microcosm of the events that took place during the Nazi's rise of terror in eastern Europe. The film depicted WWII as if it were a documentary following Russian resistance but with beautiful cinematography and direction. Emotionally the film left me stunned to the point of apathy when I finished watching it. It was a two and half hour visual and auditory assault to my eyes and ears. Despite its brutal honest depiction of the war I enjoyed the fact that this film was able to invoke this kind of emotional response on me, which I feel is very rare in films today. I also loved Flyoras transformation from a ignorant eager child into a scarred soul with the will to still keep on fighting for he's people, even after all the horror he experienced throughout the film. Flyoras story exemplifies the resilience of the Russian people to fight against the Nazi's in a very personal way that affect the audience tremendously."

The incredible soundtrack is the cherry on top of a fantastically realistic piece of work, which does a great job at capturing what war really is all about...hell. <br/><br/>The movie will leave you speechless and even breathless at times. It's almost hard to watch, and even harder to believe that some of the things that happened throughout the 2 hours actually happened in big numbers during this period, and that this was the story of only one village. It is a story about courage, a story about love, and a story about passion. The passion to defend what you believe in and stand for. The passion to remain calm and keep your cool when everything is in your way and the odds are against you."

","Very few films have left me feeling the impact days after the viewing. This is definitely one of them. The opening scenes of the boys searching in the deserted sand bank were very intriguing as it turns out to the viewer that they were searching for buried rifles from previous war times. The shock factor of this film is extremely high. If you are not okay with brutal violence in cinema, this is definitely not a film for you. While watching ""Come and See"" I felt a strong looming necrotic feeling increase as the film progressed. Once Florya and Glasha escape the forest bombings and retreat to a formerly familiar place that was once Florya's home, my gut was wrenched. The sounds of the buzzing flies among utter silence queues the unwelcome presence of death, which we do not see until they leave and Glasha glances behind a barn to see the villagers now as a pile of gruesome corpses. The moment when she notices but does not tell Florya made my head spin at the thought of family ties being severed forever in such a brutal and unfair manner. The sheer realistic manner of the film is enough to engulf viewers into feeling for Florya and his people as their existence is nearly decimated by the unrelenting hand of Nazi Germany. Once the film wound to an end I found myself reflecting on all the horrific imagery and pain that Florya witnessed on his resilient path to surviving such a brutal inhumane event. I couldn't help but feel the hatred he felt and yet I understood why he wanted to join the ranks and fight the good fight once he realized that war is no game. I feel that the pride and resilience Russians carried on their back during the Nazi atrocities is strong enough to charge a fight for in any human witnessing this breathtaking twister of a film."
"Shawnabaca","10","1","1","3 June 2012"," By far, one of the greatest war movies.
","I'm not a fan of war, but I'm a fan of watching war movies and not for it's extreme violence, more so for its historical education and cultural value.<br/><br/>Klimov's storytelling is electrifying and a breathe of fresh air in portraying intricate and disconcerting content in a way that touches upon humanity. I have no idea what it was like to be part of a war as such, i can only imagine and yet without physically being there, as Americans we are so blinded by what really goes on out there in the world.<br/><br/>It's haunting to watch silly uniformed men with a little power take advantage, rob and ridicule people relentlessly for being Jewish. I found myself angry at times when watching this happen. Seeing fools being condoned for bad behavior because they are on the dominating side of war. It's cruel and bullying, yet it's probably true to what really happened out there.<br/><br/>And the protagonist Flor, who we follow through this journey, a boy caught up in the war trying to survive. The cinematic moments and dramatic pauses capture and bring the audience into Flor's every emotion turn. Just when you think it's over, it continues, another day of war, another day trying to survive. It's ugly and brutal.<br/><br/>It's heartbreaking to watch the German soldiers come in like Gods and have power over a culture of people stripping them off all their rights. I was angry when I saw the soldiers come in and eat their food, take their belongings all while the villagers watched in hopes that there weren't chosen to be exterminated. Horrific.<br/><br/>One of my favorite moments in the film is when Flor and Glasha are playing out in the rain despite being on the run for their lives. The most daunting is watching people being burnt alive while German soldiers make mockery of the happening. And watching Flor's face and his inner psychological torment happening. It's hard to look at this film and say that it is beautiful and unique to some of its other war movie counterparts but this movie is real and beautiful in every spoken sense of the word. <br/><br/>The score, along with the sound design, the editing, and the actor's performance is astonishing. The director's vision and storytelling is amazing, a true storyteller. <br/><br/>The ending is a true masterpiece in an attempt to try and erase this massacre from history but it's really hard to ever forget what happened. The real live footage of this genocide and the filmmaker's interpretation is genius. Really one of the most engaging war movies I've every seen, but not for the faint of heart."

","Being sick and tired of human suffering caused by wars, this movie came across to me more significant than any anti-war movie I have ever seen, that it is made purely for that reason – to affect people enough to make a change. It is crazy to think that real war images don't create a reaction anymore in human beings minds; we have become numb to everything that doesn't directly affect us, our family or friends. This certainly does not apply for everyone, but the evidence is that as a species, we don't end the suffering once and for all. Like it's not enough what happened up until today. One might think that evolution and a larger brain should have given us the tools to become peaceful and more understanding. It has on the contrary, given us enough intelligence to build larger and more horrific bombs that could probably kill most of us and all the other living things on this planet. It's a shame that this film was unknown to me until most recently, and to one of my dearest thoughts that it evoked– is it possible for a film to actually make a major difference globally? I mean – if a war can't, could a film do just that? I believe that everyone that watches this movie will not only think once, but five times about what war is really about, and what it does. And that you want to stop the occurrence of it, today."

It is a emotional roller coaster, I would advise watching this film with no references or pre knowledge of the plot. I watched it not knowing what to expect and I feel it affected me the most this way. I also don't want to write about the plot much because like I said I want you to have a clean slate once viewing. But even with such horrible images the pictures shot are also so beautiful. From a technical standpoint this movie is a masterpiece. I think what shocked me the most was how real everything was and how it was shot in almost a perspective view to make it feel as if I was there. Once my mind was connected with the film to make it seem as reality the story and plot hit me so much harder and by the end of the movie all i could really say to explain how i felt was numb."

This film definitely plays with all your senses, as a lot of the scenes are very intense, and almost makes you realize about what war may really be like, and may be the closest thing to experience it without having to enlist in the military. The film can be a bit unbearable at some points, not just graphically, but emotionally as well, as I stated before can almost put you right in the film itself. You can almost feel the intensity of the forest and the trees being blown up, and your ears blowing out and leaving them ringing (literally) for a while. For me, it's a great film if you want to know more about the Nazi invasion, and maybe get a taste of what war is like. But I am not much for war films, I understand the importance of not forgetting what happened in the past, and the fact that there are situations like this still going on, and the annihilation of villages and it's people still happening to this day. I appreciate the film, and think everyone should watch it, but definitely be aware of it's intensity as it may be too much, as it was for me."

","With ""Come and See"" the director Elem Klimov created a realistic depiction of the horror during World War 2. The plot is about a young boy named Flyora from the Soviet republic who wants to defeat his country after Hitler invaded parts of it. Throughout the movie we follow Flyora who is exposed to the brutality of war, however it seems like he becomes numb to it and at the end only wishes to survive this hell. The movie has an incredibly intense effect on the viewer and leaves the audience in a shocked state of mind. Although it depicts World War 2 and the cruelty it brought out of humankind, our generation does not seem to put much effort into creating a present that will be a better history for the future. Genocides and wars are still happening around the world and our society is reliving the horrors and terrific crimes towards mankind over and over again, which makes the theme of the movie contemporary."

","Come and see was a film that really served as a warning to avoid violence and war. It seemed that the director Klimov did everyhtin he could to depict war the horror of war. In opening scenes of the film I noticed how proud the main character Flor was about finding a gun and joining the rebel army. When the soldiers come and take Flor away from his mother it is evident that he has been sold an sensationalized view of war. He is proud to serve and fight in the war. At the camp Flor begins to see that war is not what he really thought. When he is forced to clean the camp and give up his boots Flor begins to git a hint that war is a rough rigid life full of necessity and not wants. When the army leaves Flor behind to watch after the camp he realizes that war is not so glorious. When Flor is having a good time and the mortars begin to fall out of the sky with the ground blowing up all around him flor is suddenly introduced into the psychological horrors of war. He soon realizes that war is hell on earth and not fun. The scene that most illustrates this is the scene where the nazi's round up all the towns people in a village , force them into a warehouse and burn them alive. This scene for me summarizes what the message of the movie. That war is hell and that maybe we should as adults should reassess the way we sell war , combat and violence as to younger children. It made me realize that as humans we are not wired for the psychological terror and trauma for war. This was one of the most emotionally disturbing movies that I have seen in my life. As previously mentioned the scene were the Nazis round up all of the women, children, elders and towns people. What disturbed me was how easy it was for the Nazis to burn tortue and kill those people in the village. It made me feel upset that human beings could become so barbaric and inhumane, I soon found myself calling the nazi's bastards wanting to jump out of my seat and throw something at the screen. My anger was a credit to Klimov's brilliant film making that make you feel like your were experience the real think, that I was there in the war. Lastly the main thing that I got from this movie was how dehumanizing war could be. It shocked me to see that Flor would rather use a bandage to repair his rifle than to help save a ding person. This allowed me to see how people over become dehumanized like the nazi's who killed all the villagers"
"Mortalkombat1981","Null","1","1","10 February 2012"," Come and See
","Come and See, directed by Elem Klimov, is a movie that talks about a young boy from Beylorussia named Florya who, during World War II, sees the reality of war in front of his eyes. Klimov also made this movie as a way to celebrate the Russian victory against Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. The way this movie was made, I can relate to it. I was deployed to Iraq in 2003 and the movie reminded me how much hardship can one person endure for so long. In the case of Florya just because he has a rifle in his hands doesn't mean he was well prepared for it. One must be prepared to deal with it mentally and unfortunately for Florya, he was scarred once he realized his comrades were killed in action. Ill be honest when I saw this movie I cried because it brought back memories of Iraq (I wont post what I really saw due to the fact it was very eerie for me but I believe you got the idea). However I recommend this movie for anyone who can understand that even though there will be victory, its through sacrifice that victory is gained."
"Jensenmjeffrey","10","1","1","10 February 2012"," Profound and Haunting experience
","This movie was very intense and had a profound impact. The use of music in cohesion with the film, really helped accentuate the scenes. The scores were beautiful, I especially enjoyed the piece from Mozart's Requiem. The way Klimov was able to show Florya's emotional aging was heartbreaking. I think it is because you experience Folrya's trauma as he experiences it, that makes his psychological aging so profound. Also, I really felt as if a lot of my senses were in use. Especially the scene where they dredge through the swamp, I could practically feel the mud and water surrounding me. I think Klimov does an excellent job in showing the impacts of war and the human condition. The movie was truly a haunting experience that I will not soon forget."

","""Come and See"" is a beautiful film by Elim Klimov, and a smart masterpiece way to pay tribute to the 40th anniversary Russian win over Germany forces. The cinematography of the movie made me react as in to how many people were hurt during the making of the film, but also during the actual war during War World II. It is brilliant to see how Floyra changes in front of the audience, first his innocence, and then his mind. The film does a well job in depicting how brutal war is, and Floyra's decision to stay in war at the end, even though he knows how brutal it is. In addition, by Klimov emphasizing on the story of this little village, the micros coping aspect makes the impact of the film bigger because it can represent any other village that was going under the same circumstances in Russia. The images of the film are devastating, and there is so much to absorb every second of the film."
"tsingiser-michael","10","1","1","10 February 2012"," The Power of War
","Come and See is one of the most harrowing films I have ever seen. The director, Elem Klimov, never loosens his grip on the audience throughout the entire film and he has us in his grasp. There are no exits for the film's characters, and Klimov forces that idea through the viewer as well. The mood that the film creates is such that even when nothing is occurring, we are still on the edge of our seat, fighting to keep our eyes glued to the screen. We are in war, just as Florya is. We are witnessing the atrocities that around, just as Florya is. We are no longer just sitting and viewing these events. Rather,we are transported into the Byelorussian countryside as the Nazis are invading. It is also of note that what is happening here in Byelorussia had also occurred in other parts of the country as well. This is an experience that I believe many viewers will have a hard time fully embracing, but those few that do will be forever changed. No other film has ever been able to so successfully convey the tone of war that Klimov's Come and See does. From the battered and stunning visuals to the isolated sound effects, this is as real as war can get on a movie screen. Though the film isn't necessarily entertaining, it is shocking, and if you are able to handle the horrifying aspects of war that Klimov is presenting, simply turning the film off becomes an impossibility. After viewing ""Come and See"", it is as one professor once said: ""It is a film that you will never forget""."

","""Come and See"" director Elem Klimov, takes us to a tiny town called Byelorussia, where we witness two boys digging in the sandy beaches looking for treasure, which turns out to be a gun left from the war between Russia and Germany. Floyra, a young boy from the town, takes his treasure home because with this weapon he can now join the resistance, and stop Germany's invasion. His mother begs him to stay there with her but, he is full of pride and is taken away by the resistance soldiers who help themselves to farm animals.<br/><br/>Floyra is led to a camp where resistance troops, laugh and joke about their conquest as they make fun of Hitler. This will be one of two scenes of innocence and laughter in the film, because the twists and turns that occur through out this film are shocking and horrifying. The photography and landscape are sometimes soothing, until the Germans bombs saturate the forest in their quest to kill the resistance fighters. With this occurrence Floyra's life is turned upside down, and he will be forced to learn what ever it takes to survive the atrocities committed by the Germans. In addition, he does survive, but he is forever changed. I won't spoil the film by telling you all that occurs, but it is a must see. This film manages to affect all the senses, smelling, hearing etc. This telling of the bravery it takes to keep your sense of respect and honor is what this film truly reveals. I was not prepared for this film, as I am a devout fan of comedy. This is a film my professor prefers to show in each of his classes, and I agree that we should all see this eye-opening film of the fight that a little town with a big desire for freedom can accomplish. One more note is that the movie poster says it all, in just one photo."

By engaging all my five senses, I really felt what was happening in the movie. I also mentally prepared myself being warned beforehand that I would see and feel unpleasant things. I saw a totally un-glamorized version of war, which I have never seen before. It makes me proud and thankful for the people in the army for their bravery. Innocent people were being gruesomely killed left and right. I felt as though I was right beside Florya as all these horrible things have been happening. When it said that this was happening to 628 other villages in Russia, it pained me even more that this horrible specific event was happening to villages all around as well. In the midst of all this sadness, Florya and Glashas friendship was delightful to see. They stuck by each other's side and even at the end of the movie when they were separated, Florya thought of his love for Glasha when he saw the raped girl. I wondered how people, like the Nazis could kill people so heartlessly but unfortunately people are killed to this day. People must see this film because it is sure to change your life and make you think."

Even close-up shots, of some of the characters' faces, make me feel on edge, and even intimidated. What was going through my mind, while watching the film, was the depiction of war, and how others interpret it. Is war defined as bravery and courage, or suffering and insanity?

While we also get the perspective of the civilians within this war, and the grueling events that they are destined to face, the audience quickly receives the reverse montage that is shown to give a strong connection. Throughout the young boy's journey, he remains wondering why he wants to be part of a resistance, only to quickly grow up and develop his fast understanding of this war and how it is not about hate, killing, or victory but something more. The incredible sound effects and amazing camera positioning, really gives us the full dramatic feel that is going on, this keeps us at the edge of our seat to eagerly want to know if this young boy will make it past this torn world. At the end of the movie, we are following the resistance, then the camera turns to another path, leading the screen to show the development of snow on the trail, which possibly demonstrates the state of a Russian winter that has given victory to Russian territory in past wars. Thus giving the audience a sense of hope for this resistance, and how they will possibly prevail and preserve their homeland front.

And in the moments where you tell yourself that this is just a movie, in an attempt to make yourself feel more comfortable about what you are seeing, Klimov has a way of reminding you that this is real. For Klimov, as someone who lived through the war himself, this was a movie that he needed to make. I believe that any film maker that is so passionate about a film being made, along with Klimov's unbelievable talent as a film maker, makes this film even more outstanding."

Just like in ""Saving Private Ryan"", Klimov allows us to hear the deafening ringing from the characters perspective when bombs are dropped. Also, the scene where Florya and Glasha return to Florya's village, flies can be heard buzzing around, which then shows a scene of a pile of corpses.

He was really able to effectively encapsulate this tragic event through the use of disturbing sounds and horrifying visuals, though it's a movie that would pain me to sit through again. It's one thing to remember and reflect on brutal, historical events, but to be involved in them first hand(which is what the movie essentially does to you), is truly overwhelming for the psyche. A film like ""Schindler's List,"" on the other hand, is something I can sit through several times without feeling as 'mentally abused.' I recognize that this was exactly what Klimov wanted to evoke in me. His intentions were geared towards having me take part in this war alongside the films protagonist Florya.

Yet Come and See takes the viewer into closer proximity, integrating the observer within the Byelorussian villagers midsts as they are systematically terrorized and slaughtered by the Nazi regime. The film maker also utilizes a powerful sound design to mimic the effect of a bomb blast on unprotected ears and forces the audience to watch as a mass of people are slowly annihilated, ensuring that film going audiences for years to come will understand the horrors that arise from wars waged on nefarious grounds."

Besides those war movies which shows the big cities this movie is concentrates to the small villages, because there wasn't any other movie that would do the same. Perfectly shows that the age doesn't matter in war. You have to fight other wise you are going to die. I really like the idea how the director showed to the audience how much the war can change people, through the protagonist boy, Florja.

","This is an incredible film by Elem Kilmov, that takes us inside the truth incident of the world war 2 through a young boys eyes. It is not often I get affected by movies but this is certainly a movie that affected me and opened my eyes. It made me disgusted by the humanity. How can people be such savages towards each other especially towards innocent children, women and old people to lock them inside houses and burn them. I feel a huge sympathy for those people who were killed during this war. I think by doing this movie he expressed his opinions and emotions about the world war 2 through a young boy, because he was a kid when the world war 2 erupted. I believe that this movie shows the truth side of the war. I love the way the movie is filmed, because it makes you feel like you are a part of the movie. Like you are experiencing the incidents that the characters are going through. The camera movement and the iconic picture is so well done and intensive. The close up of the character catches the intensive emotion. The sound effect on the deaf boy makes you go inside his brain.You can feel the pain and confusion he is going through, like he is losing his mind. Even if this movie represent sorrow and cruelty I could still see some moments of joy. One scene in particular is when the character Glasha dances after the Germans bombarded their camp. It was a way for them to show that they are still alive. I think the message of the film has a good connection to the title. The title says it all, come and see how they German soldiers treated us, locked innocent and hopeless unequipped Soviet resistance in their house and burned them. The camera really takes you inside the cruelty of the world war 2. The cast of the film is incredibly talented. The music of Mozart that was used in this movie, lifts the film and gives it a powerful and beautiful sound. The soundtrack and sound is designed in a way to put us through a war so we can feel what the population during the war felt like. You can also through the music hear all elements of sorrow, horror, fear, darkness, despair and in a way happiness all at the same time. Do you think war is cool? Shooting and killing some enemies? Watch this film and then ask yourself the same question. I guarantee you that it will change your view of all the violence. It is an incredibly touching and great movie."

","Mind-blowing and wonderfully done. This thought-provoking film presents us with brutal and vivid images that take us into the violent reality of war. The viewer can nothing but witness a young man's experience in a world of destruction and despair, its loss of humanity in the face of the horror and trauma of war. ""Come and see"" is a mind-blowing visual, but most importantly, emotional experience, a play on human psychology that redefines what one accepts as believable. It gives us insight on the absurdity of war: the ingenuity that one can put in destruction, the pleasure that one can take in imposing suffering, the dehumanization of a fellow human being along with the trivialization of death. The brutality of these images pushes us to question ourselves: how could one possibly believe that this quest for power, war, is worth the relinquishment of our humanity? How can one possibly justify the atrocities of war? And how can we today, everyday, go on with our lives ignoring on-going similar atrocities?"

You lose grasp of you're reality and plunge yourself into this film. Once the chaos begins in this film it never lets you go. The viewer is put into a hypnosis or dream and there is no way out. To me this movie is one of the most powerful war films because of it's message. It doesn't glorify war at all. It brings war down to it's grittiest and most gruesome it could ever be. This movie made me feel the pain of these people engaged in this war. It made me feel anger that people brought this type of horror and destruction to humanity.

This one of those films that really brings past horrors to life. The director's imagery is sensational and the on location filming as done with perfection.

This movie is about 1 village out of hundreds that had to go through hell because of the Nazis. This movie didn't tell me anything i didn't know about the WW2 but it told the story from an other point of view, when most people think about WW2 they think of Jews and Nazis, well this movie is about what Russians went through. A lot more Russian people died then Jews during this war and the way the Nazis killed them isn't better then the way Jews were treated during this terrible war. This movie is a real chef d'oeuvre even in the slow scene of the movie they are filmed so realistically and you can tell that no scene is pointless. Some scenes last more then 5 min without a cut and you really feel like you are in the war, i would feel my heart beating faster and getting anxious while watching it. Sometime you feel like you need to hide from the bomb yourself even though you are sitting safe in you're living room. very incredible movie"

","Idi I Smotri or Come and See is a heart wrenching account of a boy's transmogrification from a giggly young boy to a veteran of the war. Based on 'The Khatyn Story' by Ales Adamovich, Come and See is director Elem Klimov's last movie in 1985 and arguably the best ever War movie. Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, The Pianist, and Der Untergang, to name a few of the critically acclaimed War movies, come a cropper when compared to this Aleksei Kravchenko starrer WW II movie, based on the extirpation of 628 Byelorussian villages and their inhabitants by the SS troops of the German forces in 1943. The movie starts in a desolate place that appears to be a former war zone, with a couple of young boys trying to salvage some useful arms, particularly a gun which is a guarantee for participation in the war against the Nazis. Throughout the 142 minutes, the movie is sure to keep the audience glued to the seats. The title of the movie suggests a trip not just for Florya (Aleksei Kravchenko) but also for the audience into one of the Byelorussian villages where morality, faith, life, freedom, happiness and humanity was guillotined. The movie depicts the graduation of Florya into an old warhorse even though it happens in a matter of days. Florya's reckoning with the environment that is out there to exterminate him, fill him with hatred, contempt and loathing for the Nazis as he continues his expedition into the realm of death and persecution in the backdrop of innumerable pograms. O. Yenchenko's music and the realistic camera work by Alexei Rodionov are in sync with the subtle use of countryside imagery by Klimov. The scenes are depicted just as the happen in reality without any unnecessary flamboyance yet the pograms are so malignant, sadistic and traumatic to render the use of the plethora of unbidden cataclysmic special effects inconsequential. Here I would like to take the reader on a pseudo-tour on the sets of Idi I Smotri. A lot of uniforms used in by the soldiers in the movie are originals; actor Aleksei Kravchenko in an interview revealed the use of real bullets in the movie, with the bullets sometimes fizzing past his head. Klimov planned to have Aleksei hypnotized by a psychotherapist during the most apocalyptic scenes so that they wouldn't affect his psyche, though Aleksei Kravchenko was unaffected by hypnosis and had to pretend all the way. According to New York Times review Idi I Smotri is a moviemaker's tour de force. The movie is an unremitting parable alongside the un-quenching thirst of chaining the world by the barbaric Nazis who considered themselves as the sole and worthy proprietors of the world. The film was initially named 'Kill Hitler' but because of its inappropriateness to the theme of the film it was later changed.<br/><br/>Idi I Smotri is an allegory that makes no bones about what Nazis did in Byelorussia; Florya symbolizing, the asphyxiation of human freedom and innocence. Two seemingly penny-ante scenes sum up the director's creed in this film i.e., the biggest casualty of war being the macabre carnage of innocence; in the first scene the partisan Byelorussian force is shown moving in the direction of the forest, to meet the Nazis while in the second, which also happens to be the last scene of the movie, the Byelorussian force is again moving towards some battlefield. These scenes per se appear a mundane extension of the necessary formality of continuity in the film, but on a different level these scenes depict the transmogrification of an individual, a country or humanity in general towards an irretrievable condition of hatred and muteness resulting from an inability to react with venom. In the first scene Florya is green as grass to the vagaries of war while in the last scene his position is taken up by a young boy who follows the marching Byelorussian force while Florya is giving went to his anger by firing wrathfully at Hitler's photo, before joining them on the road to redemption. In one line..Take a bow Master Klimov."

","One expression that exemplify my feeling upon seeing this film is ""shock and awe"", I mean really this is a true must see for war movie enthusiast and the anti war audience as alike. ""Come and See"" gives a realistic view of being in a war torn country without pointing a finger at whose good and who's bad because both sides are equally dis likable. They both have their motivations and in the middle of all the mayhem going on there are the people who are caught in between both sides.<br/><br/>The film is seen through the prospective of a young teen (Florya) who is disillusioned about the whole war situation in his country very early in the movie, as he chooses to fight alongside his fellow Russian nationalist troops and gets left behind to fend for himself. From this point in the film Florya is put through a literal hell on earth, having to find his way through the vast Russian wilderness and through various villages all the while avoiding Nazi capture and or worse.<br/><br/>Throughout the misadventures of Florya he is faced with all the horrors of the Nazi invasion along with all the rest of the Russian people. The stress is evident as the viewer can see him go through the metamorphosis from young idealistic teen to a hardened old man due to what he witnesses during the invasion.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is what a war at its best and not the glorious glamorization that we too often see in war movies. This film is a real eye opener and one of the best war movies I have ever seen. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but it is filled with all type of shocking images that one would expect during wartime, defiantly not for the easily offended or the squeamish so if you are planning to see this film selection you have been warned!!!"
"classicrocklover003","9","1","1","31 July 2011"," A Combination of Raw Realism and Artistic Surrealism
","Most people know the atrocities if WWII. It has been the subject of books, art and films since it's inception in the social consciousness. Although the story has frequently become a history book recital, what Klimov has done with his film ""Come and See"" makes a supremely profound impact on its cinematic viewers and changes the robotic understanding of one of the most painful times in world history. It is important to note the significance of the title, which comes from the biblical passage of the Apocalypse of John. In it, the beast teases John to look at the destruction of the Four Horsemen by whispering ""come and see."" This is the first powerful hint at the deep meaning of the film. Come and see refers not only to this biblical passage, but to the obvious destruction that Hitler ravaged upon the rest of the world. Hitler here, seems like the beast, bellowing to the world to ""come and see."" It is this manifestation of darkness and destruction that Klimov displays, and the artistry that Klimov uses to do so makes the film the masterpiece that it is. Florya, the protagonist of the story starts off as a naive boy, searching for a gun in an abandoned field, his mind filled with the glorified thoughts of war. As the film progresses, Florya's physical body, and especially his mental state, ages years, and the illusion of valiant fighting are replaced with the reality of the raw ""dirtiness"" of destruction and war. Frequently uncomfortable to watch, this film engages all th senses, you see the darkness of the world, smell the raw sulfur and gun powder in the air, hear the uncomfortable buzzing of the flies in the rotten world...it is almost unbelievable. The viewer wants to cry out, to make it stop, to turn away, but you cannot. Klimov displays something so captivating that regardless of how uncomfortable the trip of movie is, you feel obligated to fight through it, because you know, immediately that the magic of the film lies within. Cinematically, the composition is stunning. The mere use of the close-up, which in many films is flippantly accepted, is used in this film as a true testament of the emotional impact of its content. When we see close-ups of Florya's face throughout the film, we see his age progression and the callouses that have developed on his soul. It is not a cinematic trick or the power of makeup; it is clear that the actors of this film have forever been changed and aged by portraying the despair of the Belorussian villages during WWII. This film is not just another story of WWII, but it is a story of the humanism, or lack thereof, that the world can harbor and humans can release."
"perez_jessica_ivette","Null","1","1","30 July 2011"," Incredible war film
","This is an absolutely incredible war film I have seen. I enjoy watching war films and ""Come and See"" is yet to be the best. This film is taken place during WWII and is spoken in Russian. There was a lot of tension which took into place, showing how war really is. You can notice that this film is not comparable to any other war movie. The cinematography, soundtrack, hidden symbols, setting, as well as showing the audience from both objective and subjective point of views. The director did a fabulous job on getting all the small but yet important dynamics of the film. Watching this film had a strong impact on me because of what I just experienced, in reality that really happened.<br/><br/>The setting, without giving too much away, was set in several spots including the camp where they stayed. I felt as though each individual location had its own story behind what they were going through and we were experiencing with them as well The soundtrack, made me feel the close relationship between the film and I. Not having any soundtrack at all doesn't really say or make you feel as much than having music go along with the story. Many of these war films that I have seen didn't have a deep connection than what I felt with this film. However not only did the soundtrack have an impact on me but the sounds of the explosions and what they people were encountering was a huge impact.<br/><br/>The cinematography, showed many things that explain the story. Like many hidden metaphors and symbols. I don't want to give anything away unless you watch the film. In my opinion the last few minutes of the film was the most felt connection I had throughout the whole film. The cinematography overall was unbelievably done.<br/><br/>The title of the film originally was supposed to be called ""Kill Hitler"". I am actually satisfied they didn't keep that name and called it instead ""Come and See"". I see this title relevant to the story because not everyone knows exactly what happened during the war. Also calling everyone to come and see this film to experience what others did. In other words the story of what really happened. This is a beautiful artistic well done film."
"DorsaDavari","9","1","1","26 July 2011"," The title says it all, ""Come and See""
","Instantly when I hear World War II I think about the holocaust. I think about the six million Jews, who were mulishly murder. I think about how 2.8 million non-Jewish Poles risked their lives during World War II. I then think about how World War II was one of the deadliest wars ever with an estimated death toll of 62 to 78 million deaths. Come and See takes you on a very emotional journey about the story of a Belorussian boy, who is forced into the violence of war. It is an atrocious and brutal movie, but it is a story told like no other. We often see many movies about the Holocaust and Word War II, this movie is different. It is a coming of age movie about a young boy who is stripped of his innocence when he thinks he wants to join the Soviets.<br/><br/>We all know that war is a very hardcore and blood shedding scene. At first war is glamorized in Come and See, until Florya gets a taste for reality and really experiences war, but he continues to fight. This movie is very draining and emphasizes on the truth of World War II. We follow Florya until the end of the movie and we see an aged image of his face and we really realize how much impact the war had on this blameless kid's life. Klimov does not take any mercy on the audience and goes all out during the movie. There is a scene when the Germans are setting a barn filled with children and adults on fire and they are banging on the doors, fighting for their lives to escape. You cannot help but sit and cringe in your seat. To know that this really happened, that yes this is just a movie but during that time era the Nazis were murdering millions of people. What was more disturbing for me was when the civilians were getting burned to ashes; the Germans were laughing and celebrating. I could not help but think in what kind of unjust world we live in. After World War II we said ""Never Again"", but genocide still occurs. After watching Come and See I realized many new things about war. It opened up the door to the truth for me.<br/><br/>Watching Come and See I realized we cannot just blame Hitler for all of this mass destruction. This movie really opened p my views on the war and helped me understand World War II on a bigger scale. Now when I think of World War II I do not just think about the Jews, but everyone who was involved. Come and See is a great movie. it is very different, and it can be disturbing at times, but it is very moving and it changed my view on the war."

"reytakang","9","1","1","26 July 2011"," War, What is it good for?
","""Come and See"" was one of the most difficult movies to sit through that I've ever seen. Cinematically and story wise it pulled absolutely no punches. The director Elem Klimov chose to show us the most horrible aspects of war and does so in such a way that mentally our senses our assaulted by the gritty depictions of war time horrors. The constant buzzing of the flies I immediately understood to be a tell-tale sign of death and their constant buzzing became a harbinger of sadness and heartbreak. In this film death often comes suddenly and without warning. Just the way it does in a real war. Throughout the film we see the main character Florya go from a wide-eyed boy filled with optimism into a haggard shadow of his former self, seemingly aged decades from the horrors he's forced to witness and survive through. Ironically these hardships forge him into very type of soldier that the Nazi's wanted to snuff out. Those with the will to fight, but more importantly a reason."

","This movie is nothing short of amazing. Elen Klimov did a great job with this movie. It went right into the heart of the people that watch the movie. It is a very easy plot to follow, yet it takes you on so many emotional roller coasters that it keeps you on the edge of your seat. A lot of the music just takes you to another place as far as your emotions go. You cant help but feel for the main characters in the movie as they go thru some of the most heart wrenching deaths you could ever imagine. seeing people raped, shot, and even burned to death as you must stare and watch not being able to do anything about it. Yet thru all the adversity, florya still has the heart to go back into the middle of the fight and defend his country and fight for his family."
"DeathRiderDoom","9","1","1","13 July 2011"," Horrific & Stunning - a Masterpiece
","Absolute cinematic masterpiece.This soviet era surrealistic WWII film follows Florya, a young boy who lives in a village in Belorus, as he attempts to join up with Soviet partisan forces during Nazi occupation. What follows is perhaps immeasurable and describable by words. In one of the most vivid, haunting, and probably best war films ever made, we follow Florya as he experiences the psychological horrors and grim, horrific realities of ordinary people and their lives on the brutal Eastern front. In a film which is a masterwork of soviet era expressionism, nightmarish surrealism with vivid images which will become burned into your mind, Come & See is far from the heroic, romantic war cinema of (great) films like Great Escape, Where Eagles Dare, or even the stunning Longest Day. Hell, this superb masterpiece even makes Das Boot or A Bridge Too Far look like light-hearted romanticism. This film is a haunting nightmarish opera, absolutely overflowing in its creative genius and vision and technical proficiency. Cinematography is stunning. So many bold, mindblowing images, horrific scenes of Einsatzgruppen brutality are given a poetic beauty to them, while cameras flow intricately through them. Burning villages, savage slaughterings, soldiers emerging from the woods like ghosts and hysterical, blaring crowds pleading for mercy - this film weaves them all with godly precision. The music intertwined with surrealist imagery and perhaps the best sound engineering out of any film i've ever seen are both integral. The acting is moving with the hithereto unknown Aleksey Kravchenko exacting a mindblowingly horrific performance as the young boy Florya - who's expressions capture the sheer terror experienced by millions all over the Eastern Front. Technically brilliant, excellently scored and shot, emotional, horrific, brutal, surreal and vivid, this strange masterwork of a war film picks up and improves exponentially on works such as Apocalypse Now & Catch-22. Brilliant."
"vahak30","9","1","1","9 February 2011"," WAR, a psychological game of oppression and conflict.
","Elem Kulimov's thriller about war and human conflict is definitely a movie that will stick with the viewer undoubtedly forever. Usually war movies are done in either tow ways, one being the ""Saving Private Ryan,"" way of glory, valor, and determination; or in this case a more realistic and often actual representation of war, depression, despair, and hopelessness. The movie does a magnificent job at demonstrating the human psyche and outlook on life when war is upon one's country, the agony and distress shown by the protagonist (Aleksei Kravchenko) throughout the movie makes you cringe at every new scene. This movie in particular has such profound imagery that often times just a few seconds of frame at a particular image, (the back of the village) are enough to tell the entire story of both the people and the true nature of war itself. I felt that I was somehow being tormented throughout the movie, uneasy, moving around in my seat, in utter disbelief and disgust, realizing that the movie has almost direct parallels with actualities the war had. Klimov does an excellent job displaying the psychological effects of war on Floyra. The use of music excerpts fits perfectly with the movie. The moment the Nazis bomb the area Florya was first stationed we hear this deafening noise, we feel the emotions and feel like we are almost under attack ourselves. If an individual wants to see a movie where the true elements and identity of war is depicted, look no further than this, Come and See the true nature of the beast!"
"kristakibler","9","1","1","8 February 2011"," Florya becoming a true man in the eyes of World War II
","Elem Klimov's film, ""Come and See"" was an extraordinary realistic approach to the portrayal of the Soviet Union's struggle to survive during World War II. Klimov deserves all the recognition for creating one of the best honorable war movies of all time. Through his realistic stylistic attributes, the audience is able to fully indulge their six senses and develop a sensory overload that haunt your mind of the horrific events that will forever mark history. ""Are you crazy?!""-This is an amazing opening line of the film, that serves as an effective foreshadowing of what is to come. The intensity of ""Come and See"" is efficient through the use of reaction shots that allow viewers to feel for the actors as if they are in a trance. By shooting the actors at a ""through the lens"" glance, Kilmov is able to capture real humanistic expressions on their faces. Through these shots, the audience can unconditionally grasp an emotional awareness of what it could have been like to experience World War II for yourself. Also playing with your sense of smell, there is a scene in Florya's village where he returns only to find it has been completely wiped out by the Nazis. Florya and Glasha are sitting at the family table eating leftovers as flies infest the area. The elaborate buzzing of the flies leaves you cringing in your seat. The soundtrack and sound effects lead you through Florya's journey of survival while losing his home, family, hearing, and joining the Partisans. Through it all, he was able to redeem self-awareness and become a true man. Klimov's film is an intellectual montage. Consequently, the film is presented backwards putting focus on Florya's experience (the effect) first and then the dramatic closing scene of Florya shooting his rifle at a picture of Hitler (the cause). This way of montage allows you to fully focus on Floryas's ultimate challenge of finding a greater meaning and truth of life, without any glorifying aspects. In the beginning of this film, Florya is just a boy who dreams to become an honorable man. Through the film and through his experiences, does he actually come to terms with himself as a true soldier. In the end, you are now aware that Florya is a conscious man who isn't just fighting without cause. Now he is fully engaged and aware of Hitler's power and what it means to really fight in a traumatizing war."

","Come and See is one of the most powerful movies I have ever seen. Not only does it tell the story of the war between Russia and Nazi Germany but tells the story of millions of people in Byelorrusia through the story of a young naive boy. The ""naive-ness"" of this boy ironically enough is lost through the world of a war. The movie is full of close-ups and even scary images of what war can do to anyone even a young boy who is at the dawn of his life. The movie makes sure not to glorify war and violence but shows the horrifying effects. <br/><br/>Even though the movie is based on World War II it can still relate to todays events. War never seems to cease like the war in Iraq or Afghanistan. The soldiers over there aren't having a blast or being ""Army Strong"" they are fighting for their own lives. Watching their friends get shot. People dying. People crying. People asking for help. Going into the military just like the boy of ""Come and See"" without a clue of war truly is. <br/><br/>The movie is a masterpiece. It makes a statement. In war NOBODY wins not even if the newspapers say it or the losing side lost more soldiers. Lives are always lost and can only damage people not even if the soldiers survive the war they still have to live with it for the rest of their lives."

","Elem Klimov leaves no stone unturned and nothing to one's imagination in this film. The audience and the camera are invited to come and see with Florya and Glasha, a childhood gone awry with the horrors of war. Glasha invites you to visit the portal of death and Klimov follows Florya and Glasha like ""Hansel and Gretzel,"" as if the camera is an eye witness to what is happening; the audience and the camera have joined forces with Florya. The camera is no longer a camera, but a living, breathing person. We witness with Florya the non-stop suspension of his disbelief--the breakdown and breakthrough of a fourth wall every breathing moment of his life. We see, we feel, we hear for Florya.

"blastaneros","9","1","1","7 February 2011"," A young boy goes to war and struggles to hang onto his sanity and morality as he fights the Nazis.
","Not often do I see a movie so visually arresting that it becomes impossible to unsee it. ""Come and See"" is a spellbinding tale of innocence shattered by the inexorable, mechanical cruelty of war. The protagonist, Florya, wants to become a Partisan, a guerrilla group bent on stopping the advance of the German Fascists at any cost.<br/><br/>He is barely of adolescent age when the decision is made for him, and he is whisked off to war. Lagging behind due to the heavy weight of his gear, he meets Glasha, a girl with a near-prophetic intuition. Her presence gives the film a psychological clout reminiscent of German expressionism; much of the full horror of war is experienced subjectively, through her eyes. When a Nazi plane bombs the forest, Florya is temporarily struck deaf, forcing Glasha to catch the exposition ball. Her face twists in abject terror, and her voice is distorted to a mechanical whir, as she seeks shelter from the mayhem. Later on, when the two find their way back to Florya's hometown, we find it deserted, except for the remains of a stale dinner and his two sisters' dolls--all swarming with flies. Florya never sees the bodies of his entire village piled against the back of a house--yet the camera does, through Glasha's eyes. Klimov is a genius at conveying the sheer power of subjective, emotion-laced scenes like these. A major theme of the movie is the dehumanizing effect of war. Animalistic imagery reinforces this. At one point, we see a single cow, alone except for Florya and his comrades, in the middle of a field. Suddenly, machine guns open fire, and the cow is hit. She bellows in agony and sinks to the ground, convulsing and bleeding, before dying a slow, painful death. This symbolizes the expendable soldiers on both sides, who are driven like cattle off to war and die like animals, with no trace of human dignity. Soon afterward, the Nazis invade the rural village of Perekhody and herd every man, woman and child into a barn, again like cattle. The adults are then removed, with the children left inside. They torch the barn, children and all. We hear their terrible screams, and the door stretches and strains as they struggle to escape. The camera stares paralyzed at this atrocity, just as I was, from its sheer brutality. The Nazis proceed to torch the rest of the town with zero regard for civilians. It is a far cry from most Hollywood movies, which romanticize war as an act of chivalry and patriotism. Not Klimov. War is hell, and he drives this fact home with a hand as heavy as an anvil.<br/><br/>Near the end of the movie, the outraged Partisans corner the invading Nazi unit and secure them to a wall, similar to the innocent people of Florya's village. They, Florya included, debate whether to burn them alive, as they did to many of Florya's neighbors. Suddenly, the movie shifts to formalism: the color becomes sepia, and we see a dramatic montage of scenes from Hitler's regime. They begin with the emaciated, living skeletons of the concentration camps, and run backward in time to propaganda posters, Hitler's rise to power, and finally Hitler as a baby. Suddenly, a pang of conscience strikes them--if they burn the soldiers, they would sink to the same level as their victims. They would be war criminals as well. Florya raises his gun, which he has not fired once in the entire movie, to shoot the image of baby Hitler--but freezes. We realize that some humanity remains in him. In true realist fashion, the core of the movie is not its plot, or its setting, or its visual effects--but the complex, deep emotions that make the characters believable and easy to relate to. Highly recommended!"

"ktcryer","8","1","1","6 February 2011"," Klimov asks us why?
","Elem Klimov's ""Come and See"" captures the inner spiritual experience of being at war unlike any other war film I've seen. The innocence of the protagonist, 14 year old Floria is representative of our own unconsciousness of the realities of war. Floria takes us with him as war is forced upon his conscience for the first time in the most brutal, realistic, cold and hypnotic way. Just the same way we are misled by a false representation of soldiers as heroes, Floria's delusion of becoming a hero of war is quickly realized. His innocence is stolen forever and his spirit will be eternally crushed by the presence of the greatest evil man has ever come to know. Klimov captures the devastating monstrosity of the unfeeling Nazi troops as they round up Jews like sheep and celebrate the extermination of each and every one of the villagers. With scenes the viewer can almost smell, Klimov creates a very real experience as we feel the wounds this historic act of pure evil has left opened, gouging a deep hole into our history as a people. <br/><br/>The piece of the film I found most brilliant is the way Klimov captures the inner spirit of our protagonist Floria. His pure mind rapidly becomes flooded with images and memories of war that will crush even the strongest man's spirit into a million pieces. He witnesses genocide, he comes close to being exterminated alongside his mother and twin sisters and is captured and tormented by the Nazis. His inner world is portrayed through the external expression of his face. We see his skin age into petrified wrinkles and chapped skin while his eyes become glued so wide open that they can't possibly stretch any further as they try to take in the unfathomable hell on earth being created right before his eyes. <br/><br/>If only in a matter of weeks war can turn a young innocent boy into a grown man whose not only been through hell but still has to marinate in it, who can grow gray and have molded into his face wrinkles he should never have seen until the natural force of gravity etched them into his skin, then Klimov is showing us the insanity of violence and hatred, and the deep unforgiving destruction it births. He is asking us, why?"

The scenery in the movie, (much like the character) takes a drastic change as the movie progresses. Florya becomes traumatised by each of his battle experiences that by the end of the movie his face is beat up and drained of all hope and joy, much like the baron and crude landscape towards the end of the movie. The dialogue is limited to a couple of lines through the movie not much talking takes place. Instead we are subjected to a ringing noises and gun fire, as well as the silence of the Arctic tundra. I found it interesting how the visuals were unrelated to the sound. For example when Florya and Glasha first get hit with bombs the sounds of the forest are replaced by bomb explosion's and gun fire creating a collision of imagery and sound. What makes this movie so hard to sit through is the seriousness and honesty in each shot. There is no glorification in war and this film sets out to prove that. Even the protagonist himself is not glorified, instead he is tortured continuously by the harshness of battle, and fails time after time to engage in any heroic act. He is unable to save his mother, care for the villigers, or show mercy for the enemy. The one thing that really stuck in my mind about this film was the straight on camera shots of each characters face. At first this creates familiarity and a play-fullness as we travel with Florya through the whimsical forest in the 1st moments in the movie. We later get to know each character in a more intimate way, the head on portrait shots give us insight and clear vision of each persons expressions and gestures. So much so that we don't need much of a back story or dialogue. Their faces communicate much more than words ever could."

","The character change seen in this film, would be exactly how I would imagine a child would be after experiencing such a time in WWII. The child in the film is once seen as excited and thrilled by the idea of war, but immediately is thrown into a sickening, confusing and horrific world where there is no other option but survival. The imagery in this film is incredible. The impact it had on me while I watched this film nearly made me sick. It was brutal to watch but I was very thankful for that, no one wants to see the war sugar coated. The soundtrack was equally as impacting as it complimented what was going on on screen perfectly. The actor playing Florya did an incredible job at growing with the story as the boy did look about 25 years older in the last scene in the film. Absolutely brilliant."

","The interesting thing for me when I saw this film was that I could not decide whether I liked it or not. Of course I could see that it is a quality film with great actors, still, I felt so bad after watching it so I could not say that I enjoyed it. After thinking about it I realized that this is one of these films I liked but would never watch again. I think that he really made this film as a film about war should be. I have seen so many films about war where I enjoyed watching war happen in front of my eyes and if so, the film is probably not very realistic. In almost all film about historical wars, it seems like it was this fantastic great victory and everyone was happy. I think that Elem Klimov tries to show us that there are no such thing as a happy ending in wars. The people who experienced it will have scars for life. The reason why I felt so uncomfortable watching it was that he made it so real. I felt this panic all the time and as Florya tries to escape the Nazi's, I wanted to escape to. I think that this is what makes it so important, to tell us who never experienced war what it is really like. The film shows how war changes people, that it is not a game and that nothing good comes out of it."

You actually at times feel you are right along with him, in his shoes, aghast at the inexplicable displays of humanity at their absolute worst. It is unrelenting from start to finish.

","Ellem Klimov's masterpiece about the German invasion of Russia. This film truly captures the feeling of war. You can even feel the quick mud and cold weather in this film. One thing that is truly amazing about this movie is that although it is an anti war film(and the best, in my opinion), it doesn't whine about war and how the soldiers are treated(unlike ""Born on the fourth of July""); instead, it gives us the true feelings of the people who are under attack by others. I don't recommend this film for people who(like me) lived through these situations since it brings your most horrible memories in front of you. But other than that, it's highly recommended for people who are interested in cinematography and sound design, since it has some new ideas used in it."

While I'm sure other movies out there top Come and See as far as violence and artificial shock values go, Come and See is the real deal. War films tend to go toward either extreme subjectivity or for complete objectivity, which both have their uses, but Come and See blends the two together into something uniquely cinematic. War films come and go, with few of them leaving a mark on the audiences psyche. Come and See is a rough and wild ride that more than leaves a mark."

Elem Klimov definitely succeeds at demonstrating that war, truly is hell. <br/><br/>To me the movie demonstrated how fragile life really is and how casual death was at the time. People became highly desensitizes by all the terror they encountered. This horrific event is a part of the war which many people are not familiar with.

","This movie was very sad to me. It really brought out the true colors of the Nazis during WWII. I felt that most war re-enactments are too scared too show the gruesomeness that this movie showed with ease. The main character shows a true character arc. He is timid in the beginning. He is naive and scared, but after witnessing with his own eyes the destruction and death that has been brought over his people. He becomes obsessed with the fact that he feels revenge is the only way to get even against the Germans.Not to mention he looks like he aged about 30 -40 years through out the movie. Over all this movie is not for the faint of heart but if a person is looking for a movie that clearly depicts the horrors of WWII, this is the movie for them."
"m_para_dis","9","1","1","11 December 2010"," Definitely Worth Seeing
","Come and See is an unforgettable film about the horrors and atrocities of war. It's a quintessential anti-war film, and like all true anti-war films, this is not a glossy romanticized version of war. This is gritty and brutal and the landscape is strewn with blood and devastation.<br/><br/>The story follows Florya, a young and impressionable Byelorussian boy who joins the Resistance army during WWII. As his fellow partisans depart the camp to fight for their cause, Florya is left behind. What follows is an unbelievable journey of survival with images that are so grippingly terrifying they are forever seared into my memory.<br/><br/>One of the most touching and meaningful scenes in the film occurs near the end. Florya has carried a rifle with him throughout the entire film. As many times as death has confronted him, as many narrow escapes as he has made, he has yet to use his rifle. After so facing so much monstrosity, he is reunited with the partisans again. As they are about to depart, Florya encounters a portrait of Hitler in a puddle. He shoots the portrait and what follows is a sequence of montages playing in reverse, sliding back in time: concentration camp corpses; Nazi party congresses in the 1930s; Hitler in combat during World War I; Hitler as a youth and finally a photo of baby Hitler in his mother's lap. Florya doesn't hesitate to shoot after each sequence, but when he faces baby Hitler in the last montage, he is unable to pull the trigger. There is something so remarkably sad, tragic, and yet heroic in his inability to shoot baby Hitler. It's a display of Florya's humanity after everything that he's suffered thorough that is so expressive and evocative of emotion.<br/><br/>When Florya finally stands as a survivor at the end of the film, he has a choice to join the Resistance and not be left behind this time. It is as an informed man, instead of an impressionable boy, who has earned the right to fight, that he trails off with the partisan forces."

So brilliantly done that it has impacted the way I look at war in general. I love how Klimov made the beginning at an easy going pace showing bits of happiness and joy, but then the movie took a complete turn and became so disturbing and outrageous. I had my hand over my mouth and my eyes began to water at times and I just kept thinking about how horrible everything that was happening to this poor boy was. I kept thinking about how sad it is that humans are capable of doing such horrible things and after the movie I felt really distraught and sad.

","The title of this extraordinary film is borrowed, appropriately, from the biblical Book of Revelations, and the apocalyptic vision it presents of a Russian village destroyed under the advancing juggernaut of Hitler's 1941 blitzkrieg certainly ranks among the most horrific depictions of wartime madness ever recreated on celluloid. The story follows a young Russian boy separated from his partisan brigade, and tracks his slow descent into insanity as he witnesses one atrocity after another, until Nazi soldiers finally herd him (and, by extension, us) into a crowded peasant church and set it ablaze with flamethrowers. After several long, ominous establishing scenes the pace builds with feverish intensity to the climactic moments of annihilation, a tour de force of camera-work and editing apt to leave a permanent scar on the viewer's nerves. Faint-hearted patrons are advised to stay away: this face-to-face confrontation with the stark brutality of modern warfare is gut-wrenching stuff indeed."

","Come and See is an incredible tribute to World War II and had political implications in 1985 when it as made. The constant chaos within the movie is symbolic for what could have happened back in 1985. A nuclear war could have broken out and engulfed the entire world in the same type of destruction that was demonstrated in the movie. It would really be a total war. One of the downsides of the movie is its bias. It shows the entire German army as villainous an heartless. The only signs of emotion are shown to simply make the movie more believable. The Soviet troops in actuality were probably just as brutal as the Germans since both sides were pulling out all the stops. However, since this movie is a tribute to the defeat of the Germans, it is indeed logical to make them look as atrocious as they were shown."

","This is a masterpiece of war movies. Come and See takes us with the main character, Florya, to another ""world"". We can feel those character pains and struggles. Come and See is the warranty that we fight for no reason, and while in war our life have no meaning, and we give up our lives in order to fight for reasons that ""have no reason"". The psychologist horror is more painful to watch than the physical violence. The movie is so real and ""touches"" all of the audience senses that we forget that we are actually just watching a movie. In my opinion, the end of the movie is absolutely brilliant, superb. Watching the ""flashback"" of Hitler's life until his picture as a baby, a baby just like many other that died because of him and his Nazi's ideals."

","I absolutely loved Come and See. I found its new point-of-view on war a breath of fresh air. Furthermore, this film to me was more true to exactly what war causes to the psychological condition. Although perhaps director Elim Klimove did not set out to create a horrifying/scarring film about the injustices that occurred in Byelorussia. In fact, he does two great things in this film. He really makes the audience reflect of the horrors/tragedies of war as well redefine the war film genre entirely. What most affected me was the exact terror that the Nazi regime committed. As the film ends it informs us that the massacre that occurred in that village happened over 600 times just in the tiny area of Byelorussia. This made such a huge impact to me. Of course I had heard of the immense numbers of casualties of the war, but it took it happening to one small village for me to understand the atrocities. Something the director I feel achieved greatly was making the audience feel as though they were there in the battlefields with the main character Florya. This was done through great special effects along with dramatic sound effects. The experience of this film is unforgettable and in my eyes overrides countless films that glorify war."
"benbrownstein","8","1","1","31 July 2010"," Ben's Review of Come and See, Incredible Film
","Come and See is incredibly shot. The film incorporates rich style in its shots. It appears to have soviet montage elements to it. This is visible in the precise editing and credits. Beautiful Locations, especially the forest scenes. The scene in the forest where the protagonist and his lady friend were shaking the trees in the rain is an example of an incredible scene.<br/><br/>The Social interactions between characters is groundbreaking and completely original. When our protagonist finds his lady friend in the forest, she is crying, he begins to cry. They are quite a physical distance apart. Both are shot back and forth with a long lens. Its really interesting how they begin crying, then laughing, then crying, then laughing, with very little speaking, defiantly one of the more trippy scenes.<br/><br/>Overall the film made me feel emotionally disgusted of war. Our protagonist started out as a child playing with his childhood friend, and ended up as a survivor. His face aged throughout the film, from all the stress he endured from surviving. He had close calls to his death, from being locked in a building with women and children that was about to be burned down, to a nazi officer holding a loaded pistol to his head for a photograph, I can only imagine what he felt, and it makes me feel sick to my stomach to fathom it."

","I enjoyed this film. You really get to understand the struggle and pain of the Russian people against the Nazi Germans. It didn't have this patriotic energy in this film for the viewer which I liked because you get to see the difficulties of war instead of just the victories of one, like in Saving Private Ryan. If I had to see which group was the Ant/Pro in the film. I would say the Russian army and people were the Antagonist and the Nazi's were as the Protagonist, because the Germans were in control of those towns, but that's how I saw it.<br/><br/>What also made it nice was not really talking about the politics of why the Nazi's invaded Russia. But instead the methods and ways they took control of each town. This was showing the frustration and anger of how the Nazi's invasion was getting more and more popular for the average man ""the Russian farmers in the story"" to rise up and fight. Even if they didn't even know anything that was happening with their government to fix the problem, anything about what was happening in Moscow, or even anything that was happening in the town next to them, which I enjoyed."
"abigail-juaner","10","1","1","30 July 2010"," Come and see a boy who was robbed off of his youth and was forced to be a man through the horrors of war.
","Come and See aimed to tell not just another story of WWII, but the one that we have probably missed to recount. The Nazi occupation of Belorussia was almost overshadowed by the accounts of Holocaust, nevertheless, it was as tragic as the latter's story. This is not about the heroics of a few soldiers or the betrayal of a comrade. This is the story of the witnesses and casualties of war, the ones who were left unarmed and defenseless from extreme brutality. Elem Klimov's portrayal may not give you the adrenaline rush caused by heavy action fight scenes and he may not have shown a lot of bloodshed, but without a doubt, he will make you weak. He left me psychologically exhausted. The excellent sound design which gave a feeling of turbulence throughout the film will leave you in discomfort almost as if you were being assaulted. My senses were abused. The excruciating face of Florya, the image Glascha saw at his home and the whole scene of the village burned were all unforgettable and haunting. I was traumatized. Klimov's way of storytelling is not simply by making you watch it unfold, he will give you a sense of almost being there right beside Florya. And together, you are both scarred and changed for life. <br/><br/>This film is the epitome of anguish and madness brought about by war. It will remind you that when the war is over and done, there are physical and psychological wounds that will never heal and there are boys and girls who will never be children again. What I appreciated most about Come and See is that it was not your typical glamorous war film. It stayed true, closest to the heart of the story it wanted to tell."
"pyepeeler","Null","1","1","29 July 2010"," Nazi German Oppression from Russian Point of View
","Elem Klimov's _Come and See_ is a horrific odyssey into World War II, taking place in Russia and told from the perspective of a country-bred, teenage boy - Florya (played by Aleksei Kravchenko).<br/><br/>As we are drawn along Florya's journey, we are subjected to various acts of unspeakable violence by Nazi German officers – the slaughtering of a village, rape of a teenage girl, a mass of people being burned alive.<br/><br/>Klimov's decision to tell this story through the eyes of a naïve adolescent allows the audience to experience the Nazi German occupation of Russia as an ordinary person living in Russia might have. The situations and circumstances the boy witnesses for the first time are also things the audience, most likely, is seeing for the first time. Florya is our entryway into the Russian's experience of World War II. He is our connection to this time period.<br/><br/>Florya's perspective enables us to sympathize with Russia's attempt to fight off Nazi military forces; also, it enables us to see, first-hand, what Nazi soldiers were really like, how they acted, the content of their conversations, their attitudes toward their enemies, their reasons for military aggression.<br/><br/>As I watched _Come and See_, I was deeply unsettled by the scenes and the raw emotion which seemed to pervade the entire scope of the movie. It almost plays like a documentary, with a hidden camera following Florya along his journey.<br/><br/>Another noteworthy aspect of the film was the fact Florya maintains his essential humanity despite the brutality and abject circumstances he finds himself in because of the Nazi soldiers' actions. I believe Klimov made this decision to maintain the audience's empathy and rapport with the character. If Florya had decided to go on a rampage and begin furiously murdering already wounded Nazi's, I believe our connection to Florya would have been severed and, hence, a loss of interest or, at least, a detached viewing of the remainder of the movie may have been the result. Florya's goodness (despite his flaws), keeps us on his side.<br/><br/>As I walked out of the lecture hall after finishing _Come and See_, I felt gratitude for the fact I live in the United States, a nation in which freedom is protected and homeland security is a top priority. At least for the rest of the night, everyday concerns (like the issues which pertain to being a minority in a white-dominated area of Los Angeles, or wanting to know if the Dodgers had won) fell by the wayside – they had lost their power over me. I was glad to be alive."

","Come and See Review by Dean Gold WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>There were three stand out scenes for me in Come and See. <br/><br/>The scenes of the airplane bombing early in the film were the most harrowing I have ever seen in a movie. I had never seen anything that seemed so ""real"", so it was no surprise to learn that the only that to make it look that real is to really drop actual bombs from planes. It is still incomprehensible to me how the filmmakers got away with this legally and how they could actually count on the actors not getting maimed or killed. The same goes for the cow field scene where they used live ammunition which was more effective then the best executed CGI could ever do. Also the crawl through the swamp was shot in a way that made it clear it was really happening and again I wondered how the filmmakers knew the actors wouldn't sink down and suffocate in that bog. How Klimov expresses Florya's deafness in the aftermath of the bombing made me cringe in its effectiveness.<br/><br/>I don't think I'll ever forget the scene of the Nazis burning the barn full of people. Words cannot express the feeling. It should simply be seen. The most searing image in my brain is the shot of the Nazi woman gluttonously feasting on lobster with delight as men, women and children were burned alive by the Nazi murderers destroying the village. Later, when Florya sees her twisted and twisting on the ground dying a painful death, I confess I relished it, though Klimov may have intended anything but that.<br/><br/>Finally, I come to the scene where the Russians capture some of the commanding Nazis. It's hard to choose between what is more maddening: The disgust worm-like sniveling of the Nazi who tries to find sympathy from the Russians about to kill him or the Nazi who sticks by his ""you deserve to die"" convictions. This scene was as sickening and suspenseful as it gets.<br/><br/>The major issue that detracted from the film for me was the lead. It was no surprise to me to learn that Alexei Kravchenko who played Florya was not a real actor at the time. His unconvincing performance often took me out of the film, but he did a good job considering that he was a first timer."

","I have seen many, many war movies throughout my life time, but this film has got to be the one that will remain in my memory forever. As I was watching ""Come and See,"" I felt like a character in the movie. It was like I could smell the fires and explosions that were occurring non-stop throughout the film. This has got to be one of the most powerful movies ever made. It also is one of the most horrific coming of age movies ever. I imagine that individuals who are pro-war would also be very affected by this film. In the beginning Floyra, the protagonist in the film, starts off by trying to find a weapon which obviously shows his love and desire to be in war; however, towards the end of the film, after he has experiencing all the hardships that comes as a result, his desire to be in war is no longer evident. We, as an audience, end up having the same feeling as Floyra towards the end. The audience is rendered much like Floyra that we watch with pleasure as Floyra symbolically destroys a picture of Hitler. I like that Klimov's style of shooting in the movie allows for the actors to look directly at the camera, as if the viewers are part of the movie. Klimov does an amazing job of showing us the story through the eyes of the characters. I was astonished by the acting in this film. I have never seen such marvelous acting. This helped drive the film forward. Although this movie may be brutal and too much content for some viewers, i still recommend seeing it. The brutality is there to show us what war is truly like.

","This movie had a lot of formalistic aspects to it where the snow symbolize the defeat of the nazi's and the sky symbolize the continuation of life and spirituality in the movie... This movie uses suspension of disbelief to give the audience the realistic sense that it is happening and that it did occur. Which gives the movie a more impactful sense to resonate the viewer to understand the cruel harsh world that the war brought to the innocent people who had to suffer at the hands of the nazi's. It was a good movie and had a lot of good points like when the protagonist was shooting at a photo of Hitler yet he had never killed anyone before in his life, so losing his family and all that had happened up until that point brought him to change and become like that."

As soon as the film started and his voice was so raspy and creepy that I thought this movie was going to be much more dreadful then it really turned out to be. <br/><br/>""Come and See"" was such a powerful movie and sent me through an emotional roller coaster. In the beginning of this story you see a 12-year-old Florya(Alexi Kravchenko),who is willing and excited to join and fight for his honor. It takes you through his raw journey of his process of being hardened through this war. <br/><br/>He stumbles across Glasha and they are immutably bonded with her by the explosions, which leaves him temporarily deaf with a horrible hum that is throughout the movie. This is when things started to get odd. They go back to the village where he was from to see his mother and finds an unsettling mound of bodies..""Come and See"" is a deeply raw and dark film. Watching this movie and watching Florya go through these struggles there is a sadness and a feeling of stress. This is a movie where you use all five of your senses. I could not just relax and enjoy this movie without it pulling me into the rawness of this war. The acting was beautifully done, and they really bring you into this movie and make you feel everything they experience.

"tulame","8","1","1","7 June 2010"," Beautiful, Gruesome, and Tragic
","I do not like war movies. In fact, I believe that all movies should have a happy ending. I suppose the fact that Florya survives is this film's version of a so-called happy ending, however, as this is based on WWII, a happy ending does not make sense. <br/><br/>The scenes that resonate with me are the most humanistic. In the beginning of the film Florya attempts to make his two twin sisters laugh prior to him joining the Soviet Partisan forces as his mother attempts to convince him to stay. This causes me to believe that not only did he not comprehend the severity of the situation, but he also wanted his little sisters to remain calm. Before leaving, one of the officers pointed out that the girls were identical, this foreshadows the difficult times and ultimate death of the family, as the Nazi party did testing on twins during the Holocaust.<br/><br/>The most beautiful scene in the film was after Florya and Glasha realized they were abandoned and they came across each other, both in tears. The wonderful part of this film was how evident human emotion was depicted. However, Glasha's expressions elicited confusion on my behalf, as at times I thought she went mad. Unfortunately the beautiful scene of them in the forest was ruined by bombs being dropped. This caused me to question how they filmed the scene. The saddest scene to me was Florya's desperate attempt to find his family by working his way through a bog, and the moment when Glasha concluded he was mad as she saw the stacks of murdered bodies. <br/><br/>As the film comes to a close, Klimov creates a montage of photographs and scenes of Hitler and the Nazi party. The last photograph is Hitler as an infant, which may depict that evil is a trait taught by society and that people are inherently good, or quite possibly the opposite. The fact that in the last scene Florya sees snow parallels how the Nazi's were extracted from the Soviet Union, not by human strength, but by the brutal winter. <br/><br/>Overall, this is not a film I will see again, however it is a good depiction of the Nazi's attempt to conquer the Soviet Union during WWII, especially with a personal perspective."

Although the movie is gruesome and has a very real war-like feel to it, I believe that this is what makes it so beautiful, telling the story without trying to hold back from emotions. I think a great movie is one that can manipulate your emotions to the will of the director/writer, that just goes to show how much thought went into this film.

I love how this movie tastes and smells and sounds and feels and truly moves you from your seat. In the dire moments of the film I caught myself almost swatting away the flies; Elem Klimov truly puts you in the shoes of various characters.

It dug that knife so much deeper when we sat aghast and in horror at the fate of each character. The image of Hitler as a child that sunk into my thoughts and resonated into my mind; I remembered the comment an SS Officer had made about Russians and how the so-called unraveling began with the children. I immediately saw the correlation between the two, somewhat agreeing with what he was saying but in the completely opposite direction. To be as rotten as Hitler I truly believe that no amount of life suffering could have amounted to justify genocide. Everyone has troubles and lament in one way or another; Hitler is a perfect example of how bad seeds start as kids. What I had trouble recognizing was the immense disdain that previously discussed SS Officer had for communism. The thread that conversation had originally sparked from stemmed from the manipulation of asking the adults to leave all children in the barn, unknowingly to be burned to cinder. Only a monster would be able to do such a haunting and sinister act, thus why analyzing any SS Officer and Hitler himself would be as progressive as running in circles. I feel the most pivotal moment for Florya in the entire film, aside from shooting the picture of Hitler, was when he entered a reenactment of what he missed in his hometown into the second village. He was an outsider, a participant who outwardly glanced at the slaughter. It was almost as if the village was composed of sheep versus humans, constantly catering to the Germans every step of the way. It was in this moment Florya truly realized the grand scheme of the situation and that it was on a massive scale. Truly inspiring. I went from hating war post-""Come and See"" to making a beeline to the WW2 section in the library."

"clara007","10","1","1","3 August 2009"," The most realistic WWII film ever
","""Come and See""(Idi i Smotri) is a magnificent film by Russian filmmaker Klimov made during the Cold War. It tells the story of a young Byelorussian lad called Florya who decides to join the rebels fighting against the Nazis during WWII. The day he arrives to the camp, situated in the middle of a forest, it is bombed and he, along a girl named Glasha miraculously manage to survive. Right after the bombing, Klimov (who uses Eisenstein like cuts in this scene) sucks the audience into the story, taking them inside Florya's head, hearing, experiencing his suffering and his descent into madness.<br/><br/>It is not a movie for the weak of heart. We see Florya experience in a couple of days what most people never go through in their whole lives: surviving a bombing, being shot at, seeing an entire town burned alive, seeing a woman who looks like Glasha raped (the most shocking image of the whole film, I literally had to look away) and finding his own family dead. That is made evident by his face at the end of the film where he looks more like a 60 year old than the young man he was at the beginning. That final scene where he finally shots the picture of Hitler with the rifle he has been carrying around for the entire movie while Mozart's Requiem plays and we see Hitler's life depicted in images going backwards until his birth is one of the best scenes in film history.<br/><br/>What also makes this movie great and different from WWII movies is that the 5 senses are at play, including that of smell, which is present when Florya and Glasha drag through the mud when escaping Florya's village. The techniques shown here have been reproduced many times in Hollywood WWII movies like Saving Private Ryan and makes, between other things, ""Come and See"" is a must see film for anyone who enjoys war movies, but remember, be ready to be tortured for the 2 and a half hours the film lasts, even more, you won't be able to sleep that same night, I know I didn't."

A paralyzing view which shows the unpublished secrets of the war, and the side most important and compelling amongst the madness; the innocent.

","Do not watch this movie light heartedly, possibly with a alcoholic beverage (it might help ease the pain). Klimov does an amazing job of jolting the audience and showing how close to annihilation we were when the Nazi's were trying to take over. Set in Byelonessia 1943, a little boy is digging in hopes of finding guns or grenades that have been left behind. He finds a rifle, which he is so happy about, but doesn't realize the events that have been set by him now trying to be a solider. Klimov does an excellent job of showing ""glasnost"", creating a vertical relationship with the audience, and a holds no bar kind of feeling. The audience experiences everything with the Flor, from his hearing loss when the bombs go off, to swimming through the mud. You feel disgusting and want a shower as you watch this. All and all though, it is the triumph of the human spirit that shines through. Flor is put into unimaginable situations, where he must survive, grieve his family members who have all be killed, and become an adult before he is fully ready. There is a scene, where Flor finds bandages, and tries to bandage his rifle (as if that is going to fix it) but it is from a little boy's mentality who is obviously not really ready to take all this on. The Hitler Montage in the end, is perfect way to create another vertical relationship with the audience. It starts with images of men found in Nazi camps, and runs through everything down to the baby picture of Hitler. It makes you question and think, babies are suppose to be harmless and adorable. But this baby is responsible for killing thousands and thousands of people!"

","Such an intense film. What struck me most when watching ""Come and See"" was that it really made me experience what it must be like to be surrounded by war; to have it in your own back yard. The last war that was fought actually IN the United States was the Civil War (us fighting ourselves nearly 150 years ago). Of course, how can we understand what it's like for people in Iraq when we come into their country and bomb their homes and kill innocent people (sometimes women and children) in the process? Unlike ""Saving Private Ryan"" and many other war films that use extensive choreographed battle sequences, ""Come and See"" manages to show the horrors of war without glorifying violence at the same time. Through the use of incredible young actors and devastating scenes that engage all the senses, ""Come and See"" causes the viewer to lose their own innocence and gradually question their own sanity as they share Florya's journey into the agonizing horrors of war. I can't imagine anyone seeing a film like this and still advocating unnecessary wars like the one in Iraq."

","Come and See is an astonishing film that shows how a young boy ages in front of the camera. This young boy instead of being able to enjoy his youth, he grows up going through what an adult soldier goes through as if it was a grown man trapped in a kids body. It is a film where the plot is almost unpredictable. When I first saw it, I thought Flyora was going to get caught and be drag to a horrible place. In almost every scene I thought that he was going to either get killed or tortured. To my surprise, Flyora was never caught. Somehow out of experienced grown ups, this young boy survives to witness everything that surrounds him. This is a great film but at the same time it is a film that is painful to watch. It shows pretty harsh, yet true, scenes that makes you feel this nauseous feeling. Overall I consider this film as an eye opening to people that might have a different concept of what it is to fight in a real harsh war."

","Brilliant War-based movie, in the eyes of a child who was forced to grow up. There is a paradox there however, as the child was very eager to put a rifle on and go to war- little did he know that his worst nightmares were yet to come his way. His tasks throughout the film add to his growing character, and touched me in a way that most movies do not. I especially enjoyed the part where he was dragging through the deep sinking mud, as this was actually said by the director ""go ahead and go across, i'll just film"" ( not in those exact words.) He matures throughout the movie and it is apparent in the look of his eyes. Through the evil things the Nazis are doing to innocent people, and he was one of the lucky ones to survive. It also says a lot about his character when at the end they have captured some Nazis, and he decided to shoot the picture of Hitler instead of the actual prisoners. Very well thought out movie, and I would recommend it to those seeking an action filled film."

I have seen similar movies, such as Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and Defiance, but what made it more compelling is the main character and his point of view and growth within the movie. The movie primarily focuses on the main character, Florya and his growth within the war. The filmmaker highlights Florya's 5 senses to leave a mark with the audiences on the actualities of the tragic event. At the end we are left with the feeling we have been through what Florya has been through. What affects me the most was the ending, when an old looking Florya shoots the picture of Adolph Hitler and the jump shots of Hitler from his recent times moving backwards till he was a baby. What I understood from this scene was that with every shot he fires we see Hitler's image move backwards in time, I understand that Hitler began as an innocent child with no education of war, which mirrors Florya from the beginning of the movie, when his mom says that he is only a child. I also noticed that the filmmaker also stresses images of children and babies throughout the war, in mind that we children symbolizes life and innocence. This movie will blow your mind."

It presents events as remembered, not as recorded, a movie of memories: not as experienced in the sense of the audience seeing or hearing what the protagonist sees or hears - but seeing events in the form they take in a person's mind, with all the power and flaws of human memory. The film is therefore episodic, disjointed, lacks scenes that would explain, has scenes that go on for a long time, lacks a story-line, shows events in a seemingly haphazard manner and at times makes little or no sense. These are the ragged memories of a boy who starts out naive and full of patriotic intentions, but by the end has possibly lost his mind. The memories of a half-mad traumatized boy in the form of images he has had seared into his mind. This is the best anti-war movie I have ever seen."

","""Come and See"", the title of the Elem Klimov's brilliant psychological horror war picture can be definitely noted as a precursor for many of today's epic war pictures. The combination, of sight and especially sound, can bring one to feel as if they were living in war torn Belarus. The image of patriotism and the disillusionment is one to be taken home with, and thoughts are left to question acts of war and conquest. In today's day and age, with the recent speak of North Korea casing nuclear weapons, many are left to question whether it is freedom we long for, or warfare. 'Come and See,"" tells the story of a Russian boy, Floyra, who is prepared to confront the Nazis and become what he has dreamed of, a heroic patriot for his country. But soon does this innocent youth discover is that war is no petty game of guns and bullets, but a world of gruesome imagery, violence, death, loss of innocence, torment and ultimately hate for other another people. The world Floyra discovers is a world of loss, betrayal, hunger, thirst and the encounters with men and women who gain selfish freedom by the death and murders of other innocent families. A key moment in ""Come and see"" is the scene in the forest where he discovers Glasha, another girl who was left behind by the army. Upon meeting her in a morbid state, German airplanes attack their port and they run for cover and escape. Elem Klimov directs this scene with wonder in that you come to hear the perspective of Floyra, who has gone deaf as the bombs come under fire. There is nothing but a mere haunting mumble of noises with voices that sound stretched out and yawning. Elem Klimov shows his mastery to not only interweave good imagery, but great sound so that it's screeches stay with you, breath by breath. Quite possibly one of the most horrific adaptations of the Nazi War era crimes, Come and See does exactly what its title states, ""Come and See"" a life so diseased by the acts of war."

The most terrifying things that happen in this movie, are left up to the viewer to imagine. This, I think, is an amazing way to get into the audience's head and under their skin. You do not see the people burning in the barn, you just see the barn burning. Yet we were just in the barn, and even though we escaped with Florya (the main character) your heart is still racing because you feel as if you were in the barn with the rest of the people. You can't smell a movie, yet you gag at the revolting stench of the swamp or dolls in Florya's house. Your not a character, yet you are scared for your life at the sight of the pile of bodies, you feel amazingly luckily not to be blown to bits by a mine. You've only meet the German minutes before (and you my think of yourself as a decent human being a would never do anything the Nazis did) but you clench your teeth, praying to see them burn to death, and you are almost broken hearted when they aren't.

","This has become one of my favorite war movies. The face of the protagonist still echos in my head as he watches a church full of people burn to the ground; or as he realizes that his family has been murdered; or in the most intense and abstract of scenes, when he gazes down upon the picture of Hitler and fires his gun for the first time as a mélange of war footage is interwoven with his disturbed expression. Many times throughout the film Klimov's use of sound creates an intense overwhelming feeling which almost literally makes me feel the anxiety that the characters must be experiencing in the scene. A good example is when the protagonist realizes his family is dead and unites with the surviving villagers. There is an effective use of disorienting sounds that really do start to make you feel like the world is collapsing around you. What sticks with you the most after seeing this movie is probably its depiction of the reality of war. In so many ways this movie puts Saving Private Ryan to shame (still an awesome movie) where we get a bunch of high paid heads to make us ""feel"" for them through acting. Rather, in ""Come and See"" we get the opposite, very few, low paid actors. The ""feel"" then comes from the directing style and the directors voice."

Florya is accompanied by a girl named Glasha after he is called upon to help the Russians defend themselves from the Nazi invasion. Due to circumstances beyond their control, these two young individuals are forced to wander the Russian wilderness while, at the same time searching for Florya's family. Florya and Glasha fight for their survival as they witness the death of many villagers. Their encounters allow the audience to witness the physical and psychological horrors brought upon by the Nazi's invasion of Byelorussia. Florya, after finding other survivors and finding out that his family is dead, realizes that he is temporarily deaf and goes off with a support team in search for food to help the other survivors. During his journey, he encounters appalling experiences as he tries to stay alive. The boy, Florya, continues to keep his life through pure luck as his life is spared over and over again.

","""Come and See"" was a very difficult movie for me to watch. Some of Klimov's scenes were so realistic they were frightening and made my stomach turn over and over again. The movie expressed how impersonal the warfare was during WWII. The scenes that stood out for me the most were 1) the burning of the people in the barn, 2) the bodies that were stacked against the house, 3) when Florya shoots the picture of Hitler.<br/><br/>The first two scenes that I mentioned are difficult to watch because they are so monstrous. Klimov demonstrates a very tasteful measure of restraint and doesn't show much of the scenes, but he leaves the majority of it up to the audiences' imagination, which is probably worse. The bodies stacked against the house were only shown for a matter of seconds, but your mind is so focused on them that it takes forever! Not to mention, right after that scene the audience encounters the man that was burned alive. The makeup was very realistic and it is very difficult to keep your eyes on the screen.<br/><br/>One of the last scenes of the movie when Florya shoots the picture of Hitler over and over again is probably the most prominent and realistic images in my mind, yet it is ironic because it was the most formalistic and unrealistic scene in the movie. The sequence disrupts space and time, but because I knew that the stock images of Hitler were authentic and that all of the destruction of WWII was because of him, it weighed on my mind and on my heart twice as hard as the rest of the film. I amounted all of Florya's pain and frustration into those pictures and was all for Florya shooting the picture, but then when Florya doesn't shoot the picture of Hitler as a baby it makes you question your own morality.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was put together very well, and although the content is difficult, it is a movie worth watching."

","This was probably one of the most touching movies I have ever watched. It is one of those that can change your point of view in a lot of aspects. Sad movies have this power a little more than the happy ending ones. It is a lot like life, which fits the real life scene that the movie depicts. <br/><br/>During the Second World War, Flor, a Byelorussian finds a buried gun from WWI around his village, which allows him to fight the war like his dad. This boy not older than 15 is doomed without even knowing. Leaving his mom and little sisters at home, Flor leaves to a psychological and physically violent experience, against the will of his mom and dad, who had told him to stay and take care of the family while he is fighting the war. The adventure starts with him already being beaten by the recruiters on the way out of the village. From there and on his life becomes gradually more carelessly empty. He meets Glasha, a girl that is at the same base he goes to. These two meet and they are director Klimov's entrance to the whole psychological aspect of the war on people. <br/><br/>The fine line between their innocence and the corruption of their surroundings is a constant contrast in the movie. When they first meet out in the fields, they go through a bombing attack by the enemy. That makes have to stay together and take care of each other. They stick to their innocence and make plans. The violence around them is clear and the image of the plane in the sky (in between scenes) always predict something bad that's about to happen. However, after the bombing the two are alone in the woods with a mysterious big white bird. The bird made me feel more comforted and hopeful that their lives would get better as the movie went along. Wrong. They try to be together and away from the war. Wrong again. They go back to a vandalized village where a 2 second scene of corpses piled up by Flor's old house say a lot and hit the viewer like a punch on the stomach. That combined to the subtle indicators of violence around the house such as the blood stains on a little kid's toy on the floor. At this point Flor, already deaf from the first bombing, goes mad. <br/><br/>The amount of hate this boy witnesses makes him slowly detached of any human/love values and he just wants to fight this thing that's caused him so much suffering. Another strong scene is when Flor is back in the Village and meets his dad, who is back from the war and together with the survivors of the killings on the area. I could better state it what was left of his dad, who had been burned alive by enemy soldiers and survived although having asked to be killed instead of being tortured like that. Major killing scenes are not the main focus of Klimov on the movie. The focus is to show one personal experience, Flor's, of what is like to fight the war and how it affected him. Even though the found gun was his passport to be able to fight the war, Flor does never use his gun except this one time, when he shoots a whole load on a Hitler portrait on the floor after having survived a major attack. The shield created by the amount of atrocities witnessed made our main character lose all of his beliefs and will to build a family with Glasha and be happy even though he left her to go back to war after having had a baby. He becomes this old looking young boy that had the pain and the evilness stamped on wrinkles and marks all over his face. <br/><br/>Klimov did a wonderful job with this movie and the fact that Flor did not die did not make my viewer heart feel better. It shows in detail how this little boy from this little Byelorussian village was affected by WWII and that is so touching, specially knowing that that was only one of the 628 villages that were burned to the ground during the war. No wonder this is considered one of the best anti-war movies out."

It is amazingly done as it assaults all of your senses and leaves you feeling angry, ashamed and depressed.<br/><br/>You can see the fear in and all around Florya, the boy who was recruited for the war, to fight alongside the Soviets against Germany. You hear the intensity of the bombs exploding next to Florya and understand why he suffers loss of hearing. You taste the grit in his mouth when he stumbles and falls into the mud and feel the cold seep through his bones as he and Glasha maneuver through the swamp. You smell the stench of the burning acid and flesh in the air when the Germans burn the captives and your heart breaks for the Mother, whose child is tossed back into the building and she is then brutally raped. Only at the end do you feel a little sense of justice when Florya shoots the picture of Hitler.<br/><br/>As the film plays, the feeling of angry surfaces just for the mere fact of the injustice of war and sending children to fight as men and women for the sack of survival.

","This was a fascinating but at the same time heart-wrenching look into the lives of Byelorussian soldiers during World War II. When the film begins, German soldiers have already entered the country and are brutally killing the Byelorussian soldiers and civilians with smiles on their faces. We see the story through the eyes of Florya, a young boy thrust into the war by soviet partisans much to the dismay of his mother. We see the transition of a normal boy to an extremely disturbed young man. The more brutality he sees, the more his insanity increases. As hard as this film was to see, I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I found it visually stunning and highly recommend it to not only a film major but history buff as well. I also found the music selection particularly interesting especially in the end, using both Mozart's Lacrimosa and Wagner's (a Nazi sympathizer) Die Walkure in very emotional scenes."

","This story is not about war in its' stereotypical sense. Though yes, the main conflict is of an ideological, religious, and nationalistic nature, it is not a war of such. Rather it is a war of the human mind and soul, more specifically, a young boy's mind and soul as he witnesses the atrocity of actions committed with no legitimate reasoning.<br/><br/>This is made all the more haunting by the realism conveyed in this film. Thanks to the desire to create the most realistic portrayal possible, nearly everything was filmed as is - you will feel as if you are there, (and, at some points in the film, you actually may be). There are no stand-ins; the actors actually did this during filming. Therefore, every image is that much more haunting because you feel a direct connection to the characters.<br/><br/>It's a shame this isn't one of the more well known war films to the general public. It's easy to see why not - this is not about spectacle, explosions or patriotism.

","Come and See (1985) by Alem Klimov, shows how a young man named Florya was so excited about joining the army, but once he was in it he found out that it was not pleasant at all. At the age of 12, he had to experience WWII, when the Jews were the target of the Nazis. Florya lost his innocence, family, and friends. The only thing that he did not lose was the willing of keeping himself alive. Klimov did a great job showing how the war affected Florya's emotional feelings, how he started aging little by little in front of the camera. The movie is not so much about the graphics of the Holocaust, but how the war affected people's mind and feelings. The movie shows the cruel reality how young boys have the wrong idea why they want to join the army, but once they experience war they really find out the answer why they are fighting for. Almost at the end of the movie, Florya shot the photo of Adolph Hitler with a rifle, and it was a way for him to take all that pain and anger he had inside. He felt that he found a reason why to keep fighting against the Nazis. Florya felt the right to defend himself against people who wanted to hurt him."

Both have many of the same themes, including racism, hope, transformation, loss of innocence, death, fire, premonitions, historical accuracy, point of view, revenge, family, religion, symbolism and irony.<br/><br/>Just as the book commanded students' interest, ""Come and See"" was spellbinding. The images are powerful. Indeed, I consulted with others before deciding to show this movie even though it probably would be rated PG-13 in this country.

"Turfseer","6","5","12","2 October 2010"," Apocalyptic vision of Nazi horrors is shocking but perhaps not shocking enough
","After spending a good deal of time wading through many of the reviews of 'Come and See', I've found that there's pretty much a consensus that the 1985 Soviet film about a Nazi massacre in a Byelorussian (Belarus) village is a cinematic masterpiece. There was one review however, that caught my eye where the film critic expressed some reservations and that was Walter Goodman of (believe it or not) The New York Times! He called the film's director, Elem Klimov, a ""master of a sort of unreal realism"". And I agree that this term, ""unreal realism"", captures the essence of the director's approach.<br/><br/>Daniel Goldhagen in his brilliant book, ""Hitler's Willing Executioneers – Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust"", makes the point that Hitler could not have been successful without the overwhelming backing of the ordinary German. The great value of Goldhagen's tome is that he puts a human face on the killers. He describes in detail how police battalions, consisting of ordinary Germans who were given little training and weren't always Nazi party members, were conscripted and fought in tandem with the specialized killing regiments (such as the Eiznsatzgruppen), other SS and SD units as well as the regular Army, during various ""aktions' against the civilian populations (principally Jewish) in Eastern Europe. What I found out from reading Goldhagen's book is that the killers did not have to fear any reprisals if they decided to opt out from participating in the massacres. Quite the contrary, the commanders were only looking for volunteers and for the few who actually were part of a very small minority that found that murdering people made them too queasy, they could be given a much more benign assignment. When they weren't committing heinous crimes, these Germans were involved in ordinary pursuits such as participating in track and field events or going bowling. One officer even brought his wife to witness one of the massacres.<br/><br/>Klimov's approach, however, is to view events at a distance. None of the Byelorussian townspeople or partisans are developed into characters of any depth. Similarly, there is little attempt to humanize the Germans (until the end when Klimov does show the SD commander begging for his life and another officer refusing to back down, spouting his racist views). For me, this could have been a more powerful (and of course a very different film) if Klimov gave his characters some personality and perhaps had focused on one particular German antagonist. Instead, ALL the Germans are lumped into a collective mass. By humanizing the killers, the cruelty of the Germans would have proved more up close and personal.<br/><br/>Instead Klimov's distancing effect softens the horror. It's as though one is viewing a Hieronymus Bosch painting in a museum and is fascinated by the images of hell the artist has created. We never actually SEE the people who murder Florya's family; the horror is muted as Glasha only catches a fleeting glance of the dead bodies piled against Floyra's house. It's shocking but perhaps not shocking enough! Similarly, we feel nothing for the villagers who presumably fled and whose terrifying escape is never shown (and we never learn how they actually escape to the island across the bog). <br/><br/>The great value of Come and See is that Klimov DOES show how the Germans, as a collective mass, actually enjoy what they're doing. The massacre appears as it's a drunken orgy, a macabre carnival, where murder becomes one big joke. That of course is one aspect of the horror and it's quite effectively conveyed in the final scene of the movie. In contrast, since we are not invested in any of the villagers who are herded into the locked building and then machine-gunned and set on fire nor are we acquainted with any of the killers on a personal level, the full import of the horror again feels muted. Yes, there is a shot of the villagers trapped inside, pounding on the door but it's seen from a distance. It's left up to the viewers imagination as to what's happening inside the burning building. Similarly, we see the lone woman who jumps out of the building before the conflagration and is dragged to a truck where she PRESUMABLY is raped as the truck drives off (and more soldiers pile in). Again, it's left to our imagination as to what happens to the poor woman but Klimov spares us the complete import of the horror. To repeat: it's shocking but perhaps not shocking enough.<br/><br/>While Klimov focuses on the massacre of the Byelorussians, it should be noted that the first group of people the Germans always singled out for extermination during all their murderous forays, were the Jews. The Jews were considered ""non-human"", as opposed to the various Eastern Europeans who were dubbed ""sub-human"". So I was puzzled that Klimov only shows the capture of one lone Jew (yes, it's possible the Jews in the village had already been ""disposed"" of before the massacre takes place) but I wonder if that lone Jew would have been given 'special treatment' by the Germans (such as being hung in the Village square for anyone left alive to see), instead of being thrown into the building with the rest of the villagers.<br/><br/>Unlike Sean Penn who gushes (as part of the DVD special features) that Come and See is a powerful ""anti-war"" movie, I see its strength as more a cautionary tale about Fascism than the more generic polemic against war. I found Florya's loss of innocence perhaps the most 'obvious' part of the film as one would expect that war would have a most deleterious effect upon any child. <br/><br/>In the end, one senses that the events were even worse than what is shown here. I agree with the Time's critic's appellation that 'Come and See' is a work of ""unreal realism""; at best a 'noble attempt' but certainly no masterpiece as most have insisted."

This movie goes on far too long without getting to a point (if it ever does, besides war is bad for everyone), and I've seen way to much of that anguished kid staring shocked and dismayed at the camera (about half the movie). There isn't much war going on, just tragedy, atrocity, or pointless wandering around the edge of war. Lack of dialogue and explanation means that much of the time you don't know who people are or where they're going or what they hope to accomplish when they get there.

","A painful and haunting film set in Belarus in 1943, which opens with an old man's mystical declaration of impending doom, followed by a brief interlude of innocence between a young 12 year old boy and a young girl, but after a glimpse of a German bomber flying overhead, something like an angel of death, bombs drop, the earth explodes, the young boy loses his hearing and then bears witness to the horror of war.  <br/><br/>     Some of the imagery feels dreamlike or like a horrible hallucination, like the slowly evolving scene where he and the girl fight their way through a muddy swamp which nearly engulfs them, the horror of seeing herded, starving people, his neighbors, with nowhere to go, seen almost as corpses or ghosts in a fog, he wanders the countryside in search of food, and finds a cow, but it gets killed in the crossfire of stray bullets that appear as laser beams across an open field, he discovers one house with all the neighboring people huddled inside, a horrible scene of terror made even more horrible by the arrival of the Nazi's who round up all the people in the countryside, herd them into a church, lock then inside, and then burn them alive, while they feast and get drunk, even take photographs, like it's a festive occasion, the season of the sadists.  However, this film was produced to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Russian triumph over the Nazi's, but in 1943, the Nazi's burned 628 Belarussian villages to the ground, slaughtering all the inhabitants, literally trying to wipe these Russian people off the face of the earth.  It was impossible to view this film in 2001 and not think of the recent Serbian excursion into Kosovo. Despite all efforts to teach and remember and learn, history repeats itself. <br/><br/>     While the last hour of the film is truly mesmerizing and is a great cinematic exhibition,I believe it is more graphic than profound.  Did we really need the large, expressionist facial close-ups to represent the horror?  The images were powerful enough, the over-acting only diminished our emotional connection to the screen.  While intense, I believe it lacks the inner complexity of an even greater Russian film,  `The Ascent,'  filmed in 1976 by this director's wife,  Larisa Shepitko, which examines not just the graphic outer horrors, but she finds truly inspiring images that reflect the absolute insanity taking place inside these human beings; the ending of that film is simply awe-inspiring."
"harryplinkett14","1","14","49","8 March 2019"," Myth
","By the time the horrible events depicted in this film took place, the USSR had spent a quarter of a century murdering tens of millions of people and sending even more people to gulags. Also, prior to Germany's attack on the USSR, the USSR had invaded Romania, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, Poland, and Finland. After invading Poland, the USSR executed the entire Polish elite in the Katyn forest.
Yet, in this film, the memorable scene where the boy shoots a photograph of Hitler suggests that all the evil of that time period was caused by him. This is simply not true.
Also, while the murder of the entire population in the village is like a picture from Hell, one can't help but wonder how it had come to that. The film focuses on German reprisals, but doesn't seem to acknowledge that the village supported partizans, and partizans were illegal guerrilla units. They were essentially civilians who occasionally became soldiers. If you are not regular army, you can be executed when caught. But what about a village these partizans used for protection and support? Well, we know what America and the USSR did with such villages in Vietnam and Afghanistan, respectively. The difference is that in Vietnam and Afghanistan neither America nor the USSR faced total annihilation in case of losing the war. Germany had to win, or face annihilation. It was a total war. Let us not pretend Germans were not aware that sparing partizans and those who supported them meant running the risk of their own people getting murdered and enslaved.
Also, the film seems to suggest Germans were completely undisciplined and drunk. The Wehrmacht was the most disciplined military force in the world at the time, and frankly, the trope of drunk Germans, so popular in Russian cinema, is something I find hard to accept. But I admit, I wasn't there, so I don't know. What I do know is that regardless of that, Germans are not getting a fair representation of their ideology or the motivation behind their actions in this film. Their actions are cruel, but at the same time entirely provoked. And that, I think, should be the core question. I wish the film had explored that, rather than treating us to the image of a boy shooting hitler's photograph. Then again, can we blame Russians for being too upset about what happened to their people to have any interest in trying to even partially absolve the Germans from their guilt? Perhaps not. But the film is still propaganda, mainly on the meta-level, where all the blame is focused not even on Germany, but her leader alone. Looking at WWII from this historical distance, I am more interested in understanding what happened and how, rather than indulging in outbursts of emotion coupled with highly ideological, abstract notions about good and evil."

","Come and See is one of those movies, which leaves you speechless and most likely confused. Being from a country whose people had a similar fate as Belarusians, this movie was emotionally numbing because back in my home country, people are exposed to information about the outcomes of occupations, by Nazi Germany and Communist Russia, from an early age, which means that watching a movie like ""Come and See"" is rather sad than shocking. <br/><br/>Many individuals in America and Europe have learned about Nazis and Communist at schools, but then straight away forgotten because such information is just another fact with no personal experience attached. Being used to hearing about the genocide and wars, such as Vietnam War, where thousands people die, people do not see that information as shocking anymore. However, after watching Come and See, many should be able to understand why schools and society put such a big emphasis on human cruelty against other human beings through out the course of history as being shocking.<br/><br/>For some this movie might feel fictional, but sadly it was the reality of many people back in Soviet Union or Nazi Germany. For those who have never experienced having relatives brutally killed in a foreign country or burnt to death, Come and See is a good example of insanity and pain one had to feel.<br/><br/>People tend to incorrectly refer to Belarusians as Russians just because they were occupied by Soviet Russia and for decades ruled under Communist regime. It is important to understand that the characters in Come and See are fighting not just against Nazi Germany, but also against Soviet Union. This movie is a cry for freedom and independence, not just a celebration of victory against Nazi Germany. It is true that this film was made for a 40 year anniversary of Soviet Union's victory in World War II (as well as Cold War, and Gorbachevs 3 year plan Glasnost and Perestroika); however, as Eastern Europeans had a tendency to have subtext in their movies, I do highly believe that the freedom of ones nation was the main theme of the movie."

It would of course ultimately lead to the Soviets wreaking terrible revenge on the Germans at a later date.<br/><br/>Some may argue that this film is propaganda at it's best and even a means by which to forgive the Soviets their actions once they arrived in Germany after successfully pushing the Nazis back. ""We did this to them because look at what they did to us"". I must admit, it certainly worked on me......i wanted the Russians to annihilate the Germans.....show them no mercy.

It was the coolest war scene maybe but it was realistic due to special effects but montage faded it a little bit.

This is probably the most devastating (war) movie I have ever experienced. That's right, you can't just see it, you experience it. The film puts its main character through such adversities and never gives any hope for things to turn better. Seemingly lighthearted scenes are sent by Oleg Yanchenko's ominous score that foreshadows the horrors coming. Even more horrifying than the brutal scenes of violence is the way we see the teenage boy grow older with one summer. At the beginning we see a young boy full of life, ready to protect his land, and by the end we only see grey and scarred human wreck. And not only physically - just look at those eyes of the boy, and how the life has been sucked out from them. The inexperience of the young actor is quite clear in some scenes in the beginning, but altogether, it is some remarkable acting. I guess the fact that the film was shot in sequence helped to improve his role. Almost like he grew with the character he portrayed. Not so fun fact - when the filming was finished, Aleksey Kravchenko's real hair had turned grey from the excruciating shooting period.<br/><br/>The visual style of the film is astonishing. I'm always overwhelmed by the ability of Russian directors to use vivid dreamlike visuals to bring the horrors of the war onto the silver screen. In this case 'Come and See' is a prime example. The scenes in the forest between Flyora and Glasha (Olga Mironova) seem like they belong into some other movie (or into some other genre altogether), yet they are properly placed.

It's a film I hope humans won't be able to make (because there's no reference), although it's undeniably a stunning masterpiece.
The film is set in white Russia in 1943, two years after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet union, during which it is self-evident that many brutal battles took place, but the camera avoids the battlefield where the two sides are directly depicted, and follows closely a boy who joins the army.
Young floriola with partners in the ruins of the war in the gun, with a gun, he can join the guerrillas. He got his wish, bid farewell to his mother and a pair of naive and lovely twin sisters, was disguised as the German guerrillas away.
In the froyola home, the mother received the two soldiers who had come to take her son with a mixture of fear, anxiety, and a vague hatred. When one of them, a large, jargon-prone, stiff-faced soldier, tried to amuse his two younger sisters, the children were terrified and on the verge of tears. This is in stark contrast to the scene when the mother angrily thrust the axe into her brother's hand, threatening to have him chop them to death before leaving the house. Despite attempts to be kind and reassuring, even the casual children felt strange and nervous in the two adults who had gone to war, an aura that was hard to blend with their daily lives.
The film quietly reinforces this sense of separation again and again, arouses emotions with the stimulation of subjective feelings, and gradually immerses the viewer's mental state into the historical scene it is to shape. Although it's realistic, it's actually full and subtle in its use of techniques to create a presence of ""body,"" as the title suggests, ""see for yourself.""

The first hint of this change comes at the beginning of the film, when froglia digs into a gun against a backdrop of green grass and blue sky, but then the fighter jets streak across a gray sky, and from a bird 's-eye view, the grass and trees become a gray blur.
Through the auditory drop. Such as high and low roar, from machinery (planes, motorcycles, etc.), from animals (flies, etc.) or disturbed radio waves, even physical tinnitus. The monotonous repetition of the sound made people anxious and depressed; There was the interlacing of the true and the disguised intonations -- the children who had come before froriola, speaking in a disconcerting, aged and fierce voice. Then we heard the truth of his voice again, and above all the childish words of concern to his companion: ""what's the matter? Peeing your pants?"" This seemed to confirm his real age. But even as I felt compassion for the child, I was still terrified: for the voice of the old man was beyond the range of what I could understand a child to disguise, and there was an inescapable truth in it.
As the film progresses, the signs of aging that end up on fryola's face again echo those of the well-spoken child, who is a shape-shifting sensor, spokesman and victim of the powerful violence.
Then there is the expression, the behavior, the emotional reaction, let me feel the most creepy is this. Laugh, laugh desperately, twist a cry face and still smile! Floriola and graca meet, sadness, fear, despair... There is a lot of unbearably negative emotion hidden in the neurotic dialogue, and yet they tacitly communicate with laughter and bantering. Floriola home in the emotional description of the repression to the extreme, but people can not use the word of pity or compassion to isolate themselves, to comment on it. I can only pause, pull away, and let myself think of something else. It turned out that the psychological interpretation of froriola's actions was a profound portrayal of the grief response:
1. The denial. When fryola entered the village, he felt something was wrong, but he did not want to face up to his prediction. He entered the house, ignored the whizzing of flies from the rotten food (his voice was deliberately exaggerated), and brought out the milk that had gone bad for too long to feed graca. ""It's still warm,"" he insisted. This assumes that mom and sister have been away for a short time and that everything is fine;
2. The suspect. Graca found the village head was massacred and hysterical, but froriola did not look, excitedly dragged graca into the swamp. He assumes that his family has survived their hiding on the island, but as he struggles through the mud, his flustered steps reveal the question he asks himself -- is it really all the same? Whether misfortune has befallen;
3. The anger. Arriving on the island, graca shouted the fact that his family had been massacred, and floriola attacked, strangling her and pushing her into the swamp. Still, he does not accept the reality of death, but the irrationality of this moment allows him to vent his anger towards death on his closest companions (in fact, the self-attack is directed at graca, who becomes the self-embodiment of froriola's acceptance of the reality of death).
4. Guilt. In the refuge of the island, the severely burned uncle deliriously blames fryola for digging up the guns. Although we know this is not true, fryola is also immersed in such remorse, which is mixed with the guilt of abandoning his family to join the army. He burrowed his head into the mud. When he followed the adults in search of food, the women asked him, ""don't leave us, child."" A mother with a baby in her arms consoled him: ""you never knew it would turn out like this. You never knew."" ""No, it's all my fault.""
The rough fate of floriola did not end there, foraging on the road with four people, finally left him. Rescued by an old man, he is hidden away in the village in his new identity, and the old man's rambling introduction to his family seems to ease the atmosphere, even with a touch of fantasy -- will froriola fit in with his new family? But then came the Nazi massacre.
In one detail, fryola is left behind by the army, crushing a nest of birds' eggs as he runs. This is probably the dividing line, and since then, the teenager's face has often developed the expression that trauma sufferers have. Two more photographs, one with the guerrillas, when he was a normal boy; The second time, he was photographed with a pistol held to his head by the nazis.
In the pull off state, we can say in theory that the child needs psychological intervention. But the truth is, we're watching, we're watching, we're not doing anything about it. As for myself, I can only chills and pray that I shall never be in such an environment as long as I live.
The unity and separation of emotions is an important criterion for judging schizophrenia, so we see it as abnormal when an individual's behavior and emotional response to a specific situation does not conform to our expectations. But what if the environment itself is abnormal? Every moment in the face of deprivation, the loss of loved ones, the threat of life, bad luck hovering over the head but do not know whether the next second will come... So what can we rely on? There is no such thing as normal order, that is, the collective schizophrenia, no one is immune.
The germans drove and beat the villagers to cheerful music and playful propaganda and burned them in wooden houses. Throw a baby back to the window of death like an inanimate muppet, or like a young pioneer doing a good deed, carry an old granny to her bed out of the burning place... The grotesque behavior reveals that the victorious side is also seized by fear, though not until after the exile.
I didn't like the silence of the guerrillas and the villagers at the end, watching scornfully the spectacle of the defeated side, the last volley of fire ending them, the fire thrown into the water. It seems to emphasize the moral nobility of the just side. It would be better if they acted impulsively, or even violently in return. Nico thought it was a good deal. She thought it was not that they didn't want revenge, but that they had a deep fear of the violence. Also, the maker of fear will eventually be swallowed up by fear. But why is it that humans are endlessly involved?
This film makes me strongly feel the power of art, which can not only be used to satisfy aesthetic pleasure, or passively become some kind of desire object; When it is full of energy and tends to perfect, it has a breathtaking attraction, can actively grab and capture the viewer, accurately and impressively instill its idea. It is, so to speak, both a danger and the best warning of it"

","It took director Elem Klimov eight years to get approval for this film. And it ended up being his last one. He was tapped out, done, out of ideas. He felt like he had nothing left to give.<br/><br/>I can see why.<br/><br/>Come and See is a historical anti-war film based on real events in Belarus under the onslaught of Nazi Germany. Our focal character is Flyora (Aleksey Kravchenko), a farm boy, who joins the partisan movement to oppose the Germans. Through his eyes we witness the atrocities committed by the Germans and witness horrors unlike anything I've ever seen on film screen.<br/><br/>Klimov mixes horrifying, brutal hyperrealism with surrealism. Extreme close-ups, literal wading through mud, blood and human remains, gruesome battle wounds and people being burned alive are from time to time interwoven with almost dreamlike visions and long takes of fleeting serenity. This sounds artsy, but it actually works to bring all the horrors into even starker contrast.<br/><br/>That being said, the violence, brutality and sheer horror do go so far in this film that at least I ended up becoming detached. I knew it was real and that these war crimes had really occurred in Belarus - the film is noted for its historical accuracy - but at some point I simply checked out. Which in some way makes it that much worse.<br/><br/>It is a great film. A terrible, horrifying, nightmarish film. But great."
"Josua_E_van_Hansen","8","0","0","3 April 2020"," Come and See - An accurate depiction of war.
","I find it interesting that 75 years after world war II, a film made in 1985 depicting the events of the war would have such a relevance in the year 2020. I believe that it's entirely due to it's accurate depiction of war and how it corrupts innocence. I could make lists upon list on how various details in the film make it such a work of art, but in this review I want to specifically talk about the main character and how he is relevant to some teenager / young adults in modern times, thereby making the film so astounding.<br/><br/>In today's world we often misunderstand what effect actually has on the state of countries and the individuals that fight in them and a large cause to this is the glorification of war in films and video games. We often think that if we went to war it meant that would be seen as national hero and a true strong independent man. Which is the exact mindset Florya (the protagonist) starts out with. This is shown through his refusal to listen to his father and mother's warnings and through his envy of his superior's authority and company. But as he sees how war effects the people and the land around him he soon realizes that his ambitions were nothing but delusions blinding him from the truth of what war truly meant. So he fires his rifle for the first time not out of ambitions or honor but out of pure hatred for the war and what it had done, which doesn't necessarily cause the viewer to feel hatred but it creates an understanding and sympathy towards Florya and his anger towards the war. What a powerful ending.<br/><br/>Having the main character start out in the viewers mind set is genius, as it creates a connection between the character and the audience from the start and makes his emotions feel more genuine. That's because the character is processing the events fort the first time just like the audience. Which is also why it is so important to show the true reality of how things happened and not shying away from it, by cutting to black or another scene, because it would create a disconnect between the character and the viewer.<br/><br/>In summary Come and see is such an amazing film due to it's accurate depiction of war and the effect it has on the human mind by showing us the perspective of a naive boy. I would recommend this film to anyone who doesn't have PTSD and would definitely recommend it as an essential piece of cinema for film scholars and cinephiliacs."

This Film ""Come and See"" by Elem Klimov is a great example of what cinema has to offer to those whom wish to pursue a career in cinematography; it touches upon the idea that cinema can change and invoke emotional imprecations from past events like World War II. This film brings the viewer into the action and provokes you to smell, feel, and almost taste the gore that surrounds the entire movie from start to finish. We see a Great use of visual directionality in demonstrating the idea of pain and distress from the cause and effect in the film.

","Come and See was impressive and at the same time the kind of movie that has you leave the room unable to speak to your friends until the movie leaves your head. It starts off slow, building some momentum as it goes when you grasp the location, time, and situation. Slowly the movie turns itself upside down then flips you right side up every now and then, then repeats the process. The movie becomes more and more insane, and right when it hits rock bottom, it gives our protagonist a bit of pause where he laughs and calms his nerves... Slightly.<br/><br/>Definitely well shot, and the most amazing part is the lack of digital editing, where everything was done on set.

This film had many close ups but rather than feeling that the characters are looking at us, it feels like they are looking through us.

","After you see the first couple of scenes of this film you wonder if you are watching the work of a surrealist. The story fragments do not seem to connect and the characters are hardly appealing or even understandable. However as the film moves on the story emerges. The film is set in German occupied Russia in 1943. A young boy joins the partisans but is deafened and disorientated by a bombing attack. He wanders around moving towards his own village. Around him moves a group of German SS troops leaving carnage as they massacre the women children and elderly men in the villages. You do not see the Germans till the last part of the film but their presence is everywhere.<br/><br/>The climax of the film is his meeting with the SS unit as it moves into and destroys a village. In the end the film is one of the most gripping and realistic portraits of war ever made. The film has no heroes, there is no message yet the film captures you in its intensity. None of the characters are attractive and the feeling is one of realism.<br/><br/>In the last few years a number of films have been made about combat on the Eastern Front. For instance Enemy at the Gates and Stalingrad. Both films look like sanitised television shows by comparison. The film is both effective as a work of art and also of a portrait of the reality of a brutal conflict."

","This movie was very touching. I was engulfed in emotion while watching it. I enjoyed when the movie went from and objective to subjective view when the bombs were dropping on Florya and Galasha. That moment really made me feel like apart of the movie. I had to keep reminding myself that it was just a movie. The scenes were, not so much graphic but I feel it was the fact that they were so genuinely composed. Watching them struggle through the swamp I wondered why am I watching this but at the same time I could feel all the pain and desperation. I felt that the movie was self referential in its regard to ""killing the children"" when Florya stepped on the bird eggs. Its not the same as killing the children so that they don't turn into dangerous people, but maybe to save them from growing up in a world full of bomb, guys, fire and violence. Another thing I noticed was when Florya told Galaha ""I'll save all of you"" it wasn't just about Galasha, it was about all the people who needed to be saved."

","Elem Klimov's 'Come and See' shows brutality and mercilessness of war. I think this film has no even plot. It just shows the horrors of war through a young boy who volunteer for a partisan. Also, a film has no heroism, no distinguishing oneself in war, and no impressive speech. There are just deaths, brutalities, and victims. Survival in war only depends on luck. Most war films are wanted to have elements of reversal, but at the same time they also are wanted to be heroism. However, in this film 'Come and See' does not have these elements at all. This film only tells us that there are no bad guys, good guys or justice in war. There is only one thing, victim."
"sherving55","8","0","0","8 February 2011"," A Great War Film
","This film is a gut wrenching experience that will test a viewer's limits. The realistic sense of this film does so much to heighten the brutality of what is being shown. The story is what I would assume war is like, as in not glorified, but shows unbelievable hardships of a young boy who has joined the partisans. The way Klimov shot the film, where scenes like the crossing of the bog were real and not staged also helped with the realistic sense, but also with the horrifying feeling this film gives off. This film also does a great job to make you feel the crazy that is happening in the movie. Scenes are not shown with a great amount of details of explanation, they are felt though, which is why it is such an intense movie. It literally feels like you are there with Florya. Just too quickly mention, some scenes seem to be amazingly realistic and that's because they probably are. The film really does show the unimaginable effects of war. You can see how everything is damaged, like how nature is destroyed with the dropping bombs, how innocent people are massacred. The psychological, emotional, mental and physical torment people must go through just to survive is depicted flawlessly in this film. I don't think I can stress it enough, but all these things rub off on viewers. Viewers watch as the Nazi enter a village and massacre an entire village as they celebrate and take pictures. Then it moves onto these same Germans and Russian collaborator begging for forgiveness and not be killed by the partisans. The question that should come up as this scene unravels is what should happen to these Germans. Is it okay to brutally kill these captured Germans? After all that is what war is is it not?"

I may not have know what the story was about. For the viewers who have little knowledge about the Eastern front in the early 1940's,it could be confusing to watch with no understanding of the concept of the story.<br/><br/>Quick over view, for the people who haven't seen the film. Come and See"" is based on experiences witnessed by citizens in Eastern Europe during the German Invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 . Their treatment, mostly the work of the SS, towards the citizens of these countries were barbaric. Countless men,woman and children were raped,beaten,shot and slaughtered in one of the biggest act of Genocide in history. Come and See is set in Byelorussia around 1942-1943. The film is told from a young Byelorussian boys view named, Florya who joins the local partisans against the German invaders. We see him go through the film in an unconscious state of mind.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that we get to know little about Florya,we don't learn anything about who the characters are and why they are there. The film is very slow and at many times throughout, nothing much is happening. The one good set piece that as any little visual effect showing the horror, at bested a film can, that these people went through comes right at the end. Like the massacre of Florya's family ,which you don't see, it could have been better done.<br/><br/>The film as a whole could have been so much better. The long, ringing in your ears, muted sound is off putting and not effective.<br/><br/>This film gets three stars from me for the reason of 1. The trees exploding scenes (around 20 seconds each) are visual stunning as well as 2. The bullets travelling at speed and glowing up the air, (also around 20 second). 3. For bringing to screen, a story from a group of partisans in Eastern Europe view and for the last 15 minutes of the film.<br/><br/>Come and See is not a total disaster of a film. It is well filmed by the director Elem Klimov and does,though very loosely, tell us about the experience of the partisans during the war. However their are NO set battle scenes, hardly a shot is fired, their is only one massacre scene at the end, and most disappointing of all the film is very SLOW."

Klimov seems to be one of those directors who likes to linger for an intolerably long time on something in order to make his point. Narratively, not a great deal happens. War really is hell, particularly for Florya, the boy-soldier who is witness to the most terrible atrocities imaginable and Klimov films the scenes of mass horror in an appallingly straight-forward fashion, (compare this with the sentimentality of Spielberg), and the final scenes are among the grimmest in all cinema. Unfortunately Klimov takes an eternity before finally taking us into the mouth of hell. At half its length and with the emphasis focused on the carnage this could have been a masterpiece.

","This film follows the path of a young boy as he confronts the incredible brutality of the partisan war in the Soviet Union during WW II.

As a result, he becomes a witness to the atrocities visited upon his village and others nearby by a wandering einsatzgruppen unit that takes great pleasure in its grisly task of extermination. The film is episodic and takes some unusual turns (the effort to put up the dummy German is one). This is film about images, not words. There is remarkably little dialogue throughout much of the film. It's also brutal and graphic.

","If you want an ""arty"" war film, then I suppose this is for you.
I think the director only partially succeeded in portraying the suffering of civilians during times of war, due to making some silly mistakes with the planning and execution of certain scenes.
Some parts stretched credulity beyond breaking point. For example, the protagonist being allowed to splash around for ages in the bog before his girlfriend eventually decided to tell him that it was futile because she knew his family were dead.
The recurring motif of the airplane, so badly executed that it was akin to a flying saucer from a 1950's sci-fi ""B"" movie.
The Germans, who, to a man, were completely ecstatic about burning a barn full of Belarusians. You might have thought that one or two of them would be human enough to turn away or find something else to do other than applaud.
The very poorly applied makeup on the protagonist's face which was supposed to convey his dramatic aging due to his experiences.
The stupidity of running into the middle of an enormous field when supposedly trying to sneak past German lines to get food.
The stork. Very arty but incomprehensible.
All these issues pull down what could have been a great film.
I think the best part was the unexpected ""bomb"" from the airplane. Human moment.
Some other parts were well done. The sacking of the villages was portrayed well, possibly due to a complete lack of planning the scenes and winging it.
Use of animals worked well, must have been excellent handlers (apart from the stork).
The acting was very very good. Characters developed well, just some fibre, maybe some documentary styling missing to make the thing more believable.

It makes very little sense and just confuses the hell out of the viewer.<br/><br/>The acting is also pretty bad in a couple of scenes, particularly from the 2 main actors (the girl and the boy). I understand that it was both of their first times acting in a movie, but that doesn't excuse the bad casting choice. I mean, sure the girl is distractingly pretty, but she's a poor actor and she has no place in a movie... with her looks maybe in a magazine or pin-up poster, but not in a movie.<br/><br/>I'd give the first half of the movie a 2/10 and the second half of the movie a 8/10. So basically, if you want to watch the movie, do yourself a favor and skip to half-way."
"BigBoote66","8","4","16","18 May 2005"," Worth seeing, but caveats
","As others have said, the film is brutal and visceral. Definitely worth watching; this is the kind of movie that would never be made in the United States (either by Hollywood or independents), for good or ill.<br/><br/>Examples of the ""difference"" include things like live ammunition being used for gunfire, and the fact that they actually machine-gunned a cow (and filmed a close-up of its death-throes).<br/><br/>However, I'd like to address an issue that seemed quite plain to me but others haven't touched on. People call this an anti-war movie, but I feel it works almost as well as anti-Nazi propaganda. The tone of this movie is unrelentingly bitter and every instance of anti-war sentiment can be interpreted as an indictment on the brutality of the Nazis.<br/><br/>I'm not trying soft-sell anything perpetrated by Germany during the war, but merely contrast the way that an anti-war movie would be made by the West. In every serious war movie I'm familiar with, there is a strong sense of regret and ambivalence over the actions of both sides. The message that you walk away with is ""both sides are capable of committing terrible acts."" But this film squarely puts the acts of evil in the hands of an almost cartoonish (although terrifying) ""enemy"" that would seem over-the-top in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" Perhaps things were as bad as this; perhaps this is the directors way of showing how traumatized the boy was by what he witnessed. But the fact remains that the Russians are universally portrayed to be good and suffering and heroic, given the circumstances. Even the denouement of the film, showing the destroyed German force, would indicate that ultimately the partisans, with their rifles & handful of mortars, were capable of destroying an body equipped with armor, air support and plenty of fresh lobster.<br/><br/>The most glaring point was the final scene, where the Germans are shot by the partisans instead of being burned alive. Given what had come before, I felt this showed a ""turn the other cheek"" attitude that simply wasn't reflected in the historical realities, where advancing Russian forces gave back nearly as well as they got, burning entire German towns , with plenty of rapes & atrocities to go around.<br/><br/>I understand that war movies almost invariably portray the protagonists as rising above their enemies level of barbarism, but given the portrayal of the horrors visited upon them by the Germans, I didn't buy it. The ending smacked of propaganda, and I would have preferred the film to conclude after the destruction of the village - the anti-war message would have been complete."

","Only thing this movie is good at is violence. It is boring, not so well made movie about war. Yes, there is the terror, yes there is some drama, but done in such a boring way you feel like you could just walk away from it all and everything would be just fine. I don't understand the hype, but as a trend follows, foreign movies tend to get good reviews mostly because of patronizing commentators, who want to seem smart and profound. <br/><br/>Boring, low-quality overrated garbage. And there is this constant babble about how Hollywood can't make this. Hollywood is not always at it's best, but we all know it can surpass this crap by a mile anytime. Shindler's list, for example, is way better than this. This is waste of time, with good promo story. One of them is, that kid acting went back to school with gray hair. Oh give me a break will ya'. <br/><br/>Don't believe hype about everything. There is a reason this crap of a movie is not so well known. The most horrible things are faces, that are made to look almost like in a horror flick. Yes, war can be horror, but movies that rely on brutality are usually crap and achieve their impact through gore and violence. There is much more impact behind deep storytelling than this.<br/><br/>Intermezzo: When you watch reviews you see many saying ""he actually walked through mud to film this"", while no one says SHE DID TOO. <br/><br/>Crap on crap is crap. This movie is brutal, boring crap. And playing Mozart in the background is beyond stupid since it is only for molesting viewer. No Mozart is playing in the real world and no sinister sound is in the background. To get real feel set this to mute in every mayor scene. Not that big of an impact. Only well brutal with horror soundtrack in the background. With that music, baking chocolate chip cookies can look as a deepest horror flick ever."
"patrickknill","Null","2","6","9 September 2003"," Flawed but worthwhile
","Some of my problems with this film may be the result of it being made in a just slightly thawing political and cultural climate. The backwards montage scene at the end - No! The inability of Glasha to hold the same facial expression for more than an eight of a second. Was she also hypnotised like Kravchenko? Fortunately she disappears in the second half of the film. As an expression of the psychological effects of war, it works for a while, but it becomes very grating. Others are to do with the DVD transfer in (I suspect pan and scan) full frame, it made it look like Klimov didn't know how to compose a shot at times. Maybe it really did look like this on release, I don't know. But, these gripes aside, the film does come together in the second half and the final scenes in the village are an outstanding indictment of war and a very unsentimental representation of the Byelorussian experience under German occupation."

On the paternal side my father's mother was raped by the soviet union's soldiers.<br/><br/>So when I watched this movie. It started out ok.

I wonder if any country would make a movie about how bad are the US soldiers. How on Earth would that be in the top250.<br/><br/>

As seen through the eyes of a 13 year-old, it is unbearable to watch what he had to go through and they commit unmentionable acts of genocide. The end sequence in which he tries to turn back the hands of history is as surreal as the atrocities he had to witness and incredibly live through.

"ashermanb","Null","1","2","27 July 2012"," Bleak and Enlightening
","Of all the films I've seen throughout my life, Elem Klimov's Come and See is indeed among the bleakest I have ever experienced. Taking place during World War II, the film focuses on a Bellorussian boy named Flyora, who wishes to join the partisans' fight against the Nazis. Among the things that impressed about this film was the fact that it shows Flyora developing from a naÃ¯ve young boy, eager to fight in something as glorious-sounding as war, to, in spite of not seeing much combat, a veteran who may not be eager to fight but realizes why he must. In the span of the film's run-time, you can see the aftermaths he encounters take a toll on his innocence, as the life gradually appears to drain from his eyes, until the end where they seem almost cold with hatred, pain, and sorrow. It is a dark coming-of-age tale that sends the message of how war is not something glorious, but rather, it is something that takes from you. It may even force you to see yourself and your allies sink to the levels of your enemies. And on a more depressing note, the ending shot leaves me with the impression that, while the battles we fight may matter now, time and nature will eventually make these struggles irrelevant, and forgotten."

","Come and See is the original version of ""Saving the Private Ryan"" movie by Steven Spielberg, he even correlated his movie to Come and See by Emir Klimov. This movie ""Come and See"" had a really nice plot to it; really scary and gruesome. No wonder it was said that you will use all your five senses into this film, and that was really true; the film made me hear what the protagonist was hearing, it made me feel how they were suffering in the war, what they were going through, touch what they were feeling on their skin on what they were going through, taste what they were tasting by the foul face expression they were making, smell what they smelled and see what they was seeing, which really impacted me, it made me feel like as if I was going through what they were going, it gave me a sense of trauma by all the events that happened.

It's impossible to say that I felt good, in any definition of the word, after watching Come And See. The Belarusian countryside is shot beautifully, its depiction of Nazi war crimes is terrifying, and yes, the fate that befalls its main character is heartbreakingly sad. But there's so little that is actually said, I was not certain that this film was actually meant to have a protagonist.<br/><br/>I'm afraid to say that I eventually gave up on this film. It blasts horror into the viewer's eyes like a shotgun held directly up to one's eye socket, and it actually ends up numbing you.

"lizzzyj","8","1","2","9 June 2010"," Horrifying, stunning and powerful
","""Come and See"" is a Russian film that was filmed about the post soviet era. It shows how Russia was invaded by the Nazis. It was to me a very haunting and disturbing film that portrays to the viewers some of what went on in World War II on the Russian front. It starts off kind of difficult to understand, and I wasn't sure what certain characters were doing. But shortly after, I found that this was going to be a great film. The title of the movie is basically saying, ""Come and see what war is all about""...and the movie shows it like no other. My professor showed it in my film class and prepared us for the gore. It was brutally realistic with most of the scenes that will stay imprinted in my mind for a long time. The movie did stick to the Soviets as the good guys, but really portrayed the casual brutality of the Parisian warfare. There were two scenes that really stuck out to me that I felt were very powerful, but also so disturbing. The first one was when the main character by the name of Flor, and a girl he befriended have to run for their lives as bombs are being thrown all around them. The only way to get to the other side is to swim through a sewage-like swamp, barely being able to keep their heads above. It was not only excruciating, but disgusting at the same time. God only knows what was in that swamp, and they had no other choice. Plus the background noise and music made the scene so intense it kept me at the end of my seat. The second scene that I found I still can't get over is when the Nazis brutally destruct a Russian village. It is a horrific, and such a sad scene that I almost couldn't even watch. A shed was burnt down full of civilians in it...children, women and men burnt alive. You could hear the people screaming and crying for help as the Nazis sat back and laughed and clapped, and embraced each other. And they all start to shoot at the shed also, the scene was terrifying and unforgettable. The sight was just horrific, along with the yodeling and music in the back round. The whole scene was just a gruesome massacre. The ending I found to be quite touching in an odd kind of way, but I will leave that for the viewers. Overall I found the movie to be really good as I rarely watch films like this. It did remind me a little of ""Saving Private Ryan"", which was another horrifying war movie that I had seen a long time ago. ""Come and See"" is a great movie as long as you are prepared to be shocked and see some brutal scenes. But it is a take on the reality of what can, and does go on at war. I think it is a film that if not all, at least most adults should see."
"ramzi60","10","1","2","4 August 2009"," Makes Saving Private Ryan look like M.A.S.H
","This is, quite without hyperbole, the best war movie I have ever seen. Of all the films, in fact of all the books and museum exhibits and documentaries and works of art I've seen, this comes closest of any of them to truly capturing the unglamorous reality of war. Come and See really does make every other war movie I've seen look sanitized and limp by comparison. There is no real heroism, no catharsis, no false assurances that the good will out in the end: only brutality and its victims and witnesses.<br/><br/>The war between Germany and Russia was the most destructive war in human history. Millions of people were slaughtered in a conflict in which virtually no distinction was made between combatants and non-combatants. It is appropriate that this movie is so unsparing of its audience. Given the subject matter, any film that didn't shock and horrify would probably border on untruth.<br/><br/>The movie is set in Belarus in 1943. From the very first there is a sense of dread. We see the movie's main character, Florya, pulling a rifle out of the sand, then a plane flies over him and his friend and we see them from the pilot's perspective: small, diminished, vulnerable, a microcosm of the civilian population destroyed by the Germans on their thrust eastwards. In the next scene we see Florya being taken away by Partisans, despite the entreaties of his anxious mother. They put on a show of dragging him away in front of the other villagers but in fact Florya is happy to go. He positively beams with pride and enthusiasm. His face throughout the film is a powerful reflection of what is going on around him. By the end, it is a mask of trauma and pain: he looks like he's aged twenty years.<br/><br/>Florya links up with a band of Partisans in the forest. He is left behind after they set off and links up with Glasha, a beautiful if somewhat creepy nurse who looks like a Slavic Kirsten Dunst. The Germans bomb the forest and Florya is made temporarily deaf. There is a surreal scene where Florya and Gasha gad about in the forest with a sort of Adam-and-Eve innocence. We are plunged into Florya's aural environment, which consists of throbbing and high-pitched whining and incongruous music. He smiles as he watches Glasha, drenched from the rain, mount a suitcase and dance a lively little jig to the accompaniment of weirdly off-tune music playing, we assume, only in his head. A stork emerges from the trees. This scene is pure visual poetry and, in light of Gasha's ghastly fate, it haunted me after the film was over.<br/><br/>Without wanting to give a scene-by-scene synopsis, things get worse. Florya is progressively engulfed by horror. At first the Germans are scant and elusive but towards the climactic scene they become terribly omnipresent. A propaganda officer assures the assembled peasants in that 'Germany is a civilized country' against a backdrop of barbarism. There is something very effective about the way the German soldiers are portrayed. They are not the archetypal emotionless killing machines. They act like thugs and buffoons and appear to have the time of their lives brutalizing the villagers. None of their individual characters are developed very fully. They are units in a collectivity of evil, too swept up in a pathological group dynamic to think about what they are doing.<br/><br/>The film's central event is among the most traumatizing scenes I've seen in film, a crescendo of butchery which grimly completes the film. Come and See may have been used as propaganda but it still rings far truer, in my opinion, than Saving Private Ryan or Schindler's List or any other Hollywood war film praised for its 'realism'. It is the most affecting movie I have seen in a long time and from this day forward will be the standard bearer for any war movie I see."

","This is, without a doubt, the most intense and grueling war movie I have ever seen. The entire film is a complete onslaught of the senses. It is the story of a young boy named Florya and his small Soviet village during the Nazi invasion of World War II. At first, naive to the reality of war, Florya finds and gun and is excited to join the Russian militia-style resistance to the Nazis, much to the dismay of his mother. The time span of the movie is only over a few days, but the boy appears to age years over the horrific events he endures. The soundtrack is absolutely harrowing--as bombs are dropped and the camp is attacked, it's as if the viewer's ears are ringing amongst the chaos.<br/><br/>At two and a half hours long, watching the film is a rather draining experience. Notably, towards the end of the movie as a village is burned by Nazi soldiers. All the townspeople, including Florya, are forced into the building as it is set on fire. As the camera shows people inside fighting to open the doors, crammed into the building, I started to feel panic attacks and claustrophobia. I felt I was in that building, scared and completely helpless, struggling desperately to get out. The Nazis are, as usual, inhuman dogs who drink and laugh wildly as an entire village is burned inside a building, only allowing out adults with no children. Florya's fate is decided by the whim of an officer, who waves him away with a nonchalant wave as the troupe marches on to burn another village. The ending speaks an important message, as the Russians simply shoot a small band of Nazi soldiers, rather than burning them alive in kind.<br/><br/>I honestly don't believe that these things I gave away will take away from the experience of the film because this film is just that, an experience. It is a long and depressing and grueling film, but one certainly worth watching. The titles at the end, stating that what happened here happened in over 400 villages, is beyond my comprehension. War is not presented as courageous or glorious, but as it really is, terrible and traumatic. I did not sleep the night I saw this movie. Difficult to sit through but it should absolutely be seen by all."

Is it the very opening of the movie that brings this state of facts, as you're told you're just poor little bastards who can't understand anything of what's going on, that you'd remember everything keeps going on and on and on without you to escape it? Is it because these first sentences I can't quote are dedicated to the young protagonist in which we will entirely penetrate? Or may it be due to the almost unreal living reality the entire movie flashes over you? That very feeling that you could have done such things, in such a situation, that every guy down here might be anything we usually like to consider as morally impossible? Will you bare the absolute passivity of civilians -if we can call 'passivity' the fact of trying to save one's life by helping anyone stronger than one is? Maybe it is just because it depicts reality as it might be -not understandable, not to be focused on, not to be made or modified as we'd like it to be, but just as something you can't escape, that stands still when you're happy, when you're suffering, and dying..

I was really surprised because I didn't even heard about it. Came here, read this board, I thought ""Gee, this must be good"". It took one day for me to find DVD, and here I am - ready to watch. And everything went downhill since than 1) IMDb says its in Russian. Hell no, I couldn't understand a damn thing (most of the movie). It was in Belorussian or Ukranian language. I almost hugged TV just to hear some familiar words. There were no subs... I know this is not movie's problem but it gave me a really hard times 2) The whole relationship between Glasha and whatever-his-name-is was just a mess. It led nowhere. From the moment he saw her the first time - it was like was wondering why she is going with other guys and he was just sitting in a tub. It looked like he wanted more, thats what I thought. But there was no more. So I don't see why Glasha-character was even there. Also if they decided to add her - so please bother to tell what happened with her at the end (dead, missing, etc?) 3) Bad lead character development. The was no... lets say ""presentation"" of him in the beginning at all. I simply didn't care about him. It is hard to like a movie when you don't like / care about lead. 4) Some action of characters was just idiotic (first talk with Glasha in the woods, OMG. It was too strange) 5) Many posters here said about ""how great was the acting"". Didn't see that 6) Didn't feel the whole war-thing. (MAYBE is was just me) 7) The barn scene was stupid. Do you remember before the fire two people got out from the window. OK. Here comes the fire. Is it BETTER to stay inside and burn alive or you COULD at least try not get shot but go through the window??? It was about 100 or 200 people inside and all they did it's screaming? I'm not buying it. Maybe its because movie was cheap, I don't know about others but I was looking on empty barn on fire 8) I can think of more but do I really need to? I've got an idea that most of the people liked it because its Russian (kinda new, exotic, about the war). If this is the reason - I get it. For example I have a thing for danish movies, there is something magic about them for me. I didn't see any Russian people here, and I must say this movie is not very ""popular"" here in Russia.

The leading character/performance is great, often ""too much"" - in a sense that all other characters are too minor and supporting, less than e.g. Belarusian nature which wildness and emptiness provide additional value (btw, periphery villages in Belarus look almost the same as in the film, with minor technical accessories visible). <br/><br/>On the other hand, one should bear in mind that this film was made before perestroika. thus all atrocities in the WW II were committed by Nazis only - so the Soviet people were told and that we see in the film. There is nothing about Soviet partisans stealing and plundering, confiscating properties, killing countrymen for living further in occupied territories, etc. Thus, in reality, Idi i smotri provides rather lopsided picture what was going on in those turbulent times and can be regarded a great work in terms of visual only."

","There are scenes taking place that appear to be non-sequiturs; several lightly armed Russians going to some distant 'warehouse' to secure food in the boonies after their particular village has been savagely attacked (though there's no explanation provided to explain how so many villagers escaped the Nazi extermination regiment that left a mound of bodies next to a walled house on the outskirts of town.). Then we cut to a scene where the same men are running for their lives seemingly pursued only by a fixed and unseen machine gun's bullets. Not a clearly thought out scene! Another: Florya and a companion have requisitioned a cow. Suddenly massive tracer-laden machine gun fire inundates the area the three are in but the only casualty is one of the men. Question: How do you miss a standing cow in the field? (Answer: The cow is then killed for better theatrical value.) The director, Klimov, born in 1933, seems to never have seen a movie. How else to explain long, long static shots of people that provide no additional information about them. He's also deficient in any editing aesthetic after 1919; Mr. Klimov: your time is our time and you waste much of it in shots that need editing. Even the extraordinary section of the movie showing the horror of the destruction of the village.....and it is an extraordinary war horror section.....has a scene where a Nazi officer, about to die a violent death, delivers pure pedantic-inspired dicta. Propaganda, not reality and the scene stops cold in its tracks while this character speaks. The reverse-images montage near the end is something the illiterate and unschooled Florya couldn't possibly have been exposed to. Why hang this lecture on the kid? Yes, a powerful film but heavily uneven."

","Russians sure do know how to make a boring movie, no matter how interesting the story is.<br/><br/>""Come and See"" is an intense true story about a kind and quiet Russian boy who looks for a gun, which could be his ticket to join the Soviet Army. Little does he know the horrors that will come once he does join the army.<br/><br/>It started out pretty good, but it soon got to a point where it all felt messy and nauseating, kind of like the feeling I get when watching an overly artsy Nicolas Roeg film. My only problem with it was that I might've not been in the right mood to enjoy a film like this, but I can't disagree with others calling it a masterpiece. Apart from that, some parts were very uncinematic and the editing was horrible.<br/><br/>The best part of the film has got to be the natural cinematography, without it there probably wouldn't be much to talk about. I loved the point of view shots, they made me feel really uncomfortable. Some dialogue was pretty good and there were some scenes that were extremely tense, too bad they were followed by other scenes of boredom and nonsense.<br/><br/>I've got to also point out how I loved the way the movie established so many characters in no time by doing simple things like taking a picture and seeing their reactions as they walked towards the group and how they posed was enough to tell me who these guys were. Once again, I have to say the camera work was brilliant, it reminded me of the similar work in ""Children of Men"" and ""There Will Be Blood"".<br/><br/>Towards the end I kept thinking this would make a great double bill to watch before ""Inglourious Basterds"", for that way you wouldn't look away when the ""Bear Jew"" beats the Nazi who doesn't give Aldo Raine the information he asks him for. There's a sense of realism the movie brings that makes it so discomforting to the viewer, even the bullets used in the movie were real and they even killed a cow. I'm not saying it's just an okay movie, its actually a great movie, but it's not a movie I'd like to see ever again as it left me feeling real bad and might've just ruined my day.<br/><br/>I'd recommend it to anyone who liked ""Apocalypse Now"", ""Full Metal Jacket"", ""The Thin Red Line"", ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", ""The Pianist"", and/or ""Requiem for a Dream""."

","Many little boys have had the same dreams and aspirations as the young Flyora has, to serve his country for glory and honour. Most have not gone through what he experiences in Come and See. The first image is of an old man who is slyly employing reverse psychology to get the boys to stop digging for weapons. He screams himself hoarse like a withered drill sergeant; later as he is found covered in burns inflicted by the Germans, he again heeds his warning, but it is too late. There is no doubt he speaks from experience - he knows the war's terrors, but perhaps he also knows the childlike excitement of playing guns and wanting to march off to defend his country. He, like Flyora's mother, is trying desperately to stop this vicious cycle. She acts exasperated at Flyora's antics, and his desire to join the troops. He is given the old 'act like an adult' treatment as she tells him to brandish the gun and kill them now (because him going off to war would mean the same thing). But as soon as the dream becomes reality Flyora is once again her baby boy, and she whimpers and tries to coddle and hold onto him in vain. <br/><br/>An interesting mentality portrayed here is the soldier's treatment of the war as an opportunity to pose and mould their image. There is a sequence where the camp gathers around for a comradely group shot - they jeer and push and shove and grin, and it seems all fine and dandy. What the camera doesn't capture is the harsh reality of the conditions they endure. Some of the film's most indelible images are not of violence, but of the sheer filth and grim of the camp's various facilities; Flyora scrubbing uniforms in a great big pot of boiling water, and a great, grey chunk of smoking meat (the animal is indistinguishable) rising from a similar pot (the connection is easily established and harder to forget). Later the Germans pose too; in one of the film's iconic shots, a gun is held to the terrified boy's head, and no doubt that photo is going to be framed and used for further purposes. Klimov touches on this theme, perhaps not with the greatest nuance or detail. Here it exists as a simple metaphor - of war being a posed experience for the wider public, for the young boys back home who see only white smiles and shiny guns. Come and See is showing us what lies underneath. <br/><br/>And yet, has the message seeped into Flyora? The film's events continually hurtle towards him, bringing wave of devastation after devastation. But even halfway in when we are convinced this is hell, Flyora still maintains that the soldier is an honourable mantle as he shouts to the farmer. See how periodically Klimov inserts moments of him caressing and cleaning his rifle like an infant child, even after he has seen the destruction that can be released from its barrel. He grips it tightly after he has lost his family, like it is the only comfort he has left in the world, refusing to let go and be rendered vulnerable. And it is not even certain that he has registered the deaths either; as they run out of his decaying home, Glafira looks back to see a pile of bodies stacked up against the side of the wall like they were nothing more than firewood, but Flyora is convinced that his mother is still alive somewhere in the bog. Klimov shows great restraint here; it would have been easy to linger onto this shocking image for a lot longer, but the shot is brief before Glafira is dragged away by Flyora's delusions, and we are left gaping and wondering if what we saw was really that unimaginable horror. <br/><br/>The film's weakest moments make it clear that this is a product of propaganda, set to expose the atrocities committed on the Eastern Front - the Germans are simple, cruel villains that spit out harsh antisemitism (when in reality many soldiers, though they swore the Reichswehreid, did not subscribe to Nazism) and carry out their duty with almost a evil relish, yet they are also cowardly, folding easily under the steely gaze of the partisans and renouncing their ways under the guise of only following orders. The most ludicrous moment comes when Flyora is confronted with a portrait of Adolf Hitler, and footage of the war rewinds and rewinds until he is faced with the infant Fuhrer himself, but cannot pull the trigger. This reeks of oversimplification and sentimentalism; the young boy's turmoil and rage over the horrors of war and yet abated by the very innocence he shed only moments ago. It belongs in a Hollywood film, and a poor one at that. <br/><br/>But Aleksey Kravchenko has made what seems like a straightforward play of morality harrowing and unsettling. His early wide grins at being given extra guard duty are replaced by an expression that can only be the thousand yard stare, the lines in his face weathered and almost gouged in. They belong on a face much older and have no business appearing in his youthful visage. At select moments Klimov uses straight on, symmetrical head shots as a way of mimicking intimacy (Ozu used this technique quiet often). These give the hollow-eyed, blank stares of Flyora an immensely distressing quality, and we cannot look away, yet we also cannot bear to meet his gaze (though his mind is working more than his eyes are). The final shot is masterful; it assumes the point-of-view of Flyora, jogging mechanically at the back of the group, fleeing momentarily into the forest, but as if remembering just a glimmer of the feral, solider mentality of the beginning, he rejoins the partisans. And then he comes to a complete stop in the track, and we can almost feel the child inside him fade away."
"vladislavmanoylo","8","1","3","14 November 2015"," a great film, but not a pleasant one.
","A rough estimate of the content of Come and See is 30 minutes of irony and strangeness, and an hour and a half of surreal and nightmarish, suffering and cruelty. Come and See contains no enjoyment or relief for any of the characters until the final few minutes where by shooting a picture of Hitler we see footage of the war in reverse and get to briefly fantasize that none of it ever happened. And then the audience sees the movie end with tragic classical music that allows distance from the events and claustrophobia-inducing sounds that we've been experiencing for the past two hours.<br/><br/>Watching this movie leaves your emotions and senses drained from the sheer quantity of content intended to convey distress and misery, through the imagery, the sounds and the events portrayed. One of the most dense moments in the film for this is when the main character and a girl he's met are wading through water. This scene occurs some time after a bombardment leaves Flyora's hearing damaged, and a buzzing sound reappears here simulating near deafness. As Flyora drags himself and a girl through the thick swamp covered in a layer of mud thicker than skin, his voice and movements can scarcely be heard through the droning sound of birds, violins, and horribly dissonant piano reverb. And then after emerging from the swamp covered in mud, the thick surface of the swamp disappears, almost as if it was there only for him.<br/><br/>On a slightly related note, it's interesting that whenever a character tried to keep him stationary to avoid going out into further suffering, the place where he would have stayed, and in another case did stay, suffered a much worse fate.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie does a fantastic job on many levels of dragging the viewer into a place filled with misery. So whether that's something you want to experience should be considered before watching, because this is a great film, but not a pleasant one."
"Lee-Decker","7","1","3","4 June 2012"," Comic Relief in an Uncomfortable Situation
","I dislike gratuitous violence, loud screeching noises, uncomfortable scenarios and images of Hitler. However, the way the the movie, Come and See portrays these things is surprisingly tasteful. Taking on such content is risky because if the viewer cannot handle the content, they will not be able to appreciate the essence of the director's interpretation of said content. <br/><br/>I compare this film to the movie, Schindler's List in the way that it wrenched at my guts and did not let go for a sustained period of time. In Schindler's List, Spielberg used violence in such a manner that it was not difficult to endure. Instead the context of the violence was the disturbing part. The viewer has the power to differentiate between reality and what was going on in the movie. This was not the case in Come and See. Both the violence and the story were disturbing and captivating giving it a potent blend of horribleness. I felt sick and intrigued at the same time while watching this cinematographic work. There were some points in the movie were the director did allow a quick breathe of musty air to allow you to keep going. <br/><br/>One example of these quick breaths was a certain scene which I found gave the piece a dark sort of comic relief. It was when they built with mud and excrement a puppet Hitler. By giving this crude inanimate representation a ventriloquist's voice, it showed that even an object formed from the grotesque, compared to the content of the movie could appear light-hearted and comical in the eyes of the beholder."

The movie did show that Florya was sane at first but then after fighting throughout most of his life show that he was starting to loose his mind. Most people that fight tend to have mental and physical issues. The movie did get very graphic and was hard to watch at time. However, the film did show true realism because wars still exist today.

My father was not very pleased telling me these stories. It always made him very emotional. Now back to the film, just seeing the way the Nazi soldiers had treated these Russian villagers had made me very uncomfortable and sensitive inside. It made me think, how could the other nations not see what is going on here? Why? Ugh.

","<ul><li>Reviewed after a single viewing</li></ul><br/><br/>As everyone else has already mentioned, this is an extremely disturbing, gritty, realistic, and impressive Russian war movie. Having a young adult (although by the end of the movie he is mentally transformed far beyond his age) as the main character was a unique choice for a war film and is just another way to make everything in this film seem even more shocking. And this young actor, Aleksei Kravchenko, is a perfect fit. His faces and movements perfectly display the extreme emotional turmoil that any of these situations would create. The writing and dialogue was a minimal part of this movie for me (although that could have been because I don't speak the language and had to focus on subtitles) but the message is easily communicated across any language barriers simply because of the bleak imagery and this feeling of dread and horror that I rarely come across even in legitimate horror movies. War is hell. I think that's the point of the movie and it definitely succeeds in showing that. There are way too many brilliant, memorable, but disgusting scenes of wartime atrocities, some of them bordering on surrealistic hallucinations (similar to some parts of Apocalypse Now), especially with the help of a very strange and unsettling drone/ambient soundtrack meant to simulate the confusion of bombings and shellshock. There are parts that drag a little bit, but not for long. Powerful scenes are spread evenly throughout the film and at the end the viewer should be left ragged. I certainly was. Some of the worst moments are stuck in my head whenever this movie comes to mind. Although this is a brilliant movie, it's hard for me to say I really enjoyed it, seeing as I usually enjoy lighthearted and beautiful movies. It was hard to watch but for all the right reasons. So on two different scales:<br/><br/>Enjoyment: 6/10 Quality: 8/10 Would I watch again?: Of course, with the proper mental preparation haha"

I can believe this really happened like the film shows.

"joemargolies","6","1","6","21 April 2013"," Come and See, but Don't Return
","Kilmov's 1985 film Come and See is a harrowing war drama that marks an unmistakable departure from war films of the Thaw era that preceded it. Whereas earlier films used World War II largely as a backdrop for psychological exploration of the people who lived through and after its trials, Come and See is truly a film about the War. The title, an allusion to the destruction wrought by the four horsemen of the apocalypse, relates the film to the 1962 film Ivan's Childhood, in which these apocalyptic harbingers were also featured, in addition to featuring a young man ripped too early into maturity as the central protagonist.<br/><br/>From the beginning, Come and See is a series of violent, arduous events almost totally devoid of respite. Florya, the protagonist, finds a gun buried with a corpse in the sand near his village, and uses it to join the Belorussian Partisan Forces. When he is left behind in reserve, the reality of war's harshness settles in as the camp is bombed, his village is massacred, and he is tossed among seemingly endless episodes of death and destruction, ever pursued by the lazy circling of buzzard-like German airplanes.<br/><br/>The devastation is so constant that Florya's development throughout the ordeal is manifested largely in an almost perpetually present mask of fear stretched across his face, at times pierced by cries of anguish. In one memorable scene, Florya watches as Nazi troops slaughter an entire village by locking them in a church, lobbing grenades inside, setting the structure on fire, opening fire with machine guns, and initiating a final conflagration with a flamethrower. Their actions are quite literally overkill, completely gratuitous violence, reminiscent of the film as a whole, which shows many more scenes of violence than are necessary merely to express how much destruction the Germans wrought in Belorussia. Each one is nonetheless meaningful, portraying how awful the conflict really was for peasants and their families. <br/><br/>Come and See achieves its effect through powerful visuals and sounds. The harrowing atmosphere created by the events on screen is echoed by the jarring buzzing of tinnitus, airplanes, flies, and machine guns, and unsettling situations are in turn mirrored by unsettling shots. When Florya is left behind in the woods and finds Glasha, two young children in an environment that is distinctly not child-friendly are framed dead-center during their conversation, an unnerving method of filming that marks the scene as all wrong. This combination of disconcerting plot, shots, and sound creates a film that is comprehensively disturbing, but very powerful.<br/><br/>This relative torture of the viewer is important to make clear the anguish constantly bearing down on Florya, the result of which is underscored in the final scene. Florya, who has lost his village, family, friends, and innocence in a very short period of time, fires his rifle–his blessing and curse–for the first time in the film at a portrait of Hitler. As he fires, he imagines the Nazi rise to power occurring in reverse, but when it reverses far enough to become a baby Hitler on his mother's lap, Florya cannot bring himself to fire. His face has become old and grizzled from his harsh ordeal, but he retains his humanity despite his anger and what he has seen. There is no happy ending to this film, but given all that has happened, it ends as hopefully as it reasonably could, with Florya running to join the ranks of his comrades in the woods, leaving the destruction–at least temporarily–behind. As a whole Come and See depicts physical and emotional devastation from beginning to end, but is nonetheless worth seeing for a realistic portrayal of the most grotesque horrors of war."

","I know most of the titles from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die pretty well, some have remained in my memory that I have either seen or have been meaning to see and remember the titles, and this Russian / Belarusian film was one of the titles I remember reading and wanted to see. Basically set in 1943, during World War II, this film follows young Belorussian boy Florya Gaishun (Aleksey Kravchenko) who is thrust into the brutal and atrocious world of the war happening. He is forced into joining the fight with the Soviet resistance who are hardly equipped at all and feel hopeless because of this, and going against the savage German forces becomes more dangerous as they invade the various countries. Florya witness terrifying and horrifying situations such as fellow soldiers killed in action, many explosions and all forms of violence, and with all this happening he slowly loses his youthful innocence, and more importantly his mental state. The end sees him truly lose his mind when it all seems to be over for him, having been through all the brutal events, and he simply looks at a photograph of Adolph Hitler, he sees flashes of his rise to power in reverse, and finally having a weapon he attacks this photograph. Also starring Olga Mironova as Glasha, Liubomiras Lauciavicius as Kosach and Vladas Bagdonas. Kravchenko gives a great dark performance as the boy who goes through absolute hell and naturally loses the plot until he is pretty much completely broken down, the film has good use of colour to create mood, there is some impressive camera-work during the battle sequences and travelling through the woods, and the war sequences filled with violence and suspense are suitably gripping, so although there are the odd slow moments and it can be hard to understand all going on, overall it is a hard hitting terrific enough epic drama. It was number 71 on The 100 Greatest War Films, and it was number 21 on Film 4's 50 Films To See Before You Die. Worth watching!"

","The film follows the mounting mental anguish of a fresh boy soldier in the face of the atrocities of war  his face steadily more haggard as horror piles upon horror. There is a mix of familiar Tarkovsky elements: the child's embroilment in war; the forest as a kind of Eden, the cabin home of childhood, burning buildings. The best parts come early on during some beautiful lyrical moments in the forest  showering in a rainbow, the dance on the box, and inside the cosy little fir-branch shelter which goes down among my favourite movie scenes of all time  the stork looking in was inspired. And his voice goes hoarse after the bombing  how intelligent - only the Russians could have done that. <br/><br/>The largely ambient soundtrack in the second half of the film (to reflect the boy's temporary deafness) coloured the madness of it all by means of sound  a brilliant concept done to astonishing effect. And yet... I wasn't completely convinced by it all. It was over-dramatised in places (the burnt man's speech, for example, and the boy's face was contorted with insanity a bit too often)  a more restrained approach might have been more effective. And I was sorry when the ditsy Glasha disappeared because she really had something. The relentless depiction of the German army as a travelling circus of drunks, whores and eccentrics was superficial and smelt of propaganda... another superb film marred by the Soviets. Let's not suppose the Nazis were the only ones to have burnt villages. The Russians themselves had been committing pogroms like this for decades, and had done the same to non-Jews in their civil war (remember Dr Zhivago?).<br/><br/>The reverse-montage at the end also didn't work for me. There were deeper questions to be asked here, not simply about Hitler's childhood, but about humanity in general. The veneer of civilised behaviour is only skin deep. These events were not in the distant past but within living memory. Don't suppose for a moment that it was the fault of one man, that it can't happen again, that it is not happening somewhere in the world right now - that barbarity is not somewhere deep inside all of us.<br/><br/>The killing of the cow? Well, it's silly to want your sensibilities spared in a film like this. Thankfully, it wasn't gratuitous."
