"Snow Leopard","Null","218","287","26 January 2005"," The Conventional Wisdom is Partially Right
","The conventional wisdom about ""The Birth of a Nation"" is that it represents an impressive and innovative display of cinematic skill that was unfortunately wasted on a story that promotes a bizarre and disturbing point of view. While that is certainly true in a general way, it might also be something of an oversimplification.<br/><br/>It really is almost like two different movies. The first part, which takes place in the era before and during the Civil War, contains little objectionable material, and it deserves praise both technically and for the acting. The second part, set in the reconstruction era, contains almost all of the disturbing material, and it also is really not all that great in terms of cinematic quality.<br/><br/>Then also, the degree to which ""The Birth of a Nation"" may have influenced the development of cinema has very likely been overstated . The controversy that it generated may very well have helped it to remain better known than other films of the era that were equally innovative and/or lavish, or nearly so.<br/><br/>If the movie had ended shortly after the memorable and well-crafted Ford's Theater scene, the anti-war sentiment and similar themes would remain the main focus, since the effects of war on families and individuals is depicted convincingly and thoughtfully. In that case, its occasional lapses would possibly at the worst be called ""dated"", given the quality of the rest of this part of the movie.<br/><br/>The second half, though, is completely unfortunate in almost every respect. Not only does it promote a distorted viewpoint, but the story becomes labored, and the characters lose their depth and become more one-dimensional. The purely technical side, such as the photography and the use of cross-cutting, might still be good, but much of the rest of it loses its effectiveness.<br/><br/>Perhaps more importantly, it really seems rather difficult to justify the credit that this one film gets in the development of cinema. There had already been numerous feature-length movies, and most of the techniques that Griffith used were also in use by others. He may well have been ahead of the pack in terms of appreciating their possibilities, but that does not mean that cinema would not have developed as it did without this particular movie.<br/><br/>Just as one example, the Italian epic ""Cabiria"", from the previous year, has the same kind of lavish scale, is quite resourceful in its techniques, and is quite entertaining, without causing so much controversy.<br/><br/>Other early feature-length films also include some creative efforts to adapt film-making techniques to longer running times and more complex stories. Finally, many short features from the pre-Griffith era experimented with the same kinds of techniques that he later would use systematically. There's no denying Griffith's considerable technical skill, but others of the era also deserve some credit, even if they and their works were less controversial, and are now largely forgotten as a result."
"Cineanalyst","10","166","226","31 July 2005"," The Birth of an Art
","Before ""The Birth of a Nation,"" motion pictures were a medium with the potential to be an art. This movie, more than any afore, realized that promise. It's the most important film ever made; it's the birth of an art. Alas, it's also racist.<br/><br/>The film's controversy appears to have left director D.W. Griffith dumbfounded, judging by Griffith's responses to critics and from descriptions by Griffith biographers. The son of a Confederate soldier, his prepossession for an antebellum South wasn't, if not still, unusual. Histories of the day, including those by would-be US President Woodrow Wilson, supported his perverted depiction of the Ku Klux Klan saving a South pillaged by carpetbaggers, scalawags and encouraged Negroes. The film quotes Wilson's ""History of the American People."" Thomas Dixon Jr. himself solicited the White House screening where the President is said to have quipped, ""It is like writing history with lightening, and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true."" Dixon's racist book trilogy and the subsequent play were Griffith's inspiration for ""The Birth of a Nation.""<br/><br/>In it, the American Civil War and Reconstruction disrupt the once-friendly relations between the Unionist Stonemans and the Confederate Camerons. The first part is largely free of controversy, although its racially-segregated imagery underlies a nostalgia for the institution of slavery; it's idyllic romanticism and melodrama typical of Griffith, absent Dixon. And, the battle scenes are excellent. Explosions, smoke and hundreds of extras fill the action. Future prominent directors like Raoul Walsh and Erich von Stroheim assisted the direction. The action shifts between bird's-eye views and medium shots, demonstrating vast scope with attention to isolated skirmishes. Including Griffith with ""Judith of Bethulia,"" filmmakers had until now failed to realize massive battles with such grandeur. To top it off, cinematographer G.W. ""Billy"" Bitzer's moving camera shot of the Little Colonel's charge.<br/><br/>The second half of the film, when Congressman Austin Stoneman (based on Radical Republican leader Thaddeus Stevens) and his mulatto protégé Silas Lynch lead the freed slaves into postwar power, is when the racism becomes especially blatant. Blacks are portrayed as childish morons or as easily-excitable brutes--harmless enough if put in their place, such as with the condescending ""faithful souls."" According to Griffith, it's the mulattos that are especially dangerous, because they posses the cunning of a white with the animalism of a black. What they want is to ""marry,"" which means rape, white virginal women. The film is sexist, too. This is most evident in the infamous scene of the Black buck Gus chasing the childlike Mae Marsh through the woods, to a cliff she leaps from to preserve her purity. It's especially offensive because it's so well done, except for the trope of the ""Little Sister"" ludicrously surviving the fall briefly for a last gasp. The photography sets it apart, and the crosscutting intensifies the classic last-minute rescue attempt, as the Little Colonel enters the action.<br/><br/>Yet, the Klan rescue is by far the most offensive and concurrently most exciting sequence in the picture. Griffith and his editors, headed by James and Rose Smith, crosscut between multiple actions, climaxing with the rescue of Elsie Stoneman from the threat of being raped, the Aryans and faithful souls under siege and the whole of Piedmont under the heel of a black mob. To that date, it's the most advanced, amazing montage and remains impressive to this day. Before, Griffith had found how exciting well-edited suspense could be, with ""The Battle at Elderbush Gulch"" and his last-minute rescue flicks, such as ""The Girl and Her Trust."" And a variation of Wagner's ""The Ride of the Valkyries"" greatly adds to the intensity.<br/><br/>The silhouette of Klansmen riding upon a hill, with the sunrise behind; the moving-camera shot of the approach; the angled camera positions: Bitzer and Griffith photograph it brilliantly, too. That is, besides the interiors. Theatricality is the film's major cinematic weakness. This is most evident in the missing walls. The narrative structure is also traditional. Griffith would never do otherwise, and it's certainly not unique for 1915. Filmmakers were beginning to exploit the advantages of controlled filming within studio sets by now, but the open-air sets with natural lighting, as used here, were still prevalent. At least, the sets here are decorated in detail. Bitzer and Griffith, however, were consistently innovative in their beautiful outdoor photography--with camera movement and positioning, tinting, nighttime photography and good use of split-screens and of masking the camera lens.<br/><br/>The acting is also theatrical, but Griffith did direct his actors to be subtler in comparison to contemporary acting. Lillian Gish rose to the forefront of this style, largely because of this film, which made her a star. She plays Elsie Stoneman, who has the more prominent of the two romantic relationships in the film with a soldier from the other side; she's Griffith's ideal white virgin. There are some especially well-acted moments here for its time. The sequence with Marsh using ermine in attempt to garment her ragged house dress for the homecoming of her brother and Henry Walthall's slow, moving walk towards the front door of home are especially poignant--showing the destitution of the postbellum South.<br/><br/>""The Birth of a Nation"" is a troublingly racist picture, which is said to have revived the KKK (as well as being the cause célèbre of the newfound NAACP in its efforts to censor it). Nevertheless, its importance in film history, and its cinematic merits are immense. There are other impressive works from this time: films by Bauer, Chaplin, Christensen, DeMille, Sjöström, Starewicz, Tourneur and Weber. Yet, to say the least about ""The Birth of a Nation,"" as far as I've seen, nothing before matches its scale with such filmic innovation.<br/><br/>It runs for 12 reels--having cost some $110,000 to make. Its vast popularity also had incalculable effects on movies as an industry, including the establishment of Hollywood at its center. Although other estimates are lower, Griffith-biographer Richard Schickel claims it grossed more than $60 million by 1917. Its influence, not only on cinema, is enormous. No other film has been as important to the direction of motion pictures as an industry and an art."
"Auburn668","10","168","238","9 February 2004"," VISUALLY ENLIGHTENING AND SOCIALLY DISHEARTENING ""BIRTH"" STILL A 10.
","D.W. Griffith's Civil War shorts were only a prelude to what has become one of the world's crowning cinematic achievements and one of its most painfully embarrassing moments concurrently.<br/><br/>To this day it still causes not only controversy but even verbal warfare amongst friends and critics.  But if films were judged solely on their subject matter many of our classics would have been tossed into the garbage hamper.  As being such, I will not let that taint my opinion of it.<br/><br/>""Birth of a Nation"" succeeds on so many levels its difficult to find a place to start.  Perhaps its best to say that Griffith may have considered what he may be starting hence the freedom of speech title screen at the beginning. For not shying away from controversy alone Griffith deserves his merits. His use of tinting is outstanding.  Some may say (and they may be right) that Griffith is the father of the modern screenplay.  His use of setup, turning point, confrontation, turning point, resolution, and conclusion is still the formula used today and is usually the formula that has graced every best picture winner at the Oscars ever since their 1927 beginnings. The catch:  there was no written screenplay.  Griffith made this film in his mind as he went along.  THAT is genius.<br/><br/>The battle spectacle scenes were unequaled in their day.  This wasn't another day's work.  This was a big budget, Hollywood, parade of the extras, grand scale masterpiece.  One gets the sense that the real war was just getting the war scenes filmed.  Father of the close-up, father of the chase scene (on two fronts: individual after individual and group after group), father of showing synchronous events on two different stages, the buildup of dramatic climax, and the list goes on.  Outstanding use of camera angles (the perch overlooking the valley during Sherman's march comes to mind here), and historically accurate enactments (Lincoln's assassination) score big as well.  This was ""Citizen Kane"" a quarter of a century before there was a ""Citizen Kane.""<br/><br/>The acting is surprisingly very well done.  Henry Walthall does a fine job as the star of the film but George Siegmann, Walter Long, and Ralph Lewis are three of the most villainous characters to ever grace a silent era film. And I would be amiss to not mention Lilian Gish who absolutely sizzles here.  After all these years she is still one of the most charming and beautiful women I've ever seen in my life.  Griffith obviously thought so as he used her in his other three masterpieces as well.<br/><br/>But for all of its cinematic showcasing, the film's image will forever be scarred by its outlandish racial prejudices.  And make no mistake about it, its a difficult watch.  As a white, its still difficult for me.  As a black, I cannot imagine.  It is so easy for me to sit here and say to separate its art from its viewpoint but that simply isn't realistic.  Should it be required viewing?  Yes.  Would I blame any black for not wanting to watch it or hating it after seeing it?  Absolutely not.  I understand where you are coming from.  The unfortunate thing is that the film could have succeeded without this viewpoint by simply making the south's new oppressors white union soldiers.  It IS historically accurate  to say that president Andrew Johnson did indeed want to crush the southern elite into oblivion after the war which is one of the things that led to his impeachment.  But Johnson, who is strangely not even mentioned in the film following Lincoln's assassination, certainly would not have employed northern blacks to do the crushing.  I understand the film was following Thomas Dixon's novel and play but to not even address how Ralph Lewis' senatorial powers overshadowed Johnson's presidential ones and those of Congress' 1866 Civil Rights Bill is proof enough that the film goes out of its way to make northern blacks the villains.  Griffith's only defense, and it is a SMALL defense, is that southern blacks are still apparently our friends.  Griffith was the son of a Confederate fighter which may explain some of his views.  But certainly he did not want to be a hate-monger.  He tried to apologize with the making of his next film, the masterpiece ""Intolerance.""  He certainly had black friends on the set during the making of ""Birth of a Nation"" but this harks of the classic case of the good man who doesn't realize that some of the things he is saying are hurtful.  I don't think it really dawned on him. This however is a trivial compensation at best.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day, D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"" is still a landmark achievement not just in film but in popular culture.  After its release film became a way of life for America instead of a treat you helped yourself to once in a while.  Not until Hitchcock would a director ever again be the star of his own films, wielding a control and vision so unique that their name is forever welded to our memory, for the better or the worse.  So many firsts.  So much controversy.  And controversy,ironically enough, has been Hollywood's middle name now for the last 50 years.<br/><br/>The nutshell:  absolute required viewing for all things considered.  Watch with caution and prepare to be disturbed.  Not being able to watch it is easily understood.  One of the 100 greatest films of all time...10/10."
"mozart182","9","114","167","12 October 2003"," Simple in appearance, but speaks volumes
","This is a film which every movie buff really does need to see, for two reasons.  1)  It shows how far the movie making process has come, and gives us all a way to truly appreciate some of the other early films, and how far the moviemaking technology advanced between 1915 and the 1930's.  and 2) It also allows us the chance to appreciate just how conflicted our society has always been, not just today.  Many of the other reviewers have labeled this film as racist garbage, but it truly does represent one group's view of society at the time, and gives us a great way to understand some of the driving factors behind the race relations problems we would have later. In particular, during the Civil Rights battles that would take place during the 1950's and 60's in the deep South.<br/><br/>The film is the story of two families, one Northern and one Southern, and how their lives would be intertwined during and after the Civil War.  It focuses on two sons who fought in the war, and the effects their fighting would have on their families, mostly focusing on how one son would go on to be the founder of what we now know as the Klu Klux Klan.  What I found most interesting is that a group we now speak of in such evil tones are represented in the movie as the defenders of all that is good and holy. When put in it's historical context and we realize that President Woodrow Wilson talked about the movie in such high praise, it gives us a real appreciation for how the world we live in has changed.<br/><br/>In particular, though, pay attention to the battle scene in the movie. What seems to us to be extremely simple special effects, were the highest technology available at the day, and viewed by the public as an incredible work of storytelling.  When taken in context, you can only be impressed by Griffith's storytelling abilities, no matter what you thought of the story.<br/><br/>While the movie is no great work by today's standards, and I actually found it very hard to watch considering it's simple style as compared to today's movies, I think this is a movie you definitely must see.  It gives one a real appreciation for how far movie-making technology has advanced, and makes us realize just how much different our society is now than we were just one century ago."
"jdab","Null","217","336","28 July 2003"," Bad History
","Anyone who thinks that this film depicts real history is seriously deluded. One commenter noted that the KKK was fighting for a good cause during Reconstruction, but not now.  I guess to him good causes include killing and intimidating freed slaves who were merely attempting to exercise their rights to vote and make a living.<br/><br/>Griffith's portrayal of Reconstruction black politicians is not only racist, but blatantly untrue.  Only in rare instances and for a short time did black representatives control any Southern legislatures, and this at a time when they were the majority of voters in many Southern states!  For years teachers of Reconstruction have emphasized carpetbaggers, but have ommitted the fact that the post-Reconstruction governments were founded with the explicit purpose of disenfranchising blacks and violently enforcing their underclass status.  For this reason and others, Birth of a Nation's claims to historical accuracy would be comical, if not for the horrific implications of the film.<br/><br/>That said, this film should be seen, mainly because it provides a document of a poisonous way of thinking that is by no means dead.  It also represents the pop cultural moment when Northern and Southern whites reconciled over the memory of the Civil War, mainly to the detriment of blacks.  Lastly, those who want this film burned only give ammunition to the idiots who still praise the KKK.  It's better to let these jerks hang themselves with their own rhetorical ropes than to let them claim victim status."
"smithmjsjsmith","10","51","79","24 January 2018"," Yes it's racist, but it's also groundbreaking and influential
","I can completely understand your frustration with this movie. It's no secret that it's a racist film and did result in the revival of the KKK. But you have to understand what life was like back then. In 1915, nobody had ever seen a movie like this. Not just in terms of production, but in terms of editing, length, casting and attention to detail. It was the first time in history where a ton of effort was ever put into a motion picture. When ""The Birth of a Nation"" came out, people began to take film much more seriously and wanted to see more high quality movies when it was brand new. <br/><br/>As for the racism, it was sadly a product of its time, but that's not to say people didn't find it offensive in 1915. Plenty of African Americans were outraged over this movie and tried to have it banned. The KKK would even use this film as a recruitment tool up until the 1970's, although this wasn't the intention of its director D. W. Griffith. He probably had no idea that people would be outraged over this movie, but I don't think he intentionally tried to offend a lot of people, he just wanted to make a movie that people would remember and hoped to impress as well as shock. He did just that, Birth of a Nation is certainly impressive and shocking. <br/><br/>It is offensive by today's standards and obviously a movie you could not make today. But I do believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression and I don't believe in censorship. This film should be shown in all film classes so we can not only understand how the first big budget film was made, but to understand what racism was like in 1915. I am strongly against banning this movie because it's essentially the same as pretending the racial prejudices never existed, but the views expressed in this movie does not represent me as a person. I only appreciate the art and attention to detail that was put into this movie. It is nothing short of groundbreaking and way ahead of its time regardless of it being the most politically incorrect movie in history. You should definitely watch the movie as long as you are prepared to be shocked and see film history."
"sharkey197","7","112","188","3 October 2005"," Consider--it's 90 years old!
","As I read these comments on this most controversial film, what is coming across is a surfeit of emotion that any film rarely engenders. I wonder if any of our modern films will be able to evoke such passionate response 90 years from now and the fact is, I think not. Yes, the film is racist. Yes, the film is a watershed for cinema. And no matter what you think of it, it's still got people stirred up, ready to scream and yell and be appalled, disgusted, outraged, etc. Can there be any doubt as to its greatness if it still has such a life today? Its greatness certainly doesn't lie in its subject matter, but in the fact that this silent film can provoke such reactions in a generation weaned on computer graphic images, a generation that views the silents much as they view watching a parade of fossils drift by. I am literally stunned by the power of a piece of film to move so many so long after it came into the world. Perhaps its greatest lesson is the impact films have on us and our society and how powerful those moving images can really be. Something tells me that 90 more years will go by and this message board--if it's still here--will be still be getting impassioned opinions from those who have just seen Birth of a Nation. My word--what immortality!"
"bbhlthph","Null","80","134","26 April 2006"," Is the historical importance of this film greatly exaggerated?
","I saw this film at a small ""Art House"" theatre when I was a graduate student. It was supported by program notes, and reviews of the film by respected critics, these stressed Griffith was a trend setting director who had made significant contributions to modern cinema. I remember three major developments were attributed directly to him, firstly his use of a mobile camera for tracking rather than bringing events to the camera; secondly pioneering the use of close-up photography in the cinema and thirdly the incorporation of pseudo-documentary sequences (e.g. the assassination of Lincoln) into a fictional story. I therefore watched this film with great anticipation; but as something of a young idealist I was more and more sickened by what I then felt was glorification of the KKK, and afterwards I was bitterly disappointed by my evening. I decided that if I ever watched TBOAN again it would only be when I was better informed both about American history of the period and about the work of other contemporary Hollywood film-makers. It is now 60 years later and I see ""The Birth of A Nation"" is scheduled to be screened on TCM next month, so probably the time has come to watch it again; and perhaps comments based on my original viewing so long ago may be appropriate at this time as the impressions I now have of this film will be those that have been with me for most of my life.<br/><br/>Films showing conflicts must present both sides as believing utterly in the righteousness of their cause; but historical films also have at least a moral responsibility to ensure the material shown has some reasonable approximation to historical accuracy, and whenever possible the convictions of both sides should be equally fairly presented. Most of the criticisms of TBOAN on this database derive not from its sympathetic presentation of the KKK but from the fact that this is presented as the only side which is relevant. We need to remember that slavery was introduced into human society back in prehistoric times - it was usually associated with a recognised obligation on the part of the slave-owner to provide a reasonable standard of living for his slaves, and alternative mediaeval societies from which slavery had been eliminated often did not do even this for their dispossessed citizens. Members of ruling classes everywhere lived a lifestyle which required the full time labours of many slaves or underprivileged workers to maintain, and only after the invention of the steam engine did it become possible to picture a world from which slavery might eventually be eliminated. Although this then probably became inevitable, its elimination has still not been completed; and in the United States it took place in an appallingly destructive way, part of which is pictured in TBOAN. Every nation has shameful episodes in its history which have and will cause distress for many generations before they are gradually outgrown. Recognising that the American Civil War did not result only from a dispute about slavery but much more from a whole range of economic and cultural issues, I appreciate that it would be grossly improper for me as a Canadian to seize on some of the controversial aspects of TBOAN as an excuse to condemn the film. I will re-watch it as a valid and important effort to document the concerns of the group of citizens it featured (although I will still reserve the right to feel Griffith should have made more effort to also document the concerns of those with opposing viewpoints.) My concerns here are directed more to assessing the importance of TBOAN in the development of the modern cinema, and I currently find myself siding with the relatively few users who have commented that its significance seems to be greatly overrated. When I first saw this film I had seen relatively few of the important early silent films, and it was easy to accept claims that Griffith's work was of overwhelming importance. Now I have seen other contemporary works; and have also come to appreciate that all surviving copies of about 90% of these works have totally disappeared (whilst probably half of the 10% of which copies still exist are not available for home viewing even from specialist libraries as the only copies are located in inaccessible archive collections). This is not brought out clearly by most of the 200 user comments on this film listed by IMDb, and it is so important that it has led me to pen these further comments. Film-makers in the silent era were extremely productive - Griffith himself is credited by IMDb with having directed over 500 films, most of them silent, and several other directors/producers have well over 100 films credited. Since so few survive, we must recognise how far our current assessment of early directors might change if we were able to see and compare more of their works. I believe that many innovations in film technology have been exclusively attributed to Griffith primarily because of the ready availability today of copies of 'TBOAN', 'Intolerance' and 'Orphans of the Storm'. I found this feeling very strongly reinforced when I had a rare chance to see a screening of Lois Weber's 'Hypocrites'. Weber was, for a time, the highest paid director in Hollywood and received a best director award in 1916 (ahead of Griffith, just one year after he released TBOAN). All I will say at this point is that, although I am admittedly relying on rather uncertain memories, I believe 'Hypocrites' was more stimulating for its innovative cinematographic techniques than 'Intolerance'. It would be interesting to know whether other database users have had similar thoughts about this or other early works."
"gkbazalo","Null","83","141","7 July 2004"," Good start but degrades into lurid melodrama
","I have watched this film several times over the years, and I find the second half dealing with reconstruction a little harder to watch each time. Although its racist viewpoint may have mirrored much of America in 1915, it obviously was not the only viewpoint, since America had its abolitionists in the early 1800s.  Griffith endorses just about every wretched stereotype put forth by the south during and after reconstruction, namely the venality of all northerners and the baseness of all blacks who did not completely bow to whites.  A good example is that the disdainful depiction of the black-run state legislature is based on a cartoon, not an actual photograph or contemporary description.  Griffith's portrayal of northerners and blacks is completely from the point of view of a white southern racist.  Although I greatly admire much of his work, he deserved the criticism he got for this film.  Aside from the political racism, much of the second half of the film is just silly melodrama, even based on 1915 standards and other Griffith work."
"satya232","Null","106","184","17 July 2000"," What does it mean to say something is 'Politically Correct'?
","I don't think there's ever been a more maligned phrase than ""politically correct"" out there; the words immediately evoke a kind of liberal pseudo-fascism that some would have you believe is dominating freedom of speech and thought around universities and media outlets everywhere.  I'm not so sure about that, but I am concerned at the counter-trend, of things that are labeled politically incorrect now proudly sporting that label as if they were a rebel, a David fighting these psedo-fascist Goliaths.  That is hardly the case.  D.W. Griffith's movie, far from being a politically incorrect movie unfairly condemned by the liberal elite, was a movie that perpetuated and, to a certain extent, created a Southern Myth that was damning to black people all throughout the country.  The scary bit about this movie is not that it is one voice amoung many giving a personal recount of reconstruction.  The movie is not presented that way, nor was it received that way.  Until the 1960s, this movie WAS the commonplace, everyday understanding of reconstruction, understood by both Northerners and Southerners (aside: notice how the movie intentionately put as much distance between Northerners and Southerners as possible?  The enemy is blacks and ""radicals"" (who were nothing of the sort), not Lincoln or the union soldiers.  The movie was trying to appeal to a Northern audience).<br/><br/>Anyone who ever complains about the political correctness or historical ""revisionism"" of today's academics, see this movie.  And understand, that it is the work of historical ""revisionists"" that are responsible for teaching the facts about our nation's history, grasped out of the hands of fictions like Griffith's horrific Birth of a Nation.  And don't be so smug about complaining of political correctness in the future.<br/><br/>And don't try to seperate this film as an artistic work with the historical perspective of the film.  Keep in mind, this film was not only a portrayl of history, it was also a *part* of history.  It served to defend racial segregation, lychings, and the Klan at a time when all three of those were very real political issues.  It is not a coincidence that the greatest period of lychings and Jim Crow laws came shortly after this movie.  In short, this film oppressed people.  So don't treat it like it existed in an entertainment vacuum, unaffected by and unaffecting everything else around it."

","This movie had the stockholders quaking when they saw the costs mount. It was the most expensive movie made up to that time, and it shows that silent films really COULD create spectacle on a grand scale.<br/><br/>One of the posters remarked on how ridiculous the Klansmen's hoods looked. Actually, the original ""ghost costumes"" were all homemade and there was no standardized uniform- some had spikes on the head, horns, painted faces on the masks, etc. <br/><br/>I myself had an ancestor who was a member of the Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan, and they saw themselves as guerilla fighters against an occupying power, not as terrorists. Today we can condemn them. At the time, it must have seemed to them that the war was over, but that the battle lines were still firmly drawn.<br/><br/>This film is a good peek into the attitude of the general public in 1915 about Reconstruction. It became a national obsession, and probably gave impetus to Col. William Joseph Simmons's decision to ""resurrect"" the Klan in that year."

","I've read a few of the 10's at this site and am a little surprised at the pass given to this monument to slavery, racist bigotry, and violence. ""Birth of a Nation"" is a national cinematic embarrassment. That it is well crafted is moot. If this were a movie that glorified rape or child sexual abuse, but was well crafted, well directed, and had outstanding performances in it, would we be discussing it's virtues as a fine piece of film making? I don't think so. <br/><br/>Consider this: Nazi Germany committed mass murder against Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Slavs, and political enemies. The plunder and suffering inflicted against these people ripples through our culture to this day. The fact that Leni Riefenstahl's cinematography in ""Triumph of the Will"" was ""groundbreaking"" is kind of beside the point!!! <br/><br/>I find the intellectual airy fairy commentary in the 10's section of the reviews here to be disturbing. Frankly, I think you people should be ashamed of yourselves for promoting this disgraceful homage to slavery and murder. Slavery is at the very least murder of the soul. But we all know that was the least of it's offenses. <br/><br/>""The Birth of a Nation"" is a bad film because it promotes a reprehensible ideology. The merits of it's production values are irrelevant. And not that it should make a difference but for the record, I am a white male southerner."
"AlsExGal","8","23","39","30 July 2016"," Great techniques and a horrible message...
","...yet I still give it an 8/10 for all of the ground that it broke. <br/><br/>When it was released in 1915, the Hollywood movie industry was still in its infancy as movie makers such as DeMille had only been there about a year or so. Most movies were made on the East coast and used artificial lighting which often gave the films a very flat look.<br/><br/>Most filmmakers would film outside until the late afternoon and then close up shop. Griffith however liked to use lighting just as the sun was going down as it gave everything a soft glow. These scenes looked better than anything you could have achieved in a set with artificial lighting in those days. <br/><br/>The battles scenes also looked very good, like a lot of care was taken to set them up and make them as realistic as possible. This kind of an epic was rare for the times and must have surprised most movie goes who were more used to short films that were often shot on sets with artificial lighting. <br/><br/>Some of the innovations of BOAN (it should be noted that while Griffith didn't originate all of the techniques used in BOAN, he was the first to integrate them all so seamlessly in a feature-length film) included night-time photography-Billy Bitzer achieved by firing magnesium flares into the night for the split-screen sequence of the sacking of Atlanta, being the first film to have an original score, the first film to employ hundreds of extras for the battle scenes, flashbacks and parallel editing, and extensive use of close-ups, long shots, dissolves, etc. to heighten the impact of the story.<br/><br/>It's not fair to other films and filmmakers to say this film and this film alone changed movie history but it's definitely on the short list of films that did along with DeMille's ""Squaw Man"" released the previous year which is remembered as Hollywood's first feature length film, even though it is not. That honor goes to Helen Gardner's ""Cleopatra"" made in 1912.<br/><br/>Then there are the features of the story that give this film a well-deserved bad rap for having revived the KKK. ' There is the Austin Stoneman character who is biracial and wants to rule the South with an iron fist. He sets himself up as some kind of alternate President during reconstruction. Where was the real president, Andrew Johnson? Locked in a broom closet? This character was supposed to be a thinly veiled caricature of Thaddeus Stevens. <br/><br/>Since white Confederates have their civil rights suspended during this time, the state houses of the south are shown packed with the absolutely worst stereotypes of black men, with them eating, drinking liquor, and taking their shoes off and putting their feet on their desks during the chaotic legislative sessions. They are also shown as sex-mad for Caucasian females, the biracial Austin Stoneman included. Let's just say that the story is as subtle as a sledge hammer, but when you realize that its contemporaries considered a guy in a cape with a long mustache tying virgins to railroad tracks to be high drama, the actual message of BOAN may be hogwash, but the complexity of the story telling and the sophistication of the acting is to be admired. <br/><br/>That's why I recommend it in spite of the point of view of the script. Sorry for the long review, but a long film often requires one."

","Disclaimer: I detest the KKK and White Supremacy This is possibly the greatest film ever made. While it is truly deplorable in what it condones and promotes, the propaganda aspect of the film is paralleled only by Triumph des Willens. Watching this movie in 2016 is a constant battle between feeling sympathetic towards the downtrodden white supremacist and remembering that that very same person that the movie is making you feel sympathetic towards is an absolutely terrible person. This movie makes me, a northern Jew, feel bad for the KKK at times. I have never before, and likely never will again, see a movie that I have so viscerally despised yet admired. It's enthralling and dangerous. It comes as no shock that this film helped renew the KKK after it came out. It's an important historical piece and also is possibly still the greatest film made over 100 years later. You need not be, and hopefully are not, a member of the KKK or a white supremacist to watch. Contextualizing it into modern history is something that is incredibly important."

","A lot of people see this film as an artistic triumph. But the fact that it's well made doesn't redeem the underlying message. You can say that it was a different time... make excuses for it... But there are some films that are best viewed as a regrettable part of American history.<br/><br/>This film is quite simply a justification for the genocide and subjugation of African Americans and a recruitment video for the KKK. It warps history and attempts to manipulate the audience into believing offensive racial stereotypes to justify white supremacy. It romanticizes plantation slavery in the south, when in fact it was a time of suffering for many. Most of the black characters in this movie are just white men in black-face, portraying extremely offensive racial stereotypes. It ignores the fact that many white individuals did not live this lifestyle, and lived in poverty during this time (another HUGE cause of the Civil War which is virtually ignored today)and instead tries to rally whites to it's cause by referring to it as an ideal time.<br/><br/>The class I watched this with ALL thought it was ridiculous and completely offensive, regardless of race and gender. Granted... in 1915, it was a different time and a different culture. They viewed this film as a piece of art. But we're in 2009. Racial relations have changed. There is still an undeniable racial divide, but it is nowhere near the levels found before the first World War. It's time we stopped making excuses for films like this. This is nothing more than well made KKK Propaganda presented under the guise of history. I give it the 1 it truly deserves as a film that still exists in our society. However, I will give it this... Despite it's problems, it is important to watch this film from an academic standpoint: the ONLY reason being to understand our artistic history and the mistakes made. It should be viewed as a marker for how far we've come, and how far we still need to go to achieve true equality."

","This film is sometimes denounced as racist, and it appears to be when judged by a time following the race riots and black civil rights movement.<br/><br/>The black citizens are often shown as illiterate and ignorant.  They were, not because of any failing of theirs, but because of laws forbidding their education.  The carpetbaggers came to take unfair advantage of a beaten people and a large uneducated population.  Their activities caused a great deal of backlash, much of which was unfairly directed at the former slaves. That backlash happened at the time, it was not invented by Griffith.  The Klan is shown not as the gang of thugs and bigots most people consider it now, but as an army saving the people from the carpetbaggers.  This also must be judged both by the situation at the time, and with the realization that there were real wrongs to be righted (the carpetbaggers again).<br/><br/>Now that a DVD with essentially the whole movie is available, watch it again, trying to put yourself in the place of someone who has heard stories of the civil war (the Southern viewpoint) and reconstruction all your life, and who probably had a father or uncle(s) who fought for the Confederacy. It looks a lot different that way."
"ReelReal","Null","92","192","18 April 2007"," technically overrated, and historically laughable
","The technical: It's amazing how so many throw out their own common sense and swallow an idea if it's fed to them enough. So many people use the defense that this film was so innovative in order to excuse the extreme racism in depicts. First of all, there is still a dispute as to whether Griffith did indeed ""invent"" the close up shot and cross-cutting of scenes. But even if you accept that, so what? The film was made in 1915, during the very early stages of film-making. Just like with any industry, film-making was progressing, and such obvious shots were only a matter of time. To say that Griffith was ahead of his time is not saying much considering the youth of the industry. The film, even technically, does not stand the test of time. If it did, we would not have to continually be reminded that the film was made in 1915, and that's why we should be impressed. Citizen Kane was made in 1939, and it was truly ahead of it's time. The shots in that film wow me to this day. It just so happens that this film, BOAN, was the first to use simple techniques that were inevitable. (Some of which are believed to have been suggested by the cameraman, and not Griffith himself).<br/><br/>The history (Reconstruction): For those who argue that this film is historically accurate, I can only guess that you have another agenda, much like those who argued the same at the time. The debate about the reconstruction will never end because there was not the technology and a media capable of recording the events in a clear and unbiased way. The written accounts are widely varied, and debated. But again, let's use common sense. Of course there was violence and I'm sure some amount of treachery after the civil war. You have a new ""regime"" coming into a place full of strong feelings and tradition. Reconstruction would of course have meant getting rid of old leaders and old traditions, and it would have been met with opposition. Still, had the reconstruction been anywhere near as it was depicted in this film, the country would not have recovered and rebuilt as quickly as it did. I've read too much from both sides about the reconstruction to buy this extreme point of view.<br/><br/>We are in a rough time in this country right now. Should an anti-Bush filmmaker make a film about this time 50 years from now in the same vein as BOAN, it would depict this administration as Nazi-like extreme rightist who peer through citizens' window, randomly imprison Muslim-Americans and attack all underdeveloped Muslim countries with oil on their land. The whole administration would look like sinister villains and Bush would be a dopey puppet like imbecile. Of course, if it wasn't for us having the technology to record today's news, anyone with an anti-Bush agenda would rally behind the film and argue that it is historically accurate. Some might even believe it. Pro-Bush folks would argue that it had no validity at all. But like anything, it's more complicated than either extreme will admit.<br/><br/>This film was a racist satire of Reconstruction at best.<br/><br/>Quick response to volksgeist, from Canada: I've read all of your ""reviews"" and they are nothing more than quotes by historical racists and anti-Semites. Your agenda if obvious. Still, since your non-review made it on the site, I'd like to take the time and respond briefly to your quote. It is indeed an interesting quote. But, like this film, it's from a particular point of view with a particular agenda. Yes, Africans did walk among diamonds for generations. Yes they did have abundant natural resources. And, that remained true until they were invaded.<br/><br/>Perhaps, it was out of wisdom that they chose not to destroy the resources for wealth, but to live among them in balance with nature. Diamonds, after all, are not food or shelter. They are used mainly as symbols of status because they are ""pretty"". And now, people lose their lives over these pretty stones. Where is the wisdom in that? The natural resources of Africa have been diminished to almost nothing, and the continent is in shambles due to the ""progressive"" thinkers such as yourself. Maybe, just maybe, your ideas of progress are simply different from those of the natives of Africa. And considering where we are headed now, I'd argue that they were wiser.<br/><br/>Also, since that quote, it has been proved that Africans did indeed travel across the seas. In fact they visited the ""Americas"" long before Columbus ""discovered"" them. All your quote proves, to me, is that racists can be eloquent, but it doesn't make them any less wrong."

The first 25 minutes are completely unnecessary and it was like the director was blind during the directing of the movie. How could one not see that the same scenes were used over and over again and added absolutely nothing to the story. I cannot even say how many times I must have zoned out or pleaded for this soul crushingly dull film to be over. I believe that you must watch the whole film to give a fair opinion, but this one really tested the limits of my philosophy.<br/><br/>As I've said before this film is unbelievably long, 3 hours to be exact. 3 hours when it should have been 2 hours tops. Each scene takes an excruciating amount of time to watch. Such as the ten minute long battle of Gettysburg. Or the 10 minute long watch these soldiers march out of town. Or the first 25 minutes of the film basically being people walking around.<br/><br/>It disgusts me that this film has a 6.9 rating currently on IMDb.

"merrywriter","10","42","83","25 October 2006"," History is Never Politically Correct
","You cannot judge this film by today's cultural standards - don't put your own value system on this nearly 100 year old film. JUST BE THANKFUL WE HAVE EVOLVED. It's shocking today to see such a view point because victors (re)write the history books where the ravages of Reconstruction have been all but eradicated. Only 50 years after the war, Griffith had reasons to choose and Dixon had reasons to write The Clansman.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't made for the glory of the clan, but of the ""necessity"" of the FIRST clan as a response to the stealing of lands by Federal Officers, as the Kentucky Griffith family well knew. How Reconstruction went in your southern neck of the woods depended on who your Officer was. If he wasn't bought off by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, you might keep your house by paying semi-inflated taxes; if he was bought off, God help you- you were out, (that's why so many houses had GTT painted on them - Gone To Texas). Lee said he never would have surrendered if he had know what Thad. Stevens (Stoneman in the film) and Edmund Stanton had planned with misnomered reconstruction. The bitterness from the vengeance of Reconstruction is what precipitated Jim Crow which never would have happened if the Confederacy had been allowed to secede. The Confederacy never would have lasted more than 20 years because of in-fighting. For economic reasons each state would come back into the Union one by one. To be reinstated each state would have had come in without slavery which was on its way out due to the industrial age. Thus there wouldn't have been the loss of life or bitterness against blacks that Reconstruction itself precipitated. With only a few other places, it was mainly in South Carolina where the legislature was taken over by blacks who in the main did not have any education and were the puppets for the Scalawags (white republicans). Historical fact: South Carolina was purposely made the most to suffer (including Sherman's March which was worse in SC than GA) for leaving the Union first.<br/><br/>According to Griffith's film, Birth of a Nation was born in that little cabin when North and South had to defend themselves from a negr0 takeover (the film's words) - thus the clan to the rescue. (Being thrown out for taxes was more common.) Unfortunately the film, shown for 44 straight months in New York alone, caused the rise of the second KKK which had the most members in Ohio and Indiana in the 20s and 30s. After a scandal with the Imperial Wizard of Indiana, clan membership decreased with hold-outs in the South into the 50s and 60s. It was smashed in the 70s with today's off-shoot of ne0-Nazis. You can be sure the KKK is dead because they never would have allowed today's Mexican immigration into the USA and there have not been vigilantes throwing them out with cross burnings, hangings and the like atrocities.<br/><br/>To see the variety of plantation life read Frederick Olmstead's tour of and titled book 'Slave States,' to understand plantation politics. This dedicated abolitionist in today's terms would be considered blatantly racist. But you have to remember that the 'rebellion' started as fight to leave the Union and Northerners were fighting to keep the South in the Union, the fight was not about Slavery. Lincoln emancipated the slaves - a campaign promise he went back on, he said he wouldn't - and only in the South, not for (Grant's) slaves in the North. In 1863 seasoned Yankee fighters left in droves when their 2 year enlistment was up because they were fighting for the Union, not for abolition. Scorsese covered the riots that happened in New York because of the Lincoln's draft in 'Gangs of New York.' <br/><br/>Southern California in 1915 was not very populated, especially by blacks. The film industry had just moved there. ""Holidays"" were instituted for whole populations of nearby towns to be extras in films. (If you've been an extra you know that where you get placed in a set does not give you a clue as to what's going on in the movie or the script.) There were still a few minstrel shows left, black face was still semi-popular, even blacks put on black face to do their own minstrel shows. It was from this tradition that the not rare black face was used in the film, but also know that these were seasoned actors who knew how to take direction and ""act,"" it wasn't because a black person was excluded, even though it would have been too much for audiences to have seen a white woman falling into the arms of a real black man in 1915 (only 50 years after the war)  note: mammy's were OK, but this film's mammy was a man in black face in order act in ""her"" fight scene (Hattie McDaniels was not in Hollywood yet, there wasn't even a Hollywood yet). Even integrating real blacks in the film, rather than just whites in black face was considered controversial in 1914.<br/><br/>I'm a historian from ultra-liberal San Francisco, so don't call me a racist. History is never politically correct, but it IS written by the victors. That is why it is so shocking today to see this view point, which by the way was then banned in several places, including Boston, and there were plenty of protests at the time. Griffith's father, a colonel in the confederate army, had seen first hand the ravages of war and reconstruction. Only because Griffith was the first director with the ability to produce such extensive film, was he able to decided what to put on film. <br/><br/>Griffith's next film, 'Intolerance,' was his reaction to 'Birth's ...' criticism. If you would see 'Intolerance' before 'Birth...', by today's standards you would say, ""What foresight!"" (against the death penalty - of the innocent) and much more, his best film)."
"Style_is_Substance","8","12","20","15 March 2017"," Racial Insensitivity Analysis
","The recurring criticisms towards the film's portrayal of racism oftentimes include the use of black-face makeup on white actors, the limited portrayal of black people being shown in a negative and sexually aggressive manner, historical inaccuracies to favor the South's point of view, and the glorification of the KKK. <br/><br/>Black-face makeup is an arguably racially insensitive makeup tool generally used by white actors to portray black characters. Similar makeup techniques were used in classics like Lawrence of Arabia, Touch of Evil, and Breakfast at Tiffany's where white actors are in different colors of makeup to portray characters of other races. Black-face was less a fault with the film as much as it was an unfortunate fault with the era in film and the lack of job opportunities in America for black people at the time. Black-face was a tool within the film that reflects the time frame that was still plagued with its racially unfair history. <br/><br/>There are several notable characters that represent African- Americans as either being saintly by obeying their white southern masters, or the opposite by carrying out their violent and sexually aggressive behavior. While the latter statement is only really applied to one represented character on screen, most of the black characters are either neutral or as mentioned otherwise, this scene can be quite problematic. This is due to what one perceives the film as implying, as one can argue that this indicates that black people are generally like this. <br/><br/>On the subject of stereotyping, people suggest the scene involving a black man attempting to rape a woman, who jumps off a cliff to her death, unfairly implies that black men generally behave that way. It is not fair to apply stereotypical attributes, whether they stem for partial truths or not, upon everyone within a culture. The sexually aggressive rapist character triggers others in the film to unfairly associate the individual's qualities with his race. The film clearly depicts racism but is not necessarily condoning it. Furthermore, the exaggerated attributes of the mentioned character are technically held to the same standard as most of the significant characters within the film. Silent films are known for exaggerated performances to heighten drama.<br/><br/>A constant criticism is that it is morally wrong as its narrative is from a racist viewpoint. Beloved films consistently portray stories and themes from the perspective of evil. People consistently accept films depicting murder and other crimes, shamelessly told from the perspective of said criminal. Goodfellas depicts evil behavior in the form of organized crime, as seen from the perspective of someone who is and likes being a gangster. One can say the film does not promote such themes, but technically it never directly states it isn't. The lead character frequently and directly voices his disgust for regular lifestyles to the audience, while commenting on how superior his way of living is. Scorsese leave it up to the viewer's perception to interpret right from wrong, mostly with success. Goodfellas' depiction of violence theoretically could be mirrored with this film's depiction of racism as both display evil from characters' viewpoints who argue for it; and without an observable argument against such behavior, the audience can perceive right from wrong themselves. However, this can't be fully compared, as the film does provide a clear distinction. <br/><br/>The film does not condone racism, from my perspective. Like Goodfellas, it depicts heinous acts and includes characters blatantly arguing for a certain evil lifestyle; although, unlike Goodfellas, The Birth of a Nation includes direct statements heavily suggesting the evil content depicted is not necessarily promoted by its creators. At the start of the film is an inter-title that reads: is blatantly stating its intentions that are not to offend with improprieties and obscenities. Griffith previously made a film depicting the KKK as the enemy. Griffith, makes a test to his audience, albeit unknowingly, and their discernment of how differences in camera movement and editing can imply heroism to an individual. <br/><br/>Griffith argues that one must first understand evil and darkness, to understand and embrace its opposite. With such free speech, he demands the right to show whatever he sees necessary in the depiction of this historical event.<br/><br/>One can argue that such beloved films about criminals are acceptable to argue for and rationalize immoral behavior, when there is a logical explanation for such behavior. For example, a character decides to rob a bank for his/her sick spouse, and decides to kill people along the way. Point A leads to Point B. Indeed, there is a motive, but it does not make the violent behavior right. This logic can be applied to the film. Racism increases due to events including the scene mentioned above. Point A leads to Point B. There can be reasons for immorality, but justification is not necessarily acceptable. I believe this film is not held to the same standard as other films that technically deal with similar potential issues. One may argue that racism is not greater in immorality levels than other crimes depicted in films, yet many beloved western films reinforce racism towards Native Americans. Interestingly, nine years prior to the controversy and multiple bans of the film for its alleged racist agenda, the 1906 film Reenactment of the Massacre at Wounded Knee was banned in the US for its sympathetic depiction of Native American people.<br/><br/>The glorification of the KKK is constructed by the perception of the film's viewers. It does not appear that the film is condoning the group's agenda; even if the film was doing so, it is a double standard to find this inappropriate and dismissing it, but defending crime films arguably condoning crime and violence, and western films arguably condoning racism towards Native Americans. Now, there are those who do not accept any form of rationalization for evil in free speech, which is reasonable."

","My opinion of this film is a hateful piece of propaganda. I've studied film and while so many people say it's important because it's place in film history, that's secondary to the impact. This film helped the formation of the second wave of the Ku Klux Klan. These people lynched and terrorized Blacks and Jews and many of the US's prominent politicians, including former President Woodrow Wilson were members and supporters of the Klan. The film was screened at the White House and Wilson (who segregated the Federal government) lent his support to the film. The racism in this film isn't a joke, it's an advertisement for White supremacy and it had a horrible and deadly effect on many people's lives. The stereotypes in this film have affected Black actors ever since. I had to watch this film for a class on racial stereotypes. The depictions are disgusting and it's worse that films like this went all over the world- taking this image of Black Americans to the world, when all of the main Black characters were played by whites in blackface makeup. Placing this film in the proper context is difficult if you are unwilling to acknowledge this film contributed to violence against nonwhite American citizens.

","This mix of genres of the early cinema deserves a mention as one of the best movies in the second decade of the century. Technically, Griffith totally improves the good things made by previous directors. Acting is good, editing is crazy and the narrative structure is revolutionary. The movie offers epic war scenes just as romantic love scenes, and honestly dosen't look like a 1915 movie.
The first half is highly enjoyable, the second half is racist sometimes at unbearable levels but it's part of that old mentality. If you love cinema history, this is a must watch masterpiece."
"filipemanuelneto","7","5","7","22 January 2020"," Controversial, politically incorrect, but quite engaging, technically brilliant and striking in its day.
","This film was and will always be controversial, as the American Civil War is today. It is difficult to have a neutral analysis of the conflict and the period of reconstruction that followed, and I am not going to be the one who has not even studied US history to make this analysis. Nor did I read Thomas Dixon's ""The Clansman"" to find out if the film is fair in its adaptation to the screen and if the book shares the political and social vision that the film expresses. The film is divided into two parts. The first, quite consensual, follows the Civil War until Lincoln's death. The second part follows the following years and the first movements of the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Of course, the film is partial and is not politically correct ... expresses an opinion about the conflict and the years that followed, claiming that there were political mistakes and that too much power was given to blacks, that in a sense freedom was confused with permissiveness and that values, mentality and pride of the southern white class were little taken into account by Union policies. The birth of the Ku Klux Klan, in turn, is portrayed as a consequence, a reaction of a slice of southern white society that felt threatened by new order of things. This is what the film supports, I don't know if it was so.<br/><br/>In the film's script, two families portray the divided country: on the one hand the Stonemans, with a strong political influence in Washington, and on the other the Cameron, who own a plantation in South Carolina. The families have a friendly relationship, and these ties they are not broken by war. Proof of this is mutual assistance on the battlefield. Another interesting detail is to see how Lincoln, despite being the leader of the winning faction, was portrayed as someone very respected by southerners. Each family suffers losses and dangers during the conflict but it is still at war that Ben Cameron falls in love with Elsie Stoneman. In the second part of the film, Ben is an increasingly dark and worried man, and he is the one who founds the KKK to protect those he sees exposed to the abuses of the newly freed blacks. Some scenes are strong, like the attempted rape of Ben Cameron's younger sister, which ends in the worst way and is easily one of the most dramatic moments in the film. In a way, the little girl was the portrait of innocence in this film, and dies almost like a martyr.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is extraordinary. Whether you like the story told or not, it was a milestone in cinema with several important technical advances for art. The battles of the war are reconstructed with great realism. The cinematography and filming were particularly brilliant, as well as the historical reconstruction, done with great realism and rigor both in the costumes and the sets. Hundreds of costumes dressed up were part of this filming, which must have been an effort and marked the beginning of cinema as an entertainment industry. The music that accompanies the entire film is marked by diverse leitmotives, which were extracted from the nationalist and confederate national anthems, as well as from several well-known melodies of classical music."

","Few things are more amusing than reading the comments on this site by people who go out of their way to claim that they despise political correctness on the one hand, but that they believe that no one should see this film and that they wish that every copy were destroyed. <br/><br/>It's funny to read how these open-minded sorts are in favor of censorship to a degree whose closest parallel is Nazi book-burning. <br/><br/>This is a truly great film from the standpoint of the sheer mechanics involved in creating it. Everyone interested in film history ought to see it. It wipes-away the view of ""the Silents"" as having consisted of either overheated melodramas or ""screwball comedies""  played out against cardboard sets.<br/><br/>I bought a DVD version of this several months ago and I will admit that it's difficult to watch, simply because it has so little in common with our modern films- black-and-white, no sound, no totally gratuitous violence or sex, no fast-cuts or digital special effects.

"czulkovsky_po","10","17","33","27 October 2001"," better than ""Gone with the wind""
","""A piece of racist trash""? ""A disgrace""? Come on, people, what are you thinking of? <br/><br/>This is a good example of a movie that has had a very bad press it doesn't deserve. It is true the film is showing the Civil War and the Reconstruction from a very unique pespective, but that is not a sin. Actually, art is precisely about that: about showing YOUR perspective, not THE official perspective. <br/><br/>And if we go to the racist details, OK, it is racist... but no more than 90 percent of Westerns, almost all American movies about war (against Germany or Japan or Vietnam), or ""Gone with the wind"" (which also praises the KKK and it shows black people as good servants and bad free citizens).<br/><br/>The difference with any other racist artwork is, of course, that this is the best of the best. The cinematography is a miracle. The acting, in spite of some few really bad stereotypes, is generally moving: think, for example, of the scene when the ""Little Colonel"" returns home or the accident/suicide of his younger sister. Or Lincoln's assassination . These are immortal, unforgettable scenes.<br/><br/>Actually, the intemporal quality of this film can be easily proved by how fun and absorbing it still can be. The first time I heard about a 3 hour long, black and white, silent movie, I thought an appointment with my dentist would be better that that. It's the problem with filmic conventions that are not valid anymore: even Keaton's or Chaplin's movies sometimes turn to be really boring. Not ""The birth of a nation"". At the end, I just wanted to see a third part for this story."
"MartinHafer","3","25","52","23 May 2006"," sad relic of racism
","First, I want to point out that just about every nation on Earth has struggled with racism and this review is not intended to slam the USA. Second, though this film was one of the very earliest full-length films and it has absolutely amazing battle scenes and production values, you cannot admire them and turn a blind eye to the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I just read an idiotic review on IMDb that indicated they liked the film and it was essentially true! Huh?! I am an American History teacher and I can assure you this ""true"" movie is complete hogwash and a horrible testimony to our country at the time that this WAS widely regarded as truth.<br/><br/>Here's the problem--nearly all the black roles are played by white people in black makeup. And, when the South loses the war, these ""uppidy black folk"" then run amok trying to rape the white women, subvert the rule of law and spend most of the time eating watermelons and dancing to banjo music (I kid you not--this REALLY is in the film). So, according to D. W. Griffith's view of the Reconstruction Era is that the blacks took control of the legislatures and went mad with power until the honorable KKK came to the rescue!!! The most awful scene involves sweet and innocent Lillian Gish being repeatedly approached for sex by a black man. He will not take ""no"" for an answer and eventually she jumps to her death rather than to be defiled by a Negro! My heart cringes just writing this!<br/><br/>So, my overall verdict is this is a horrid film with wonderful production values. Also, and this may sound stupid I know, I recommend you DO watch this film! First, because how can you know about how far we have come as a people without knowing our past. Second, the idea that repellent images and movies should somehow be censored is repugnant--burying your head in the politically correct sand is just silly. But, for the love of God, DON'T TAKE THIS TO BE FACTUAL! If you do, I feel very sorry for you. And if you know someone who takes this for truth, set them straight.<br/><br/>FYI--When this movie debuted, the KKK was practically dead in America. Thanks, at least in part, the KKK soon became one of the strongest political forces in the country--all the way through the 1920s. This is sad but true."

","""Birth of a Nation"" is a film that occupies a unique space in film history. It is the movie that started all movies.

It has been studied endlessly over the years and Griffith's techniques were copied and expanded by the Soviets in the 20s. However, that being said, it is also the most racist and offensive film ever put on screen. It indoctrinated many people into racist action and hurt many African communities.<br/><br/>When anyone thinks about being a filmmaker, one has to consider that ""Birth of a Nation"" started it all. One has to ask are they really supporting a medium that was started by a hateful film? Are they contributing to the problem? This applies to people who watch movies to.<br/><br/>These questions cannot be answered by censoring the film or by marginalizing it.

","D.W. Griffth's 1915 epic ""The Birth of a Nation"" is probably the one movie that everyone should see at some point, just to understand the American mentality of the era. As far as I could tell, the movie professed to be an indictment of war. Of course, as is well known, it came out as an exaltation of the Ku Klux Klan, and possibly the most racist major movie of all time.<br/><br/>What one has to realize is that the era in which the movie got released was the nadir of race relations in the US. Indeed, then-Pres. Woodrow Wilson was a white supremacist to the core (among other terrible things). ""TBoaN"" was based on ""The Clansman"", written by Thomas Dixon, one of Wilson's college buddies. As I read in ""Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong"", Dixon's obsession with race was ""...unrivaled until 'Mein Kampf'"". The movie's release is one of the factors that spurred a resurgence of the KKK, and the period 1917-1921 saw more anti-black violence than any other time since Reconstruction.<br/><br/>So, we can debate the movie's merits, or we can understand what the mentality of the era was. Like I said, everyone should see ""The Birth of a Nation""."
"Don-102","3","29","65","25 January 2000"," Painful Opening of the Cinematic Curtains.
","I first saw BIRTH OF A NATION in a film class and I found it very hard to stay awake.  That was 8 years ago.  My eyes stayed open this time to witness a film of monstrous racism and an epic feeling of sympathy for the Ku Klux Klan.  Of course, I know all of the significance and importance of the movie and how director D.W. Griffith invented the language of modern cinema, at least as far as the silents go.  I must say that the influence, techniques, and  legendary status of the picture goes out the window because of some idiotic ideas and horribly racist scenes that made my stomach churn. <br/><br/>
Its a shame the first ever feature length film has few moments that can only be appreciated unless you consider them within the context of time.  Filmed in 1914, there are massive crowd scenes, re-enactments of critical moments during the civil war, and even the first known depiction of the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln (done quite well by the way). Griffith's huge mistake was to show the KKK as heroes and to sympathize with the Confederacy ideals of a Southern republic.<br/><br/>Word has it that Griffith was raised by African-Americans and even loved them.  He pays them no respect or even any credit for anything in this miserable play on race.  That's really the problem.  Innovative techniques aside, Griffith must have never realized the pain that is surely felt by African-Americans today who must study this film or even see it for its renowned ""importance"".  BIRTH OF A NATION is for buffs only and believe me when I tell you this.  I could not look past the white actors playing blacks as drinking, jumping, would-be rapists in dark-face.  <br/><br/>And what is with the ""mulatto"" who tries to create a black empire only to be foiled by the ""glorious"" clan members ?  Griffith shows great empathy for the clansmen who look a lot more ridiculous in their clown outfits than the actors in black-face.  I don't mean to sound like a civil rights activist (I am a white guy from the suburbs), but BIRTH OF A NATION is a document not only of the racism that existed in the 1800's, but also of the early 1900's. The first ever film to tell a cohesive story, feature-length style, should be forgotten.  Luckily, Griffith was able to redeem his social image as far as history has written it with some more imaginative films. <br/><br/>

"THE_Tetsuo","10","15","30","25 November 2003"," Excellent cinema, in spite of its propaganda
","It's hard to be completely objective about this film, but Griffith made a masterpiece for filmmaking.  Unfortunately, given his Southern roots, it's expected that he would make a film with such a disturbing message.  The truly strange part about this film is that the first half is very much accurate, yet Griffith sees them as a case FOR slavery!  Of course, the cruelty that the slaves faced wouldn't be put in the film for obvious reasons.<br/><br/>The film then delves into fiction for the Reconstruction period.  The ""Making of"" documentary even states that much of the scenery for this part of the film is mostly false or overwrought.<br/><br/>And yet I have to give this film a 10.  Not because of the content.  I'm a diehard liberal, but that doesn't mean I'm going to love every film with Barbara Streisand or Al Franken in it.  This film was truly ahead of its time and has even aged well.  No wonder it's been a successful KKK recruiting tool."

","The genius of Griffith is in full swing with this classic epic. Mr. Griffith laid the groundwork for cinema composition and structure. He was perhaps the first director to give the camera more movement and incorporate into the art form it is today. I realize that many of today's audiences would be offended by the subject matter but one must understand times were different. I believe the main point they were getting across was the ruthlessness of the carpetbaggers and other reconstrucionists imposing their will on a peoples' society and ideals. I don't believe Mr. Griffith was the terrible racist many think he was. This film should be based on its contribution to the technique and artistry of the cinema and not its political content."
"morganstephens512","10","8","14","29 March 2017"," The best
","Before you click no on the helpful button, you have to understand some things. Yes this film is racist. HOWEVER, a racist film does not instantly mean it is a bad film. In fact there are some great films out there that are racist but it uses the racism to help the story telling. This does that perfectly to the point where you see that this film HAD to be racist to get the message across. <br/><br/>Now that we got that across, let's talk about more things I talk about that make me say this is, almost uncomparitively, the best film ever made. <br/><br/>First thing to take in is the fact this film is 100 years old by this point. At the time, this was nothing like the world have ever seen before. Yes, films were a thing before, but none were more than a hour long and none were that good. This film was 3, barring 4, hours long. Not only that, but it captured things about basic film making to such a level that most people at the time, and a quiet majority of people today, are able to over look the problem mentioned earlier to see the art this film really was. <br/><br/>At the time, this film made over a hundred million dollars in the first year of release. Adjusted for inflation, that means this film had made nearly 2.5 billion dollars at least. Until Gone With the Wind came out, this was by far the highest grossing film of history. <br/><br/>I have seen this film five times and it gets better with every viewing. Every second is amazingly made, the over arching theme of the film, while gross and disgusting, at the time didn't offend as many people. Also the theme of the film really captured how some people felt at the time. But the film making of this is so well done and seen that the theme of the film is actually, in some cases, quite interesting. <br/><br/>If you are somebody who just not stand the racism part of this movie, only watch the first part. Most people I have asked that had a problem told me that the first half was pretty good and tolerable, it was just the second part that bothered them. <br/><br/>There was tons of effort and love put into this film on all cast members. This film was made on a budget of 100,000 dollars and you can see how well that money was spent. The costumes, the camera work, the music, and the lighting are all so well done and parts of it still hold up amazingly. <br/><br/>I'm not somebody promoting the fact that this film revived the KKK, or the fact that this film is propaganda, I am being realistic and looking at the film itself and the impact it made. Gone With the Wind was inspired by this movie. That was the first film that finally broke Births record at the box office and what many people consider to be a modern day masterpiece. Yes, this film also revived the KKK. Which was honestly the worst part of this film. HOWEVER, that was not the films meaning. The film was about the directors feelings of the KKK and how he thought they were heroes. He had no intention of reviving them. So it's not even the films fault. <br/><br/>Most people say this following statement: This is the first true movie that started everything. Birth of a Nation is what every film in the past hundred years owes its quality to. Good or bad. Like it or dislike it, Birth of a Nation is a film that is staying forever. <br/><br/>This statement is completely true. Every single word of it. Honestly, even if you never see this movie or don't have the courage of seeing the second half, you need to over look the racism and accept that this film, for everything it did and for the time, this is the greatest film ever made. The next best movie ever made, and it's a close one, is Intolerance that came out the next year by the same director. <br/><br/>I hope I brought some new light to the matter."

","Sat down to watch the longest version of the DW Griffith epic I had ever had in my possession, a version running around three hours and ten minutes. Clearly racist, even if it was never intended to be, the film is not really possible to defend on any sort of racial grounds because it was wrong in the day it was made (it really angered many people right out of the box-and it amazes me that Griffith would ever have thought that people wouldn't have been upset) and it still angers people today .Its a mind trip movie and while its aged badly it still has a great deal of power. Its the power in a the creaky old bones that has people still turning apoplectic when ever the film is screened because you want to cheer when the hero rides to the rescue, even though we really shouldn't. Remember that this is the film that manged to change everything about film, culture and history. yes the Italians were doing grand epics and yes the bits and pieces of what we know as cinema were floating around, but here at last it was all put together. a Huge story told in the most modern way. Certainly Griffith's story telling ability is stilted, it always was and always would be, but the way he put sequences together, especially in the later part of the film, changed the way movies were seen. Essentially this erratic film helped speed us to the present.<br/><br/>The film as entertainment is a mixed bag. Some of the sequences are so horribly stilted that they are near unwatchable. The black face make-up is bad, never mind offensive, its just poorly done.(and if you think anyone can justify, even remotely the portrayal of the African Americans you must be mad) The main story of the two families is horribly melodramatic. But at the same time there is something about the film that keeps you watching. The sequences of real life events are mesmerizing, the battle and action sequences (Including the Klan to the rescue) are spectacular and if they seem clichÃ© its only because they have been stolen thousands of times. And as melodramatic as the family story is you do manage to become invested in the romance. The film actually works as an entertainment, even if its uneven (which is what angers many people-they get involved and hate themselves for it). Yes I like the film, though to be perfectly honest I prefer shorter versions of the film since the three plus hour version I saw last evening was just too damn long and I hit the scan button a couple of times.<br/><br/>Is the film worth seeing. Yes. Though understand what you're getting into a film from another time and place that is a creaky as they come and really morally questionable, but still manages to be watchable. See it if for no other reason as to understand where movies came from and to understand the mind set of the worst kind of racism, the sort that doesn't realize its racist."

","Other people's comments about the film should be read - my brief summary is that the film, for its time, content, cutting and so on deserves a '9'. Lillian Gish's performance was, for me, simply sensational while Mae Marsh's character of the 'young, hyperactive teenager' was Oscar-winning material.<br/><br/>That said, I wanted to challenge each and every one who watches this film and who looks at the obvious racism (although it tends to be overly stated by many) to do some research for themselves on the circumstances surrounding the time setting of the film.<br/><br/>Many will shout long and hard (as is their right) that the film is racist - that it makes generalisations about people and groups that can't be substantiated. I would tend to agree with them.<br/><br/>However, I have not yet seen *anybody* research the setting of the film and say 'this is the way it was' and 'this is why the film is wrong'. To be honest, in spite of my research into the matter myself, I have also been unable to determine just what exactly 'happened' and what the 'truth' was.<br/><br/>To see the insertion of the KKK in this film immediately gets one's back up (it did me) - but it wasn't til I did some research that I found out that the original sect ceased to exist by 1871 and was only reformed along *different* lines in 1915 (and partly as a result of this film).<br/><br/>I have no doubt that Griffith misrepresented many of the 'facts' of history but my appeal to each watcher here is to research the matter for themselves - especially those interested in studying film-making - and to see what the true state of affairs was in post-Civil War America, compare it to that portrayed in 'Birth' and see where Griffith chose to re-write history.<br/><br/>Film making is influential.

"moimoichan6","1","23","51","1 July 2006"," Birth of Cinema ?
","""Birth of a Nation"" is a disturbing paradox : it is one of the most important movie ever made, but also an absurd demonstration, from both a historical and artistic point of view.<br/><br/>The movie is divided in two parts. The first one introduces two American families, who share love and friendship, before the civil war tears them apart and transforms the bound between the two families in epic battles full of blood and tears, where the two friends of yesterday are now leather enemies and have to kill and die in each other arms. To those bloody war images, Griffith wants to oppose an universal peace message, and that's how he introduces art in cinema : the cinematographic images are now for the very first time able to support and carry an universal message. Cinema is now considered as an art, with the equal pretensions that literature could have, as the opening citations of the ""Bible"" or Shakespeare's shows it.<br/><br/>In 1915, Griffith is the all Cinema and his art has no rival. <br/><br/>In this first part, the support of Griffith for the south reinforces the humanistic aspects of the movie : we are on the losing side, which goes with the romantic tone of the movie. And above all, the other characters are treated with the same compassion and respect than the south. For it's indeed the southern families who lost the more in the civil war (I mean in the in the movie...), as one of the most moving and sensitive frame of the early cinema underlines it : the Cameron's son, the only survivor of a family of three children, comes back in the family mansion in rags, where his coquette sister is awaiting for him. She lost all here precious beautiful clothes for the war effort and is now miserably dressed. He hesitates on the front door,the brother and the sister are afraid to look at each other, she shyly shows him her dress with a sad smile and they finally kiss each other. The artistic and sublime conception of Griffith cinema succeed in those poetic and melancholic images.<br/><br/>However, the second part absolutely and definitely ruins all this artistic efforts. And it's the same elements which lead the movie from the grandiose to the stupid. Griffith, indeed, has a very American point of view on art, which has to be ""bigger than life"". That's why the movie can't end with the melancholic defeat of the south, but as to show its re-rising. And this ""second chance"" will be the doomed the movie to the worth stupidity and racism.<br/><br/>That's because of this narrative reasons that the movie sacrifices the universality of its message for a a racist and historically absurd vision of the past. Griffith interprets Lincold's death like the starting point of a kind of ""black regime"", that the North tries to establish in the South, in order to create chaos and anarchy (?!!). This ridiculous theory is shown like a historical fact in the movie, and legitimates racist and stupid images, which contrasted with the humanist message of Griffith. We can for instance see the deputy's room of South Carolina controlled by alcoholic and sexually depraved colored men, actually eating chicken wigs ! In order to fight this imaginary ""black insurrection"", the Cameron's son, don't have any choice : he creates a group of white knights to fight it, the Ku Klux Klan. And the worth of it is that this group is in the movie the real heroes of the American union.<br/><br/>Even the right to lynch black people is given to the KKK by the stupidity narrative point of view of the movie. There're always in Griffith' a naive woman, who represents purity, and who dies from a tragic death. In BOAN, it's the little Cameron daughter, who committed suicide to save her honor, after a black asked her to marry him (certainly a metaphor of a rape). The black man is killed by the KKK, who ""only reestablish justice"".<br/><br/>It is strange to see that somehow, the racism of the movie doesn't have any impact of some judgments on this film. Sadoul writes for instance in his ""Histoiry of Cinema"" that ""Even when the racism of the movie chocks the spectator, he's even more shocked by the beauty of the images and the absolute perfection of their editing."" Pierre Leprohon also thinks that what's Griffith may think doesn't really matter, the only fact that Griffith sees the cinema ""as something which can carry his thoughts"" is important. And I can't disagree more. Of course, I don't deny the importance of the movie in cinema history, but the fact is, that because of its racism, it doesn't archive to be what it's meant to be : a universal and humanist movie, and a piece of art. It's not a moral point of view on the film, but a artistic one : BOAN ISN'T A GOOD MOVIE. Where a sublime effect must arise in the spectator's soul, only indignation stays. No, the ""beauty"" of the movie doesn't erases its stupidity and its incoherence but only makes his pretensions more absurd. And that's why what's some see as one of the most important movie in film history is also, and mainly, a bad movie. <br/><br/>Fortunaly, one year later, an absolute masterpiece would actualize everything BOAN failed to do and really give birth to cinema as an art. This movie will be done by the very same Griffith and he will call it ""Intolerance""."
"drednm","10","20","44","23 October 2005"," THE American Masterpiece
","Amazing 1915 film by genius filmmaker D.W. Griffith. The controversy swirling around this film since its debut has unfortunately overshadowed the significance of America's first feature-length film. Even though one of the title cards specifically says the racial attitudes taken in the film are NOT meant to reflect on current current-day audiences because the attitudes reflect historical facts from the 1860s. That said, current audiences should concentrate on the amazing achievement of this film.<br/><br/>Griffith was a master story teller, and Birth of a Nation is a great story, following two families (one Southern and one Northern) as they lurch through the Civil War and the following Reconstruction period. Griffith's other great strength as a filmmaker is that he knows how to use the screen as a canvas. Griffith's scenes are rarely stagnant, a problem with many silent films. It is truly amazing to watch his outdoor scenes because there is so much going on. The main action is in the foreground but there are always other things happening in the background. Griiffith and camera man Billy Bitzer virtually invented modern cinematography with these shots that provided clear focus foregrounds and backgrounds. They also invented the closeup, which other filmmakers of the days assured Griffith would confuse audiences who were used to seeing actors with bodies! Griffith's mania for historical accuracy continues to amaze in this film's battle sequences, set designs, costumes, and most famously in his depiction of Lincoln's assassination. Just amazing. His depiction of the Ku Klux Klan is also historically accurate no matter what our attitudes are today about this group. Films must be judged in their own context and not filtered through our modern sensibilities.<br/><br/>Griffith's stock cast works well here. Lillian Gish at 22 is a beautiful heroine and is wonderful as Elsie. Her forced marriage to Lynch (George Siegmann) provides her with some great dramatic moments. Mae Marsh is a wonder as Flora. As in Intolerance (1916), Marsh proves to be one of the most expressive actors of the silent period. Marsh was 20. It is amazing that they knew HOW to act for the camera when films was still so new. Henry B. Walthall has his one great role as the ""Lillte Colonel"" and is quite good. Miriam Cooper (also in Intolerance) has a good role as Margaret. Donald Crisp plays U.S. Grant. Future superstar Wallace Reid plays the heroic blacksmith, while the screen's first Tarzan, Elmo Lincoln, plays his assistant. Bessie Love has a few scenes as a besieged Piedmont girl.<br/><br/>Robert Harron and Elmer Clifton (both stars of Intolerance) play southern brothers. Josephine Crowell is the southern mother. Mary Alden is very good as the mulatto mistress. Walter Long is the nasty ex-slave, Gus. Joseph Henabery plays Lincoln. Eugene Palette plays a union soldier, and William Freeman has a great scene as the sentry who so longingly looks at Gish. Violet Wilkey plays Mae Marsh as a child. Future star directors, John Ford and Raoul Walsh (as John Wilkes Booth), also appear.<br/><br/>The Birth of a Nation is a stirring film filled with memorable scenes. Modern audiences have trouble watching the KKK as heroes but it's important to realize the historical accuracy of this film. And as in Intolerance, Griffith makes sure the audience sees his films as warnings against the evils of war. When Birth of a Nation and Intolerance were released, the US was not yet involved in World War I. Griffith's major point in these great films is to show the ugliness and futility of war and to plead for common sense, compassion, and tolerance.<br/><br/>Griffith and The Birth of a Nation basically created the American film industry. This film is still the biggest box office hit of all time when adjusted to modern ticket costs. in her autobiography, ""Griffith, the Movies, and Me,"" Lillian Gish states that this film made so much money it was apparent that filmgoers, even in small towns, went to see it two or three times. The Birth of a Nation is an astounding accomplishment on all levels.<br/><br/>That this film and its director continue to be vilified by critics who can't understand the concept of ""historical context"" is too bad. The Director's Guild of America removed Griffith's name from its lifetime achievement award in the late 90s. What hypocrisy. When this film is announced on a TV schedule, letters pour in condemning its racism. These idiots have likely never see this film.<br/><br/>History is history and we can't change it by editing out the parts that now embarrass us. Even today we live in a political world that future generations will judge harshly. The same greed and inhumanity that we see in The Birth of a Nation is alive and well in our world or petropolitics and American imperialism.<br/><br/>Bravo to D.W. Griffith: the genius of the American cinema."

","So, let's get the part where I tell you about this movie out of the way. Birth of a Nation is a story following well... pretty much the KKK. This movie is 90 years old, so some amazing amounts of racism are to be expected, although even then it caught people off guard. It's really racist, horrible, vile, disgusting, so on, so forth. But the influential nature of the movie, as well as the very amazing acting, design, and cinematography behind it.

Every critic recognizes that, yes, this is probably the most racist film ever made, a terrible revision of post-Civil War history, and a glorification of the KKK - ah, but it's so innovative, and so wonderfully shot! Ho hum. What I notice -- after struggling to root for the heroes, seeing as they are self-righteous bigots - is that it is so incredibly, tediously, ridiculously LOOOOONG. Griffith could've been really inventive and created a miniseries, or a trilogy. As it is, by the time you get the ""chase"" scene near the end that Ebert goes on an on about, you're so bored out of your skull you hardly care.<br/><br/>If you decide, as I did, to try and set aside your feelings of outrage due to the racism, you'll find yourself feeling....nothing.

","Without a doubt a shear test of will given to students of any film teacher to see if we really got the guts. An absolute challenge to make through, Birth Of A Nation (1915 dir. by D.W. Griffith) made me wish I knew more about movies so I could focus on something other than the disagreeable plot line and the apparently revolutionary camera work. the plot was slow moving and non-interesting, both before and after the War took place. I thought the movie would have been better off showing strictly the war, but clearly the writer had a different agenda. Thomas F. Dixon Jr. wanted to show the development of the KKK, but not only show it, glorify it. However despite my opinion, when I checked the facts it turns out that this movie was monumental, in the introduction of Motion Pictures into the mainstream entertainment market. That being said, Birth Of A Nation is a great movie to have knowledge about....but I don't suggest actually watching it."

"smithmjsjsmith","10","8","15","5 November 2017"," Racism like this still exists and that's even more sad
","Is this film politically incorrect? Absolutely. Was it influential? Yes. Is it historically inaccurate? For the most part, yes. Film is considered art and art has always been considered controversial. This was the first film to gain significant controversy and it wouldn't be the last. The film saying that all blacks are murderers and rapists is no different than Donald Trump saying all illegal immigrants are murderers and rapists. This film came out in 1915, Donald Trump made that controversial statement in 2016, 101 years later. Things clearly haven't changed. You need to be aware that this film is racist or else it might be a bad influence on you. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie does portray the KKK as heroic, it does make it seem all blacks are vicious rapists, but I don't believe in banning this movie because it would be the same as trying to pretend this kind of racism and racial prejudice never existed. It should be shown so people can learn from the past and never make those same mistakes again. As for the black face makeup, that was sadly a product of its time, most black characters in movies back then were portrayed by white actors wearing black face paint, it was racist back then and it's racist now. <br/><br/>Even though it was politically incorrect, there was no film like this at the time in terms of production and editing. It was the first time people began to take a motion picture seriously. The movie was seen as a book in moving pictures full of drama, excitement, romance and heartbreak. It's just unfortunate one of the most influential movies in history also happens to be the most controversial. <br/><br/>If you are aware that this film is nothing but anti-black propaganda, then this movie probably won't turn you into a racist. Almost every open minded person knows that the KKK is a horrible organization that should have never existed. But you should appreciate this movie more for its art and production rather than its message. There's been plenty of other stories with bad messages. Grand Theft Auto V is a video game about trying to become a successful criminal and that game has sold extremely well. This movie should only be seen by those mature and open minded enough to know how racist it is. It shouldn't be seen by a young mind who doesn't know right from wrong."

","This box-office hit by D.W.

What might come across as sort of racist was perhaps not always the case or just representative of one particular individual in that group.<br/><br/>Even so, the movie goes a little too far in some instances, particulary in blaming the black community for crimes and glorifying the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>But it has to be appreciated for its technical achivements and narrative structure, which was unlike anything ever seen. The actors also do an incredibly job, and it is truly an testament to the art of silent filmmaking that has arguably been lost in time.<br/><br/>This is a no-brainer must see for every lover of film!"
"disinterested_spectator","8","3","4","6 August 2015"," The Dread of Miscegenation
","A lot of apologists for the South claim that the Civil War was not about slavery, but about states' rights. There is a hint of that in this movie, with the head of the Cameron household expressing alarm that the sovereignty of the individual states is being disregarded by Lincoln's administration. But the main thrust of this movie is that the mixture of white and black is evil, and that it is the ultimate cause of the war. The very first scene depicts the first Africans being brought to America, which was the first step toward disunion. The suggestion is that it would have been better to leave the Africans in Africa.<br/><br/>But it is too late for that, so the next best thing, according to this movie, is white supremacy and segregation, especially in the form of slavery. This is shown as being a workable solution, for we see how happy the black slaves are, doing a jig for their white masters, whom they adore. The black slaves are depicted as being content with their lot, lucky to be so well cared for. If the mixing of black and white in a general sense is bad, the mixing of black and white in a sexual sense is a great evil. This movie is positively obsessed with the horror of miscegenation. And the mulatto, the offspring of such an evil union, is naturally the embodiment of that evil. Furthermore, the mulatto, being half black, is legally a Negro, and thus his lot is cast with the Negro. But being half white, he has the intelligence and the ambition of a white man, and cannot be satisfied with the black man's lot. He knows that the only way his position in life can be improved is if the position of blacks in general is improved, if they can become equal to whites, and thus the mulatto becomes a rabble rouser and a sower of discord. The result is that he becomes a traitor to both races.<br/><br/>There are two mulattoes in the movie. The first is Lydia, the housekeeper of Austin Stoneman, a powerful member of the House of Representatives. She is made miserable by the fact that she is almost white, so close to being white that it tears at her soul. She is Stoneman's mistress, and as such has influence over him, leading us to suspect that she has been instrumental in goading him to help bring about a Civil War to free the slaves and in encouraging him to impose harsh terms on the defeated South at the war's end.<br/><br/>A second mulatto, Silas Lynch, heads to Piedmont, South Carolina at Stoneman's request, in order to oversee Reconstruction. When Lynch gets there, he finds the former slaves contentedly continuing to work for their former masters, and even worse, still doing the jig and eating watermelon, so he knows he has his work cut out for him. Soon, Stoneman decides to go to Piedmont for his health, taking his daughter Elsie with him. This suits Lynch just fine, since he has designs on her.<br/><br/>The blacks come to dominate the courts, both as judges and jurors, so that whites are always at a disadvantage, and the blacks win a vast majority of the seats in the state legislature after the election. One of their first acts is to pass a law allowing blacks and whites to marry. In response, Ben Cameron realizes that whites can regain power by forming the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gus, a black captain the in the army, has taken a fancy to Ben's sister Flora. He follows her into the woods and begins making advances. She runs to the top of a steep cliff, and when Gus refuses to stay away, she leaps to her death, thereby saving her honor.<br/><br/>Now it is war. But it is not simply black against white, for many blacks are depicted as loyal to their former masters. Nor is the wartime animosity between North and South of significance compared to the all-important cause of protecting white women from black lust. When a bunch of mostly Southern whites take refuge in a small house where Yankee veterans live, the intertitle says the former enemies are united in defense of their ""Aryan birthright.""<br/><br/>Lynch wants to marry Elsie. He says he will preside over a black empire, with her as his queen, but she is horrified. So, he locks her up and prepares for a forced marriage. But then Stoneman, who was temporarily away, returns. When Lynch tells Stoneman that he wants to marry a white woman, Stoneman congratulates him, for he thinks that is a great idea. But when Stoneman finds out it is his daughter Elsie that Lynch wants to marry, he is outraged. The hypocrisy is simplistic and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back at the house where the Yankees have taken in the Southern whites, the blacks have surrounded the house, trying to break in. When the people inside the house run out of bullets, the men prepare to bash the brains out of two women and a little girl rather than have them suffer a fate worse than death. At the last minute, the Ku Klux Klan rides to the rescue.<br/><br/>In the end, the Klan is victorious, disarming the blacks and disenfranchising them on election day. White rule has been reestablished, and all is well."

","A spectacular, elaborate production covering the Civil War era of American history, with an unfortunate last half drawn from Thomas Dixon's fictional novel ""The Clansman."" Made in 1915, the film makes a sincere and documented attempt to recreate several signal events of the period including Lincoln's call for volunteers, battle scenes, Lincoln's assassination, and the signing of the end of the war by Grant and Lee. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it's hard to believe that the last half of the film is in any way historically accurate with blacks shown taking over government, dispensing justice, and running amok all over the South. It was, in fact, their disenfranchisement and segregation that defines the real legacy of the Civil War.<br/><br/>With intertitles calling the Ku Klux Klan ""the organization that saved the South from anarchy,"" from ""towns given over to crazed negroes,"" the last fifteen minutes play like the cavalry charge to save the pioneers from the Indians. Very excitingly done, with Wagner's ""Ride of the Valkeries"" in the 1930 version soundtrack, with quick and exciting cross cutting. Griffith, of course had done this before, most notably in ""The Battle of Elderbush Gulch"" (1913), also with Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh. This type of final chase scene being done hundreds of times from then on, thanks to DWG! <br/><br/>Also of note, many of the 'lead' black characters were really white actors in black face. Mae Marsh was still doing her frenetic jumping jack shtick, apparently these gestures were meant to convey ""youthful full of life innocence"" since she carried this into ""Intolerance"" (1916). Lillian Gish, also given to some quick hand flaying gestures, did them her own way, and showed us how expressive she could be with just her face, later perfected in her magnificent performance in ""Broken Blossoms"" (1919).<br/><br/>The last half tends to drag; it plays like a 1920s western, so I'll give the film an 8,"

The disaster that `Birth' brought was far more pernicious, subtle and limiting than something that can be recognized and changed by men of good will.<br/><br/>This was the birth of film as illustrated books using a slightly expanded vocabulary of the theater. Film could have been a new medium when it was born. It could have been transformational in the way we see the world and reason about it and ourselves. But the birth of film was as a retard, a small adjustment to plays. Griffith was from the theater and successfully found a theatrical formula that worked sort of: a simple play augmented by a context of huge action, here both the Civil War and `facsimiles' of history: things that couldn't be created on the stage. Griffith's formula was only an imperfect solution, but such was the potential of film that ""Birth"" became not only an enormously popular film, but also a pattern which still dominates today. We still think of films as expanded plays and demand the same things of them.<br/><br/>Some filmmakers (Greenaway comes to mind) have been creating films that live up to the potential of the medium, both reinventing film and fighting the pattern.

","It is really difficult to look objectively at this key moment in movie history, almost 90 years down the line.<br/><br/>Griffith's greatest achievement has to be seen in its historical context to understand its lauding of the Ku Klux Klan; here was someone who saw the Civil War and the movements within it with glory and affection, and who undoubtedly had very different values to today's viewers.  This gives rise to what can only be described as a flawed view of the race question in America. However, I don't think that gives modern filmmakers the right to change or tamper with Griffith's vision.  It must be left to stand as it is, faults and all.<br/><br/>Performance-wise, we have Lilian Gish and Mae Marsh, both perennials for Griffith, and both excellent, and the great Henry B Walthall, plus an entertaining short appearance from Joseph Hanabery as Lincoln.  There's also a small, showpiece role for the young Wallace Reid (as the blacksmith).  We have sweeping vistas of battles both in war and outside, we have imagination, scope, and energy not seen in films made prior to BOAN's appearance.  Yes, the politics are suspect - but this is film history, it is our heritage, and for that reason alone, BOAN has to be recognised for the great milestone it was and the influence it undoubtedly had on movies that followed."

","I see a remarkable similarity between the personality of composer Richard Wagner and the director David Work Griffith, pariticularly as it applies to ""Birth of a Nation."" Both have the capacity of creative technical and even emotion genius, while at the same time, a penchant for prejudice and bigotry. <br/><br/>What makes their work so difficult to judge is that it tends to slip in and out of sickness subtlely and surprisingly.  Their genius has the power to draw one into its fold, then manipulate one's emotions to its pleasure. Having gotten the viewer hooked into its context, it weaves its clever, overpowering spell of persuasion.<br/><br/>Their is very little to uplift the spirits here, to make one feel good about one's self, not to mention one's fellow beings.  Where is the love and celebration of life as it's to be lived?  Where is the joy of this precious gift to be on this planet, enjoying its richess?  Where is the embracing of each and every human being who is our brother and sister, and trying to empower them to reach their full potential?<br/><br/>I see none of that here, only a lugubrious attitude of hatred, superiority, and downright fear.  Parallels between the work of Leni Riefenstahl and her ""Triumph of the Will"" and ""Birth of a Nation"" are not without validity.<br/><br/>
This work will forever be a contridiction, and there is no hope in making it better.  We can only strive to separate its technical achievements from its low-level mentality -- or avoid the work altogether."
"moonloop","9","9","18","14 September 2004"," there are some films you will never forget after viewing,this is one of them!
","After watching "" Birth of a nation"" yesterday I really had some mixed emotions as most viewers will probably have. A good film for me is one I keep thinking about, for its story or its images,or both.And this is certainly the case with Birth of a nation.<br/><br/>I understand that many people will say,how can you like a film in which the Ku-Klux-Klan are the saviors,that is plain racist and historical wrong? So despite these arguments why did I enjoy this film so much ? First it's story. It got to me from the very beginning.Griffith knew how to mix the big events and the more common,everyday-ones.In this case the American civil war and the influences on two families,the Stonemans who live in the north and the Camerons from the south.Two families that are connected through their sons and daughters who are friends.Maybe a bit predictable but Griffith makes you care.He pictures the battlefield and the horror of this war perfectly.On the front where the soldiers die but also on the homefront, where families are attacked in their homes, and of course the powerlessnes of women when they lose their dear ones.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is more politic.The action shifts to the south in a period of reconstruction. Griffith uses fac-similés for different important scenes: the surrendering of the south and especially Ford's theatre where president Lincoln was murdered. These scenes made me feel as if was watching the real thing.For most people the racist part of the film starts here as blacks seem to take more and more control over the south,and are mostly portrayed as savage brutes and ignorants.The scene (another fac-simile)of the blacks ,taken over the legislature in the state capitol is laughable.What is more disturbing is the death of the youngest and most likable character in the entire film,Flora the youngest daughter of the Camerons. When she is pursued by a black she jumps from a cliff ,preferring death above dishonor. Whatever the message ,the scene of Flora fleading through the woods,and her older brother Ben,trying to rescue her is an unforgettable one. After this event the Ku Klux Klan takes matters in hand.<br/><br/>Now the question remains if Griffith was a racist.He certainly was hurt when he was accused of racism and he removed some scenes from the film after the release.I'm no specialist in American history, but I was surprised to hear that what Griffith portrays in this film was written down by famous American historians from that time.So it could be that Griffith was genuinely misinformed about what happened in these troubled years after the Civil War. Being said that there are many other examples of 'creative' people who were judged as racist, sometimes only years later. An example is Hergé the creator of the world famous 'Tintin'. He refused till the late eighties that his first book 'Tintin in the land of the Sovjets' was reissued because or the way he portrayed the ""Bolsjevists"" .Only after there were many bootlegprints circulating,he gave in.Also having had many criticism on how he portrayed Jews and Negroes in his later books he drew many of his characters and scenes again for future reprints.But still many collectors loved the original books, and these days the first printings are reissued in fac-similés.Hergé realized later he had been misinformed by the books he read and regretted these ""faults"" he had made.For Tintin in the land of the Sovjets he found his inspiration in the book 'Moscou sans voile' written by a Belgian consul.These books made the public opinion in these days (around 1929).Public in Europe were convinced that the 'Bolsjevists' ate little children for breakfast. Hergé regretted his naiveté very much in later years.<br/><br/>So my thoughts are that you have to look at the broad picture,in the case of Griffith the year this film was made.At the historic opinions about a bloody war and it's aftermath that happened not that long ago.Opinions that were shared and often made by historians and media.I don't know if Griffith ever regretted the 'opinions' he ventilated in this film.But that aside I am convinced that he was a great director,that he knew how to tell a compelling story in an innovative way.Everyone should have seen or see this film at least once. I rate it 9/10."
"Kirasjeri","3","19","45","20 September 1999"," DON'T FORGET YOUR SHEETS!
","It's curious and disturbing to read the warped reviews by Confederate-sympathizers who defend this tripe. ""Birth of a Nation"" was a well-done movie - technically. But even in 1915 it was very controversial and often picketed. By the 1930's it's overt racism and lies was not acceptable at all; compare ""Birth"" to ""Gone with the Wind"" - which was bad enough!<br/><br/>The Confederate Mythology is of a ""brutal Northern occupation"", and the ""poor South at the mercy of black-run state governments"".  And ""Birth"" glorifies the subsequent rise of, believe it or not, the Ku Klux Klan. (The movie was based on an older pot-boiler novel called ""The Clansman"").<br/><br/>
The reality is only for a brief period did blacks control the South Carolina (where they were a clear majority) statehouse; they never did anywhere else. The reality is for two years after the Civil War the South was recalcitrant, unrepentant, and brutal to former slaves. It wasn't until 1867, two years after the war, that Reconstruction began. And the only thing that was ""brutal"" was the how the racist ex-Confederate veterans resisted it at the behest of the Southern oligarchs and the Democratic Party that used the Klan as their Terror Arm to control the ballot box (read ""White Terror"").<br/><br/>The scene in ""Birth"" of the white-sheeted Ku Klux Klan riding to the rescue against a horde of sex-crazed black soldiers (actually whites in blackface) intent on raping some white women was especially sickening. But to the lovers of the Confederacy, THIS is ""history"". And it was ""Birth"" that directly led to the rise of the KKK to major power in the 1920's. Of note is that their power collapsed after it was revealed that their leader had kidnapped a young, white, unmarried librarian, and for days tortured and raped her on a train and a hotel room.

It makes you feel uneasy watching this now, it still retains a lot of emotional power, very unusual for such an old film. The acting of all is understated particularly Henry B.

HOWEVER, let's be honest, being important for technical reasons and being a good movie are two very different things. I am amazed reading through so many of these reviews how people will readily admit not enjoying watching it then still give it nine or ten stars simply because the techniques used to make it were innovative. Even if we ignore the fact that every scene is horrifyingly racist (from the beginning, it makes the case that the KKK was an essential response to the oppression white southerners were experiencing from newly freed slaves, I mean come on people!!!), it still doesn't hold up as being enjoyable at all. It is way too long, boring, emotionally distant (you are never given a chance to connect with or care about any of the characters), the plot is both historically inaccurate and not compelling whatsoever altogether it's just a mess.<br/><br/>That being said, I will reiterate my point that students of history ought to watch this for its historic significance.

","Oh. My. God!  I rented this movie out of curiosity; I honestly thought it would be so dated that it couldn't be truly offensive.  The blacks in this movie are portrayed as simple-minded, violent children.  There is not one sympathetic black character.  The movie tells the story of the Civil War and Reconstruction from the point of view of the white supremacists.  The disenfranchised whites suddenly find themselves at the mercy of the black voters, jurors, legislators and business owners running the show.  Lillian Gish plays the daughter of a white politician who is the ""leader"" of the blacks, a ""Radical"" who believes not only that blacks and whites are equal but also that blacks will and should take over from the whites, using violence if necessary.  Gish's fiance forms the Ku Klux Klan to end the anarchy, and when she finds out what he does she ends their engagement (though she won't ""tell"" on him 'cause she's a lady and a good daughter of the South).  Later she is at the mercy of her father's mulatto henchman, an evil character with political ambitions of his own, who gets drunk and tries to persuade her to marry him and be the ""queen"" of his black nation, while dozens of blacks riot outside.  Of course her fiance, along with dozens of other Klansmen, ride triumphantly to her rescue and trounce the rioters. Then the blacks are intimidated into giving up their political power and peace is restored, and Gish and her fiance marry and live happily ever after.  Just appallingly offensive stuff.  Yeah, it's historically significant and it's well-made (it's kind of long, and tends to be slow until the second half of the story), but WOW.<br/><br/>Ultimately it's just so sad in the way it's so matter-of-fact.  Sure, the idea of a population of uneducated, unsophisticated people being in charge is worrisome, but this movie jumps to conclusions about how their society would immediately collapse into anarchy, and that all blacks (and mulattoes) are dangerous, violent people with political agendas.  You want to write a big check to the NAACP or the Southern Poverty Law Center (they fight the Klan) after seeing this movie.<br/><br/>Lillian Gish never married; she said the only man she ever loved was D.W.

"Blogger66","10","7","14","16 September 2017"," Here I Stand as a Progressive Racist
","As a white young man, I am stuck in between on whether or not I am a racist for contributing the Birth of the Nation with a perfect score. Again, as a white young man, I am still a racist, no matter what. However, the point of this statement as if it's a racist for loving this film. This review intended to break down the reasons why I rated a perfect score to justify the fact that it didn't increase my view of myself as a racist. <br/><br/>D. W. Griffin demonstrated his clear intention to direct this film to support the promotion of the Ku Klux Klan and the white supremacy. As a further matter, he was known as a Civil Hero who fought for the Confederate had rationalized his motive to be the director. It portrayed his pride of KKK for their accomplishment to bring back the white supremacy after the Civil War. He, indeed, possessed a gifted talent in his abilities to create a powerful influence in both categories (history and cinemas). <br/><br/>In an aspect of the films, this movie took the first step to open the gate for the success in Hollywood. In other words, it considered as one of the most innovative movies in the cinema's history. Before this, the movie length of longer than one hour was unheard. The Birth of the Nation is probably one of the longest films (+3 hours), even in today's cinemas. Also, it's unbelievable by the fact that it excelled in nearly all aspects of production, including excellent acting and editing, in 1915. <br/><br/>The Birth of the Nation is a requirement to see for the history buffs. It's impossible to find someone who could act like Abraham Lincoln better than Joseph Henabery. I found myself lucky to watch Lincoln (2012) before I could watch this or it would bring me a disappointment. <br/><br/>For the history buffs, moreover, the Birth of the Nation reflected the accurate timeline in between before the Civil War and after the birth of KKK. It also portrayed the honest perspective of the society during these periods. Black Americans weren't allowed to be in the movies. White Americans took the floor as they painted black on themselves. I feel it's one of the positive assets to justify the progressive society by proving the White Americans clearly couldn't act like the Black Americans since the Black Americans have own unique attributes. <br/><br/>The film of the battles in Civil War was marvelous. It's a 1915 version of the war film in comparison with the Saving the Private Ryan (1998). I still remember my reaction when I first saw the Saving the Private Ryan. It blew my mind away. In the meantime, I couldn't imagine how people would react to the Birth of the Nation in 100 years ago. No wonder that it contained a powerful influence to push further apart the gap between the Black and White Americans. It affected my curiosity about how much did it factor to the racial segregation. Yes, again, the reason for stating my curiosity is to indicate the effects of dominance in persuasion from the Birth of the Nation. <br/><br/>I wish I could go on and on, but this review intended to reveal my viewpoint as a white young man. I insisted on repeating referred as a white YOUNG man because I'm still uneducated in regards to racism. However, it played a significant part to my willingness to learn and become a better person.<br/><br/>My perceptions of the Birth of the Nation are meaningful to me. It gave me the better understanding of the society during these periods. The explanation of the birth and evolution of KKK was perfect. It didn't lie about the motives that led the KKK to oppress the Black Americans. The impactful moment was when Black Americans were finally empowered to include the politics. The pathway seemed to be reaching a light at the end of the tunnel after a very long journey, but the birth of the KKK prolonged the pathway in the tunnel. Black Americans were held back in every aspect of privileges in the United States. At the end of the film, it showed the celebration of accomplishments of white supremacy. <br/><br/>Cowardly and selfish were the main impression that I get. It led me to my realization that the racism, sexism, and all the -isms started by the fear among White Americans with the full privileges. <br/><br/>The reality of the truth gave me the realistic depth of understanding what went on in the society during the periods of slavery, civil war, and the birth of KKK. Looking back, the sign of progressive society is active, but the vigorous motives, such as cowardly, fear, and selfish, had slackened the progress towards equality. <br/><br/>I disagreed with the conversancy that this film should be banned or else because I wouldn't want to stick with my state of mind before I watch this. It's, no doubt, an ultimate masterpiece of KKK propaganda. However, in my eyes, it had become one of the masterpieces ever in the education history. It's a must recommendation for my circle of friends to watch."

"mmmuconn","6","7","14","3 January 2003"," Griffith's greatest fear
","SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>D.W. Griffith makes sure his landmark film contains every African-American stereotype invented, but he focuses most strongly on blacks' purported lust for white people.  It seems that Griffith perceives miscegenation as white folk's greatest threat.  In perhaps the most famous scene in `The Birth Of A Nation', Flora Cameron (Mae Marsh) jumps off a cliff to her death rather than endure rape by a black man.  Griffith presents her fall as a noble decision; the white woman's virtue, her purity, must be maintained at all costs.  Griffith paints Negroes with all sorts of negative qualities, but his two most unlikable characters, importantly, are offspring of sex between the races.  Congressman Stoneman (Ralph Lewis) is smitten with a mulatto maid who clings to him hungrily.  Their relationship is meant to symbolize the perversity of the North's Reconstruction policies.  Stoneman's trusted protégée, meanwhile, is also of mixed heritage.  Silas Lynch (played in blackface by George Siegmann) is a power-hungry backstabber who fantasizes about becoming a black emperor of the South.  Griffith's narrative renders Lynch most frightening, however, when the political upstart attempts to force Stoneman's daughter (Lillian Gish) into marriage; such behavior is treated as the apex of Lynch's ability to emasculate white men.  It is no accident that the Ku Klux Klan and other racists so frequently proclaimed their desire to keep pure the Aryan race.  They saw the threat to their political and social power foremost as a rabid sexual ambush.<br/><br/>Rating: 6"

","I'll give it a '6' for directing and cinematography. <br/><br/>I recently saw ""Birth of a Nation"" on TCM's May programs honoring African-American actors. I use to wonder what D.W. Griffith was thinking? He and writer, Thomas F. Dixon Jr., must have had some major problems with prejudice. But we need to remember what Reconstruction in the south was like to understand the writing of the book and the making of the movie. It was a grim, harsh time for the people who lived it. A juicy topic for authors and directors.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that a lovely young woman like Lillian Gish made her career with a movie like this one. She either did it for the part or, maybe, changed her views radically as she mellowed with age. But I have to remember that many actors play parts with which they don't agree.<br/><br/>This movie is an insult to the Confederate veterans of the Civil War who were too busy rebuilding their lives, families and homes to join the Ku Klux Klan. More of the southern politics should have been represented. A better representation of southern black politics should have been shown. Not every African-American man interested in government, was an ignorant oaf. Most of the problems there was a lack of education. <br/><br/>It's, also and especially, an insult to the African-Americans. They were portrayed as rapists and murderers during a time when they could be hung, usually in the middle of the night, for simply looking at a white woman in the wrong way. And on top of that many of the parts were done in black face. What, there weren't enough African-Americans who needed acting jobs to fill the bill?<br/><br/>In spite of it's excellent and insightful camera usage (Griffith knew directing and filming) this movie is a sad commentary on our country's entertainment history's ability to insight upheaval. <br/><br/>Why would ""Birth of a Nation"" be allowed to be made to encourage a political influence such as the Ku Klux Klan?

And, at its core, corrupt, soulless, and evil.<br/><br/>Birth of a Nation created Hollywood, and Hollywood has followed its example ever since. Their maxim is: entertain, dazzle, empassion, involve, and in all ways draw in the viewer-- but never, ever take the time to think out the deeper implications of the meaning of your film. The ""cinema-industrial complex"" can buy great cinematography, cool shots, stunning visuals, good acting, a well-written score-- that is, they can buy everything but truth and meaning.

It was (sort of) entertaining, but there was nothing great about the picture.  The acting was horrible.  I realize in silent films actors had to show more emotions on their face, but really--everybody was overdoing it (Gish was the worst by far).  And the racial content was repugnent--when I saw it with a full audience there was a lot of shifting in seats, muttered grumbling and a more than a few bursts of sarcastic snickering and groaning.  You could FEEL the audience getting upset.  I don't care how good people think this film is, the racist content is unbelievable.  It shouldn't be banned, but it should be shown for how disgusting and shocking racism can be.  Also, if there had been just one more scene of the KKK riding along like the calvary to ""save"" white people from black, I was going to throw something at the screen.

There are fantastic battle scenes of Sheridan's advance through the Shenandoah valley. And of course had DW Griffiths ended the movie with the Rebel collapse and reconciliation of the opposing factions, this film would be regarded as a masterpiece. Regrettably DW continued the story into reconstruction and presented an extreme Southronist version.<br/><br/>In fairness to DW it must have seemed to the Southernors who rebelled to guarantee the continuation of the peculiar institution that the world had turned upside down when Southron arms failed and the fate of the Lost Cause was sealed. The Democratic president the Southern carpetbagger to New Jersey Woodrow Wilson agreed and called this film ""History written with electricity."" By all accounts the film was out of step even in the times it was issued.<br/><br/>The film deserves a **** 1 **** and should be consigned to the deep.<br/><br/>The defeat of the South in 1865 was not the birth of the nation.

","I don't know what prompted Griffith to make this film. Ignorance abounded. The South was reeling from the post Civil War era. The book, the Klansman, was probably pretty popular, just like anti Muslim books became popular after 9/11. This in no way should make such content acceptable. As we look at historical curiosities, this film falls into that category. I bought a VHS copy of this a few years ago because I had never actually seen it (I had watched isolated clips on cinema retrospectives). My wife and I were stunned by the content, although we knew what it was about. To see it, makes it even worse. Nevertheless, since I've been educating myself about film history and craft over many years, I felt I really needed to watch it with both a critical and a societal eye. One thing I saw was masterful images of war on film made in 1915. I saw motion and shadows and all the other things the early geniuses did to separate themselves from the also rans. The editing is excellent. The acting is emotive and appropriate for the time period. I have seen other Griffith films and know that this was a mistake. He could have applied his genius to another milieu, but he didn't. I doubt that anyone takes the content of this film seriously. If it weren't so sad, it would be downright amusing. The stereotypes are so lame and over the top. But we need to place ourselves in the historical context and evaluate it that way.

D. W. Griffith, growing up in the South, witnessed and lived through this era, and for him and his fellow Southern whites, the Ku Klux Klan were as heroes. This movie simply gives an unpopular point of view in the post-war status in America.<br/><br/>Aside from the racism, the movie is excellent, and should be a must-see for all movie fans.

But since Gone with the Wind is one of my all-time favorites, I thought I would finally give Griffith's classic a chance and see. Well, I love movies, and I love silents although I'm only in my thirties, but this movie made my eyes water from the pain it was putting me through. I'll toss political correctness to the winds...this movie, despite the few moments of artistic breakthroughs by Kentucky's own D.W. Griffith, the movie was so painfully bad in its' post-Civil War scenes that I was eventually doing my own version of Mystery Science Theater 3000, creating my own dialogue to match the hideous storyline. The sight of seeing Caucasians masquerading as blacks, the spectacle of Klansman riding to the rescue like the Knights of the Round Table...the historical inaccuracies, it made me physically ill until all I could do was laugh at the ridiculousness of it all. How the AFI thought this movie worthy of the top 100 I don't know. Yes, Griffith was a gifted moviemaker, but give credit to his better Orphans of the Storm or even Intolerance or Broken Blossoms. This film shouldn't be banned however. Let it be seen as the racist piece of vitriolic garbage it is. I'll give him minor credit for his Civil War battle scenes, but that is it."

","Of course, I heard about this film from my film courses, and they commented about how this film established the feature film, yet was so racist, but until I saw it, I really had no idea how ridiculous this film was. The entire first half had only slight racism and I began to consider that my professors were over-reacting by calling the film racist--that was until the second part began, not without a warning that the film was not intended to be racist, but rather to convey history during the Reconstruction period. From that point, there was scene after scene with ideas so absurd, I could find no other reaction but laughter. From the scene of the horribly stereotyped Black Congressman, who were certainly never elected to any positions of power, to the notion that Blacks were able to vote and kept whites from voting (when in fact the history of Jim Crow, grandfather clauses, literacy tests and other discrimination made sure that blacks never got to vote in any great numbers) I could only stare in disbelief that D.W. Griffith could have ever made this movie with any degree of seriousness. I know people used to be so ignorant and stupid--obviously miscogenation was more than frowned upon--that much I believe, but believing that whites really feared the creation of a ""black empire with an unwilling white Queen at the side of the evil Mulatto""--to believe this as any sort of valid fear is just laughable. How could this even be filmed? Sure it is racist, but to take this racism seriously would almost be like taking an insult from a mentally retarded person seriously. I don't mean to downplay the consequences of perpetuated stereotypes, but if this film in any way reflected feelings of people at this time, then I'm glad that I have been fortunate enough to live in this era if it is indeed that much less ignorant and ridiculous. (In addition to my other complaints, I found the scene where the ""little general"" got the inspiration for the KKK to be hilarious--the sheets scaring the stereotyped pickanninies away was the beginning of such a horendous tradition; that and the idea of union and confederate enemies teaming together to defend their ""Aryan birthright""?!!) I know that history is more tragic than it should be, but this film was so outlandish that it felt like it was a parody made by black filmmakers to demonstrate an exaggeration of misguided racial tensions and discrimination, prejudice, etc. (I apologize for rambling, but I merely meant to clarify in hopes that my perspective won't be misinterpreted into disregard for hatred of discrimination.)"

It was so absurd I wouldn't have been paid to finish it.  After the civil war the film depicts blacks as ""ruling"" towns and being cruel to white people and Congress is shown as being completely black with the members in top hats acting silly, rolling on the floor, etc.  And to top it off because of these events the film shows the KKK emerging to bring back equality and justice.

","I've already commented briefly on this film, but after reading some of the other comments here I feel it's necessary to say more. It amazes me how anyone can defend this film. Many of the comments here have stressed it's technical achievements, and suggested that it's only fair to view it as a product of it's time, and that's all well and fine, but I think some of you are losing sight of the bigger picture.<br/><br/>It's true that the most controversial movies are often the best. Certainly that's true of many of my favorite movies. But there's a reason why they're often the best and that's because they're often the most insightful and thought-provoking. But the problem here is, as far as being insightful and though-provoking, The Birth of a Nation is about as far from that as you can get. To be totally honest I thought Showgirls was more insightful and thought-provoking. What this movie is is a fantastic piece of racist propaganda that was created primarily to boost the popularity of the KKK and to foster a nationwide feeling of hatred toward blacks.<br/><br/>And that brings me to my central point: PEOPLE WERE KILLED BECAUSE OF THIS MOVIE. Do you people realize that? How can anyone defend a movie that in all likelihood was a prime factor leading to the murders and harassment of hundreds if not thousands of blacks? I hear people here talking about camera angles and filming techniques, and I'm sure the film's all very wonderful in that regard, but I don't think that would have mattered very much to the people who lost loved ones because of this film.<br/><br/>I, as you might have guessed, gave this movie a 1, and I think anyone else that looks at their conscience will have to do the same."

","This film is a major milestone in the history of cinema and a triumph of what was to become the standard of filmmaking technique adopted by 'Classical Hollywood'. It is also massively valuable in terms of its message, which is both a reminder of the brutality and questionable morality of the very act of the creation of the modern USA, and inspiration for Americans who have almost forgotten their roots, history, and identity. It was the brave and selfless acts of these ancestors that shaped the course of history, and if we are to honour them, we must ask ourselves: would they have sacrificed for their ideals, knowing what future generations would do with that legacy? Recently we saw a series of barbaric attacks on monuments erected to the great men that fought in the civil war. It really is time for Americans to start appreciating their ancestors, instead of denouncing them."

","While I am not a huge silent film fan, I chose to watch Birth of a Nation as an assignment for a class I was taking. I was impressed with Griffith's use of colors to express the various moods of the scenes within the film. This was a technique widely used after this film was made. Seems simple by today's standards, but back then was a breakthrough to use color on film.<br/><br/>He also did a good job of using the action to convey a theme in the scenes. The film kept advancing through this use. I recall most vividly the turning point of the film when the Col. discovers his passion to fight for the rights of the people of the South. This carried the 2nd half of the movie. The story line in the beginning might drag, but if you can hold out till the end of the film, you will not be dissappointed. This truly was a breakthrough for its day, and Griffith should be credited with helping advance the way films are made."

"Boba_Fett1138","10","8","19","21 January 2007"," It still is the best movie about the civil war ever made.
","Being far from the most politically correct or historical important movie about the civil war, it still remains the best made and told movies, especially considering that this movie was made in 1915. <br/><br/>The movie its story is very well told and beautiful brought to the screen. The style of film-making was truly revolutionary for its time, the reason why the movie, from a movie-technical point of view, is considered to be one of the most important and influential movies of the early 20th century.<br/><br/>The movie can be divided into two separate parts. The first halve of the movie is about the start and end of the civil war and ends with the assassination of Abraham Lincoln (that's not a spoiler is it? ha-ha!). The second halve of the movie focuses on the aftermath of the civil war, a subject that never ever really gets handled much in any other movie. The first halve is more serious dramatic and historical like, while the second is more over-the-top dramatic and the story becomes more fictional and also because of that more entertaining.<br/><br/>Actually surprising to see how well the first halve of the movie was made. The movie had a couple of good looking mass scenes and spectacular looking battle sequences. Of course the movie as a whole is also beautiful looking with good sets and costumes.<br/><br/>But the best thing about the movie remains its storytelling. The characters and drama get very well developed and the build of the overall storyline makes sure that the movie takes some epic-proportions at times. The directing from D.W. Griffith is extremely good.<br/><br/>The second halve of the movie is controversial to say the least. It among other things, shows how and why the first ever Ku Klux Klan was brought to existence. Of course lots is exaggerated and everything in the story is extremely figurative black and white. You also have to keep in mind though, that the first Ku Klux Klan was different than the second and later forms of it. But still that's not an excuse for this movie to glorify the KKK and give them in this movie almost mythical like proportions. As a matter of fact the movie, among other reasons, caused the rise of the second KKK, in 1915. I don't really understand why the filmmakers picked this approach and storyline. Not sure what they wanted to achieve with it. Still I'm able to look at this movie as a piece of well made early film-making. Guess that in a way the movie is a bit the same as ""Triumph des Willens"", it's something beautiful, made for something horrible but you should still be able to appreciate how technically well and beautifully the movie is made, if you can remain objective and non-biased about the controversial subjects handled in it. The movie is too beautiful and well made to hate it.<br/><br/>Perhaps the movie would had even been better and definitely had a better reputation of the movie ended after its first halve. <br/><br/>And you can say and think about the ending what you want but it's both tense and spectacular. It also follows two separate story lines and cuts back and forth between them, which works all the more better and effective for the movie its tension. I think that this storytelling approach was also unique for its time but I have to admit that I'm not sure about that.<br/><br/>The movie features perhaps a bit too many characters and plot lines, which does make the movie at times confusing to watch but then again, aren't most silent movie at least a bit confusing and unclear to follow at times? It's also the reason why the movie is extremely long (for its time) but that of course is also depending on which version of the movie you're watching (For information, I've watched the longest version).<br/><br/>Of course the acting is terribly over-the-top by todays standards. Every emotion gets extremely exaggerated, mostly by the female cast, played by early big movie-stars Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh. Actors that I still liked in this movie were Ralph Lewis and George Siegmann. The movie features many at the time unknown young actors or other movie makers, who later grew out to be stars. Most notably to me were Walter Long, who would later appear in a couple of Laurel & Hardy movies and Raoul Walsh as John Wilkes Booth, who would later direct some classic- and Errol Flynn movies, mostly in the '40's.<br/><br/>A must-see for every objective movie-lover.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"tfrizzell","Null","8","19","10 October 2003"," Should Only Be Experienced for Its Early Cinematic Processes.
","Completely over-rated would-be-masterpiece that is easily the most racist and most degrading movie ever produced depicting African-Americans. ""The Birth of a Nation"". Is it a good film? Certainly because of the performances, the coherency and its focused tone. Is it landmark? Definitely, because of D.W. Griffith's impressive and innovative film-making techniques. Is it politically correct? No, not in 1915 and it becomes more politically incorrect as the years pass us by. The movie starts off very dramatically as the Civil War of the United States splits families and friends in every direction. Anarchy soon follows as President Abraham Lincoln is assassinated. Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation has (in the eyes of the film-makers) become a major mistake though as African-Americans have taken control of many governmental entities, including Congress and the Senate. Thus the way of life for white Americans is changing and becoming unsatisfactory in the process. Enter the Ku Klux Klan. In this movie the Ku Klux Klan is portrayed as a group of white knights, heroic men who are out to reclaim the way of life that is rightfully theirs. And of course all this leads to more turmoil for all inside the movie's vast landscape. First of all racism is the greatest social disease that anyone can experience in life. I do not like this film at all for its story, particularly in its second half. Early on the movie is very impressive in showing the way the Civil War tore apart the U.S. However, this production pales in comparison to movies with similar themes like ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Glory"". In terms of cinematic history, ""The Birth of a Nation"" is very important. But its social retardation and its racist biases overshadow its landmark film-making techniques. 4 stars out of 5."

","Many people seeing this film today cannot help but view it in the context of modern racial attitudes.Griffith's (and Dixon's) history is highly flawed,and the film's racial viewpoint was more than offensive to many in it's day,and time has not improved them any.Also most people upon first viewing the film they've heard called a masterpiece are suprised to find that it's not full of all sorts of new trick shots,but rather that it is a well structured and finely crafted film that can hold it's own with anyhing made today. What they don't realize is the startling advance it was in film making compared to the average feature of it's own era(1914-1915.) If onne see ""The Birth"" AFTER first seeing something like Theda Bara's 1914 film,""A Fool there was"",just how much better and what an advane ""The Birth""was becomes immediately apparent! The thing that has always amazed me about the film is how strong it's abbility to draw in it's viewers still is! This is perhaps the strongest reason for the many who still oppose showings of this movie almost 90 years after it was made! I was lucky enough years ago to talk with my paternal grandmother,who told me of seing the film in it's initial New York run at a ""legitimate"" stage house,The Liberty Theater on Broadway at $2  top for reserved seats,(which was what one paid to see a Broadway show in those days) acompanied by a full orchestra.<br/><br/>A closing note in these days where the box office gross is the measure of a movies worht.We will probably Never now how much the film has grossed (and it's still in paying exhibition),but we can safely say that ""The Birth of a Nation"" has ben seen by more people than any other American film."
"keith-moyes-656-481491","1","7","16","16 December 2011"," No more Nickelodeon
","I have finally seen this landmark movie. The DVD version is in reasonable shape for such an old picture and is almost complete, so provides a good basis for judgement.<br/><br/>The subject matter has been extensively discussed elsewhere on this site so I will confine myself to a few comments on its technical qualities.<br/><br/>It is difficult to evaluate very early movies, because cinema was still being invented. Only 15 years before Birth of a Nation, people were still watching two minute clips of horses eating hay and trains coming into stations. Clearly, cinema had taken huge strides in a very short time, but when I view this film I am less conscious of how far cinema had come than how far it still had to go.<br/><br/>The only real benchmarks I have for this movie are two Louis Feuillade serials (Fantomas and Les Vampires) made at roughly the same time that I have on DVD.<br/><br/>In one respect Griffiths was no more advanced than Feuillade. They both shot their lengthy movies almost entirely with a still camera. I assume that some of the shots of the KKK on horseback were taken from a moving truck, but I did not notice any other camera movements (although I might have missed a few slight pans). Griffiths injects movement and vitality into scenes through the staging and the performances rather than with the camera and this is done so effectively that I was rarely aware of how static the camera actually is. <br/><br/>However, Birth of a Nation does represent an advance over the Feuillade movies in terms of editing. There is noticeably more cutting within scenes and (particularly) cross-cutting between them. This is especially effective in the final few reels when Birth achieves a dynamism that the two French films cannot match. On the other hand, it feels even more primitive in its use of inter titles. <br/><br/>Each scene is introduced by a title card that explains what you are going to see. This is unavoidable for scenes where two people are simply having a discussion, but there are many scenes in which the action is self-explanatory and the title cards are a pointless intrusion. More revealingly, there are also cases where the card is needed but could have been avoided if Griffith had shown a bit more imagination in the writing and staging of scenes. Two examples will illustrate this. <br/><br/>In the assassination scene, the inter-titles tell us that Lincoln's bodyguard deserts his post in order to watch the show. This card is needed to make sense of what happens, but this is because the action is not clear enough in the way it is staged. If Griffith had established the man's status as bodyguard more unambiguously and had given us a few shots of him getting bored and restless and periodically peeking through the curtain, then no explanations would have been necessary.<br/><br/>Later, we see two KKK spies discover Elsie's imprisonment and this leads to her rescue. Again, the two spies have to be identified by a caption which could have easily been avoided if we had first seen the two men donning their disguise and sneaking into the town. These missing scenes would have made the action flow more smoothly so it would nave required no explanation. It would also have helped if we had actually seen them conveying their news to Colonel Cameron. As it is, there is something of a yawning gap between Elsie's discovery and her rescue.<br/><br/>In 1915 Griffith still had a lot to learn about basic visual story telling.<br/><br/>However, I suspect that the real reason for all these inter titles was simply that Griffith was in the grip of a stylistic convention that demanded a title card for each scene, whether it needed one or not. The trouble with this convention is that makes the movie feel like a series of vignettes or 'tableau vivants' strung together chronologically, rather than a continuous narrative. As a result, it feels as if the titles that are telling the story and the visuals are merely illustrations. <br/><br/>Of course, this is an overstatement that ignores the film's greatest merit; the fine performances of many of the cast. George Siegmann's Cyrus Lynch is just a grimacing bad guy and Joseph Henabery is simply striking poses as Lincoln, but most of the performances are excellent and many of the scenes are much more subtle and nuanced than the bald statements of the inter-titles would suggest. Often, it is better to ignore what the captions say and just watch what the actors do.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Birth of a Nation does have some real cinematic merit but there is no denying that it is still a somewhat primitive piece of film-making and I suspect that Griffiths was much less of an innovator and a pioneer than his reputation suggests. <br/><br/>I don't think this movie can be regarded as a major work of Art but it is undoubtedly of great historical importance and is worth a view for that reason alone. However, I think its importance has more to do with its impact on the movie industry than the movie art. It was a huge investment and a big financial risk that succeeded triumphantly at the Box Office. If there had been any lingering doubts about whether or not cinema was just a transitory sideshow attraction, they had been decisively answered. Cinema was here to stay and the sky was the limit for ambitious film makers. The Birth of a Nation was also the death of the Nickelodeon. <br/><br/>It's just a shame that cinema's commercial potential had to be demonstrated by such a nasty, rancid, foul-smelling pile of ordure as this.<br/><br/>PS In fairness, this final judgement relates mainly to the second half of the picture."
"delivered_from_reality","10","7","16","8 June 2001"," Almost as good as Gone With the Wind!
","The Birth of a Nation is one of the most forgotten films ever made, and this is true, you can see, because of the fact that this film has as many memorable scenes and emotional/patriotic intensity as 1939's epic classic Gone With the Wind.  Even though this movie is silent, The Birth of a Nation instigates the viewer to see a modern war masterpiece using old-fashioned cinematography to create a surreal environment.  The cinematography in parts is wonderful and uses great use of color for war scenes and racial discrimination.  The movie's validity on the fairly obscure subject of the racial discrimination in the years following the Civil War are intriguing and nearly addictive to watch. ***POSSIBLE SPOILER AHEAD*** Throughout the 3 hour 9 minute epic, the only part that there is to complain about is the first thirty to forty-five minutes. In these minutes, the film presents too many characters to keep up with, too much action begins to occur before the audience is familiar with the future romance-plotline, and afterwards, becomes dull and boring.  However, after this ""black-hole"", the movie becomes a non-stop romantic/drama/war masterpiece that still should be referenced to today.  The Birth of a Nation is definitely worth at least one viewing."
"TheLittleSongbird","5","3","5","17 April 2020"," Birth of controversy
","Saw 'The Birth of a Nation' for quite a few reasons. One was that it was directed by DW Griffith, the more that has been seen of his recently he and his work became more interesting. He made a lot of very good to classic films, short and feature. Lillian Gish was one of the greatest silent film actresses, who never failed to move me, and there was a reason as to why she was a Griffith regular. Also wanted to see what caused so much controversy and still does was as bad as all that.<br/><br/>After seeing it, 'The Birth of a Nation' is pretty difficult to rate and review with me being so conflicted on it. While appreciating that 'The Birth of Nation' was/is ground-breaking and that it is of historical importance, the second part really ruins the promise that the first half showed so it was very difficult for me to get much out of it. It is very easy to see why the film is so controversial and why it is considered offensive. While it is one of Griffith's most historically interesting films, it is also his most divisive by far and one of his worst in my view.<br/><br/>'The Birth of a Nation' still looks great, Griffith's films always were extremely well made technically, some of the camera shots innovative and unlike what was seen before at the time. Gish is typically wonderful, the poignancy brought to her relatable role being quite powerful. The rest of the cast are also on fine form, especially Mae Marsh and Robert Harron.<br/><br/>Griffith's direction is masterful and technically more than efficient, well certainly in the first part and keeps the second from being unwatchable (along with the acting). The first part of 'The Birth of a Nation' is absolutely brilliant, very compelling and epic as well as moving.<br/><br/>Which is why it is so regrettable that the second part feels like a different film and difficult to sit through. It is with the rescue and from that point on that 'The Birth of a Nation' falls downhill badly, despite the production values and acting still being so top notch. It is not just one-sided, but it is also blatantly racially offensive now and even for the time, which has always been the biggest criticism directed towards the film. It takes a lot for me to be offended by a film but even when judging it for the time and accepting that racism is far from gone today, that didn't stop me from feeling uncomfortable with the portrayals of the supporting characters in the second part (African Americans portrayed negatively and a notorious group in history treated as heroes). It may be based on objectionable source material, but this was a rare example of a film that would have been much better straying away from it and not true to it.<br/><br/>All that being said, that is sadly not all with 'The Birth of a Nation's' criticisms with the second part. Its pacing is very pedestrian and from the rescue onwards the story is badly over-stretched even for a film intended to be epic. What started off so rivetingly became a test for endurance where the eventually excessive length was felt. The characters completely lose their dimension and go from complex to one-dimensional stereotypes and the melodrama gets very over the top and downright silly.<br/><br/>Overall, brilliant first part but the second is a mess. 5/10"
"freddyschmitz","8","3","5","28 August 2016"," A revolutionary film that was ahead of its time - with a hateful and wrong message.
","Beforehand, I highly condemn the message this movie has. The high rating is solely based on the qualities of the film in regard to the craft involved in its making which is, objectively, just phenomenal for its time.<br/><br/>What makes this silent historical epic revolutionary are the enormous battle scenes, involving hundreds of extras and a director directing from a big tower via light signals, its use of music and camera, filming at night (which wasn't common back then), coloring of specific scenes (mostly battle scenes) in one color and a battle in the films' climax used as a tool of dramatization and storytelling. The film paved the way for big epic movies which would mark Hollywood forever since then. At a running-time of over three hours it was the longest film to ever be released back in 1915.<br/><br/>Obviously, due to its racist portrayal of black people this movie is not for everyone but if you are interested in the history of Hollywood you've got to check it out, while ignoring the historical inaccuracies and racist bull crap Without this movie Hollywood wouldn't be what it is today. It would not have impacted America and its film industry that much if it wasn't done so well.<br/><br/>Even when ignoring the racist viewpoint this was made from you don't get around to notice the historical inaccuracies and at over three hours this movie seems a bit too long for me even though its an epic. Plus several characters weren't fleshed out enough. Of course, this is due to the fact that this is a silent film and it was made over 80 years ago with different narrative standards at the time but from my viewpoint, which is currently set in the year 2016, I simple cannot ignore it and it bothers me. And again, the racism in this film simply feels overbearing sometimes, the director even went so far to cast mainly white actors for the most vicious black characters, simply painting their faces black. But as I said, I tried to not let the racist overtones of this film affect my rating. Overall I give this movie a strong 8/10. I only give higher ratings to films which really touch me on an emotional level and the pure viciousness in its portrayal of an entire group of people makes this impossible for me."

Even the just too precious Mae Marsh is less irritating than usual. On the other hand, there is it's subject matter, which is race relations during the Civil War and Recontruction. It would be hard to imagine a more blatantly biased presentation. I still cannot watch the second half without wincing at times. Every time I see Elsie and her Klansman proudly leading the parade of the Klu Klux Klan, I want to scream, ""Lillian, how could you?""

"oconnor0930","5","3","5","27 January 2010"," Great Film that doesn't leave you with a Great Feeling
","Let me begin by saying that ""The Birth of a Nation"" was cinematically a great film. It is truly amazing how J.W. Griffith made this historic film that is nearly a century old feel like a contemporary masterpiece. An excellent use of parallel editing, a complicated series of cuts, and the variety of wide and close shots make this film a must see if you want to see where 'epic' films first began. The color hand painted onto the frames helps set the mood and evoke emotions in the audience. A great example of this is where the scene of Atlanta burning is painted red. The shots of the battle scenes are so grand. It is very evident that so much planning among so many people went into the making of this movie.<br/><br/>This movie also has a high degree of verisimilitude, mainly because it is based on nonfictional events. Because the audience knows the gist of what is going to happen, the director uses the lighting and variation of shots to create suspense. An example of this is the Lincoln assassination, where John Wilkes Booth is creepily shrouded in shadow. The score also adds to the anticipation.<br/><br/>A troubling part of this movie is how it goes beyond being politically incorrect to being downright offensive. Though Griffith gives a disclaimer saying that his intent is to be historically accurate rather than racist, I believe the movie went above and beyond in a negative way. The racism is sickening and the historical accuracy is questionable. The K.K.K. is depicted as being heroic, saving society from the 'black savages'.<br/><br/>Though ""The Birth of a Nation"" made great strides cinematically, the outright racism made the movie's achievements secondary in my reflection of the movie. The length of the movie, though ground breaking in 1915, was excruciating. Watching this movie is an endurance test not for the faint of heart, especially since the second half of the movie is utterly sickening."

","While possibly lacking in some historic accuracy, I believe DW Griffith correctly captured the emotions of the time through exaggeration of the stereotypes. US reconstruction after the civil war was not a happy time, and no one group was to blame. The Birth of a Nation clearly paints that picture.<br/><br/>Every movie should be viewed in the proper context. This movie is about a time very different than our own, filmed at a time very different than our own. A 1915 movie about the late 1800's can not be judged by 2006 standards.<br/><br/>Study this film even if you do not agree with it. DW Griffith is a fine director and was on the cutting edge of film making in 1915."

","~Birth of a Nation~ is not a film. It is an historical document of racism whose merits (or lack thereof) as ""Art"" are completely irrelevant.

Do you really care about that sentence's grammatical form, or whether or not it has spelling errors? I didn't think so. Well, for those of you who haven't seen it, ~Birth of a Nation~ is just as bluntly and horribly racist as that sentence, and I can't see how ANYONE could possibly get past that fact, as if anything could ever be more relevant.<br/><br/>The fact is, whether D.

And also, as some people here have noted, when you try to stifle the bigots, you just give them something valid to complain about. So people can rave about Birth of a Nation if they want to, oohing and aahing about its battle scenes and use of tinted lenses. But you should all keep in mind what another reviewer here has already pointed out - innocent people were murdered because of the hate this film engendered.<br/><br/>Do you think the families of those murder victims would agree that ~despite~ its racism Birth of a Nation is ~nonetheless~ one of the 100 greatest films of all time?

"Tornado_Sam","Null","4","8","10 July 2017"," This Film is Not Racist: It Only Reflects how Racism Was at the Time of the Civil War
","The title of this review says it all. The reason people call this film racist is because it has a very realistic idea of how racism was at the time of the Civil War. And Griffith wasn't racist either; he wanted only to show how white people thought of blacks at the time. So anyone who hates this film is only hating on how black people were treated at the time of the War. That's silly to hate on; that time depicted here is gone and today black people are treated equal.<br/><br/>This film is 3 hours long, much longer than a full-length movie would be today (I was shocked when I heard this films' run time). It is all about 2 families (the Stonemans on the North side, and the Camerons on the South) experiencing the Civil War and its aftermath. The slaves, once they are freed, begin to rise up against the white men, which is when the KKK stepped in, to stop the continual rise of the freed slaves. True, they are depicted as heroes here, but again, that's how it was then: perhaps the Klan was, at the time, considered heroic. Of course, it's different today, as the Klan still exists.<br/><br/>I thought this film captured the essence of the War well. The acting was very good, and it actually looks like it was made during the War, which was, of course, impossible. This film combines fact as well as fiction. Of course the story itself wasn't the work of Griffith or anyone else involved in this film: the story was based on a book called ""The Clansman"", by Thomas Dixon Jr. I have not read the book but it looks like it was well adapted. True, some of this film is slow-paced (for instance, the beginning introduces the characters and takes quite a bit of time to do so) but when the film gets exciting, it turns into a cliff-hanger at times. It is presented in 2 parts: the first part deals with the historical events of the War, and the second part is a fictional story involving the KKK and a crazy idiot named Silas Lynch. Both parts are well done, and the person who played Abraham Lincoln (Joseph Henabery) was fit for his role. The Lincoln Assassination was also well done too.<br/><br/>Very good. Someday I should find myself a DVD of this one!"
"Giovanni_Corleone","8","6","14","15 February 2006"," Racist? Yes. Awesome and important? Even more so.
","Directed by D.W. Griffith, and often credited as the first real movie ever made, Birth of a Nation is an amazing blend of action, romance, glory, and sorrow. It starts off right before the Civil War, introducing the characters: the Camerons (South) and the Stonemans (North). Their families are associated with each other in many ways. The sons from each family are ""chums,"" the eldest son of the Camerons, Colonel Cameron, is in love with the eldest daughter of the Stonemans, etc. As the war rages on, their differences get the better of them, and become (for the most part) enemies. After the South loses (spoiler), the carpetbaggers enter the scene with their black puppets, making large black armies and basically black supremacy. In response to this comes the Ku Klux Klan, led by no other than Colonel Cameron. Yeah, Birth of a Nation is racist. It depicts free blacks as manipulative, power-and-woman-hungry, and subordinated ones as happy but dumb-as-rocks. Despite all this, it is a great movie. Even though it is silent, it makes one feel many powerful emotions. You're taken for a roller-coaster of a ride as you see friends die together, valiant charges, and love-stricken couples. Despite being silent (and three hours and seven minutes long), there was not a second I was bored during my viewing of it. A must-see for all those interested in film, and a recommendation for everyone else.<br/><br/>P.S. Anyone seen Apocalypse Now? If so, you know the ""Ride of the Valkyrie"" scene, wherein the helicopters raid the village blasting this piece? That's inspired by this movie, by a scene where the Klan saves the town from rioting Northerners, all while playing ""Ride of the Valkyrie"" in the background."

The sweep of history portrayed, sometimes in politically incorrect fashion, is also worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Perhaps not fast-paced enough for your 1990's thriller fan, though.

","Birth Of A Nation. D.W. Griffiths revolutionary cinematic epic.<br/><br/> As expressed in other reviews, this film is quite obviously slanted in favor and glorification of the southern cause (and, a bit more disturbingly, to that of the Klan post-war).<br/><br/> Yet theese are things you must expect. When judging elements of the past, be they actions, speeches, or films, one must look at them in the context of their period. You may view them as right or wrong, but to fully understand> something, you have to at least ATTEMPT to see it from the viewpoint of that era, however flawed it may be.<br/><br/> The film is quite slow at times (I've watched it nearly twice, the first time I fell asleep during the end), and quite long. Its plot is filled with comical and slightly offensive characatures of groups, and the symbolisim is HEAVY HANDED (a perfect example, the shot of a cat and dog fighting after the outbreak of war. Although numerous other examples can be found). The writing is typical for the period as well.<br/><br/> I found this film interesting on a number of levels, primarily, because of my interest in the American Civil War. But also to see the cinematic firsts in the film (camera work, the massive battle scenes, etc.). And finally, to see the way the war was portrayed in the early 1900's.<br/><br/>From a historical standpoint, I laughed at times. The film has a tendancy to represent the war in broad strokes, also there were the requisite errors in costuming and so on (such as how the klan members appear to have plungers or..some kind of long shaft like object protruding from their heads underneath the hoods..like hateful teletubbies if you will..I STILL don't fully realize what prompted that).<br/><br/>From the standpoint of a (somewhat) film enthusiast, I was amazed at how some of the camera techniques were done. My personal favorite is the shot of shermans march to the sea (which must have been shot from either a hilltop or scaffold of some type, It'd be interesting to know just how that was set up). Also, the battle scenes do set the standard for following works.<br/><br/> To bring this long winded review to a close, if you watch this film you must do so expecting to be offended, amused, and a bit nauseated by the predictable, black and white (no pun intended, I assure you) plotline. But you should also be prepared for a fascinating look into the cultural views of the early 1900's, the interpretation of the war, and the cinematic mastery of D.W. Griffth.<br/><br/> I have to give this film a 9, simply because of its value as a cinematic ""time capsule"" of sorts."

It is about honorable defeat and the chance for an absolute union; a chance destroyed by an assassination. Finally, it is about the quest for revenge. Birth of a Nation is not only the first feature film, but a movie worthy of the utmost respect of movie fans. My recommendation: Stop the tape after Lincoln is assassinated."
"Argead","10","9","24","4 July 2004"," Masterful Storytelling
","Griffith made ""The Birth of a Nation"" at the outset of World War One. It is the product of a bygone age and should be viewed as such.<br/><br/>The arguments about racism spewed upon this film by so many who should know better are completely out of place. They are irrelevant. When this film was made racism was the law.<br/><br/>Let's bear in mind that for something like two centuries Americans were raised to view slavery as something perfectly normal. It was part of everyday life and it was encouraged. It was the law of the land and God's will. This is the very definition of a racist nation and this is the America that David Wark Griffith inherited. This was his reality.<br/><br/>We should acknowledge that Griffith was a sophisticated man. His peers respected him and regarded him highly. At worst he was no more racist than the majority of Americans of his time. Probably much less so. His next feature film, Intolerance, is a testament to that.<br/><br/>However, we have to appreciate that the generations preceding him viewed blacks as inferior to whites. A sub-species that could be trained to do labour. They were literally property, something akin to a horse but with the power of speech. That blacks might be human beings equally endowed with God's blessings as whites, was a concept many Americans simply could not grasp. It is this historical view that is presented in the film.<br/><br/>Griffith masterfully captures the contempt and rage of Southerners over the freeing of their slaves. They did not see it as a good thing and they could not accept it. Their social order was turned upside down by the do-gooders of the North. It was viewed as a form of humiliation imposed upon them. That Southerners would revere the Ku Klux Klan follows logically. The Klan itself springs naturally from this mindset. This is the film's perspective. If you can't understand that, then this film is not for you.<br/><br/>If you hate this movie because of its racism then you hate America because that's what it was like at the time. It is a genuine presentation of the Civil War from people who were only one generation removed from it. Griffith's own father participated in the war and here Griffith is sincerely telling his version of the truth.<br/><br/>Racism aside, I was mesmerized by this film. It is one of the finest I've ever seen. It held me captive from beginning to end. From an historical standpoint the film is a window into a world that vanished long ago. That Griffith was able to pull this off during the earliest days of cinema is indicative of the enormity of his talents. ""The Birth of a Nation"" isn't ""a"" film; it is ""the"" film. This is the granddaddy of them all. It is an early masterpiece of such magnitude that it altered the cinematic landscape."

"Jazzy_san","9","2","3","20 April 2018"," The Irony of a Masterpiece filled with controversy.
","First of all .. this movie has 2 sides .. Good and bad.
This film is a masterpiece of cinema, The Birth of A Nation is the birth of an art, the art in motion pictures.
everything featured in this movie wasn't all that good. the acting department wasn't too convincing, quite theatrical.. a bit excessive. it's just that the central figure has something more, a convincing acting that later catapulted her name in the Hollywood cinema world. Lilian Gish who played Elsie Stoneman very well.
The advantages of this film is in technicality. cinematography which is a new breakthrough in its era, the camera angle that makes a scene reach the audience, backgrounds and night camera techniques, lens focus, the editing scene per scene and of course its MOVING CAMERA.
everything tasted fresh.<br/><br/>The first part of this movie feels magnificent and epic. it's far from the controversy and about 15 minutes of it full of bombs, gun smoke, dozens of horses, dozens of cannons and hundreds of extras in the crazy Union vs Confederation civil war scenes, at least that's what I had in mind considering this movie is 113 years old. the shot techniques using bird's eye view and medium shots alternately adds more excitement in watching every action scene, not to mention the shooting technique using moving camera that focus on the 'little colonel' on horseback. the climax was the confrontation of two different friends in a situation of confusion on the battlefield that led to the death of both characters.<br/><br/>The second part of the film is the controversy and causes a lot of impact afterwards.
throughout the 3 hours 15 minutes of this film, 90% of its extras of black people is 'white people painted black'. this was already a very strong racism, not to mention that the Afro-American people in the second half of the film was depicted as barbaric and superficial, full of exaggerated emotions.
in order to understand what I mean, I highly recommend you to watch this movie. especially the second half of the film.
all of the controversy was overrun by KKK (Klu Klux Klan) which been made by the director as the 'savior' of the country from the tragedy that devastated the southern region of America.<br/><br/>regardless of all the controversies, this film is a milestone in the history of world cinema, especially for war and epic genres.
many films are trying to figure out how the Civil War happened after this movie and make this film as an example.<br/><br/>it is the irony of a masterpiece filled with controversy."
"djpwm2005","5","2","3","17 January 2013"," Half for the influence, half for what it lacks (or: just because it's influential doesn't mean it lacks flaws)
","Given there are nearly 300 reviews written for this title, it's hard to say anything that hasn't already been said. But I will add my voice and will hopefully put things in a new light.<br/><br/>First, I want to describe why I gave it five stars. As you will see at the end of it, it's quite elementary. It's all to avoid extremes. Giving it a 10 is to deny its shortcomings especially in its characterization and depiction of history. Giving it a 1 is to deny its importance in cinema, both for American and for cinema-at-large. A ""5"" is a fair-balance between the two poles.<br/><br/>*The Birth of the Nation* was the result of several decades of one-reel films made for the nickelodeon theatres. While Griffith didn't invent the various shot scales, camera positions and editing, he helped shape the language into how we understand it today. As Alfred Hitchcock said when he first saw it, ""it has everything in it."" You have your close-ups for dramatic effect, long shots for establishing geography and grand action, insert shots to clarify information, match-cut editing to make actions and reactions seamless. Furthermore, this is beyond just one-reel. *The Birth of the Nation* provided the birth of the feature-length film.<br/><br/>Because many others have taken the torch as it were to make more sophisticated and refined feature-length films, the technical flaws are more noticeable. While Griffith was one to rehearse extensively with his actors and everything was planned out and thought out, there are some shots where the blocking is not refined and the pacing is not quite there. And though it's easy for us in the present to criticize silent film acting as ""overdone,"" this is where the visuals have to carry the message and thus action has to speak the dialogue. But in spite of the flaws, it was a very good start for what film-makers will do with their own stories.<br/><br/>The negatives are in its story with its racist overtones. While much has been said about its racist nature, it's much broader than that. The story is very simple and the characters are not one for complexity and depth. Good guys are good guys; bad guys are definitely bad guys. Caricature and exaggeration are part of people and situation portrayal as well. And with its three-hour running time, it's a long, unfolding story of complete flatness. This is not to say it lacks emotion or drama; but its execution is too simple. Again, this is comparison to a number of films made longer after this one that do employ more sophisticated means of telling its story and showing its characters.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a film that can be seen once. Even then, you'll already know the aspects make it influential. For better and for worse, it's part of cinema's canon for it pushed it from nickelodeon novelty into the predominant art and entertainment form once held by the novel and the theatre."
"TheUnknown837-1","Null","2","3","4 November 2010"," Its aesthetic value is immeasurable, however the subject matter of ""The Birth of a Nation"" really challenges your perceptions and it's frequently an unpleasant experience
","""The Birth of a Nation"" is a landmark in many ways. It's an unquestionable milestone in the history of the world's greatest art form - the cinema - and it has left influence in ways that are both good and bad, majestic and evil. For me, it's also kind of a personal landmark. I saw the movie for the first time about three weeks ago. It's just one of the hundreds of motion pictures from around the world, from various periods in time, that I have seen and yet out of all of those titles, it is the first one where I sat resolutely dumbfounded at the end of it, completely unsure of how I felt. It is a movie that really challenges your perceptions of it and I had so many strong reactions at cross purposes to it that I felt empty for many reasons. Chiefly, I could not decide whether I even liked the movie or not. Three weeks later, I still cannot.<br/><br/>So this review will be a forerunner. I will strictly analyze the movie and my mixed reactions, since I cannot come to a positive or negative conclusion.<br/><br/>First of all, the aesthetic value of ""The Birth of a Nation"" is immeasurable. This picture, created by cinema pioneer D.W. Griffith, practically reinvented movies into the form that we continue to see them today. Dramatic structures, shot compositions, editing techniques, and themes that seem commonplace today were born in this movie. Doing all of this in a window of three hours and having cost more than $100,000 means it also defined the genre of an epic. Structurally, it's the great-grandfather of ""Lawrence of Arabia."" For that reason, it demands to be seen by anybody who loves film and the history of it. But it is much easier to admire (aesthetically) than enjoy.<br/><br/>When ""The Birth of a Nation"" was released in 1915, it was labeled by the NAACP as being three miles of filth (three miles of film used to create a three-hour movie.) I can see their point and wouldn't dare challenge it else sacrifice my own morality on the altars of cinematic history. Like ""Gone with the Wind,"" it is about the Old South. Starting with pre-Civil War, the disappearance of the Old South, and the Reconstruction. However, whereas ""Gone with the Wind"" treated African Americans with decency, respect, devoid of bias, and as human beings...""The Birth of a Nation"" depicts them as mindless, autistic and subhuman brutes. Monsters and rapists. And the murderous Ku Klux Klan are glamorized like valiant knights.<br/><br/>The first hour and a half of the movie is easily enjoyable, for it focuses only on the war. The African Americans are really in the background. The racial animosity does not come blaring in our faces until the second half and when it does, it comes with a sledgehammer. And that hammer hits you harder and harder every second of the way. At times, it's a really painful movie to watch. Now I could have easily enjoyed and admired this picture had it treated African Americans and the Klan from a purely historical perspective, just showing it as it was. But making former slaves into disgusting subhuman monsters and making Klansmen glorified from every angle you look at it is really quite violating. Sure, there has been racial animosity in pictures before and since, but never quite on this scope.<br/><br/>So why am I not giving it a negative review? Because at times, it seems to works. Moments of suspense are truly gripping and the opening war scenes are by all means commendable. D.W. Griffith was pioneering it and mastering at the same time. I hate to admit it, but at some points I was having a great time. Then the racism came sliding back in and sort of lowered my spirits. I suppose it was this and the fact that the Ku Klux Klan does not appear and is therefore not glamorized, until the very end of the picture that I was not affronted as much as I potentially could have been. At times, it also seems like there are no good guys or bad guys at all. The white southerners sometimes even seem to be getting what they deserve when the African Americans turn against them.<br/><br/>I am not giving ""The Birth of the Nation"" a rating as I usually do. Because I rate movies based on how much I liked them. And I still cannot come to a conclusion about how I felt about ""The Birth of a Nation."" I had so many opposing reactions to the same scenes and both sides were so strong that I can't even decipher my own emotions. The only way I suppose I could clarify or even get any closer to deciding whether I like it would be to see it again. And I'm not so sure I want to see it again. A hundred and eighty minutes is a long time to subject yourself to a big, inner battleground.<br/><br/>It's a landmark in cinematic history and it must be dealt with. We cannot deny its importance in this great art form of motion pictures. However, I cannot be entirely honest by giving a definitive opinion about it, either. It's a movie that has done a great many things, including befuddling this hardheaded scholar and lover of film."

","How can one properly review this film? It single handedly changed the world, something you can't say for many movies, but in some very negative ways as well as positive ones. It features some amazing set pieces, and totally altered the standard to how films should be made. It also featured a re-writing of history and appropriated extreme racism. <br/><br/>The Birth of a Nation is a silent film, and if unaccustomed to it, it can be extremely tedious and confusing. This film suffered from this, even for more seasoned viewers of silent movies, perhaps because of its three hour runtime, or maybe because of its complex story that was impaired by the lack of any dialogue and clear editing. The acting was surprisingly more natural then most from this time era, but this also may have affected the overall film, because with no dialogue, it felt sometimes felt slow with little reason. <br/><br/>D. W. Griffith directed this historical triumph, which changed Hollywood, the film industry and, along with some issues in the South involving violent black people and wrongly executed white people, brought back the Klu Klux Klan, which continues to have lasting effects to this day. Although portrayed as a historical film, the 'history' is completely fake, even though some people try to use this as an example of truth. <br/><br/>So how do you review this film? It is best to average it out. In terms of actual filmmaking and historical relevance in the film history canon, this is a ten star movie. In terms of the problems this movie caused due to its unabashed racism, it's a solid zero. The film in terms of quality is about a five anyway, so it evens out. It is an interesting and rewarding watch, but not entirely entertaining. But no matter your favourite film, it has this one to thank.<br/><br/>2.5 / 5"

","When you watch this film for the first time, you have a strange feeling of rooting for the ""wrong"" people, and you may end up rooting for none at all by the end of it.<br/><br/>This is the strange thing about the film famous for being one of the most groundbreaking films ever made and infamous for its blatantly racist storyline and glorification of the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>It's an uncomfortable film to sit through for the vast majority of modern audiences, especially the last hour. What can be said, however, is that pioneering, and now legendary, film-maker D. W. Griffith managed to create a film of epic proportions with a complex storyline and a vast array of characters at a time when most film- making techniques used today were either non-existent or newly developed. The film initiated huge developments in the film industry and it can be argued that a number of later masterpieces would likely never have been made had this not existed.<br/><br/>The film features the classic partnership between Griffith and legendary actress Lillian Gish whose performance in the lead role of Elsie Stoneman, the daughter of abolitionist Austin Stoneman, shines brightly throughout the film. Gish' expressions are second to none other and, like in several of Griffith's other films, she is the key stone of the viewing experience. In comparison, the rest of the cast largely provide acceptable to mediocre performances.<br/><br/>The central conflict of the story is the American Civil War and the following reconstruction period. It follows the life of two families, Stoneman and Cameron, residing in the North and South respectively. The film is based on a novel and associated play ""The Clansman"" by Thomas Dixon, Jr. The original story also featured the controversial (the NAACP heavily criticised it at the time) depiction of black people, and the film uses a number of (white) actors in blackface portraying happy slaves dancing and behaving somewhat primitively. It even goes as far as featuring a black man sexually intimidating a white woman resulting in her death and the formation of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK). Speaking of KKK, the extremist group are portrayed as the saviours of white American society crushing the totalitarian black regime, which is what the black militia, led by the psychopathic character of Silas Lynch, is presented as.<br/><br/>Of course you can dwell by the fact that the film is highly offensive and that it almost single-handedly managed to spark a second wave of success for the KKK who used it for promotion and recruiting for several decades. But the fact of the matter is that ""The Birth of a Nation"" is one of the greatest cinematic achievements of all time and one of the great milestones of film history (and Griffith went on to produce a handful of great and powerful movies in the following years). Furthermore, the story itself may serve as a reminder that the level of equality has improved with time, but at the same time we still have a way to go. It definitely isn't a waste of time to watch it, no matter how infuriating it is."

Some people even call it an embarrassment of a film because of it's racist content and vile depiction of blacks who were played by black faced white actors (except some extras on the background). D.W. Griffith wasn't that much interested about the story itself, but more how to tell the story - how to build up tension and stage epic battle scenes. And there lies the duality of the film. The first part is great with it's depiction of two families - northerners and southerners - who were friends but then suddenly were thrown under the wheels of war and terror. And those terrific battle scenes. But the second part - Reconstruction era - that was awkward, it wasn't that much disgusting (for me) , but awkward to see the glorification of Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>The fact that 'The Birth of a Nation' is a silent film, it's long running time (over three hours) and outrageously racist second half, will not make it an easy watch.

","The Birth of a Nation is quite unique in its combination of innovative film techniques and outright racist content. It has sometimes been praised by American critics as the birth of an art, but this is ignoring what had happened before outside of the United States with films such as Cabiria. Griffith will be even more creative with his masterpiece created the following year: Intolerance.<br/><br/>The main interest of The Birth of a Nation is for me historical. It shows the deep conviction of white people in 1915 that black people could not be equal to them and that they did not even feel this was a racist attitude. Griffith was born only ten years after the end of the Civil War, at the end of the Reconstruction era, in Kentucky, one of the border States which initially declared itself neutral and only eventually affirmed its Union status. His father served as a Confederate Army Colonel. Griffith apparently sincerely believed that the Ku-Klux-Klan would be the saviour of America. As quoted by actress Lilian Gish in her book The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me, he famously answered when he was accused of being anti-Negro: ""To say that is like saying I am against children, as they were our children, whom we loved and cared for all of our lives."" According to the film, the inspiration for the KKK was white children dressed as ghosts to scare black children.<br/><br/>a-cinema-history.blogspot.com/2013/10/"

I think you can get the basic idea of what this film is like without me going any further. What's astonishing is that it was once considered the greatest movie of all time.

This is one of the most unintentionally hilarious moments in cinematic history. We don't care to offend, so let us offer high praise to the Ku Klux Klan, have the majority of black characters actually be whites in blackface (including one scene with ""blacks"" shoving bananas into their mouths like pigs in a trough) and use as our source Dixon's asinine ""The Clansman.""<br/><br/>Of famous American films I remember a quote, ""The worse the book, the better the film."" <br/><br/>I loathe Political Correctness as much as the next white man, but come on! The majority of Americans in 1915 were NOT supporters of the KKK, ""Like history written by lightning,"" Wilson's famous quote, actually was in reference to the huge spectacle of the film in general more than a political comment, (and indicates the President's lack of historical knowledge) and sure, racism did abound at the time. Racism still exists, it is not nice, but is also not as important as pushers of Political Correctness will try to force us to believe. <br/><br/>My hatred of this film is that the film attempts to constantly shove every racist image or idea down our throats. THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STEPINFETCHIT OR WILLIE BEST AND A TRUE DESIRE TO PORTRAY FORCEFULLY BLACKS AS NEAR-ANIMALS.<br/><br/>Griffith was a sick, incredibly overrated director--even when the importance of ""Birth Of A Nation"" is acknowledged, and I certainly acknowledge this film's importance in its use of narrative structure, but little else.

Griffith for creating film as an art form, for maturing the medium.  However, Birth of a Nation did far more damage than good as a film.  Although it is the first true American feature film, feature films were inevitable anyway.  All of the innovations used in the film had already been used in Griffith's previous films and would continue to be used.  It cannot be said that Birth of a Nation was socially acceptable in 1915.  It drew immediate demonstrations against its racism, condemnation by the American president and Congress, and was banned in 8 states.  It is directly responsible for the rise of the KKK in many parts of the South, and was used as a recruitment film for the KKK until the 1960s.  It is sad that such an unfortunate story (how the KKK saved white women from rape, forced marriage and other atrocities perpetrated by black ""monkeymen"" after the end of the Civil War) accompanied this feature film.  However, you cannot separate the story from this film.  To do so would be to ignore the damage this film has caused in U.S. society - damage that is still felt today.  That would be irresponsible."

"XweAponX","1","5","12","10 May 2006"," Horrid, Horrifying... And Frightening!
","I watched this with the best open mind I could conjure up, and it was still not enough. According to several film historians, this type of racial attitude was actually common back when this was made... And it has been said DW Griffith was actually surprised when rebuffed for making this film. But the worst thing about this film is that, for a time, we had forgotten that it was ever made.<br/><br/>Many students of film praise this work, on a purely technical aspect. In good conscience, I cannot praise this work at all for any reason. Certainly there were directorial facets that can be referred to as ""good"" but, to be frank, if you use a toilet, and then not flush, then close the lid and clean the outside of the toilet shiny bright, it does nothing except hide the fact that there is still human waste products, unflushed, in the receptacle. On that analogy, a person would probably smell the stench and see the flies from afar before they even got close to the direct source of the stench of racism. And so I can NOT give this film even the slightest iota of praise: If a thing is rotten at the core, it is rotten through and through.<br/><br/>This is exactly the case we have with this film. Of all the disgusting crap we have been sold over the years to us through the mis-use of the medium of film, This pack of lies did the most damage. This film is represented as if it were history and I am very glad it never happened, except for the unfortunate creation of a secret society that I hate with all my might. This Secret Society NEVER rose to the heights shown in the film, because I think that we as human beings actually knew better even back then to support this type of hate on the scale that was shown in this ""Epic."" The film was presented in much the same way as war films of 1941 to 1944 were presented: As if this ""Society"" were saviours of the Continental US and that ""We all should rise up and keep the repression going and then everybody live happy evah afteh."" If any good can be said about this, it would be that we can see what we do NOT want our nation to become. Unfortunately, this film being made when it was made, and Film being such a new powerful medium, that damage this film wrought lasted for decades, even longer.<br/><br/>This film is a monument to all the very worst of Hollywood: It is a monument to a way of thinking, that certain races of people ought to be ""Good lil boys and girls"" and be seen, not heard, not vote, intermarry, or have any political power whatsoever. This bad way of thinking is not limited to the race in the film, it also spreads to other races from other cultures that have migrated to the US, and even cultures that existed here before this continent was colonised by people from Northern Europe. Even in 1915... This country was not a country with only one race of people living in it, it was a melting pot. But this film represents what we were allowed to see of our nation, and it was the wrong image.<br/><br/>I am frankly astonished that the actors and actresses agreed to be part of such a thing, that they actually cooperated in this. I am thankful that we can look back on this film, as a lesson on all the wrong ways to make a film, or how to treat our neighbors and friends for that matter. I myself apologise, I apologise for this movie.<br/><br/>I also apologise for things like actors in Black Face. You know? Al Jolson, Mickey Rooney, Fred Astaire... in a comedic sense, maybe there is some kind of humour in black face. For me? But what about a person of the race that is being ""parodied?"" - How to they feel about it? The actual origin of the Black Face is a discussion for another time and place. As far as character acting: In modern film, it is possible to change an actors race for a dramatic part, if the actor is good enough: Walter Slezak to Chinese, Jean Simmons to Indian (Not ""American"") in Black Narcissus. But from White to Black, is this proper? I do not know if I can ever view films from the 30's that have follies in them, and enjoy them as I used to. Has any actor put on White face and played a white person? This is a type of hidden boundary that was crossed in Vaudeville and on film, and it is pretty tasteless even to do it in a comedic way: In Birth of a Nation, White actors in Black face was NOT being done in a comedic sense: And to see the film, it is obvious who is in black face and who is a real coloured person. This ought never have been done! Griffith overstepped the boundaries of human decency several times even by thinking of making this film, but the use of white actors in black face was the largest misuse of his authority, and his gifts, if any, of a directorial sense.<br/><br/>As far as I am concerned, this film shows the highest level of disrespect from one race to another ever captured on film. And I am sorry, I am so sorry that this was ever done. So, NO, may it not ever happen again, and may films like this be forever forgotten. May it never happen ever again!"
"medwardb1976","Null","5","12","24 April 2006"," What people must have thought in 1915.
","I thought it might interest others to know that my grandmother, who was the same age as Lillian Gish, saw Birth of a Nation in 1915. She said it was a wonderful film and she wished she could see it again sometime. I believe I may have even heard the comment more than once. The comment was made 50 some odd years after the movie came out. <br/><br/>The interesting thing is that she made no mention of racism, the Ku Klux Klan, or anything else like it. (At that time one could also find TBOAN listed in print as the first truly modern film and a breakthrough. Again, no mention was made of the film's offensive contents.) Now, my grandmother was no racist, at least by the standards of her time, was in full sympathy of the Civil Rights Movement and often said so. So why the silence on the racism of TBOAN? <br/><br/>I think that people like her that remembered such things as a movie they saw a half century earlier must have entirely forgotten what the film was about. And what did she think when she saw it in 1915? Well, my grandmother still lived in Canada at the time, was very worried about Irish independence, the First World War, etc. I would suppose that to her and people like her outside the South, they simply must have taken the material verbatim as fact without any question. Remember, at that time, regions and distances were much more isolated than today and the South would have been an exotic far-away land to most non-Southerners. <br/><br/>In addition, the book And Ladies of the Club by Helen Hooven Santmeyer about post Civil- War society in Ohio, made the comment that while Northerners were passionate about liberating the slaves, that was the extent of it. What happened to them after was not a concern in general in the North. They'd done their job as far as they were concerned. So I conclude that the racism issue of the film was simply a non-issue to contemporary audiences, at least outside of the South. I am glad that we as a society have progressed beyond that."

For I wasn't ready to watch this disgrace of a movie, and I still cannot fathom the anger and rage it caused. No, I am not an african american, nor a descendant of one. I am not an U.S. citizen, either. But it enrages me to watch it, for the sole reason that it is a display of racism and hatred for the masses.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie, not knowing anything about racial conflicts, you might end up thinking that black americans are faithful and obedient when servants, despotic and lawless when in command, and all the while with just enough intelligence to survive. In fact, the leading black players are actually white people in disguise. There are mentions of an ""heroic"" Ku Klux Klan, perpetually outnumbered by the hordes of african americans, and suffering from the worst of humilliations. The black slaves are noble beings, defending their white masters against the other black people. The black people in congress are simple minded, arrogant, badly dressed, with no manners or education whatsoever.<br/><br/>If you are beginning to equate this film with the Nazi propaganda machine of the 1930's, then this review won't be in vain.<br/><br/>Many people would like to believe that we should leave the past behind. That this film should be remembered by its artistic and technological brilliance, and not by the racial hatred it inspired. I say these people are the same that still proclaim the white (aryan, as it is known throughout the film -more Nazi references) race as superior, and that, deep within themselves, still hate and fear the black race.<br/><br/>And thus, we risk in repeating the past ourselves.

","The highest grossing silent film of all time is a grand, epic film, which (I must admit) is the absolute most racist film of all time. While you can see racist undertones throughout, it isn't until the second half of the film until it gets REALLY racist, in which the Klu Klux Klan is portrayed as heroes. Since the KKK is so glorified and the film is practically promoting hardcore racism, I should give it a much, much lower rating. Why support KKK propaganda? Well it's because, if you set aside the racism, this is a near-perfect epic film!<br/><br/>It's a truly glorious spectacle, and it was pretty much worthy of all the praise and financial success it was given. I mean, it changed the history of cinema, itself! It is one of the first film epics (after the 1914 Italian film ""Cabiria"", a film Griffith watched twice in one night before making ""Nation"").<br/><br/>At three hours long, it was a surprisingly engaging experience that used just enough title cards. One of the main scenes that I admire is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln sequence. Very few title cards are used, aside from a few describing the time and what is going on in the scene. <br/><br/>The war scenes are also amazing. Using tons of action and extras these are definitely the most impressive sequences visually and technically. They're are some of the most stunning and epic moments of the entire silent era of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Although it's a very long film (as I said before, it's THREE HOURS), but I found that to be a perfect length for the film. It actually felt like it was less than its length, because of how engaging the whole experience is. At times you could say that, for me, it was entertaining. Yes, I found a three hour long, silent, racist propaganda film quite entertaining at times, but that's just because I found the overall story very interesting and the previously mentioned battle scenes are quite incredible.<br/><br/>Of course, it isn't a film that deserves ONLY praise. While I gave it a 10/10 star rating, it probably doesn't deserve the honor because of it's brutal racism.<br/><br/>As I said, it gets much more racist during the second half of the film in which the forming of the Klu Klux Klan is shown, and how they save the day from the ""depressing"" period of time in which the ""poor"" slave owners lost their slaves by killing African Americans.<br/><br/>The most dreadfully racist scene in the film includes the Klan getting cheered on as they salute their fellow southerners . <br/><br/>Many will think that the film is one of the WORST of all time because of its racism, but my opinion begs to differ. As disgustingly and disturbingly racist as it is, with its black face actors, glorification of the KKK, and victimizing of all African American characters, D.W. Griffith's war epic also manages to be a thrilling, engaging, and action packed epic that has influenced later films for decades to come, and is required viewing for any student of film."

"paulo20","3","4","9","13 December 2004"," A remarkable film, yet also a deplorable one
","Even I, being a casual movie viewer, can recognize some of the things that make The Birth of a Nation such a landmark film. But like any casual viewer of films, I can't overlook the outrageous racist propaganda that is its subject. All the apologist remarks and arguments about historical context or what have you t won't compel me to view this film again (though I do think it should be seen at least once by anyone with more than a casual interest in the history of film). As it is, when I watched it, I often had my thumb firmly on the fast forward button. I may have missed a few nuances of story but I couldn't imagine myself sitting still through a 3-hour silent film.<br/><br/>Which brings me to my next point: why did this film have to be 3 hours long? The film's racist ideology aside, this film is faulty. More specifically, as I suggested before, it's too long. The second and third acts justify their length, but the first act takes too long establishing things. When we're given the gist of a scene with the title card (or whatever you call it), why do we need lengthy (or at least substantial) stretches of soundless dialogue and theatre-acting? Hello? The audience doesn't know what the heck the actors are saying? Why prolong these scenes? When we're told Lincoln is to sign such-and-such bill (for a more concrete example) why do we need to see Lincoln actually sitting down and signing the bill? Let's face it, the most remarkable thing about the film are its innovative battle scenes and various other innovations that modern moviegoers take for granted. In other words, except for the battle scenes, when the film isn't' being offensive, it is being boring. The other quibble I have with the film is the choice of music. Using Civil War time music is fine, but why bring Beethoven into it? I felt the use of Beethoven's 6th was incongruously used and somewhat profaned in this film.<br/><br/>Anyway, all told, it would be hard enough to make the average movie viewer, weaned on colors and sounds and special effects and whatnot, to appreciate this film if it WEREN'T racist. As it is, its subject remains a formidable barrier against such enlightenment. <br/><br/>As a final note, to those who defend the alleged truthfulness of the film, well, there is perhaps a kernel of truth in every instance of propaganda but, remember, it was also true that white Americans owned black slaves. And there is very little propaganda surrounding this particular truth. So I hope you'll forgive me if I fail to feel any sympathy for ""the poor, white Southerner."""

In the second half, it takes on an offensiveness that mere changing times can't excuse. The titles refer approvingly  to the KKK as quelling the force of negro anarchy; the movie consistently seeks out degrading  images of blacks - the grotesquely posturing mulatto;the blacks drinking and taking their shoes off in the legislature; the black who harasses the young woman into jumping off a cliff to her death; the scheming lieutenant governor...and on and on - contrasted with the piousness of the prevailing tone and the ludicrous would-be stirring patriotic aspect of the project, it adds up to a chilling spectacle. Students of early film could no doubt point out the things this film did before any others, but that aside the staging is mainly static and ponderous; the most distinctive images are also the most dated. It's most intriguing when capable of being viewed as a pure curio - as with the assassination of Lincoln or the surrender of Lee, dramatized like some rickety local theater costume party."

","How ""Triumph of the Will"" can be hailed as a masterpiece is strangely more understandable than the persistent acclaim of this atrocious example of a mass medium used to disseminate ideas of duplicitous evil. From a historical standpoint, Griffith's Civil War and Reconstruction themed saga of three plus hours, was a blueprint for modern narrative film, but do its methodological novelties justify the movie's claim to be a work of art ? Can, in any event, a practical recruitment ad for the Ku Klux Klan, be viewed as a work of art ? Can the climactic ""rescue ride"" by the white-hooded clansmen be deemed exciting ? No more so, I daresay, than a pornographic video, no matter how high in quality, which depicts simulated rape or torture. But the latter's existence is in a way, more justifiable, since assisting a disturbed individual to release (usually his) dark fantasy in a safe manner is not the same as an active promotion of hatred. No smutmaker would ever demand legitimate recognition as an artist, and no critic would ever even give so much as a thought to lauding a smut flick, even if it's a personal favorite. But ""Birth of a Nation"" has a greater purpose than instant gratification - as the opening intertitles declare, to ""preserve the purity of the Aryan race"", and to paint the events as truth, albeit unfortunate. Watching the film in its entirety can be an ordeal which one does not soon forget. It is a spectacle of little dramatic merit : after calculated sentimentality of the prewar exposition, and a few grand-scale battles, the ""Negro savages"" (white actors in blackface who act like subhuman troglodytes, bipedal apes) are introduced, and an indignant posse of ""noble white knights"" is promptly assembled to liberate the South once and for all. What follows is a spectacle that makes one twitch in disgust and anger, the viewing of which can start a riot in a matter of minutes. Only for educational reasons, to stimulate meaningful discussion, Griffith's opus should not be prohibited from being shown, as any first-amendment protected work. The director himself later repented, making some real cinema with the the obvious title ""Intolerance"" in 1916. Why the AFI voters did not include that instead, baffles any intelligent mind."

","First of all, I guess this film makes me proud to be a Northerner. It makes sense that D.W. Griffith was born and raised in Kentucky, as his Confederate values surely ring true in this movie.<br/><br/>Putting the film in its context I guess makes more sense, the film did come out in 1915 - a time when even women couldn't vote. I just couldn't get over the film justifying the formation of the KKK based on the perceived lack of power of one Southern family. But I digress.<br/><br/>The film was interesting enough at least in its techniques, it's the only silent film I've seen that actually gives close-ups of faces and I could actually easily follow the plot of the story.

"dbn3","6","3","6","31 October 2005"," A Tale of Two Movies
","D.W. Griffith has made two movies and put them on the same set of reels. The first half of the movie depicts antebellum south and the Civil War. The second half of the movie depicts the reconstruction of the south after the civil war. But they are more than just halves of the movie; they are really two different movies. The first part is a sincere attempt to recreate the factual events of the Civil War as told through the eyes of the Stonemans and the Camerons. The second part is just as sincere, but the focus is on the myths and emotions of the south after the civil war.<br/><br/>The first half of the film tracks orthodox history so closely (and there are those ""AN HISTORICAL FACISIMILIE"" notes on some of the slides) that it is easy to think the rest is correct history, too. Maybe that was what D.W. Griffith was trying to achieve. In any case, the real history of the second part is the true history of the fears and mythology of the white south after the war. They often did look on blacks as children who needed to be cared for to keep them from hurting themselves. They did think slavery was good for the blacks. They did think that a black man wanted nothing more badly than to live in a nice white mansion and to have a white wife. The second half of the film doesn't portray the history of events so much as the history of emotions.<br/><br/>Is this an outdated movie? Look at the reaction of the white establishment to popular black entertainers. They are outraged by videos on MTV or BET of strong black men who have money and sexual virility. Why is that? I think some of that outrage is the continuing echoes of the white fears of black sexuality so strongly brought out in this movie. Margaret Cameron's father Dr. Cameron is prepared to kill her before the blacks get her. Flora Cameron jumps to her death rather than be raped by a black man. The mulattoes, the products of the sexual unions Whites feared the most are depicted as the worst in the film -- from Austin Stoneman's mulatto maid who is sexually after him to the uncomfortably named Silas Lynch who is the mulatto who runs the town after the blacks take over.<br/><br/>Is this a racist movie? Of course, but I really didn't have any problem with the racism in the plot of the movie. It was easy to understand and absorb -- like reading a speech by Jefferson Davis in a history book. The racism that kept bugging me when I was watching the movie was the racism in Hollywood itself. All of the black and mulatto characters that get any significant amount of screen time are all white actors in blackface. When there were actually blacks used, it was only as extras -- such as when they show slaves picking cotton.<br/><br/>Cinematic skill - Griffith often uses some kind of mask to block out distracting edges of the picture or to frame a portrait picture of the actor. It has the effect of focusing your attention where he wants you to look. It makes for a tighter shot and probably was a substitute for a close-up lens. I assume there were no moving zoom lenses, but Griffith makes up for that by using a mask that can widen or shrink to give a zoom in or zoom out effect."
"Michael1958","10","6","16","9 November 2002"," It is an unpleasant story, but cinema wise for it's time-it's great!
","A lot of people who view this film, do so with contemporary viewpoints on the story. To be sure, they are not so nice to see. The film was made by D.W. Griffith, who did not make this movie for just any audience. He obviously made it for white people. It tells a story that people of southern U.S. white heritage still felt strongly about in 1915 and possibly even today. The Civil War and Reconstruction, the latter being very reviled. It is not taught much today, but it was facts that some Reconstruction policies helped lead to a rise of groups in the south like the Klan. These policies did help to elevate the former slaves to higher status, but as in any culture. Once the U.S. Army pulled out of southern areas, where they had been the enforcers of Reconstruction-all heck broke loose. Sadly, terrible acts of supposed revenge were carried out by whites upon blacks. From the viewpoint of a man who was born in that time, we get Birth of a Nation. It was how he saw it and how many southern whites saw it-possibly to justify racist Jim Crow laws. The film, despite the story is not just well done for cinema of 1915, it is very well done. Forget the whining about black faced white actors playing the films black characters. I got news for you politically correct folks-black face was in 1915 and had been for almost a 100 years a very common entertainment practice. By 1915 standards, there is absolutely nothing wrong with it or out of place. The fact is this, Birth of a Nation proved that feature length motion pictures were viable and profitable. It paved the way for better films that would come. Yes, the story could have been something different. Filmmakers like Griffith, Spielberg, Selznick and Coen brothers are all driven to make movies about subjects they feel strong about, dreams they had must come to the screen. This was Griffiths, for other's it reflects a nightmare of what was. If I were a black person viewing this film, I would not like it. As a white person I like it for what it helped to bring about for film future. Griffith took a chance, just as a black Spike Lee took on several of his films.   Lastly, Birth of a Nation takes the beating by modern day viewers that Gone With The Wind should be getting. That film made almost 25 years later didn't help the plight of black folks either. I personally think that film is wretched in it's depiction of black people. The only difference is that black people appear in some of the same subservient roles that were in Birth. Enough said, see it for yourself, hate it then-but before just passing it by-see it!"

The innovater, the first man to truly show the world what power the cinema can have. The scenes portraying the Ku Klux Klan would shock any person in his right mind today. Then again this is not a product of our time, and that is what makes this motion picture even more fascinating. More than any other film ""The Birth of a Nation"" is a piece of history itself. We're talking about a film produced during the first World War, three years after the Titanic went down, more than EIGHTY YEARS ago! And that in mind; Griffith's staging of the many epic scenes is breathtaking, the cinematography is groundbreaking, and sure: it's racist, but that too has to be looked upon as another product of that time and era. We're talking about a movie so old several of the extras probably fought in the original civil war, and that in mind should make any true movie buff go ""WOW!"" over this impressive piece of celluloid masterpiece. It's like Leni Riefenstahl's legendary documentary ""Triumph of the Will""; the propaganda in it can scare you, but it's too much a brilliant, groundbreaking work of art to be overlooked."

"De_Sam","1","5","14","15 October 2015"," The Racism cannot be excused
","Film is an art, and Griffith was the pioneer of this vision, he saw himself as a great genius and the 'father of narrative cinema'; when he left American Biograph after his film Judith of Bethulia he went to Hollywood and put an advertisement for himself in the paper that contained a list of all his previous films, he was certain a studio would recruit him.<br/><br/>This complacency is also on show in the very first shot of the film, namely the trademark outline for the text, containing Griffith's name in the upper-right and -left corner and his initials on the bottom. It is quite evident he loves himself very much.<br/><br/>I see a lot of reviews here trying to justify the racism in the film by saying that in 1915 everyone was racist. Then how come the film immediately sparked protest after its release? The NAACP was successful in removing some of the racists parts of the film; it was cut from 1544 to 1375 shots. Because Griffith made the film without a script and those cut scenes were destroyed, we can only guess what other ghastly things were on them -the fact that the extremely racist South Carolina Parliament scene was not cut, does make me wonder just how bad those removed takes were.<br/><br/>In typical Griffith vanity, he felt attacked and violated for the public had stained his genius and masterpiece. He went to make a whole three-and-a-half film to vindicate the 'Intolerance' of those who opposed his racist depictions. The audience did not like this unsubtle message and Intolerance became one of the biggest flops in Hollywood history (the fact that it was such a complicated film for the time was also a big factor, but just let me believe in this delusion of poetic justice).<br/><br/>It the sneering tone or the rating did not convey it yet, I absolutely loathe this film. The depiction of Afro-Americans as uncivilised, alcoholics, rapists and other depictions you would assign to the concept of untermenschen, makes my blood boil. There is a big difference between denigrating a group of people (as the Indians have been subject of in many Westerns) for the sake of the narrative and the way Griffith denigrates a whole social group (believing in the separation of the human race in 'sub-races' is in itself racist). The only time Afro-Americans are portrayed as sympathetic is when they are submissive; Griffith states this as 'the Aryan birthright' of the white South.<br/><br/>The worst part of Griffith's film is the revival of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States, he has Afro-American blood on his hands. This fact in itself is enough for me to give this the lowest rating possible. I do not care for this 'encyclopaedia of what film was capable on a technical level', if Griffith had not made this film another director would eventually have mode a similar film, one I would have actually been able to enjoy."

To my dismay, I was physically unable to sit through the whole thing and had to take breaks here and there in order to make it through the plot, which was stretched beyond breaking point.

","-The Birth of a Nation- is a technical masterpiece, one of the first convincing settings of a grand epic. Through the Civil War one has a picture little more objectionable than -Gone With the Wind- , the first movie about the Civil War and its aftermath to upstage it. -Gone With the Wind- is also racist by standards of our time.<br/><br/>D.W. Griffith gets obvious credit for creating a convincing story line, for innovative techniques of camera work, and convincing battle scenes. If some parts of it -- especially the racial stereotypes and the mythologized history -- look hokey, then think of how much more sophisticated Americans are ninety years later, when the Ku Klux Klan is an object of ridicule even in the South.<br/><br/>Whatever you say about the message, you must admit that the character of ""Silas Lynch"" (George Siegmann, obviously a white man in blackface), is one of the most convincing villains of the screen -- a base man who achieves great power as Lieutenant Governor after the Civil War but uses it only for base ends, somewhat analogous to the ""Adenoid Hynkel"" character that Chaplin created in -The Great Dictator- . Likewise, ""Lydia Brown"" (Mary Alden, a white woman in blackface), a conniving, devious, but ignorant villainess. Are those characters mere stereotypes? Sure. They are about as realistic as the fake dye on their faces and the shoe polish hair. In 1915, most white people didn't know that.<br/><br/>It is not until the Reconstruction that things get objectionable. Say all that one wants about the Reconstruction governments -- they were on a whole less corrupt and more responsive to the needs of poor people in the South than any that followed until at least the 1960s, even if the poor blacks who won some elections were often ill-prepared for holding power (as if the plantation system were intended to prepare a slave for anything other than abject servitude). The only 'good' blacks are those who subordinate themselves to white people in knowledge of their 'God-ordained, lowly place'. A white do-gooder like ""Austin Stoneman"" (Ralph Lewis) sees nothing wrong with black power until his daughter Elsie (Lilian Gish) becomes the object of a lurid affection from ""Silas Lynch"". No matter what one's views on the Ku-Klux-Klan of the Reconstruction era or of later Klans, one must admit that its 'cavalry charge' is impressive. <br/><br/>The great paradox is that D.W. Griffith wanted an anti-war movie, but -Birth of a Nation- ends in the triumph of the Ku-Klux-Klan, a group even more violent than the cardboard villains and crazed fools that Griffith portrays. How could the final scene -- an election in which dirty tricks are played upon potential black voters -- serve a sustainable peace? <br/><br/>Nearly a century later, it isn't -The Birth of a Nation- that has changed; it is we Americans who have changed. America even elected Barack Obama as President.<br/><br/>The very survival of America depended upon the defeat of two monstrous enemies, Nazi Germany and thug Japan, for which racism was the cornerstone of the empires that their leaders sought to build. We can no longer see this gigantic epic, half brilliant and half horrific, as people might have seen it a century ago. Thank God -- and better yet, thank Thurgood Marshall, Rosa Parks, Dr. Martin Luther King, and other real heroes."
"lugonian","9","3","7","10 January 2003"," A Civil War Story and Its Aftermath
","THE BIRTH OF A NATION (Epoch, 1915), directed by D.W. Griffith, based on Thomas Dixon's book and play, ""The Clansman,"" ranks one of the first and most important silent films ever produced, in fact, the first American movie epic set during and after the Civil War. It features an all star cast including Lillian Gish as Elsie Stoneman; Ralph Lewis as Austin Stoneman; Miriam Cooper as Margaret Cameron, known as ""The Daughter of the South""; Robert Harron as Tod Stoneman; Donald Crisp as General U.S. Grant; and Mary Alden as Lydia Brown, along with Eugene Palette and Elmo Lincoln presented in smaller roles.<br/><br/>After a brief prologue set in the 17th century with the introduction of slavery into this country, the dramatization moves forward to the 1860s, introducing the Stonemans, a Northern family, and the Camerons of Piedmont, South Carolina, and how two American families are torn apart after the outbreak of what has become historically known as the Civil War. Ben Cameron (Henry B. Walthall), better known as ""The Little Colonel,"" thus, heads his troops out of Piedmont, and leads a heroic charge against a Union trench, commanded by Phil Stoneman (Elmer Clifton). Consisting of then realistic battle scenes superbly recreated and retold on screen, the war finishes with General Robert E. Lee's (Howard Gaye) surrender, and that historic evening of April 14, 1865, as President Abraham Lincoln (Joseph Henabery) is seated in the balcony with his wife, Mary, at the Ford Theater attending the play, ""Our American Cousin,"" only to become assassinated by an actor crazed named John Wilkes Booth (Raoul Walsh). END OF PART I. The second half focuses on the painful reconstruction of the South, the newly freed slaves dominating South Carolina, and how Silas Lynch (George Siegmann) uses the ex-slaves with false promises to help him achieve power for himself. During this segment, there's one notable scene in which Gus, a Renegade Negro (Walter Long) becomes responsible for the death of Flora Cameron (Mae Marsh), after being pursued by him in fear of being attacked, thus, plunging to her death. To save the South from mass destruction, Cameron forms a group ""to protect the Southern country,"" better known today as the Ku Klux Klan, with Gus as one of their first victims.<br/><br/>I first stumbled upon THE BIRTH OF A NATION when it premiered on public broadcasting station of WNET, Channel 13, in New York City, an introduction to its weekly series, ""Films of Persuasion"" in September 1977. Having read and heard so much about this legendary, but controversial silent film, I finally got to see why it is listed among one of the top 50, or 100 greatest movies of all time, and at the same time, how it has been denounced by civil rights organizations. At the length of 158 minutes (depending on the projection speed by various video distributors), the story divided into two parts: The first on the two families, the Camerons and Stonemans, the outbreak of the finish of the Civil War. After a pause of intermission time, the final hour, dealing with the reconstruction, is where the controversy lies. Had THE BIRTH OF A NATION been a simple two hour Civil War story, then it would have been categorized as a historical epic retold. The second half, however, changes all that with aftermath of the war, from the South's point of view, or Griffith's, leading to the birth of the Ku Klux Klan. The surprise is finding how the now free black slaves are portrayed as villains with the Clansmen the heroes. What an eye opener this was way back in 1915, and even today! How much of the story depicted in this photo-play is true actually relies on its director. One would have to do some thorough research to actually find out more about this particular era. Fortunately for Griffith, THE BIRTH OF A NATION didn't destroy his directorial career as a whole, not by a longshot. Griffith followed BIRTH with another epic, INTOLERANCE (1916). Observers would take note that these epics each come to similar conclusions.<br/><br/>Regardless of its controversy over the years, THE BIRTH OF A NATION is fine story telling, and quite a long movie at that. KINO Video restored THE BIRTH OF A NATION with a new orchestral score and color tints in the 1990s. While the restoration is fine, the score that goes with it seems to take away from the full impact of the story. The best copy to obtain is the one by Blackhawk Video, later Republic Pictures Home Video, distributed in the 1980s and '90s. The orchestral score, conducted by Fraser McDonald, seemed better suited. The Blackhawk version lists the actors and their roles along with its staff prior to its opening while the KINO version does not. A shorter version of THE BIRTH OF A NATION exists through its 1930 ninety-minute reissue. To see THE BIRTH OF A NATION today, one would have to accept the fact that the movie has been made, released, studied, and nothing about this film can ever be changed. It can be hailed as Griffith's greatest achievement or a disgrace to cinema history. Sure, an original negative could be found and destroyed, but it'll be hard to pretend it never existed. It'll remain, till the end of time, a matter of taste or a curiosity at best.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF A NATION, now available on DVD, occasionally airs on Turner Classic Movies, usually in its nearly three hour print from Kino Video.(****)"

Between its premiere in 1915 and the first talking picture it grossed a staggering $18 million.  Given the cost of seeing a film in those days, it is perhaps no overstatement to say that, per capita, this film drew more viewers into theaters during its time than any other in all of history.<br/><br/>Yet many see it today as just a racist film put together by a complete bigot.  Well, that is a social (not a film) criticism.  The truth is that in this film D. W. Griffith  whether he actually invented the narrative elements or not  did absolutely everything it was possible to do with a camera at that time.  He also managed to do this with material that was obviously very meaningful to the viewers of the day.  The audience consisted largely of first and second generation descendents of what remains this nation's greatest national tragedy.  Developing such material in a complex, provocative, and entertaining manner is a towering achievement that deserves to be viewed and cherished in its own right without social judgment.<br/><br/>Setting content aside and looking at cinematic innovation we see that The Birth of a Nation set standards by dictating its own orchestral score, by the use of parallel action, and by cross-cutting edits to heighten a sense of suspense when appropriate.  It was the first film to depict night scenes. Griffith directed intimate close-ups as well as vast panoramic natural landscapes, using both intelligently to evoke specific emotional responses. As I said, it can be argued that Griffith did not invent all of these elements, but certainly no other film prior to The Birth of a Nation put them together as a singular artistic vision of this magnitude.<br/><br/>It is not analyzing the film very deeply to discern only its racist perspective and allow that greater weight than the absolute facts of its overwhelming popularity (in the face of significant controversy even in its time) and its technical triumphs.  The Birth of a Nation is the world's first great film and it easily ranks with the best work of Chaplin and Keaton in achieving the highest quality of art in the silent picture format."

","for those of you who have decided to critique Griffith based upon his jaded view of the South during Reconstruction and his celebration of the Ku-Klux Klan, you should note that simply because Griffith may have espoused prejudiced doctrine, his imagery is no less powerful nor less expressive than any movie since made. From eyeline matches to parallel editing, expressive framing to the simple vocabulary associated with movies, Griffith's piece provide a veritable textbook on movie-making. He is indeed the father of modern movies, and those of you who are offended by Griffith's first feature should consider why that is so. Is it because his imagery is too powerful and well shot to be ignored. Upon closer inspection, and the removal of one's attachment to the content, positive or negative, you should hopefully gain a new appreciation for ""The Birth of a Nation""..."

","The truth is that this film is offensive in regards to it's treatment of African Americans.  However, if you look beyond that, and look at the craftsmanship and the technology then this film is a masterpiece.  The use of tinting and the Iris shot were firsts, and really added to the drama of the film.  There were scenes that were shot outdoors, not on some closed off closet of a soundstage.  It would be several years before any film matched this one.  For 1915, this was an amazing breakthrough in filmaking. <br/><br/>However, it should be noted, that from a civil rights standpoint, this film is inexcusably racist and demeaning.  The stereotype of blacks as fried chicken eating slobs who covet white women, is on full display here.  This is not suprising considering the movie is based on a book called ""The Clansman.""  It is said, that Griffith made his epic ""Intolerance"" as an apology for ""Birth of a Nation.""  If one can ignore the fact that the movie extols the virtues of the Klan, and see its other fine points, then you will see it for the marvel that it is."

","Whether or not one buys into the long-standing suggestion that D.W. Griffith virtually invented much of the ""film grammar"" (the close-up and the cross-cut, for example) and the American feature length film used by narrative moviemakers to this day, The Birth of a Nation remains a simple-minded, horrifyingly racist piece of garbage unworthy of its misguided praise.  Griffith's pathetic Victorian sensibility -- already on the verge of being old-fashioned at the time of The Birth of a Nation's release in 1915 -- undermines the epic's value as the genesis of film as art, even if its lavish release and exorbitant ticket prices gave cinema its first taste of respectability.  Cases in point: the god-awful leap off of a cliff by Mae Marsh to avoid being raped by an emancipated slave and the idiotic, preposterous plotline in which Lillian Gish is to be enthroned alongside a black leader who plans to start a ""Negro"" nation.  So much for Griffith's attitudes about Reconstruction."
"Otoboke","6","2","4","16 July 2016"," The Birth of Film-Based Propaganda.
","It is often said that there are two sides to every story and The Birth of a Nation is certainly one of the most extreme examples that can be pointed to in evidence of this case. The film is split into two parts, the first of which covers the brief lead up to, effective dramatisation and culmination of the American Civil War. This part showcases all of Griffith's strongest capabilities as a director for the time in which he served American film-going audiences so early on. Although he tends to use special camera effects more for portraying vast scenes of action rather than intimate, reflective moments of beauty, the director nevertheless draws on works like Dante's Inferno and Calibria for inspiration in this regard. And while not quite as revolutionary as you may be lead to believe by other critics, his style and choice of editing amongst other aspects was at least revolutionary when shown in 1915 on American silver screens. There's no doubt about it, The Birth of a Nation is a well-made film.<br/><br/>But then, there's the second part which deals in the aftermath of the Civil War and serves less as a historically-inclined action blockbuster and more of a narrow-minded piece of American culture that unfortunately wasn't just the viewpoint of one man. Indeed, although titled ""Birth of a Nation"", one could argue that the film rather serves as the birth of film-based propaganda, purely because of this act. Rather fittingly, the film's second act opens with a disclaimer of sorts that vaguely echoes the now all-too-familiar refrain uttered by closet-bigots of ""I'm not racist, but"" before moving on swiftly to do nothing but demonise one skin colour and anglicise the other. But still, it's not as if Griffith suddenly stops making a good film. He just stops making a morally-sound one, and this is where things get tricky.<br/><br/>On a personal level, I thought the film was distasteful, but mostly engaging. One could argue that maybe such levels of engagement might not have been present if not for the eye-popping, jaw-dropping content and points of view, but Griffith's skills as a film-maker are nevertheless undoubted. The problem is, as a reviewer, who do you recommend this film to? I'd love to say film enthusiasts, but to be honest, I'm probably never going to watch this film again and feel that all things considered, wouldn't have missed out on that much had I gave it a pass. Also, what is it that makes a film ""good"" or ""worth watching"" in the first place? This depends upon the individual. For some it's about the stars, others the acting or the plot or the special effects or something else. Many people wonder why The Birth of a Nation is as widely-available and openly praised as an all-time great when at the same time it is as deeply flawed at its moral core as it is. The thing is that critics tend to favour aesthetic and a film being well-made is merely enough to make it worth seeing. That's fine and works for many modern works, but for something as out-of-time as this, it can lead to some problems. Namely that they in-turn end up recommending something vulgar and hateful, racist and bigoted.<br/><br/>So while I can appreciate and understand what makes Giffith's work here such a classic and well-made piece of cinema history, I also find it impossible to sit back and merely ignore everything that's wrong with it, which is a hell of a lot. The Birth of a Nation is surely a spectacle and does plenty of things right, but its naivety and narrow- mindedness about its central views trouble it to the point of bringing down the structure that props it up so loftily. Which is a shame, because at its core is a brilliantly executed tour de force that does what American cinema had never done before, and in some regards, thankfully never did again quite so heedlessly."
"GusF","Null","2","4","30 May 2016"," As brilliantly made as it is incredibly racist
","Based on the 1905 novel ""The Clansman"" by Thomas F. Dixon, Jr., this silent film epic is as brilliantly made as it is incredibly racist. It has often been hailed as one of the most important films in cinematic history because of the techniques that its director D. W. Griffith, a master of his craft, pioneered while working on it. Many of the techniques that audiences now take for granted such as long shots, pan shots and frequent use of intercutting made their first appearance here. The battle scenes are thrilling, beautifully staged and surprisingly violent for the time. The script by Griffith and Frank E. Woods is very well structured and, while it inspired many feelings in me, boredom was not one of them. <br/><br/>The film depicts a version of the United States, North and South, and its people, black and white, which only ever existed in the minds of bitter Southerners. Its warped, ahistorical treatment of race relations led to widespread protests by the NAACP, riots in several major cities and, according to one report, the murder of a black teenager by a white man as a direct result of the latter watching the film (though the evidence is less than conclusive). The film has also been blamed for contributing to the revival of the Ku Klux Klan, which had essentially ceased to exist in the 1870s but returned with a vengeance over the course of the next few years. <br/><br/>The storyline follows two families, the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons, who are acquainted as a result of the fact that the eldest sons attended boarding school together. The film's first half concerns the prelude to the Civil War and the war itself while the second concerns Reconstruction. Austin Stoneman, played by Ralph Lewis, is the Speaker of the House of Representatives and a thinly veiled version of the Radical Republican Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, even possessing a club foot. Like Stevens, Stoneman is not only an abolitionist but believes that blacks and whites are equal. As such, he is one of the major villains of the piece. The other major villain, his biracial protégé Silas Lynch, does not appear until the second half but he is depicted as being a truly evil, venomous character who seeks to create a Black Empire in the South with himself as its king. The only other African-American shown to have any real intelligence is Stoneman's housekeeper Lydia Brown, who is likewise biracial. Based on Stevens' housekeeper and alleged lover Lydia Hamilton Smith, she only appears briefly but she is clearly intended as a Lady Macbeth type who manipulates Stoneman into going along with her ideas of equality. <br/><br/>Most of the other black characters are depicted as being ultra- violent, cruel, detestable and sometimes little more than animals. In one particularly disturbing scene, a black renegade named Gus - played by Walter Long in blackface - attempts to rape the fragile waif Flora Cameron, ultimately driving her to commit suicide. The implication of this scene is clear: black men will rape and kill every white Southern woman unless the KKK does something about them. It's one of the most sickening sequences in a film which has no shortage of them, particularly in its second half. The only black characters portrayed in a sympathetic light are the Camerons' ""faithful souls"" - perfect illustrations of the Mammy and Uncle stereotypes - and various slaves who were much happier before they were freed. The majority of the black characters are played by white actors in blackface but there are many black extras in the background. They were probably glad to get some work but I have to wonder what they thought of the film, especially Madame Sul-Te-Wan whose parents were freed slaves.<br/><br/>Although the film is perhaps best remembered for its glorification of the KKK, they do not actually appear until 2 hours and 5 minutes into the 3 hour and 13 minute running time but they certainly make their presence felt after that. They are described as ""the organisation that saved the South from the anarchy of black rule"" and that really says it all when it comes to the film's attitude towards them. They are depicted performing several supposedly heroic feats such as hanging Gus, dumping his corpse on Lynch's doorstep and rescuing the bound and gagged Elsie Stoneman before she can be forced into marrying Lynch. The Klan's founder is Elsie's lover Ben Cameron, otherwise known as ""the Little Colonel.""<br/><br/>One thing that surprised me was the fact that Abraham Lincoln was treated very positively with Dr. Cameron even describing him as ""our best friend"" when it comes to Reconstruction. There are some moments that seemed genuine such as Phil Stoneman and Margaret Cameron's shy interaction when they first meet and Elsie putting on a brave face as her three brothers leave for war before bursting into tears the moment that they leave. It's a lovely little moment which is wonderfully acted by Lillian Gish. Although most of the characters are misconceived to some degree, the film nevertheless has a very strong cast: Miriam Cooper as Margaret, Henry B. Walthall as Colonel Cameron, Mary Alden as Lydia Brown, Ralph Lewis as Stoneman, Elmer Clifton as Phil, Spottiswoode Aitken as Dr. Cameron and Josephine Crowell as Mrs. Cameron.<br/><br/>Overall, neither the importance of the film nor its racism have been exaggerated. I think Roger Ebert said it best: ""Like Riefenstahl's 'The Triumph of the Will', it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil.""<br/><br/>I'm sort of torn about how to rate this film. In terms of quality, I'd give it 10/10. If I were to rate it in terms of morality (something that I have never done before and may never do again), I'd give it 0/10."
"CJBx7","Null","2","4","14 April 2014"," A Technical Milestone and an Embarrassing Stain on American Cinema
","BIRTH OF A NATION tells the story of two families during the American Civil War - the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons - and how the war and its aftermath affect their lives. BIRTH OF A NATION is unquestionably a milestone in the history of movies, setting the template for modern narrative structure through remarkable advancements in cinematography and editing. It is also, just as unquestionably, a film scarred by vicious racism and revisionist history, distorted through the lens of a white supremacist viewpoint. For those reasons, I don't feel I can give it an appropriate star rating.<br/><br/>SCRIPT: The movie's biggest problem, by far. Even though there are hints of racism at the beginning, the first act of BIRTH OF A NATION has some touching moments that display the human cost of war and how it impacts families. It has moments of romance and humor as well. However, the movie takes a fatal tumble in the second act, descending into lurid, unsubtle, shrieking melodrama and blatant historical revisionism, tainted with a toxic bigotry. The movie asks viewers to applaud the KKK, an organization founded on terrorism and hatred, as well as political and social disenfranchisement of African-Americans (including voter suppression) and lynching. It asks us to condemn interracial marriage, disapprove of the black population's desire for equality, and view mixed-race characters as evil. The characterizations are quite literally in black and white – white equals good, black equals bad (except for the Camerons' servants, who are called ""faithful souls"" because they continue to subject themselves to their white masters). Additionally, Griffith subjects two of his heroines to threats of rape (one imagined, one real), all designed to increase audience hatred of the black characters and sympathy for his virtuous maidens. (This is a most disturbing and unfortunate trope that he would use in future films as well, minus the racial element.) The fanatical prejudice and third-rate histrionics sink the entire movie.<br/><br/>ACTING: The acting in this film is of variable quality. I'm aware that there was a tendency to broad performances in contemporary theater and films, but Griffith's cast was renowned for their naturalistic, restrained approach in the Biograph shorts, which makes the lapses here somewhat surprising. I feel that the best performance overall is given by the underrated Miriam Cooper as older sister Margaret Cameron, who plays her scenes with a quite modern sense of realism. Henry B Walthall also plays his character credibly, even though you can't root for him – his character does found the KKK, after all. Lillian Gish has some good moments but this isn't her best role, as even she falls prey to stagy histrionics at several points during the film – her performance looks quite artificial, even by contemporary standards. Mae Marsh is also hit and miss as the little sister Flora – charming at times, but excessively jumpy and rather theatrical. Some of the mugging and flailing results in unintentionally funny moments, and the ""black"" characters (played by whites in blackface) are nothing more than caricatures.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY/PRODUCTION: The only really positive legacy of this film was its advancements in visual narrative. Griffith did not invent close-ups, cross cutting, or tinting, but he put these devices together in a cohesive way. This film is quite different from stagy earlier features like QUEEN ELIZABETH or CLEOPATRA, and shows a more advanced use of editing than the influential Italian epic CABIRIA. The battle scenes are quite detailed and realistic. Tinting is used expressively and there are some quite impressive moments in the framing of the shots. However, none of that is remotely enough to compensate for the film's other weaknesses – people don't generally watch movies for cinematography, they watch them for their stories.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: BIRTH OF A NATION remains controversial. Movie critics and scholars praise it as a masterpiece for its technical and narrative innovations, but most general movie viewers are rightly repelled by its poisonous racism. The film has some touching and humane moments, but they are negated by its adherence to white supremacist thought, its brazen historical revisionism, and its shamelessly manipulative melodramatics. It is a milestone in movie history, undeniably – but not entirely for good reasons. I can't give this film any stars or endorse it in any way because of that. In spite of its innovations, in its entirety as a work of art, BIRTH OF A NATION fails to stand the test of time. Of all the films that could have changed cinema forever, it's a shame that this movie had to be the one."

","The Birth of a Nation was the highest grossing production of the silent film era. It was revered for its groundbreaking camera techniques and narrative achievements but also explicitly racist and controversial. It was based on a play by Reverend Thomas Dixon Jr. called The Clansman. Although there were many black characters in the film only the minor roles were actually played by blacks, all of the major roles were played by whites in blackface. It was also very controversial because of its glorification of the activities of the Ku Klux Klan and its portrayal of the African American people as stereotypical and animalistic. It was voted as one of the top 100 American films by the The American Film Institute in 1998 a decision that was immediate criticized by the NAACP. Two scenes were subsequently cut from the film. Riots broke out in major cities including Chicago and Philadelphia after its screening and it was banned from being shown in eight states. For years after its release, screenings of the film were picketed and many lawsuits were filed. The most chilling result of the release of this film was an increase in Ku Klux Klan membership in the decades following its release and it is still used today as a recruitment tool for the racist organization."

","Leaving the message aside for the moment, I don't think that anyone could deny that for 1915 this was a monumental achievement. Griffith was a genuine innovator, and one of the first. As a film maker he deserves at least the disinterest that Leni Riefenstahl gets.<br/><br/>He's often said to have ""invented the grammar of film,"" whatever that means. (For twenty years I've had trouble thinking of anything, except language, as a language.) He didn't invent cross-cutting, a device that shows us a critical scene, cuts to the onrushing rescuers, then back and forth to juice up the tension. But he did invent what came to be called ""invisible editing."" Ante-Griffith, if there was a scene in which someone wiped his forehead of sweat, it was done in a single shot. Post-Griffith, we might see the figure in a far shot begin to lift his handkerchief, then a cut to a medium close up in which the figure completes the action, beginning precisely where it was cut off in the previous shot.<br/><br/>That doesn't sound like much but it did alter the way movies were made, and Griffith does it here. He also tells a LONG and complicated story forthrightly and with a minimum use of title cards, a big relief because, man, are the titles stilted, sentimental, florid, embarrassing. But making such a lengthy and still coherent movie was an achievement in itself. It was a big, expensive movie with lots of characters and hundreds of extras, about an epic event in history, and Griffith pulls it off. Credit where credit is due.<br/><br/>It's impossible to comment on the performances because they are all over wrought, as was the convention at the time. I suppose the casting is adequate, if not very subtle. Lillian Gish is fetchingly virginal with her tiny lips, but I preferred Miriam Cooper as one of the Southern Cameron daughters. She has a prominent nose, black hair, and dark soulful eyes, and she looks as if she's been around a little.<br/><br/>The DVD I have is splotched and marred and the only virtue of the sound track is that you get to hear The New World Symphony from beginning to end and, here and there, excerpts from other light classics.<br/><br/>At this point it becomes impossible to avoid talking about the plot. Here's the story. Happy Southern Cameron family, riding horses and such, chuckling along with the happy darkies picking the cotton. Sour-looking Senator Stoneman in Pennsylvania, abolitionist, who is nevertheless close friends with the Cameron family. Stoneman boy loves Cameron girl.<br/><br/>Then comes the war. (Kids: That's the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865. The North won.) A title card informs us that Lincoln has just asserted the rights of the federal government over those of the sovereign states, the first time since Cornwallis surrendered at Yorktown. (Kids: That's a reference to the Revolutionary War. PS: We won.) If your ears haven't pricked up before, now's the time for them to do it. Griffith either forgot about, or didn't know, about the Articles of Confederation being replaced by the Constitution.<br/><br/>In any case this is not the place to refight the Civil War or to argue over the Reconstruction Era that followed the Federal victory. Part I takes the viewer up through the Civil War and is generally accurate. Part II goes completely ape. ""I will build a Black Empire and you will be my white queen."" ""The streets are filled with crazed Negroes."" A little white Southern girl jumps to her death to avoid being raped by some villainous black guy. The Ku Klux Klan comes riding to the rescue of another -- well, two others, actually. An African-American judge and jury convict a white gentleman of something he wasn't supposed to do -- aiding and abetting the Klan. In 1931, the white folks made up for it. An all-white judge and jury convicted nine young black men of something they didn't do at all -- raping two white women -- in Scottsboro, Alabama. Griffith had another thing right. Reconstruction under President Johnson and others is generally considered a calamity visited upon the South. In the absence of a formal system of justice, we often wind up with an informal one. From 1889 through 1918 mobs lynched 129 persons in the Midwest, 9 in New England, and 2,915 in the South and Border South. The nation reached a total of 3,587 by 1930.<br/><br/>D. W. Griffith is said to have been surprised at the outrage caused by his film, and I believe it. Like President Woodrow Wilson, who said of the movie, ""it's all true,"" Griffith was a Southerner at a time when the South was so isolated that it was almost a country unto itself. Whatever the opposite of ""cosmopolitanism"" is, Griffith was it. I believe it, too, when he claimed he meant no harm. He was like the Buddha leaving his father's garden at sixteen and discovering for the first time that there was more than one point of view."

","The Birth Of A Nation is a silent film directed by D.W. Griffith that is well known for being one of the earliest feature length epics. As great as the film is in it's technical aspects, it unfortunately is even more famous for something much less admirable. Viewers beware! This movie is extremely racist. It depicts the African-American race in a horridly derogatory manner and regards the Ku Klux Klan as a heroic group that helped save the South during the Reformation years. With the controversial storyline aside, this movie is very well-made. The special effects and cinematography are masterful considering this movie pre-dated Gone With The Wind by an astonishing 24 years!! This is supported by elaborate sets and acting by early film pioneers Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh. And, to make up for being a silent movie, the soundtrack is much better than expected. If the controversial issues can be overlooked (which is not easy, believe me) this should be considered one of the greatest Civil War epic films of all time."

","Birth of a Nation, The (1915) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>D.W. Griffith's landmark and technical masterpiece about a Southern family before, during and after the Civil War. This was my third time watching this film and being a film buff of the early days of cinema, it truly is amazing what Griffith was able to accomplish here. Considering movies of the time barely ran an hour, it's simply amazing that Griffith could make a three hour movie and make it as if this was the common way movies were to be made. The fact that this film turned out so beautiful just shows how wonderful the director was in creating what would become the template of movies for future generations. This was the first American epic and I think you could also call it the most epic film ever made. Considering there weren't special effects at the time, everything we see here had to be done for real and the battle scenes are among the greatest ever created. With a camera up on mountain looking down at the action, Griffith is able to fill the screen with beautiful images of varying aspects of the war. A lot of films around this time didn't know they should fill the complete image of the film and often times we would only see action in the center of the frame but Griffith, since his Biograph days, knew to make sure every inch of the screen was full. These early battle scenes look so realistic that you'd think it was actual footage of a battle. We also have the Lincoln assassination, which the director uses his trademark editing style to create a very suspenseful scene. We've seen countless movies dealing with the assassination of this President but none of them have ever captured the magic of this film. the second half of the film is when we're introduced to the KKK as heroes while certain blacks take over a Southern town and try to wipe out the whites. I'm sure everyone knows the racist ideology behind these scenes so there's no point in going into it here. Back to the technical side, Griffith adds great suspense and keeps it going for the last fifty-minutes while this final battle plays out. It's rather amazing, again considering this young format, that a director could keep suspense going for so long. The way the film is shot and edited really makes for a suspenseful picture and one unlike any other even though the movie's ugliness. Griffith regulars Lillian Gish, Henry B. Walthall, Miriam Cooper, Mae Marsh and Robert Harron all turn in fine performances here with Gish and Walthall really sticking out. Joseph Henabery should also be singled out for his performance as Lincoln as he comes off very well and seems to match everything you've read about the real man. In the end, controversy will always follow this film and in today's age you can't even say the word Griffith anymore without a strong debate getting started. This might be the biggest achievement in the history of cinema but it's also the most tainted.<br/><br/>Birth of a Nation, The (1930) <br/><br/>** This review is for the 1930 sound re-issue ** <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>The Birth of a Nation, produced in 1914, stands as the yardstick by which all great pictures are measured.<br/><br/>That little bit kicks off this 1930 sound version of D.W. Griffith classic. By ""sound version"" we don't get dialogue added in ala The Gold Rush and The Phantom of the Opera but we do get a new music score as well as sound effects added in. The sound effects of people cheering have never worked in these things but the gunshots do add something to the film. Another change is that the film was originally shot between 14 and 16 frames per second but for sound the film had to be shown at 24 fps. This here makes several of the scenes look silly but the biggest problem is that the movie only runs 102 minutes, cut from 190 minutes. This edit was done by Griffith himself and I haven't yet read why he cut what he did but some of it doesn't make any sense. One of the best scenes deals with the two friends dying together in the war but this has been cut. Most of the character development has been cut and the suicide at the end has been shown complete (it was cut out in the 1921 and 1927 re-releases) yet the ""chase"" has been cut. As with the girl's death in Frankenstein, the cuts to the chase actually make the film seem worse than what's in the full version. Another thing missing from this version are the color tints, which certainly add a lot to the film. While this sound version doesn't work nearly as well due to the changes, the film itself still remains one of the greatest achievements in history.<br/><br/>A curious bit of trivia but we almost lost several of the greatest director's ever during the making of this film. Cinematographer G.W. Bitzer was almost trampled by horses while filming one scene so Griffith jumped into the thing to save him. Griffith was almost killed here. Later in filming Erich von Stroheim was almost killed during the Atlanta war battle. Yet later John Ford was almost killed during the KKK scene when his horse went the wrong way and Ford hit a tree. Do a search on Ford's story of what happened next. And then, Raoul Walsh, who plays Booth in the film, hurt his ankle during the scene but he kept redoing the jump to get it right. With his ankle badly injured, it got infected and had he not gotten to the doctor when he did, he probably would have lost it."

","As the film itself states, ""This is a depiction of the events of the civil war and of the formation of the Ku Klux Klan from the point of view of the American South."" Let that be a warning! Still, expert motion picture making from D.W. Griffith, G.W. Bitzer, and company. This film should receive a perfect ""10"" -- but the aggravating and overt racist theme is sometimes worse than the actual war. The ""Negro race"" is, if you think about it, blamed for the Civil War -- beginning with the unbalanced opening: ""The bringing of the African to America planted the first seed of disunion."" The ""Civil War"" depicted in ""Birth of a Nation"" isn't over until the end of Part 2; when Confederates band together as the Ku Klux Klan, and defeat the ""Negroes"". In this film, the KKK wins. Part 1, by the way, is somewhat more tolerable -- but, by the end of Part 2, the film's message becomes obvious. Note that Jesus Christ makes a God-blessed-this-film appearance.<br/><br/>Otherwise, Lillian Gish (as Elsie Stoneman) and Henry B. Walthall (as Ben Cameron) are extraordinary in the lead roles; she represents the North, and he represents the South. The Stomeman and Cameron families' friendship and conflicts, due to the war, would have been a good, singular film focus. Of course, Mr. Walthall's character is a racist hero, but he performs the role exceptionally well. Ms. Gish is at her silent best; don't miss the scene where, after a date with Walthall, she caresses her bedpost! Second leads Elmer Clifton (as Phil Stoneman) and ""daughter of the south "" Miriam Cooper (as Margaret Cameron) hold their own against the powerful Gish and Walthall. Ms. Cooper has eyes which seem slightly askew in some shots, giving her an eerie quality. Josephine Crowell (as Mrs. Cameron) shines, among the more mature performers. Mae Marsh and Violet Wilkey (both as Flora Cameron) are quite memorable, also.<br/><br/>In a supporting role, Robert Harron (as Tod Stoneman) is at Gish-level acting; don't miss the scene with Harron embracing George Beranger (as Wade Cameron) when the ""chums"" expire on the battleground. Harron makes the scene especially touching. Note that Harron appears later on, in an unexpected role. Joseph Henabery is another appearing in different roles; he is most memorable as Abraham Lincoln; the assassination sequence is another film highlight, with Raoul Walsh (as John Wilkes Booth). Harron and Ms. Marsh would be even more dazzling in Griffith's next, ""Intolerance"" (1916). Another great scene occurs when Walthall walks unsteadily out of the hospital with Gish, while guard William Freeman gives Gish a last longing sigh. And, it's easy to see why Wallace Reid (as a blacksmith)'s search for Walter Long (as Gus), in ""Joe's ginmill"", was a star-making brawl. <br/><br/>********* The Birth of a Nation (2/8/15) D.W.

","D.W Griffith at the peak of his career and boy, does it show. All his trademarks are melted into one, great kettle. Panoramas, close-ups, cross-cutting, iris-openings etc. The first part is the best one, a fascinating story about the Camerons and the Stonemans before,during and after the Civil War, sheer entertainment with beautiful camerawork. The second part is a little bit harder to enjoy, due to the controversy. The Negros are here described as dumb and lazy, and Ku Klux Klan as heroes. But the last 15 minutes is Griffiths ""tour de force"", a race against time, cross-cutting between three scenes: Elsie Stoneman being almost raped by the vicious Silas, the Camerons being trapped in a cabin, attacked by Negros and Ku Klux Klan racing to the rescue. It still leaves you breathless, nearly 90 years later. The acting is, as so often in silent movies, sometimes laughable, but one has to remember that melodrama was the hottest thing back then and melodrama really depends on the actors ability to stir up emotions. Much has been said about Lillian Gish (here as Elsie Stoneman, beautiful as ever), but I would say that Mae Marsh is far better as Little Girl Cameron. Just see how easily she swifts from one mood to another, from sheer panic to giggling laughter. Overall, the cast does a great job. The most impressing thing, however, is Griffiths ability to handle the mass scenes. It´s a great shame to Griffith seems to be so underrated these days, he is just as importent for the development of cinema as Homeros is for the development of European litterature. Orson Welles called him ""the greatest of all motion picture directors"" and I have to agree on that. Personally, I still regard Intolerance as Griffiths greatest achivement, but this is really the foundation of all things to come, you may as well call it ""the birth of cinema"". The copy with colour tints and full orchestral score is a must, try to avoid other copies."
"btr-2","Null","2","4","24 January 2000"," Terribly Well Done
","I had the privilege of seeing this film recently in it's original film format.  The artistry of this movie is incredible.  As I watched it, I thought about how many shots could be done more effectively by today's means.  Not too many, I'll tell you that.  The use of tinting is a wonderful pre-cursor to Technicolor.  What an innovative film-maker Griffith was.  We owe a lot to this pioneer for ""The Birth of a Nation"" and his other early works.  Motion pictures may not be what they are today had it not been for him.<br/><br/>That said for the technical end, many choose to instead dwell on the social and political aspects of this film.  While there is no denying that this is an incredibly racist film, the fact that the message is so evident is what makes this a great movie.  The goal of a good director is to simply convey their vision to the screen.  That Griffith's vision is so looked down upon to this day solidifies this movie's strength.  I for one was a little bit glad to see such a message on the screen.  What better way for a 19-year-old Midwesterner in 2000 to know the actual mindset of the Civil War South and to see how the ramifications of that ideology were still felt as late as 1915?  Were D.W. Griffith's view of African-Americans wrong? Absolutely, but I also think that this film's importance in film technology and it's ability to show that a Civil War mentality still was evident in the 1900s (there are most likely those who feel the same in 2000) far outweighs any controversy over censorship, etc.  As the saying on free speech goes, `I may not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death for your right to say it.'<br/><br/>I for one commend AFI for picking this film for their Top 100.  It must have been a tough decision, with the debate surrounding this picture.  Yet, as film as an art form was still in it's cradle, ""Birth of a Nation"" lifted it out and taught it to walk, showing the world what impacts this medium could have socially when done well in technical manner."
"IboChild","6","2","4","22 April 1999"," Groundbreaking, But Very Disturbing Film
","The impact that THE BIRTH OF A NATION has had on the motion picture industry is undeniable.  D.W. Griffith revolutionized filmmaking technique with the use of the dramatic close-up and cross-cutting as well as other visual devices. The result is a film with a profound emotional impact.  Depending on your particular point of view, that emotional impact could range from exhilaration or outrage.<br/><br/>It has been said that Griffith thought he was making a progressive representation of African-Americans compared to THE KLANSMAN, the novel by Thomas Dixon from which the film was based.  How naive can someone be?  Far from being an accurate representation of African-Americans, this film sought to destroy their image.  Black people are depicted as lazy, animal-like creatures.  The worst image were those of mulattoes, that here shown as savage people, whose only desire was to rape white virgins.  Of course in the end of the picture, the white people are ""saved"" at the end by the Klu Klux Klan.  It's no wonder that the KKK used the film for fundraisers.<br/><br/>One good thing that came out of this film is that African-Americans realized the impact that motion pictures can have on people.  This prompted the newly formed National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and other groups to protest the film.  This lead to the making of THE BIRTH OF A RACE, which was touted as an answer (or antidote) to THE BIRTH OF A NATION.  Unfortunately, it was a failed attempt, because the producers of BIRTH OF A RACE needed white money to complete the extremely expensive film, which meant there would be many compromises.  It has been estimated that the film (with numerous cost overruns) cost in excess of one million dollars or roughly eight times the budget of BIRTH OF A NATION.  The result was a film that dramatized the experience of immigrants to this country, but with African-Americans virtually absent from the finished product.<br/><br/>Even today, some scholars look at THE BIRTH OF A NATION on purely its technical merits, but fail to address the film from a political standpoint. This is very shortsighted.  Film is a medium which can have a profound impact on society.  Its dramatic presentation and its subsequent socio-political impact go hand in hand. This is true of all films, whether they are dramas, comedies or action films.  THE BIRTH OF A NATION promoted a racist view of African-Americans that would be felt for many years afterward.  Some would argue that its impact is still felt today."

","Keeping in mind that this was made in 1915, the movie was considered to be a huge breakthrough. Griffith did not invent any new cinematic techniques, however was the first one to use a lot of these techniques (tracking shots, wide angle shots, close ups) in one film. He was also the first to create a film this long. <br/><br/>It is actually not so boring, but it is just really long. In addition to that, the film's racist ideology makes me wonder why this film keeps being shown in film studies classes. Understandably, it is depicting the historical context in which it was made in, but it really is just so racist. The African-Americans in the film are actually Caucasians with charcoal on their faces and bodies. Plus, the film portrays them as violent and uncivilised people. <br/><br/>With its mass actors and wide angle shots of war, this film can be said to be the first blockbuster ever. So for that reason, and that reason only, I give this film a slightly higher rating than I would have originally. Griffith does use cross-cutting rather efficiently and for the beginning of the 20th century, it must have been a shock to watch.<br/><br/>Rather than being a film to review, I feel that this film is more of a depiction of film history (which I guess answers my previous question).<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","Third time I've seen this racist film in forty years; that's probably mysteriously enough to make me a racist to people in the antiracist industry. That's also probably enough times for me to see it too – never again! A century on and this film still has the power to divide opinion and even shock some sensitive souls and I even guarantee that less people in this lovely world have been shocked by Salo or A Serbian Film than by this. Those two examples of vile obscenity are probably blithely watched by the world's antiracists without any qualms, and they would likely defend to the death the rights of the violent perverts who made them, but not this one. The Prophet may be fervently insulted by present-day other-believers in the Name of Free Speech, but a silent film made by racists in a previous civilisation almost has the power to send millions of selective-egalitarians into paroxysms. Where are all the antiracists whenever there's a genocide going off, too busy complaining about images and words which don't suit them?<br/><br/>We all know what this is about: The American Civil War is fought at first for the Union then for Emancipation, the North wins, the South loses; Southern Negroes are turned from being absolute slaves fighting for freedom to being US wage-slaves fighting for jobs, which is a much cheaper option for colour-blind capitalism. The film itself is competent and cogent with excellent direction and photography for the time, and the first part is fairly straightforward. The contentious part is the Reconstruction, in which several Liberties were taken by the author and acquiesced to by the producers. All very unnecessary and nasty! The message appealed to a vast white market at the time, a market that still exists - although I very much doubt any of those many supremacist Chelsea fans on the French train barring entrance to a single black man recently had even heard of this film or the Ku Klux Klan! The actual reconstruction was a gruesomely complicated affair and not easy to glamourise by Hollywood, although its overall image of the South certainly was – I always found the apparently acceptable Gone With The Wind just as racist as this only glossier. But as for that so-called wonderful comedy Blazing Saddles, which black people tend to appreciate more than white - so much for Time healing all wounds!<br/><br/>I'm sure there were many vindictive Northerners and ex-slaves back then just as I'm sure there are many vindictive present-day antiracists; not only racists have agendas. Griffiths ""may not have feared censorship"" and lamely disclaimed on the intertitles that the picture was ""not meant to reflect on any race or people of today"" and afterwards came up with a movie with the scope of Intolerance as a possible atonement but will this continue to be remembered by the current crop of egalitarians. Will copies of this nasty yet revered fiction film be allowed to exist outside of the Library Of Congress in another century's time? It's interesting tripe - I simply don't see it as either enriching or enhancing in any way but refuse to worry about it or advise anyone else to be worried by it."
"redrkr","5","0","0","19 January 2015"," Revisionist Propaganda
","D. W. Griffith's silent era flick is almost 100 years old now. At the time, the Civil War had been over for about 50 years. This film starts in the throws of that war, but the bulk of the plot involves the US Reconstruction of the south.<br/><br/>The film is lauded for its technical achievements. Many of what modern filmmakers use as the basic formation of shot compositions and tracking scenes et. al. were established and pioneered in this movie. Including what I'd bet is film's first ever bar fight scene. And that's all fine and academic, but unless you're a film student, you're probably not going to be awed by the wonderment of something filmed in 1914. Especially at three hours long.<br/><br/>So what you'd be watching for is an interesting narrative. Unfortunately that's where Nation gets problematic. While the film was being praised for its grandeur upon it's release, it was at the same time reviled for it's revisionist history, abhorrent racism and the manipulation of using this medium as a means for propaganda.<br/><br/>Because within this reconstruction, black leaders are seen to oppress the white population of a southern town, including suppressing the white voters in an election. One famous scene has a newly empowered black congress holding session in a statehouse as they remove their shoes an rest bare feet on the desks while drinking liquor and eating chicken legs. Later, as whites continue to be harassed, imprisoned and killed, the Ku Klux Klan is shown as heroes. Liberators of the southern whites to maintain justice and their Aryan birthright. It is believed that this film was the catalyst for the new rise of the KKK in the early 20th century.<br/><br/>With such ridiculous hateful plot elements at the helm of the production, it's hard to take the film any other way. Filmmaking achievements aside, it couldn't possibly still stand the test of time for greatness, even if it will for controversy. But, if you're curious, the entire film is on youtube."

","The Stonemans are a northern family headed by the abolitionist Congressman Austin Stoneman. His two sons visit their friend Ben Cameron in Piedmont, South Carolina. Ben is the eldest son of the Camerons who run the friendly quaint family plantation with happy slaves. The Stonemans are enamored with the elder daughter Margaret Cameron. Ben falls immediately for Elsie Stoneman with just her picture. The North's new president Lincoln enforce its rule with volunteers which leads to the Civil War. A black militia attacks Piedmont only to be rescued by Confederate troops in the nick of time. The heroic Ben is so gallant that he's cheered by the Federal troops. He is injured and brought to a Washington hospital where he meets Elsie working as a nurse. He is falsely charged to be executed and Elsie brings momma Cameron to Lincoln who pardons him. Ben returns to find the plantation in ruins. Austin Stoneman wants the south to be ruled as conquered provinces but Lincoln resists. Then Lincoln is killed in that fateful night. Stoneman takes over as the true power of the country with his mulatto protégé Silas Lynch. Lynch is sent south to lead the carpetbaggers to organize the black vote. The newly freed blacks are rude. Lynch is elected Lieutenant Governor in a rigged election. A renegade black Gus is eyeing white women and Ben is pushed to start the KKK. Elsie breaks off her engagement to Ben when she finds out. Ben's sister goes to the spring by herself and is attacked by Gus. She falls over a cliff to her death. The KKK goes to track down Gus for a fair trial and then an execution.<br/><br/>This is well filmed but poorly written. It's not only the one sided history. It's not even the bad English coming from only the black characters. There is the happy slaves in the gentile plantation. The use of blackfaced white actors should be a big clue. Forget about the twisting of the political history, there are some really outlandish unnecessary stupid things in here. Ben is cheered on by the Federals in the middle of a battle. I don't know why that's even necessary. What inspiration did Ben get from watching the white kids hiding under the white sheets? Is it suppose to be a cloak of invisibility against black people? D. W. Griffith shows that he's a master filmmaker but this one-sided history isn't even well written. It is fascinating to see that the passage of inter-racial marriage is such a horrible thing in Griffith's mind and the true cause of all the trouble is a fight over white women."

","Hath not the morning dawned with added light? And shall not evening call another star.....<br/><br/>When in 1861 the Confederate States seceded from the Union, Henry Timrod, ""The Poet Laureate of the Confederacy"", celebrated the occasion with a poem entitled ""Ethnogenesis"". We now know, of course, that the ""birth of a nation"" hymned by Timrod was to prove a stillbirth, that the South was to be defeated in the ensuing Civil War and that the Union was to survive. More than fifty years later, however, D. W. Griffith revived Timrod's title, in English translation, for his epic film. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"", however, was not the Southern independence Timrod had hoped for but the reunion of North and South to form a single whole, greater than before. <br/><br/>The film tells the story of two families, the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons, during the years of the Civil War and Reconstruction. It has been described as telling that story from a pro-Southern viewpoint, but actually its politics, at least during Part I dealing with the war itself, are fairly confused. Its initial stance seems to be that the Civil War was a war of aggression, launched by President Lincoln in order to increase the powers of the Federal Government at the expense of the States. Griffith and his scriptwriters, however, clearly realised that this stance would be an unpopular one in the North because during the scenes dealing with the war itself it is softened in favour of a general pacifism. (The film was made just after World War I had broken out, but before America joined the conflict). Towards the end of Part I the film even seems to be arguing that the Northern victory was a good thing, because a united America was stronger than an America bisected along the Mason-Dixon Line into two independent states. Lincoln is now portrayed as the ""Great Heart"", the advocate of a reconciliation between North and South which was sadly jeopardised by his assassination. <br/><br/>It is in Part II that the film gets really nasty. Austin Stoneman, the patriarch of the Stoneman family and a prominent congressman (loosely based on Thaddeus Stevens), emerges as one of the film's villains. Stoneman's main villainy, in the eyes of Griffith and Dixon, is that he believes in racial equality and advocates policies such as the enfranchisement of black voters and an end to the ban on racially mixed marriages. The other villains are Stoneman's protégé, the mixed-race politician Silas Lynch, and just about every black character in the film, portrayed (by white actors in blackface) as stupid, ignorant, aggressive and sexually voracious, especially where white women are concerned. (Even Stoneman loses his enthusiasm for racial equality when he learns that Lynch wants to marry his daughter Elsie). The only good blacks are what are described as ""faithful souls"", former slaves nostalgic for their slavery. The heroes of the film are the Ku Klux Klan, portrayed as the defenders of white Southerners against black villainy. <br/><br/>To condemn the film for its racism is not to judge it by the standards of modern political correctness. It was hateful even by the standards of 1915. African-Americans loathed it, the NAACP called for a ban, and it actually was banned in several Northern cities because the authorities feared (with good reason) that it might inflame racial tensions. White Southerners long bewailed the perceived injustices of Reconstruction, but it should have seemed obvious that, after the destructive Civil War, America needed to be reconstructed. That process would need to involve the integration into American society not only of white Southerners but also of black Southerners, who could not be so integrated unless they were afforded the same civil rights as their white neighbours. These points should have seemed obvious but were so obscured by prejudice that black Americans were to face decades of injustice, discrimination and poverty. Griffith called upon ""the former enemies of North and South to unite in defence of their Aryan birthright,"" and for many years North and South did indeed seem united by a shared racism. After around 1876 Northern politicians took the view that, provided Southerners did not try to secede again or to reintroduce slavery, they could treat black people how they wished. <br/><br/>(Incidentally, I was intrigued to note that, in American English at least, ""Aryan"" was used in a political sense long before Hitler's rise to power, although Britons, who generally only used the word to refer to the Indo-European peoples of northern India, might have been surprised to learn that white Americans considered themselves ""Aryan""). <br/><br/>Trying to evaluate this film is a difficult task. Yes, ""The Birth of a Nation"" was highly innovative by the standards of 1915, pioneering new techniques such as panoramic long shots, night photography, panning shots and the use of colour tinting. Yes, it has a highly dramatic musical score, incorporating quotations from Classical composers as well as music from the Civil War periods. Yes, it mounts to a highly effective dramatic climax as the mounted knights of the Klan ride to the rescue of the beleaguered whites. Yes, these innovations won it a place in movie history. But none of that alters the fact that it makes propaganda on behalf of a viciously racist organisation and fans the flames of an ugly prejudice. It was credited- if that is the right word- with contributing to a revival of the Klan, virtually moribund in 1915, in the 1920s. It is one of the great ironies of cinema history that Griffith, having directed one of the most bigoted and intolerant films ever made, should have followed it up with a film entitled ""Intolerance"". He meant that title as an attack on those who criticised ""The Birth of a Nation"". He should have paid more attention to the beam in his own eye. 5/10"
"JaydoDre","7","0","0","1 December 2014"," Good structure and epic feel, but too egotistical
","The Birth of a Nation is about the life and interaction between two families, one from the Confederate South and one from the Union North, before during and after the US Civil War. The story is quite strong. It has a clear structure and you get to know and perhaps even care about the main characters. It has its ups and downs, with a really intense action scene towards the end of the film. It is pretty good.<br/><br/>However the largest problem is with the storyline. Look, it is nice that this movie stands for something, even if that something is resistance to abolitionism. Nowadays, politically castrated movies try to appeal to everyone and their messages are soft if and thin. You may disagree with the themes in the Birth of a Nation, but at least it has guts. Unfortunately, it has a bit too much guts, and its guts do not mix well with what this movie tries to be.<br/><br/>The movie states in multiple title cards that it is presenting a historical account of events and indeed does so sometimes, even citing historical sources, but at the same time it leans so heavily to the pro-confederate and racist side that it undermines itself. Especially in the 2nd part of the film you can imagine the hatred seep from the person who wrote the screenplay. Did you know that during the reconstruction era in the South the inferior blacks just completely degraded the poor poor whites, depriving them of their rights. Gosh, now I know.<br/><br/>If you want to make an exciting movie with clear heroes and villains, as is the case with this movie, stop inserting political commentary and claims to historical accuracy.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good. There were a few surprising reactions (house burning down and one of the distraught residents suddenly smiles) but overall quite good. Of course, since it is a silent film, the acting has to be exaggerated to compensate for the lack of talking, but it can be surprisingly subtle in places.<br/><br/>One of the controversial aspects of the film are all the actors in black-face makeup. It is however not the racist aspect of it that troubles this reviewer, but the distraction and confusion it causes as well as the unfortunate conclusions that could be drawn. It is simply distracting to see white actors play brown people, and because the movie is relatively dark and only has one colour, it can be hard sometimes to discern who is supposed to have dark skin until the movie tells you. This is especially true of the main mulatto villain who, at most, looks like he has a light tan. A few times the makers only bothered to paint the head of the white actor and left the rest of the body as is.<br/><br/>The film does on occasion show black actors in the background, so why could the creator not find some more? Today, Hollywood apparently has no trouble finding Arabic characters to play terrorists in pro-Western action movies, where they get killed by their hundreds, so why did this movie have trouble finding black actors? There are three most obvious possibilities: the makers were too lazy to find more black talent, too racist to put black people even in minor roles, in which case they chose their pride over film quality, or too afraid that the audiences would not accept so many blacks in the movie. So which is it, laziness, arrogance or cowardice? None of the three makes a good artist.<br/><br/>As this is a silent film, it uses title cards to clarify the events and it was pleasant to see that written dialogue was used very sparingly. Usually, in silent films, you get a shot of a person talking and then a title card states what the character is saying, but in this movie you mostly get a brief description of the scene that is about to follow and from then on you are on your own. So credit is due to the movie for being able to make the story so clear with just these short descriptions.<br/><br/>Since this is a silent film, the music plays a big role. This film had its orchestral music custom made for it and it is some of the better neoclassical chamber music. Clearly, there are some existing melodies used this film, but they are woven together with original music to create one score that makes sense as a whole. The violins take a dramatic lead role and engrave themselves into your brain, remaining there even after the film is over.<br/><br/>Birth of a Nation features good cinematography for the time. For one, the film is not purely black and white. It is monochrome, but the base color changes depending on the mood and location. Also, there are some interesting special effects used like burning cutouts of building shapes superimposed onto the film with running people, in order to imitate a burning town. It actually looks better than some of the modern CGI effects. The one things that this movie overuses is smoke. It covers up so much that you cannot tell what is going on, which is possible what the creator was going for in order to simulate chaos. Speaking of chaos, there are also some impressive large battles involving what must be at least a hundred people.<br/><br/>In short, Birth of a Nation has a number of pretty good qualities. It has a clear story, good structure, good actors, some impressive large scale scenes and special effects. However, its cultural aspect causes its weaknesses, not because of the racist material, but because of how the movie handles itself."

","Probably the most controversial and divisive movie ever made. <br/><br/>For its time (1915), its cinematography is superb. Even today some of the battle scenes are great. Orson Welles once listed DW Griffith as one of the greatest directors who had ever lived, and did so mostly for his innovative cinematography. Considering that Orson Welles IS one of the greatest directors who has ever lived, that's quite a compliment.<br/><br/>For the first half of the movie, DW Griffith stuck to history (except for the fictional families at the centre of the drama) and this had the makings of a great epic.<br/><br/>Then Griffith turned the movie into a racist, revisionist piece of pro- Ku Klux Klan propaganda. The latter half of the movie could easily have been a Nazi Germany propaganda movie from the 1930s or 40s, it was that bad.<br/><br/>Sad, that anyone could make such utter racist bs and especially considering the objectivity and solid storyline of the first half.<br/><br/>7-8/10 for the first half and the innovativeness of the cinematography. 0/10 for the second half.<br/><br/>Definitely worth a watch.

My friends point out that they are racist, but I dismiss that as a sign of the times back then, and I find them truly entertaining. However, who gives a damn about this so-called cinematic piece of ""art"" when you have whites running around in black face, the murderous Klan depicted as heroes and rabid Negro men running around molesting pure, innocent, virtuous white women? If this had been a movie glamorizing the Holocaust and the Hitler machine, I truly feel the reviews would be different. Slavery happened, Reconstruction happened, the Klan is still alive and well with a long rich history, but how can you glorify this beneath the guise of ""art"" and ground breaking innovation? The 10-star review I read said he can understand it being hard to watch if you are black, but how can it be easy for him to watch, period? Since when does a movie become great without taking into consideration the frigging content? (The story sucked, but how about those special effects and gorgeous women? True classic!)"

","I can't believe I sat through a silent, black & white, three-hour long epic from 1915. I felt as though I was peering through a time-capsule at a far distant past. The content troubled me, seeing blacks portrayed as weird, predatory, and primitive, attacking innocent and helpless white women and children. The film makes the audience root for the Ku Klux Klan because they're portrayed as heroic. I almost began cheering them on too and felt guilty in doing so. It felt like racist propaganda. But it's fascinating how a film has complete control over its audience simply by how the director paints a scene. The music, the silent acting, lavish detail all helped generate emotion and as a result I was glued to the screen. Brilliant."

","Let's see, after seeing Griffith's INTOLERANCE, a movie where a woman's movement is compared to religious Pharisees and reading about a movie like BROKEN BLOSSOMS, where the lead male character is referred to by a derogatory nick-name, I decided to give BIRTH OF A NATION a look. I am not even done with this film because it has sparked too much anger and disgust in me to finish it. It is the most blatantly prejudiced film I have ever seen. Many of the people who have defended this film in their user comments correctly state that even the best westerns contain some prejudices. I can even overlook INTOLERANCE's minor shortcomings in light of its brilliant 4-story structure and technical expertise. Likewise, BIRTH OF A NATION is beautifully photographed and there are some scenes that are fascinating to watch. Nevertheless, from the standpoint of a novice viewer to Griffith's work, my impression is that Griffith is way too pre-occupied in portraying blacks as racist, violent, lazy, and conspiratory in the second half. BIRTH OF A NATION not only does this, it doesn't hint (except maybe with the exception of it's opening scene), that people suffered because of slavery. Kind of biased for a film placed within the context of The Civil War. A film like this only makes me question Griffith's intent. Griffith later went on to make possibly the first interracial love story in the movies (BROKEN BLOSSOMS) possibly to make amends from my very criticism of BIRTH OF A NATION. Aside from it's technical aspects, I can only view BIRTH OF A NATION in the same way I view Leni Riefenstahl's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL: technically fascinating, but blatantly propagandist."

'Structure' didn't exist. 'Mise en scene' was haphazard and not recognised as a part of the film-maker's art.

","There are probably three perfect films in existence.  2001: A Space Odyssey, for reinventing film language and raising the American film to an art form. Seven Samurai, for mastering preexisting film language and raising classical Hollywood grammar to its highest level.  And of course, Birth of a Nation. For introducing to the world for the first time, a full-length narrative feature.  D.W. Griffith, like Abraham Lincoln, was a great man with a character flaw, he was a racist.  Richard Wagner made the finest of operas, and he too was an anti-semite, like Griffith.  Many artists have bad ideologies.  Thank God, that an ideology does not reflect on an artform. After Griffith invented the crosscut and the closeup (as well as a textbook full of language that is now taken for granted) he finally created Birth of a Nation, a silent work of cinema poetry.  The war sequences are on a grander level than many today, the love story will make you weep, the assassination of Lincoln will make you gasp for breath.  The final hour of the film is notorious, but only a powerfully good film could offend so many people 85 years later.  Because people are more racist now than ever before (movies like, Big Momma's House, for example), they have criticized the man who invented the narrative film in order to mask their own problems.  It is a shame and disgrace that we are all so sensitive now and politically correct that an artist responsible for the creation of cinema, no longer has an award named after him.  The film is flawless, and the man is a genius, in spite of his racism and anti-semitism.  View the work of poetry and pure cinema, you will agree that it is a wonderwork.  The corrupt capitalistic North, led by Silas Lynch is combatted by the KKK in the South, with the lovely Lillian Gish (her greatest performance until Broken Blossoms, where she dies of heartbreak) caught in between the chaos of war.  Certainly there are mature enough people to handle the fact that black men are evil in the film.  A masterpiece has to stand the test of time, it does not have to convey a popular ideology.  A TIME TO KILL for instance, is a film that is anti-KKK but it is an incoherent, stereotypical pastiche of To Kill A Mockingbird.  There is no film cut together with the style, grace, experimentation and audacity of D.W. Griffith.  Like Wagner's ring cycle, it stands as a great artistic achievement that does not deserve detractions from liberal, godless, nihilists.  A film that ranks high in aesthetic value, being the founder of all of the language used today, has a level of complexity in its history of the American character and racism, creates a beautiful film diegesis of civil war torn south, has the courage of its racist convictions, and is beautifully coherent working with only the moving image of the silent era; a purely cinematic artistic achievement.  If you are willing to trade all this because of your petty liberal sentiments that really have no impact but a negative one on our present day racist situation (perpetuated by such films as the Godfather that outright refer to black people as dogs) have been made uncomfortable, then rewrite cinema history to make yourself feel better."

"sddavis63","8","2","5","25 July 2009"," Technically Brilliant Piece Of Pro-KKK Propaganda
","""The Birth Of A Nation"" is technically brilliant - certainly, even after 95 years, the best film quality I've ever seen in a silent film, and a movie featuring very good acting which, in spite of its 3 hour plus length, is well-paced, never dull and which also features an entirely appropriate musical score. From that perspective alone, it's a brilliant piece of movie-making from the famous D.W. Griffith.<br/><br/>To modern sensibilities, of course, the movie presents a troubling perspective. In fairness, having heard how horribly racist this movie was, I didn't find that it met my expectations of how racist I would find it - which isn't to say that it isn't racist, just that I thought it would be worse. It follows a tried and true Civil War formula of a friendship between Northern and Southern families, with the inevitable romances developing, which is disrupted by the War. The War itself, I thought, was fairly presented. War itself was not at all glorified, although certainly the Confederate soldier was portrayed as a noble one, even venturing into the midst of a battlefield to offer water to a wounded Union officer, while the Union troops are generally portrayed as marauders (and there's a heavy emphasis on black Union soldiers, when in fact there weren't really that many black Union soldiers.) Sarcasm is used against some northern figures - Gen. Sherman being described as the ""great conqueror"" and then it being pointed out that his great march to the sea was largely against women and children. There's a surprisingly positive portrayal of Lincoln and equally surprising to me was the lack of any portrayal at all of Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor, who is usually a figure who lends himself to caricature. The central figure of the movie was a character named Austin Stoneman, representative of the Radicals (and based on Thaddeus Stevens.) The movie eventually portrays him as a hypocrite, delighted when South Carolina's ""mulatto"" Lieut. Gov. Silas Lynch tells him that he wants to marry a white woman; appalled when he discovers that the white woman is his own daughter. The first half of the movie depicts the Civil War, the second the era of reconstruction, focusing on the rise of the KKK, who are portrayed as the great defenders of Southern society against blacks and northern carpetbaggers. There's also the pretty typical portrayal of southern blacks (both before and after the war) as pretty happy folk who didn't need to be set free at all (after all, they only worked from 6 to 6, and 2 hours of that was set aside for dinner!) I was also surprised to see the use of the word ""Aryan,"" which I hadn't realized was in common usage in the pre-Nazi era.<br/><br/>I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be few actual black actors used in this - the primary black characters looking to me as if they were all white actors in black face. Perhaps there just weren't that many black actors available in 1915. I also thought Griffith cunningly attempted to deflect what he clearly expected to be criticisms of the movie with the use (about halfway through the film, as the second part opens) of a number of writings by Woodrow Wilson - who, of course, was President in 1915.<br/><br/>This is a truly fascinating movie, well worth watching, no matter how troubling the portrayal of the KKK as heroes might be. 8/10"

","I had heard about this film mainly because it featured the Ku Klux Klan, but I didn't know much else, so being in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I was obviously going to see it when I got the opportunity. The first half of the film focuses on the Civil War, showing the slavery of black people, and the eventual abolition of it, and the equal rights movement seeing that they can join the war. The first part ends with the death of President Abraham Lincoln, murdered at a play by John Wilkes Booth. The second half of the film sees racism grow in the Reconstruction era, and the forming of the most infamous cult group in history, the Ku Klux Klan, who only care about ridding the world of blacks, and burn some crucifixes. The story is told mostly by focusing on families affected by the events, but the footage of Lincoln's assassination, and the riding of the KKK is much more prominent. Back in 1915 the film was of course considered controversial, and today, the impact of the film has not diminished, and even though it is a little shaky, black and white, silent, and three hours and twelve minutes long, it is certainly worth it.

","D.W Griffith was the cinema's first true master. Audiences today may find his films trite, moralistic and (in this case) racist, but he is an undisputed king of film-making. THE BIRTH OF A NATION is Griffith's landmark Civil-War epic, over three hours long and packing in lot of story and technique. Yes, the subject matter (the Civil War told from a racially charged, anti-Abolitionist view) is difficult and quite disturbing, but it's still a very important film.<br/><br/>Griffith must be commended for his epic vision- the scope of the film is breath-taking. He also was the first to use massive sets and location shooting extensively. Griffith crafted many of cinema's most basic techniques- cross-cutting, juxtaposing and layering different story lines, close-ups (though Lillian Gish also had something to do with that!) and, really, the dramatic structure that is so unique to film. We should be able to look past the unpleasant story (a Southern and Northern families lives and fortunes interlink and contrast before, during and after the Civil War, culminating in the formation of the ""heroic"" Ku Klux Klan), and appreciate the significance of Griffith's film-making. The acting, from an ensemble cast, is also quite good, especially Lillian Gish."

Not before Griffith's film were all the separate elements of film-making brought together to create such a cohesive whole.

This was one of the greatest demises of independent film.

","For the most part, I found D.W. Griffith's THE BIRTH OF A NATION to be an amazing picture. Even by the strict standards of Hollywood epics today, almost everything about this film was truly remarkable-especially when considering all of the technological limitations of the time. It's hard to believe that this was the first feature-length motion picture ever made, because Griffith really has the style down to a tee. It seems like learning how to shoot and edit such a long, well-flowing story would be a skill that would take several films to master, but it looks as if Griffith virtually perfected the craft on his very first try.<br/><br/>Despite BIRTH's long running time, the film rolls swiftly by without missing a beat. The plot was surprisingly complex, beginning with a touching portrait of the friendship of two very different families, and soon branching off into several thematic subplots involving romance, war, despair, bigotry, and honor. Given the intricacy of the story, I was impressed at how clearly and concisely it played out, especially after reminding myself that film has never been used to tell such a grand story before.<br/><br/>All praise aside, however, there were some areas of THE BIRTH OF A NATION that I found to be utterly appalling. Namely, the heroic depiction of the Ku Klux Klan and the portrayal of blacks as vicious, easily led savages made my stomach turn. The disclaimer at the beginning of the picture claims that Griffith's intent was not to be racist, but merely historically accurate. Needless to say, this is wrong on both counts: not only is THE BIRTH OF A NATION a disgustingly and overtly racist picture through and through, but a great deal of the so-called facts regarding the Civil War are either grossly skewed in favor of the Griffith's conservative Southern mentality, or they are just plain made up. Though this movie is most definitely a groundbreaking achievement in film-making, it most certainly isn't a likable one.<br/><br/>To me, watching THE BIRTH OF A NATION was a worthwhile experience for historical purposes, and it really is easy to appreciate the tremendous effort that went into making it.

It was a great technical achievement for its time which has been critically undermined for modern audiences by its political subtext.  I would advise anyone interested in film history to see this for the first half, which is a quaint but effective depiction of the Civil War.  The second half, depicting reconstruction in the South, is unfortunately nothing but a shockingly simplistic glorification of the Ku Klux Klan, although it also contains some excellent examples of Griffith's pioneering advancements in film technique.<br/><br/>Probably the kindest thing you can say about Griffith is that his racial views were seriously misguided.  The only black characters he views with sympathy are the two ""faithful souls"", the Cameron's old family slaves,who are content to remain servile and blindly obedient to their white masters after the Civil War has ended.  The rest are all ignorant, drunken ""children"" who need white men to lead them and care for them.  The worst in Griffith's eyes, however, are the two mulatto characters, who are depicted basically as evil incarnate.<br/><br/>To modern eyes, also, Mae Marsh gives a performance as the ""little sister"" that makes the character seem to need sedation. Lillian Gish is fine until the very end, when, kidnapped by the mulatto lieutenant governor who wants her to be his empress ruling over his ""black empire"" (I kid you not), she engages in the most melodramatic,hysterical flailing-about imaginable. The finale, where she rides at the head of a parade of Klansmen, was enough to make this long-time admirer of hers cringe with embarassment.<br/><br/>Ah well, its best just to remember that this was all filmed in 1914, and thank our lucky stars that times have changed."

Any film that has the ability to do that in my opinion should be seen, but with a warning. Not only did it do it's job in propaganda, but it did so with no sound, nor colorization other than the use of tinting. If one is to see this movie for historical purposes, it is remarkably accurate in the first half, just from a southern aristoctatic viewpoint. The best way to view this film, is with a film equally accurate and propagandist for the other side. Glory is a good example of this.

","I'm always amused to hear people castigate BOAN for its ""racist, cartoonish stereotypes."" IS the film infused with racism? Sure -- it's a product of 1920s America, EQUALLY infused with racism. As for cartoonish, what silent film ISN'T?!?! The medium RELIED on stereotype and broad mugging in its early days. SUBTLETY wasn't part of the palette of early silent filmmakers -- or actors.<br/><br/>As for its history, it's more accurate than many would care to admit (I'm always amused to hear people pontificate about what did or did not happen in the 19th century, as if they had any historical training or background in the subject). Empowerment of blacks in the post-war South coincided with the DISENFRANCHISEMENT of many southern whites (read section THREE of the 14th amendment), and the resistance of vigilante groups like the Klan did indeed lead to a restoration of southern white political control in the former Confederate states. Northern liberals (than and now) may find the championing of this event repugnant, but it's hardly laughable. To formerly disenfranchised whites, it was something to be celebrated.<br/><br/>BOAN is a legitimate expression of how many non-slaveholding white southerners viewed the experience of Reconstruction. That it contrasts with the northern view is to be expected. To dismiss it out of hand, however, is to ignore the reality of how a people viewed their own history."
"bkoganbing","10","3","10","9 November 2010"," ""History Written With :Lightning""
","When Woodrow Wilson was shown The Birth Of A Nation at a special White House screening, the very first I might add for a motion picture, he said that the film was ""history written with lightning"". And Wilson, being southern born and bred despite being President of Princeton and Governor of New Jersey, was merely reflecting what had become the historical interpretation of that time by many.<br/><br/>Though someone like Claude G. Bowers for example would never have glorified the Ku Klux Klan as David Wark Griffith did, his histories also that of C. Vann Woodward became accepted interpretations. The Klan was merely the most extreme response of a proud, but defeated people being brought to shame and degradation. Remember the original source for The Birth Of A Nation was the Thomas Dixon novel, The Clansman.<br/><br/>This generation of film fans will recognize the framework of the Birth Of A Naton from the epic mini-series North and South. Like the more recent epic, The Birth Of A Nation is concerned with two families the northern Stonemans and the southern Camerons. As war clouds loom the Stonemans are visiting the Camerons on their plantation in South Carolina.<br/><br/>There would be barely any controversy over The Birth Of A Nation had it ended with the Civil War closing. The battles scenes that D.W. Griffith filmed were the best ever up to that time. His use of the photographs of Matthew Brady from the time to create the illusion of watching a Civil War newsreel was striking. The scenes of Lillian Gish and Henry B. Walthall are tender and romantic as the representatives of the Stoneman and Cameron clans. And the sight of Henry B. Walthall sticking the standard of the Stars and Bars in the mouth of the Union cannon will still inspire.<br/><br/>Head of the Stoneman clan is Ralph Lewis who is the 'Master of Congress' on the order of Thaddeus Stevens. Stevens did have a black mistress in real life as does Lewis. But when his mixed breed Lieutenant Governor whom he has gotten elected in South Carolina asks for the hand of Lillian Gish who he's been crushing out on, well let's say Lewis passes a Guess Who's Coming To Dinner moment.<br/><br/>Lewis and Joseph Henabery who plays Abraham Lincoln disagree on policy whenever the Civil War concludes which was certainly the case with Lincoln and Stevens. When Lincoln is assassinated which is witnessed by Walthall and Gish, Lewis's character assumes more real power than the unelected president over Reconstruction. That point of view is seen from the later film Tennessee Johnson with Van Heflin as Johnson and Lionel Barrymore as Stevens. That film also takes the same position as Birth Of A Nation.<br/><br/>The matter of interracial sex was a titillating and at the time repellent factor given the mores of the times. Gish with George Siegmann as the Lieutenant Governor was a strict taboo. It should be remembered at the time that Birth Of A Nation was out in first release, Jack Johnson the black heavyweight champion who had three of four wives who were white, was hip deep in the middle of his legal troubles and don't think Birth Of A Nation wasn't used to fan some flames against him.<br/><br/>What really set audiences off was the innocent Mae Marsh younger sister of Walthall pursued to her death by the lascivious Walter Long playing a newly freed slave. The not so implied message her was that these people were taking the notion of freedom way too far. Marsh's death and Long's 'trial' and execution set in motion for the triumph of white supremacy, the natural order of things in the minds of Dixon and Griffith and even the current President of the United States.<br/><br/>Yet as repulsive as the message is, Griffith gave us some compelling characters whom we never lose interest in throughout the more than three hour long film. D.W. Griffith set out to give the audience the biggest show the cinema had ever exhibited and he certainly did so. Griffith also made great use of music during the film, like John Ford later did in his movies he used period pieces and old songs from Europe to great affect.<br/><br/>No matter what we think of the message The Birth Of A Nation has its place in the history of cinema. It was an unparalleled achievement in its time and the stories of the Stoneman and Cameron families still hold our interest today. In a sense Woodrow Wilson was right because for all the pioneering techniques it displayed and for all the controversy surrounding its message, The Birth Of A Nation remains history written with lightning."
"TheMovieCritic_83","10","3","10","26 June 2007"," The Birth of Cinema.
","Few films have been able to spawn the amount of controversy that D W Griffith's silent epic has. 'The Birth of a Nation' continues to enrage its viewers and has the dubious honour of being one of the most despised films ever made.<br/><br/>Every serious film buff eventually comes across 'The Birth of a Nation', and the feelings that it creates are often mixed. It is the sort of film that is generally watched only by critics, film historians and those who are interested in the artistic and technical sides of cinema. These days, some people may have heard of the film, but very few have seen it. The thought of a silent film from 1915 that runs for a touch over three hours would put the majority off in an instant.<br/><br/>The film covers the Civil war, the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the reconstruction of the South and the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. D W Griffith astounded audiences with the introduction of many new film-making techniques that laid the groundwork for the future of cinema. Without exaggerating, practically every film made afterward must give some credit to 'The Birth of a Nation'. The film is constructed and put together seamlessly and still looks amazingly fresh. It was once regarded as one of the 10 greatest films ever made, but the repercussions of the film have marred it's status. So much so that when the American Film Institute put together a list of the 100 greatest films, 'The Birth of a Nation' was placed at number 44, and when the list was reissued, was not given a place at all.<br/><br/>After its release, there were many that wanted the film banned because of the subject matter it featured. The film was accused of rewriting American history as part of the story shows the African Americans threatening to create a black empire and dominate the South, all with the support of Northern carpetbaggers. The threat is countered by the rise of the Ku Klux Klan who are credited as being the saviours of the South and bringing about political control and peace. So a major complaint was that the film was grossly inaccurate from a historical viewpoint, though there were claims by historians that argued for its authenticity.<br/><br/>But the main factor that caused outrage was the way that the African Americans were presented. It was a different world in 1915 though, and the film is a reflection of its time, seeing as how those views and attitudes were what many white people would have had and grew up with. Griffith no doubt would have had prejudice embedded in him from his childhood, or at least a superior attitude towards Negroes. But Griffith insisted he was not hateful toward African Americans and Lillian Gish herself backed up that claim.<br/><br/>The film has also been put in the same category as Nazi propaganda. That of course was not Griffith's intent, though the Ku Klux Klan have used this film to support their cause. These days, audiences are disturbed at seeing the Ku Klux Klan in a glorified manner. But the Klan that Griffith depicts was inspired by the original Klan that began in the 1860's and which had gone out of existence by 1915. They were not as hateful and evil as they were in more recent times. Although you can't condone the things they did when first formed, from a white supremacist's point of view, they would have been considered heroic.<br/><br/>For all the outrage and consequences the film brought on, Griffith never meant to offend anyone. And it's reasonable to conclude that if there were historical inaccuracies, Griffith either thought that what he was showing was accurate or he may have been creating parts of the story for dramatic effect. Maybe it was both. No director would knowingly make a film that would cause the amount of trouble that this did. Griffith always stated that his intentions were good and was forever apologetic about the film.<br/><br/>Opinions of the film will always be divided. It is very difficult for some to praise the film, but to look at it as objectively as possible, its hard not to be impressed. 'The Birth of a Nation' is still so modern, so incredibly fluent and coherent. Griffith truly understood cinema and how movies really worked. He was a director who was light-years ahead of his time and has no doubt inspired countless others. How many other films can claim to have contributed so much to cinema?"
"mOVIemAN56","10","3","10","28 September 2003"," Surprisingly Good, Surprisingly Accurate
","(SPOILERS)<br/><br/>I watched this movie a couple of days ago and I must admit it wasn't that bad. I'm not a Neo-Confederate or Klans men but this movie actually depicted what happened after the war from a different point of view but in actualality never eached the peak as in this film. In The Birth of a Nation the main characters are the Klans Men and the enemy really isn't the blacks but Mr. Lynch a white man who wants the blacks to rule the south.<br/><br/>The movie contains no talking but surprisingly there are sound effects. The main character are Lillian Gishes character Elsie Stoneman and Henry Walthalls' the Little Colonel Ben Cameron who is a Ex-Confederate and the Klansmen leader. The battle scene outside of Petersburg is surprisingly realistic except for a scene when Cameron jumps over the mound to help wounded Union soldier and everybody from both armies cheer. Also this is another high point, even though the South was at war with the North, Abraham Lincoln was still a hero to the south after the war; he was there only hope. Most of the blacks in the movie are just white men with shoe polish on there faces and it has some of the worst makeup I've ever scene.<br/><br/>What would be considered over acting today is all over this movie especially when a soldier gets shot, sometimes you couldn't tell if Lillian Gish is crying or laughing at some scenes. Even more realistic scenes are like when Flora Stoneman jumps of a cliff, showing her hit the rocks about fifty feet below.<br/><br/>One problem with this movie are the depiction of blacks as fools who couldn't talk right and were only down there to destroy white civilization. This movie was an interesting experience for me to see a movie that depicted the Klan as a group of heroes and the great work of D.W. Griffith. The film is racist at some scenes and do give it a sad moment for being the first feature length movie. <br/><br/>The Birth of a Nation, Starring Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Henry B. Walthall, and Mariam Cooper.<br/><br/>4 out of 5 Stars."

"kluseba","3","2","6","18 December 2011"," Technically stunning but far too long and sadly openly racist
","Griffith's ""The Birth Of A Nation"" is very particular movie. From a purely technical point of view, this movie is quite epic, experimental and mind-blowing for the time when it has been created. True fans and experts of cinema can't pass around this movie that also features some of the most appealing actors of the early years of American cinema such as the charming and gifted Lillian Gish.<br/><br/>The movie shows us many bits of the history of the United States of America. The American Civil War is portrayed in detail and especially the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is filmed in an unforgettable manner. Note that Francis Ford Coppola seems to be clearly inspired by this dramatic scene that he almost exactly reproduced in the third part of his legendary Godfather legacy.<br/><br/>On the other side, the movie is truly slow paced and takes a lot of time to introduce many different characters. Even for people interested in early cinema and American history, it's difficult to sit through a movie with a length over three hours. This movie has many low points and its narration is not very dynamic.<br/><br/>What really leads this movie down is its wrong interpretation of history and its open racist resentments. Right from the beginning on, there is a quotation that tells us that the arrival of African slaves brought the first seed of separation among Americans. Later, the movie talks about obscure topics such as Aryan birthrights and similar stuff. This movie shows us many scenes where black-faced white actors rape a white woman, fear white children or menace white farmers. The role of the Ku Klux Klan is idealized in the movie and The Birth Of A Nation was in fact used as a recruitment tool of this racist organization and it even led to the creation of the second Ku Klux Klan in Georgia back in 1915. The fact that this was the first movie to be shown inside the White House tells us a lot about the society and politics of the United States of America back in the days but there were also negative responses as some movie theatres refused to play this motion picture for example. This movie is an interesting document of its time but definitely not easy to digest and to approve nowadays and it's good that things have changed. There is more racist and pro white propaganda in this American movie than I have seen in many propaganda flicks coming from USSR and the Third Reich.<br/><br/>In the end, this movie is an important work for the early history of cinema. It's impressive from a technical point of view and at least interesting for historians. On the other side, the movie has many lengths and is certainly too long. The worst and most intolerable thing about this movie is definitely the openly racist, wrong and closed minded analyze of history. There is a lot of anti-black brainwash propaganda so you should be careful when you watch it and not believe everything the movie tells you about American history."
"tbello22","8","2","6","26 January 2010"," Amazing Silent Film
","This movie blew me away, I was amazed by how far ahead this movie looked. When this movie was made movie just started to become popular. This movie uses techniques that no one knew about at the time Griffith's idea for this film was incredible. When it zooms on a specific thing with black edges to really get the full emotion.<br/><br/>It is amazing to see a movie about the Civil War from the south perspective. Most films about the Civil War are intended to show how bad the black people were treated. The battle scenes are incredible and look exactly like how some of todays war films are made. When the women is being chased by the black man and jumps off the edge, it makes you shocked and to see how black people were looked at during this period. Also this scene shows two different ideas of what is going on. It shows the black man chasing then jumps to the man looking for her. When Lincoln is shot you really feel like you were there and for people in 1915 they must have been amazed at what they were seeing. At the end when the Ku Klux Klan rides in to the town to stop the black mob, they are portrayed as heroes because they kill the black people trying to hurt them. They take all the weapons away from the blacks and are marched through town.<br/><br/>Although this is a really good film it has some issues. The biggest issue being the length of the film. For a silent film 3 hours is an extremely long time and the beginning of the movie was hard to watch but as the film went on it got better. Also the music doesn't fit very well in certain scenes. This movie is a must see for silent movie fans."
"treadwaywrites","7","2","6","5 May 2009"," Film History - This Is A Must See
","The Birth of a Nation is a 1915 silent film. The movie is based on two of Thomas Dixon's novels The Clansman and The Leopard's Spots. This early film is noted for its innovative technical and narrative achievements and is studied in virtually every Film History 101 class in colleges and universities. Of course it also provokes controversy due to its treatment of white supremacy and its positive portrayal of the Ku Klux Klan.<br/><br/>Originally this film would have been presented in two sections with an intermission in the middle. The first half depicts a before Civil War America and introduces two families, the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons. The Stonemans visit the Camerons at their South Carolina estate. The elder Stoneman boy falls in love with Margaret Cameron and one of the Cameron sons, Ben (Henry B. Walthall), pines for one of the Stoneman daughters, Elise. Of course the Civil War breaks out and the young men join their respective armies. A black militia (with a white leader) ransacks the Cameron house. The Cameron women are rescued when Confederate soldiers rout the militia. Meanwhile, the youngest Stoneman and two Cameron boys are killed in the war. Ben Cameron is wounded after a heroic battle in which he gains the nickname, ""the Little Colonel,"" by which he is referred for the rest of the film. The Little Colonel is taken to a Northern hospital where he meets Elsie, who is working there as a nurse. The war ends and Abraham Lincoln is assassinated at Ford's Theater, allowing Austin Stoneman (meant to parody real life Congressman Thaddeus Stevens) and other radical congressmen to punish the South for secession using radical measures supposedly typical of this period of the Reconstruction era.<br/><br/>The second part depicts Reconstruction. Stoneman and his ""mulatto"" follower, Silas Lynch, go to South Carolina to observe their agenda of empowering Southern blacks via election fraud. Meanwhile, Ben, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare off black children, devises a plan to reverse perceived powerlessness of Southern whites by forming the Ku Klux Klan, although his membership in the group angers Elsie. Shockingly a former slave proposes marriage to the other Cameron daughter, Flora. She is scared by the former slave, Gus (Walter Long), and runs off into the forest pursued by him. Eventually she is trapped and then leaps to her death. The Klan hunts down Gus and lynches him. A crackdown on the Klan is then ordered by Silas Lynch (George Siegmann). The Camerons flee fro the black militia and hide out in a small hut which is home to two former Union soldiers who agree to assist the Camerons. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Lynch tries to force Elsie to marry him. Disguised Klansmen discover her situation and leave to get reinforcements. The Klan, now at full strength, rides to her rescue and takes the opportunity to disperse the rioting ""crazed Negroes."" Just then Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding, but the Klan saves them just in time. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets, and the film cuts to the next election where the Klan successfully disenfranchises black voters and disarms the blacks. The film concludes with a double honeymoon of Phil Stoneman with Margaret Cameron (Miriam Cooper) and Ben Cameron with Elsie Stoneman. The final frame shows masses oppressed by a mythical god of war suddenly finding themselves at peace under the image of Christ. The final title rhetorically asks: ""Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more? But instead-the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace.""<br/><br/>D.W. Griffith, the film's director, agreed to pay Thomas Dixon $10,000 for the rights to his play The Clansman. Since he ran out of money and could afford only $2,500 of the original option, Griffith offered Dixon 25 percent interest in the picture. Dixon reluctantly agreed. The film's unprecedented success made him rich. Dixon's proceeds were the largest sum any author had received for a motion picture story and amounted to several million dollars. The film is estimated to have cost Griffith a total of $112,000 causing him to seek out many different investors. At the film's premiere in Los Angeles the title was The Clansman but it was later changed to The Birth of a Nation to reflect Griffith's belief that the United States emerged out of the Civil War and Reconstruction, ended by the Klan, as a unified nation.<br/><br/>The films stars Lillian Gish as Elsie Stoneman and Mae Marsh as Flora Cameron. They must be credited for causing some of the stir that arose when the film was released. Not only is the film polarizing, but as the black men in the film are being portrayed as sex crazed and violent men after these so innocent white women had to bring about a response. To stir up this type of emotion in 1915 is an impressive undertaking by D.W. Griffith.<br/><br/>As you watch the film you can't help be confused by part one and two as they look and appear to be two separate movies spliced together. Part two is the section with all of the disturbing material and does not match up with part one which has more cinema techniques. Watching the film without keeping history and film history in the back of your mind, one can easily find the film tedious and hard to keep your attention. It is like eating aged cheese, it takes a refined pallet. If you have an interest in film history and how we got from there to here with styles then this film is a must watch."
"nicolaos777","10","2","6","12 May 2007"," The Birth of Seventh Art and history written in lightning
","Silent motion picture historical epic, about a Southern family's experiences during the American Civil War (1861-1865) and Reconstruction, based on two novels and a play by Thomas Dixon. The movie costed 110.000 $ and was a big box-office hit, (10.000.000 $ in its time, about 1 billion $ today !!) but it also inspired race riots , protests, boycotts and eventually a move toward film censorship laws. Released in 1915, this film was directed by D. W. Griffith and is notable for its radical technical innovations. The Birth of a Nation is considered among the most important and influential films ever made, for its success established not only the feature-length film but also the Hollywood star system ,Griffith as the leading motion-picture producer of the time and motion pictures as an art form for cultured spectators, stunning audiences with its dazzling spectacle of a still-recent event. Until Griffith's time, motion pictures had been short, rarely exceeding one reel; episodic rather than dramatic; and poorly produced, acted, and edited. Griffith's films were frequently several hours in length, contained powerful dramatic situations and vivid characters, and were produced with technical virtuosity. Besides that's why he is often called The Father of the Motion Picture. Unlike most of his predecessors, Griffith used in Birth a variety of camera angles and close-ups, for dramatic emphasis and moved the camera close to the action, using many separate shots with flashbacks, which for purposes of clarification of plot or characterization, introduce scenes antedating those already shown. He was one of the first to use a technique called crosscutting( parallel editing), which involves switching back and forth between different story lines to achieve suspense, and an other called fade-out, a transition from one scene to another by the gradual disappearance of the first scene from the screen. Griffith's extensively collaborator and legendary cameraman Billy Bitzer did a great work, so did Lillian Gish, Mae Marsh, Miriam Cooper, Henry B. Walthall and other great actors under Griffith's direction that emphasized an intimate, restrained style of acting suitable for camera close-ups.<br/><br/>The film is also notable for the enormous controversy it aroused because of its ""racist"" portrayal of African Americans, except the faithful servants, and its very pro southern view of Civil War and Reconstruction era. Griffith traces the disastrous effects of Civil War through the lives of two friendly associated families, Camerons from South and Stonemans from North, divided now by war's storm. When Ben Cameron (Henry B. Walthall) returns to the South after the Civil War, he feels that the region is being torn apart by carpetbaggers and black people in positions of power, like Silas Lynch the mulatto lieut. Governor of S. Carolina, backed from Radicals (Congress's main political force) and their leader Austin Stoneman (a character merely inspired from radical Edwin Stanton), head of Stonemans's House, who promote complete equality between blacks and whites and the crash of South's white dominion.<br/><br/>After Abraham Lincoln's assassination (truthfully depicted), who stood against the severe treatment toward Southern States, Radicals can easily carry out their plans. Meanwhile a love affair flourishes between Ben and Elsie Stoneman(Lilian Gish), Stoneman's daughter. After a black man (Gus) attacks his little sister (Mae Marsh), Ben organizes the Ku Klux Klan, a name adapted from the Greek word kuklos (""circle""), and with his companions rise the ancient Scotland's ""flaming cross"", to restore law and order in the South, defending the white supremacy and protecting racial purity. A controversial cause in its own time and repugnant decades later in modern Hollywood. Lynch betrays Stoneman and uses his power to force his daughter Elsie to marry him and plans to turn the South in to a ""Black Empire"". Elsie resists, defending her ""white woman's pride"", in a scene where Gish gives a great performance. Finally after an epic ride of Ku Klux Klan's cavalry, and the disarmament of the black pro federal troops Ben saves his beloved Elsie from Lynch's hands and sets an and to anarchy and oppression. President Woodrow Wilson was so impressed with this version of the Reconstruction that he said it was ""like history written in lightning."". <br/><br/>IMHO Birth's portrayal of African Americans is no more racist or stereotypical than this of other national groups often harshly humiliated by US Motion Picture Industry's products, such as the Germans, the Indians, the Japanese, the Russians, the Romans etc., yet none received so much criticism. Before condemning D. W. Griffith that offered a biased view of black people and glorified Ku Klux Klan, we should consider that he was the son of a ex-Confederate Colonel and he grew up attending stories about the Civil War, the South's humiliation during Reconstruction's era, and Klan's rebellion. Therefore, he saw these historical facts through a southern perspective and put all his ideological passion in his work. So, what? As an artist, he had any right to express his beliefs, controversial or not, and anybody can disagree with him using arguments . Intolerance (1916) was Griffith's statement of feeling persecuted for his beliefs."
"classicsoncall","8","2","6","6 September 2006"," D.W. Griffith's 'Immortal Spectacle'
","Aware of the film's historic importance to the history of movie making, I wasn't prepared for the turn of events in the latter third that paints director Griffith as an apologist for the Ku Klux Klan, an organization in his mind that saved the South from an anarchy that shed more blood than Gettysberg. Also disconcerting was the presentation of a fictional character like Representative Austin Stoneman to further blur the distinction between reality and it's opposite. Stoneman's character was based on real life abolitionist Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, and in the film, opposes President Lincoln's policy of clemency for the South. Stoneman's hypocrisy relative to his assertion that black men are equal to white men is exposed in his revulsion over the mulatto Silas Lynch's suggestion of marriage to his daughter Elsie. Stoneman, who fancied himself the most powerful man in America following Lincoln's assassination, had hand picked Lynch to lead South Carolina's blacks through the Reconstruction.<br/><br/>Other reviewers on this forum have done a superb job of detailing how the film set back the cause of civil rights and the resurrection of the Ku Klux Klan upon it's release in 1915, to the point of influencing President Woodrow Wilson to expose some of his own segregationist leanings. In light of that, I'll steer my comments toward facts regarding the history of the film itself.<br/><br/>Historically, ""The Birth of a Nation"" reinforced the idea that films over an hour in length (feature length) were a viable art form. It premiered in Los Angeles on February 8, 1915 as ""The Clansman"", based on the Thomas Dixon novel of the same name, and underwent the name change for it's East Coast premiere in New York three weeks later. It was Griffith's belief that before the Civil War, the United States was a loose coalition of states antagonistic to each other. The outcome of the war insured that both North and South would now be bound under one national authority.<br/><br/>The film's controversy over the Klan's importance in restoring order in the South was actually a prevalent idea among historians at the time the movie came out. Vigorously opposed by blacks, it would take the civil rights movement of the 1950's and '60's for historians to rethink their views of Reconstruction.<br/><br/>Financially, the film was wildly successful, grossing ten million dollars by 1925, on grossly inflated ticket prices of as much as two dollars! It would remain the all time box office champion until 1937, when in an odd and serendipitous stroke it was dethroned by ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" - what irony! <br/><br/>Griffith's budget for the film started at forty thousand dollars, and he was constantly forced to raise more capital for the final cost of one hundred ten thousand dollars. Offering ten thousand to novelist Dixon for the rights to ""The Clansman"", he could only come up with a quarter of the sum, thereby offering the writer the same percentage of the profits. Agreeing, Dixon wound up with several million dollars after his initial reluctance.<br/><br/>The original film topped out at three hours and ten minutes making it the longest film on record at the time. The version I viewed today was only 103 minutes, which would explain some of the unnamed characters I had to contend with, such as Ben Cameron's brother and sisters and the brother of Phil Stoneman. Though somewhat distracting, it did not prevent understanding the proceedings.<br/><br/>I'll have to admit that my involvement with the movie won't end with this single viewing and the comments in this forum. On that point, the film will have succeeded in establishing a desire to learn more about the days of the Reconstruction and it's aftermath. For a ninety year old picture to have that kind of influence, and especially considering that it was a silent, is testimony to the power of film."

"DKosty123","7","2","6","4 May 2006"," Through The Shadow Of Racism
","DW Grifith's Masterpiece of film is amazing because it was 1915 when it was done. 1915 is the era of shaky cameras and cut up films & scenes in many films which made little or no use of modern film making techniques as of yet. In this way, this film is brilliant for it's time but today's standards make it average now. I expected over the top racism & received it while viewing this film. You have to put that racism into this frame, you are warned about ""dark truth"" by the subtitles early in this film. Indeed there are many dark sequences. As for how accurate the film is, it was not Northern Blacks who were the problem in the South after the Civel War 50 years earlier. It was the Northern & Southern Whites who were Carpet Baggers & who used Southern Blacks as puppets to continue the status quo in the South. Northern Blacks stayed in the North after the war as they were more good jobs in Northern factories. The South had few jobs after the war. The term Sharecropper was created in this era. In spite of all the blood spilled in this war, our country had still not grown up & matured to accept blacks in white society, even in the North. <br/><br/>You have to consider though that these views put in the film are from stories passed down from Grand Parents to others by the time this film was made. Stories passed from generation to generation do get embellished to the point where reality is lost & that is what happens with the depiction of racism in this film. Making the KKK into heroes is outrageous to the modern generations of Americans, but the modern KKK re-formed after this film actually bears no resemblance to the KKK first formed in the South. The first KKK fought Carpet Bagging Whites as well as fighting blacks as another hated invader. The real indication of this is the battle scenes in the Civil War. You will note that the more historically accurate Confederate battle flags are shown. The Red ""Stars & Bars"" which are now used are the Historic Revisionist / the 1950's modern KKK's way of expressing disdain to black people. Ironically these modern flags are used (acutally abused) by Civil War Re-enactment Confederates (including Ted Turner's ""Gettysburg"". <br/><br/>This film shows the clan riding in day light. That was never done. This film is rife with problems in total but worth watching because a master film maker rose above 1915 to produce an important film. If nothing else, this film is valuable in defining what racial stereotypes were & should never be again. That is why it is important, & it will continue to be an important film is because of history. We always get reminded of these stereotypes by our modern main stream news media which today is much more racist than most of the American people they report too. <br/><br/>Age has long worn out a lot of it's artistic beauty & accomplishment. It would be interesting to see modern Hollywood try to re-make this film but I doubt that any of the modern film makers have the guts to do that.<br/><br/>We appear to be entering an era where we might be destined to relive racism. Electing a Black President because he is black is a big mistake. The President's own brother has written a book saying the black President is racist- against whites. That takes our country back to this movie."
"Zando777","Null","2","6","18 October 2005"," Another point of view
","In reading the comments, I think it's important for people to try to be open-minded, and perhaps put themselves in the shoes of white southerners of the time.<br/><br/>The truth is that the south was in fact oppressed by the north after the civil war, and most white southerners were in fact disenfranchised, and deprived of their civil rights. Southern blacks were not a majority in most states, and were only elected to office because of this disenfranchisement.<br/><br/>This is all despite the fact that most southerners never owned slaves, and some blacks did own slaves.<br/><br/>There is also evidence that there was in fact lawlessness and anarchy in the South during this period, with the northern occupying soldiers not particularly concerned with protecting white southerners from newly freed slaves, not all of whom were saints or benign.<br/><br/>In light of the above, I'm not sure we can blame southerners from creating groups like the KKK to protect themselves. Those who claim to sympathize with groups like the black panthers in the 1960's, or Palestinian militias today, should be able to understand the perspective of a group that has been disenfranchised and oppressed, and feels the need to fight back.<br/><br/>As others have noted, the KKK in the 20th century was a completely unnecessary evil, because white southerners at that point already had their civil rights back, and completely dominated local government, to an unjust extent. However, the KKK during the time of reconstruction was simply a different entity, with different causes."

The use of gels to create color (as seen in the KKK scenes) and the use of vignettes (close-ups to portray emotion) were some of the first examples of these styles which we now take for granted. This film also examines the Civil War and Reconstruction from a point of view rarely studied in history classes. I found it fascinating to watch the Southerners treat the Northerners as invaders and criminals while applauding the Southern rebels. <br/><br/>I would not go so far as to say that this film should be banned or censored.

A movie like this can crush a man's ego, forever bruise the mind of the easily offended, and ruin the life of the impressionable.<br/><br/>Was Griffith a racist? Perhaps so. Was Griffith a hateful, stupid white man, who believed in the dominance over others? Not at all. Anybody who had seen many of his short films, knew that Griffith's philosophy was that of the poor man's friend. A Corner in Wheat shows the struggle of the poor against a powerful merchant, who gets what is coming to him. His Trust shows a black slave gallantly risking his life for his master...the slave was not portrayed at all as a bad character; nor can the old ""good slave, bad freeman"" arguement be used against that film. Out of his own will, the man saved the little girl from the fire...he was a good man at heart. Intolerance and Broken Blossoms, made in 1916 and 1919 respectively, tell a message very much against racism and fanaticism. With these movies sandwiching The Birth of a Nation, what can we think about this epic monster?<br/><br/>I choose to think thusly: The Birth of a Nation was, perhaps, an expose of the twisted view of history as seen through a wounded, beaten land (the South). The things we see in the film, so disgustive and reprehensive, are what is seen through the eyes of the fanatic. Whether ot not it was Griffith's purpose, I will forever see this film as a brilliant expose of man's greatest enemy."

This movie, was one of the darkest recollections of American History I can recall.  With all the documentaries and literature out there on the Holocaust, one would seem almost immune to the attrocites shown in this movie.  Unfortunately, that could not be further from the truth. <br/><br/>
This movie shook me to the very core of my Being, and for the second time in my life, had me question the fibre of American History.  It astounds me that people do, indeed, have this awful dark side - Man killing Man - and D.W. Griffith, sad to say, does an excellent job in showing us that, even in 1915, however far Man had come in his technology, in his mind and in his heart, we have come not so far at all.  Unfortunately, Hitler didn't have to look very far to get his ideas moving in the right direction.<br/><br/>The lesson in this movie is not only to learn where this country has come from...but more important, to learn, that as human beings, we should never, ever let this happen again."

","After a private screening at the White House, president Woodrow Wilson praised the film as ""history written in lighting""; and even though he later repudiated the comment once the film was attacked for its racial content, the remark was widely repeated and taken by D.W. Griffith as the highest of compliments. But Wilson's insight may have been more appropriate than he afterwards thought. Like lightning, Birth of a Nation is a mixture of the beautiful and the fearful.<br/><br/>It is unfair to hold this film up to the standards of contemporary political correctness, and while it's depiction of slavery may be offensive, even Griffith himself proffered a disclaimer as to the film's racial slurs.  He aimed to paint the American South during the reconstructionist period with historical accuracy never before attempted on film. As Griffith himself said, ""I'm going to use [Birth of a Nation] to tell the truth about the War between the States. It hasn't been told accurately in the history books. Only the winning side in a war ever gets to tell its story.""<br/><br/>Those who cry racism at Birth of a Nation are usually guilty of the same ignorance they claim this film suffers.

DWG was absolutely unconscious of his intolerance; to him, white superiority was so evident that he was utterly unable to see its savage nature, or the vileness of this racist celebration.  When, a year later, he tried to repent of Intolerance, he never repudiated this Birth, a birth that triggered the rebirth of the Ku Klux Klan.  The movie is, at the same time, a stunning summation of all that film could do in 1915; the battle scenes in particular hold up remarkably well.

"Stracke","Null","2","6","1 February 1999"," Griffith and the Nazis
","Eeriest of all, this film foreshadows numerous elements of Nazism.  Hitler was an unknown corporal at the time, but look at all the parallels.  The klan go on their climactic ride to save the South to the tune of the ""Ride of the Valkyries"" by Wagner, Hitler's favorite composer.  Also proto-Nazi is an intertitle's comment when the northern and southern whites join up against their common enemy.  Since this moment seems to be the ""birth of a nation"" that the film's name refers to, one would expect a comment to that effect.  Instead, the intertitle emphasizes the two groups' common ""Aryan heritage.""  Even decorative elements anticipate Nazi tastes. The cross-in-circle emblems on the klansmen's breasts look like the ones that would be later be painted on Luftwaffe aircraft. The tall spikes on the klansmen's hoods are penis-envy versions of what the little corporal would have worn on his WWI helmet.  Even the symbolic use of fire sends the mind backward to Wagner's operas and forward to Riefenstall's ""Triumph of the Will.""  Most tellingly, when the mulatto politician's corpse is dumped at his sponsor's door the camera lingers for a moment in exultation over this casual brutality.  The quick slump of the newly inanimate body onto the porch expresses precisely the kind of deliberately inhuman (but supposedly super-human) attitude that Nietzsche urged in the 19th century and the SS willed themselves into in the 20th.  This film is more than a lesson in cinema history; in hindsight it shows us one of the paths that opened itself before an America at the crossroads in 1915.  Next time you watch ""Triumph of the Will,"" think, ""there but for the grace of God go we."""

","Griffith is the true pioneer of modern storytelling. Despite the message director tried to convey, Film, The Birth of a Nation, is a masterpiece in term of storytelling. Griffith decided to develop plots in separate storyline, then he merged the storyline as they develop. it seems like a common technic now, but it was extraordinary at his time. The advantage of this technic is that it creates a lot of tension for the audience; for example, two different rescues were cut into a montage scene, which undoubtedly raise audiences' nerves. I mean montage scenes that composited by short shots are visually powerful, and the contents were rescues which would drive audiences' curiosity up to the peek. In addition to the storytelling, his cinematography is also fascinating. He uses exposure to focus his target; in which, he would make the surrounding of his target under exposure, then his target would be the one that is focus. This is very different from technics we would use now, but we would use the control of focal length to archive the same goal. it shows his tenant."

Southern blacks fought with the Klan which contradicted their aims in the legislature where black law makers have their shoes off and feet on the desk, drinking from bottles.

","To understand and speak about this film, one must first understand the context in which the movie was released. It was early 1915, the mindset of the people was very different to what it is today, the state of the film industry was also completely different. This is important to remember when reading the following review.<br/><br/>The Birth of a Nation is undoubtedly one of the most impactful films ever released. Anybody who has done even the slightest bit of research into this film will understand that. However, it is also one of if not the most controversial films ever made. The film cut deep into the hearts of the African Americans particularly, and, after watching this, it's easy to understand why. <br/><br/>The racism present in the movie is excruciatingly obvious and in your face. What makes matters worse is that it is also evident that the film-makers weren't trying to make it so, in order to arouse feelings of anger and frustration within us, oh no. Instead, the racism is filmed in a way that proves that it was the norm of that time to think this way about African people. This -frustratingly fundamental- part of the film is what has been the cause for more than a century of controversy. <br/><br/>I will say that as a young guy in his twenties - who has grown up in a world that is all about equality of rights of all human beings, no matter what may separate them from ourselves - it was very difficult to sit through the second half of the movie. What is shown is both infuriating and disturbing. However, that's not to take away from the truly spectacular first-half.<br/><br/>The first-half of the film really is something to behold. From the brilliant depiction of the events surrounding the Civil War, and that of the war itself, as well as the brilliantly acted romance story that is thrown in between, this movie is thoroughly engaging. The first half of the movie(90 minutes on the 3 hour version that I watched) is expertly crafted and pulled off with a style that was not the norm in the film industry at the time. I can't begin to explain the beauty of Liilan Giths performance in this movie, for my first Gith film, she completely and utterly blew me away. Henry B Walthall is also very impressive as the ""hero"" of the film. <br/><br/>The cinematic techniques used by all-star director D.W. Griffith were groundbreaking at the time. The ambition and scope of the movie even more so. This was the first time a director had attempted to tell such a big and significant story with so much style and class.<br/><br/>My enjoyment of the first half of this movie was more than enough to convince me and win me over to the quality of classic cinema. The racist and sometimes pointless second half did take away from the experience though. If you have an interest in film history and would like to see something that is a deep foundation of the birth of Hollywood, I would most definitely recommend this brilliant, albeit dated cinematic experience."
"ElMaruecan82","8","1","2","7 August 2013"," The Birth of Filmmaking ...
","There are two truths regarding D.W. Griffith's ""Birth of a Nation"": it IS a cinematic landmark AND a disturbingly racist -much more- racialist film. If technical greatness doesn't redeem from the controversial content, blatant racism can't cancel out the revolutionary achievement either.<br/><br/>I read my recent review of Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" where I conceded that if anyone could make a masterpiece of propaganda, there couldn't be an 'objective' masterpiece happening to be propaganda, for instinct of superiority is morally low and easily aroused. The fact that it doesn't take much efforts for a director to win the hearts of a specific audience, contradicts the universal and timeless appeal of Art, that can only be reached by attempts to reach truth, beauty and justice.<br/><br/>Let's face it, ""The Birth of a Nation"" while not totally inaccurate, encapsulates the most abject aspects of the Old South's mythology, reviving a myth that can no longer appeal to any decent audiences from any part of the world. Not every piece of Art should carry grand values, we can have art for the sake of art, but ""The Birth of a Nation"" can't get away with that excuse for the film was made with a clear and explicit purpose: it was meant as a historical film, chronicling, only 50 years after, the Secession War. <br/><br/>The Civil War was recent enough to leave some unconcealed wounds in the heart of many Southerners. And the fact that the film pretends to be humanistic by vilifying the War shows an unspoken parallel between the Union and Confederate Armies' brotherly bonding at the end and the same waste that painted in bloody red the mud on the European trenches. But the 'treacherous' reason of such hellish depiction relies on the emphasis made on the ""Liberty and Union, now and forever"" as the film's motto, to convey an uglier message: the Black is the enemy. However, there's no doubt that if not the message, the technical achievements stood the test of time. <br/><br/>The War sequence is made of magnificent crosscutting between panoramic shots and individual fights, and the action is cleverly punctuated with brief sequences involving the protagonist's families. The film, unlike ""Gone With the Wind"", operates in several fronts: the South where the Camerons live, the North where the Stonemans lives (Stoneman is a fictionalization of Thaddeus Stevens) the battlefield, and Washington, Lincoln's headquarters. And through Griffith' bravura directing, we follow the lives of these protagonists during three separate acts. <br/><br/>The pre-War period features a bucolic postcard-like South, where men with chivalrous looks court young and playful ladies. Then the War sweeps off everything and concludes with Lincoln's assassination, recreated with such historical accuracy it felt like real footage. Then, the reconstruction part forever soiled the film with the black paint on white actors told to act like 'savage beasts'. Although it's impossible to close the eyes on such aberrations, we shouldn't overlook the film's age: its context is as historical as the Civil War and ethical standards don't excuse chronological leaps when it comes to criticism: the film is an inevitable masterpiece.<br/><br/>In fact, it's as a great film as America is a great nation, whose greatness was built on the ashes of such crimes as the Natives' genocide and slavery. These are stains on America's heart and it's befitting that the seminal film of the country of filmmaking would carry the same racism that forged the nation. Especially since the film works like a mirror of an era when things were different: some people were racist, other were not, some others believed they were only honoring the heritage of the South and were truly believing that peace depended on a separation between Whites and Blacks, hence the fact that the good 'blacks' were named 'faithful souls'.<br/><br/>Again, this patronizing attitude doesn't excuse the black faces, but they contrast so much with the historical perfectionism of the War sequence that they speak more negative statements against Griffith's genuine naivety than the Black community. So, if the film doesn't speak the truth, it says its own truth about the standards of the Day and the way History of America was still misread, when people needed a scapegoat to justify the ruin of Civilization (today, there can still be a ""Birth of Nation"" with Arabs as the evil-doers). As for the other purposes of Art: beauty and Justice, within their own debatable subjectivity, they do complete each other for the sake of entertainment.<br/><br/>To make myself clearer: we all resent the Ku Klux Klan ideals, and we don't believe that Blacks were the one-dimensional evil renegades or carpetbaggers who plotted a vengeful destruction of the South, but the film efficiently created two sides: the good guys and the villains, and at the end, through an operatic apotheosis, the 'good' guys triumph and 'Justice' is restored. Within the films' intellectual limitations, we're absorbed by the romanticism of the action and the iconic culmination with the climactic Ride of the Clansmen under the Valkyries' music, the film's most iconic moment.<br/><br/>The clansmen go rescue the Cameron's family trapped in a Union veteran's cabin. The inter-cutting between the different protagonists, the music, the fast-paced montage and the final confrontation, are so perfectly handled that we watch the film for what it is: a heart-pounding epic. And if I said that there couldn't be a masterpiece of a propaganda, maybe it's because it wasn't intended as propaganda, explaining why Griffith, baffled by the racist allegations would make one year later ""Intolerance"".<br/><br/>Still, I believe ""The Birth of a Nation"" should have been kept on AFI's Top 100 Movies and not be replaced by ""Intolerance"" for politically correct reasons. The film, despite its content is one of the most important movies ever made; its impact on directing, editing and storytelling is invaluable. Without ""The Birth of Nation"", there would be no movies, not even those to contradict its message."

","Very few films have managed this much lasting infamy, so I felt it was necessary for my film watching education.<br/><br/>The first hour and a half actually doesn't come off too badly (well, other than the appearance of the 'pet sister', but that's a relatively small role). You have two families trying to manage during the Civil War. <br/><br/>The changing point in the film is the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. That's when you start seeing the plots against the white south kicking into gear and some pretty over the top African Americans giving that little 'excellent' expression in perfect Mr. Burns fashion. This is when a sort of parody of African Americans begins, where they are 'taking over' the South, given control of any important positions and basically the audience is informed that the African Americans are ignorant of what leadership and these types of positions truly entail. Scenes involving a rowdy parliament filled with African Americans, as an example of the parody, where one guy has his feet up, shoeless, and he is told that in here, they must all wear shoes. He is not too happy with that notion, but complies, while in that same scene, a guy talking to everybody wanders around eating chicken.<br/><br/>I also noticed that the 'African American' characters were played by a mixture of actual African Americans and people with make up on trying to look like them. It doesn't look right. And it looked like the characters that do the worst things were of the latter category along. Aesthetically, this just looks wrong, and I almost wish they would have chosen to go one way or the other, rather than try to mix the two.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it's about as interesting as any other film of this sort, past or present, except without sound (the music doesn't really count, since it only partially fits... sometimes... Don't get me started on musical scores to silent films, because that is a whole other discussion). So, we're watching a bunch of people talk and not being able to see what they are saying. Give me more title cards! It really bothers me watching a bunch of talking scenes (with very few title cards saying what is being said), because I feel like I'm going deaf, and I have enough problems as it is with hearing.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the facial expressions of the characters in this movie were used fairly well, so that you got a good idea of the emotions and feelings of the characters, even if you couldn't understand what the heck they were saying.<br/><br/>You have a very slanted film after the assassination, aiming to show the white south as victims of the north, putting the former slaves in charge of the masters and basically disallowing the white south from having any power (such as the power to vote). You do have a couple African American characters who work for one of the families (one of them as a maid) and go so far as rescuing the Doctor guy (the head of that family) from captivity, which is an odd juxtaposition against the rest of the latter half of the film, because it kind of sort of shows a positive portrayal.<br/><br/>While I don't agree with the overall thrust of the movie and who it decided to paint up as heroes, I thought it would be a lot worse. Granted, at the time it was released, I can see how it would be shocking. But for me, the more horrific moments are the smaller moments and this film is much more broad than that, much more about bigger moments. The fact that they painted the Klu Klux Klan as heroes means that of course, any act of violence they portray must be one that is justified. So, for example, they kill an African American man and leave him on the doorsteps of the lead guy in charge locally, Lynch... but why? It was because he killed a woman. Now, the quotation used to describe their actions was rather ridiculous... but because of the justification, their actions aren't horrific. It would have been much more horrific for me if they went around committing atrocities and the film still treated them like heroes. At least, here, the film is consistent. It's a fantasy loosely based in reality. If you think of it like that, a lot of the film's power is largely negated.<br/><br/>Also consider this, the KKK don't even appear until about 2 hours in this 3 hour film. Their forming is kind of ridiculous, especially when you see the main Cameron guy have a light bulb go on in his head (via his expression), but they only exist in 1/3 of the film (less when you consider that not every scene has them in it).<br/><br/>I've seen more horrific moments in films that portray the reality of them, not the fantasy. The KKK of this film is not the same KKK in those other films. And while my thoughts on the group itself remain negative, it means that this film and its portrayal of African Americans (for the most part) is merely offensive. Still, I have to stand by it as an artistic expression, adapted from a novel, in a country supposedly founded on such ideals, so trying to ban it, even at the turn of the century, I think was wrong. <br/><br/>So, take it or leave it, but worth seeing from a film appreciation standpoint.<br/><br/>Civil War Shorts (Birth of a Nation 3 disc set) <br/><br/>I'd kind of want to recommend these over Birth of a Nation, because they are small, complete little stories with timeless themes with none of the stuff that makes Birth offensive. Plus, they feature very positive portrayals of female characters and even a brave African American character who steps in to take care of a family after the father is killed."

","D.W. Griffith's epic three-hour Civil War extravaganza is one of the seminal works of early American film-making, cementing many of the cinematic techniques with which Griffith had been experimenting in recent years, among them the cross-cut and the facial close-up. 'The Birth of a Nation (1915)' was also history's highest-grossing movie for three years (before being superseded by the Mabel Normand comedy 'Martin (1918)'). There's just one small problem... the film kind of celebrates the Ku Klux Klan. A lot of people have trouble getting past that. I don't think we should be too hasty in condemning Griffith as a racist: his career is peppered with sympathetic portrayals of African Americans ('His Trust (1911)'), Native Americans (The Red Man's View (1909)') and Asians ('Broken Blossoms (1919)'). One suspects that, in Thomas Dixon's novel ""The Clansman,"" Griffith simply came across a story that he believed would translate well to screen, and did so accordingly.<br/><br/>Regardless of Griffith's intentions, the second half of 'The Birth of a Nation' is rather unforgivably skewed towards Black vilification, depicting the KKK as a band of heroes valiantly restoring social order in the American South, after the freed Black slaves create a sort of dictatorial anarchy. Still, if this is considered evil ideology, then at least it's impeccably-crafted evil ideology. Griffith's mise-en-scène remains stage-bound in many aspects (the stage at Ford's Theatre even resembles one of the director's film sets), but I was surprised by the emotional strength of multiple dramatic sequences. Perhaps for the first time in his career, free from the constraints of the two-reeler, Griffith depicts characters whose emotions feel genuine. He constructs breathtaking battle-sequences using hundreds of extras, and creates suspense through the cross-cutting of parallel sequences: the assassination of Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre is brilliantly edited, strongly reminiscent of Hitchcock's Albert Hall montage in both versions of 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934/1956).'"
"toribrown","Null","1","2","11 May 2010"," Birth of a Nation
","Believed to be single most important and key film of all time in American movie history, Birth of a Nation was introduced in 1915. It contained new camera techniques to be utilized in films. It used deep focus, jump cut and close-ups. As a matter of fact, D.W. Griffith, the filmmaker, used close-ups quite a bit in his films. The film also has new innovations and technical effects that are notable, including the color sequence at the end of the film. It uses panning and moving camera shots, high angle shots and outdoor landscapes.<br/><br/>It was a film broken up into two parts, before the Civil War in America and the Reconstruction after the war. It covers themes of the Civil War, Interracial romance (Griffith also used interracial romance as a theme in Broken Blossoms), this time being between blacks and whites, and the creation of the Ku Klux Klan. Relationships are also a theme, that things are done properly, much like one expects in the 'proper South'. Relationships develop in a slow process, such as the one of Ben and Elsie. It takes over a couple years for the two to be together. The film can also be considered racist, as the blacks are portrayed negatively. The men are seen being forceful after white women, and men in the legislature are seen acting less than respectful in a formal meeting."

","D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation (1915) is a solid film, but to me it doesen't translate as great. I believe this film is sub par for many reasons, granted this film was made in 1915 and grossed over 10 million dollars, but it seems that the beauty and art of other early silents is lost in The Birth of a Nation. Unlike Sunrise or other silents, The Birth of a Nation lacks the powerful cinematography and the undeniable romantic story. Griffith seems to struggle with the lack of sound, there are many subtitles inserted throughout. He also over zealously uses a soundtrack throughout the movie, something that seems unnecessary. Perhaps I am spoiled by the artistic creations of Murnau, but Griffith and The Birth of a Nation do not get me too exited. The stationary cameras, and the quick edits paired with non-complimentary sound gets boring in a 3 hour film. That is not to say that The Birth of a Nation was not an influential film. To create a 3 hour epic in 1915 was unheard of, people flocked to the theaters to see this film, it created controversy and it grossed over 10 million dollars. Overall I wasn't so impressed with this film, but it is an obvious landmark for movie making history."

","Birth of a Nation demanded my full attention in order to follow. At first, it was difficult to figure out who people were, differentiate them, and how they each related to each other. After I got used to the characters, I began to really appreciate this movie. The story of how the civil war tore apart friendships and how friends and brothers killed each other was beautifully portrayed. The battle scene where the two friends and opponents died side by side was very touching. <br/><br/>This movie was also visually pleasing. When the outdoor fire scenes, which were red, switched to the glowing, yellow indoor scenes, it really added a sense of changing atmosphere. I also really liked the music choice, it's not every day that you see a town burning down to the soothing tune of ""O Tannenbaum"". ""In the Hall of the Mountain King"" was a wonderful choice for setting a battle scene; it reminded me of playing the old computer game Return Fire."
"bobsgrock","Null","1","2","6 July 2009"," Within its context, it is a timeless landmark.
","Anyone that is interested in classic film or film history must watch at least once The Birth of a Nation, perhaps the most important film ever made because it was the first true film; put together piece by piece, scene by scene, it tells a story. And this isn't just a one-reel, 10-minute story. This is a 3-hour plus epic that begins before the Civil War and follows through into the Reconstruction.<br/><br/>There is a lot going on here, perhaps more than needed. Despite this, The Birth of a Nation remains a historic landmark, something that will always need to be dealt with. The fact that this was all shot with one camera, one cameraman, and without a script but visually set up in director DW Griffith's head makes this even more astounding of an achievement. However, it will always be remembered for its severe racism, especially in today's society which treats this idea in entertainment as pure evil. As a matter of fact, there is hardly any racist content until the third act, if you don't count the use of white actors in blackface. Griffith spends 2/3 of the movie setting up the story, showing through the Northern Stonemans and the Southern Camerons the immense differences in our nation at the time and how the war brought the two sides closer and then farther.<br/><br/>That is to see it from a historical view. From a cinematic view, you have to stop and really think about what you are seeing. As someone who has grown up in the technological-savvy era of the 1990s, I have no idea what it would be like to live in the early 20th century and see for the first time an account of an important event on a big wall. It must have been truly remarkable, perhaps so much that most people didn't notice the racist content. Indeed, Griffith pioneered innumerable techniques that are so common today, we don't even think about how they are done. The idea of parallel editing between the Klan riding and people defending in a cabin shocks us today because of how the Klan is portrayed. Back then, it was a mind-blowing experience that seemed impossible to understand. Yet, Griffith did it and it is because we are so used to moving images that many, if any, people see this today they will automatically disregard it as pure racist garbage.<br/><br/>There are only two rules to keep when deciding to view The Birth of a Nation. First, understand that it is the single-most important production because it is the blueprint for every other movie, TV show and other images on a camera done since. Second, understand the sheer racism of it and have some sympathy for DW Griffith. I believe that he was blinded to the impact this would have. Not even he could have surmised that this would stir up hatred, reinstate the Klan, and cause blacks to respond in their own version. These facts alone point to something greater than the offensive material: Griffith has and always will be the Father of Cinema."
"pyrocitor","8","1","2","9 January 2009"," The ultimate exercise in form versus content
","The most expensive, and profitable film of its time. A film ensconced in such controversy that its director was forced to essentially 'redeem' himself to the cinema community with his next film. A film so powerful and influential that decades after its time, it was allegedly still used as a recruitment tool. The stories circling around D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation have become fodder for cinematic legend, crafting the film such an infamous reputation that it is commonly regarded as ""the most important film that no one wants to see"". Nonetheless, despite the stories, legends and controversy, it is impossible to deny the dangerously persuasive power and sheer cinematic mastery showcased by Griffith's defining cinematic product, easily giving the film endless merits to convey when viewed in a contemporary context.<br/><br/>Few films have ever proved so troublesome or difficult to reconcile, or have presented such a paradox in terms of cinematic quality. One one hand, The Birth of a Nation is a technically stunning cinematic masterpiece, with production values and sheer scope and ambition which would be tremendously laudable in a current day context, let alone in 1915, when it was rare to have a film of an hour and a half of length, let alone three hours. In attempting to literally make good on its title and explore what Griffith saw as the birth of his country, such an audacious odyssey of a film does give the viewer the sense of being present for the foundation of an age, each minute detail from the reading of a tender wartime letter to the sweeping historical battle sequences lending credence to the film's promotional statement of being ""history written with lightning"". Griffith pioneered countless techniques of cinematography and editing to mine the maximum potential of emotional resonance and stirring, rousing reaction in viewers, making for a visually luscious and impressively powerful technical triumph. To say the industry simply ""does not make films like this anymore"" is a cliché bandied about far too often to retain its full relevance, but in the case of The Birth of a Nation, the expression rings fervently true, as film-making to such an extent of ambition, scope and sheer passion has seldom been glimpsed on a cinema screen since. <br/><br/>But at the same time, no matter how many countless technical and cinematic plaudits, The Birth of a Nation is still an inescapably, fundamentally flawed film. The amount of inexhaustible self-confidence and ambition Griffith must have tirelessly retained to convince both himself and his studio that the film was still worthy of being made (allegedly pouring $112, 000 in 1915 dollars into the production) permeate the film with a constant sense of cloying pretension and sense of stuffy self-importance throughout, plastering his name and initials over the scene setting title cards and soaking the film in a haughty sense of intense importance which lessens the stunning resonance of its technical mastery. And of course, the source of the vast majority of the film's controversy, the unavoidable extreme racism which effectively forms the centerpiece of the film (from depicting African Americans as essentially savage detriments to American life to turning the Klu Klux Klan into valiant crusaders and national heroes) makes it almost impossible to properly the film even keeping in mind its dated politics and social conditions. While the film's focalising on a different aspect of the Klan than is usually explored does help understand those who empathized with its politics and the seductive persuasion so powerfully employed by the group, such an ever recurring issue still makes it almost impossible to fully endorse the film, countless plaudits or not. <br/><br/>As a side note, it is interesting to decode Griffith's portrayal of war (through a lengthy and undeniably thrilling Civil War battle sequence), especially considering America's looming role in the World War One conflict. At first glimpse, the film might be read as an anti-war film, with its talk of settling lasting conflicts and refusing to shy away from the horrors of war (even the Klu Klux Klan sequences, as portrayed by Griffith, were idealistic people attempting to eradicate what they saw as a societal problem, working towards unification of American society... albeit an all white one). At the same time, it is impossible to deny Griffith's extraordinary proficiency as a storyteller, and the war sequences crackle with a vivid excitement and tension that most modern war films, despite countless advances in technology and narrative construction, still fail to match. And herein lies the film's seeming conflict of interest: despite lamenting the horrors of war and need for resolution and peace, it becomes quickly clear just how crucially exciting the battle sequences are, as if simultaneously romanticising the conflict and drawing every fiber of exhilarating emotional nuance from it. In Griffith's film, war is both harrowing and fun - a stance even more questionable when applying it to the First World War context increasingly creeping up on the country. <br/><br/>In the end, The Birth of a Nation proves the definitive exercise in exploring form versus content: a cinematic triumph and superb example of the persuasive power of film in terms of promoting national identity or enforcing ideological constructs (the fact that it reignited the Klu Klux Klan in the 1920s and allegedly as late as in the 1970s proves testament to its lasting power, despite the inexcusably questionable moral stance) yet one so long, pompous and inexcusably single minded in its racism that very few viewers will truthfully enjoy watching. While there is no denying the film's importance to the history of its industry or even the valid merits of viewing in a contemporary context, it remains a film to be watched with more of a bucket full rather than a grain of salt - a film more to be appreciated rather than fully satisfy.<br/><br/>-8/10"

","Certainly this film is both innovative for it's time and breathtakingly racist for ANY time. However, an aspect of this film that doesn't get much analysis is the acting. While Mr. Griffith may have expanded the boundaries of the potential of film in both the epic and the multiple-plot sense, his use of actors was in no way innovative.<br/><br/>At the time the common style of acting was both stagy and formal, with standardized gestures used to convey the basic emotions and no real exploration of the deeper aspects of human behavior. Mr. Griffith seems not to have understood or even cared that this theatrical style of acting was even more ineffective in film, particularly in close-ups, and therefore made no effort to explore more effective ways to help his actors connect with the audience. To be fair, he may have been correct in assuming his basic audience in 1915 wouldn't know any better, but still, it wasn't long before Charlie Chaplin, Stan Laurel, Buster Keaton and others (with no more knowledge than Griffith) innovated the art form in ways Griffith seemed incapable of grasping, and the film audience even in the early days always embraced the more honest and subtle styles of film acting that they instinctively connected with.<br/><br/>Ms. Gish & Company share little of the blame for their work in BOAN; after all, as has been stated, they never even had a script to work off of, and obviously there was no one on set to adjust their performances from the theatrical background they were used to. Occasionally a honest moment still seems to creep into a few of the performances, but they seem to be accidents since all the emotional moments Griffith emphasizes with editing and close-ups are terribly stilted. It isn't only the black characters that seem ridiculous, and part of the reason modern audiences have to stifle laughs at some of the performances is because that style of acting has been parodied since before most of them were born.<br/><br/>This film does make you appreciate all the more the groundbreaking work of actors from Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant and Katherine Hepburn to Henry Fonda, Marlon Brando and James Dean in creating the modern form of film acting.<br/><br/>And by the way, I have to add that even though I was warned about the racism of the film, there is nothing to prepare you for the stunning degree of ADVOCACY of the racism from Mr. Griffith. This aspect of the film, even given the overall historical impact of BIRTH OF A NATION, cannot be avoided or dismissed."

","The Civil War divides friends and destroys families, but that is nothing compared to the anarchy in the South after the war.<br/><br/>I wish to use this review as a defense of this film. It is considered one of the most controversial films of all time, and while I do not deny that it has earned that honor, I think it deserves a solid defense from those who would call it racist.<br/><br/>The opening frames say the film is intended to show the abhorrent nature of war. And the position given to the South is that it is defending the sovereign right of states. Slavery aside (and we will all agree it is a terrible crime), this is a legitimate position. President Lincoln did violate the rights of states and forced countless Americans to die. Viewed in this light, it makes sense and is understandable.<br/><br/>Lillian Gish denied it was a racist film (for what her opinion is worth), and D. W. Griffith himself was by no means a racist. He was personally hurt when accused of making a racist film, and had previously made a film condemning the Ku Klux Klan. His job was to tell a story, not to embrace the perceived message of the story being told.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert said, ""The Birth of a Nation is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will, it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."" Ebert does find the second half of the film racist, but the question remains: through whose eyes are we seeing this story? It is not true history, only the history told in the South.<br/><br/>Regardless, it is still the first blockbuster. We have to give credit to a film that runs over three hours, raked in millions of dollars and funded the beginning of MGM and Paramount.

Although both halves intertwine, the first half is ultimately a meticulous war epic, while the second half is a social investigation into the KKK and black militias.<br/><br/>There was an adaptation period during the first 20-30 minutes where I had to get used to the silent-black-and-white-ninety-year-old technology.

The story is also very unconventional, partly because of its scope.<br/><br/>The main downside of the film is that the technological gap between 1915 and the 21st century may be too large for some audiences to scale, even with the film as good as it is. It requires mental concentration for a period at the start, but then things settle in. Another obvious negative is the backwards social message. Even so, I found that watching the film expanded my horizons in a positive way.<br/><br/>Therefore, this film gets a high recommendation despite its age. It allows one to peer into the far past, where the world was different socially, technologically, and culturally. This is something that is important for everyone to experience, and this film is one of the best ways to do it."

","It's a shame really. ""The birth of a Nation"" is an epic film with brilliant directing from one of the first masters, D.W. Griffith. He uses expressive close-ups and super impositions with incredible skill. The movie has breathtaking long shots showing the huge scale of the civil war. It also includes a realistic version of the Lincoln assassination. But after Lincoln dies the movie displays the Ku Klux Klan as heroes! It actually is interesting seeing the point of view from a disenfranchised southerner but I still had to lower the movie rating from a 9 to a 8. It is just too ridiculous to see clansmen racing out on their horses to save the day. If you are trying to see the best movies of all time chronologically please skip this movie and see ""Intolerance"" which has the same brilliant directing from Griffith and is even more epic in scale, but has a much better message."

I understand some peoples problem with silent films, and I would not recommend this one as a starting point. It feels twice as long as it's already too long run time.

","D.W. Griffith seems to get all the credit for this film. When in actuality the unsung hero of ""The Birth of a Nation"" is his cinematographer G.W. Bitzer. While the plot and story may seem to go astray to some people towards the end when the racism and bigotry is full blown, there is a technical element of the film that makes it landmark. The use of irises and color in certain scenes to emphasis symbolic feuds or relationships had never been similarly done before. (ie: the fighting of the puppies and kitten to represent the North and South) If you have problems with English subtitles in current movies though, I would NOT recommend this film. But once you get past the silent factor, the film itself is definitely worth seeing. People may condemn me for promoting such a racist and KKK supporting film, but I am only promoting the film because of its huge impact on our culture in the 20th century. It was difficult for me to finish this film because of the horrible ""propaganda"" style brainwashing that was being attempted. It seemed like Griffith was trying to convince us all that this is reality, when in fact it is far from reality. It is the inner workings of a racist man. But it captured what society was like during the civil war era -- people believing slaves were happy in their situations, people believing blacks were incapable of acting properly in social scenes, people believing the KKK was a group of heroic men, etc. All of these blatantly WRONG notions were what engulfed our nation then, and when racism became taboo and seen as wrong in the early 20th century this film is what reverted us right back to those pathetic beliefs of ignorance. The resurgence of the KKK after this film was devastating to the progression of this country and any work of art and cinema that can actually alter history, I believe, is worth watching at least once."

","Many experts have claimed that the greatest novel America ever produced was THE ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN, and that the greatest opera it ever produced was PORGY AND BESS.  Many others have also found both works also racist, and they are--though not nearly as much as BIRTH OF A NATION.  This is a film that is blatantly and even alarmingly bigoted.  <br/><br/>
However, bigotry infects many works of art from the past.  Along with the American works above, I could name dozens of others, many of them quite beloved, from Shakespeare's MERCHANT OF VENICE to Wagner's PARZIVAL to Malcolm X's Autobiography.  Even the New Testament, in the Book of Titus, second chapter, has a really hateful generalization about all people who come from Crete. The answer does not lie in condemning such works, but progressing beyond them.  <br/><br/>BIRTH OF A NATION stands up as the ultimate test of racism and aesthetics. If one can appreciate it, then one appreciate any bigoted work of art; if one condemns it, then logically one should also condemn countless great works of the past and present.  When you ""search your conscience"" while appreciating this film, you might apply that consideration as well, remembering that it's always easier to jump to indignation than to understanding."

","First of all, if you're going to appreciate this film, then you're going to have to appreciate the technicality and handle of the camara both before this movie was ever made and after.  Before, camaras never moved; camaras were far away, never any close-ups of any kind. Griffith took what he had and used it. He reached new heights with it. It's grand because before this movie, movies weren't really much. It was also the first movie to create a LOT of strong feelings for any film. It was a racist movie. It said the Civil War wasn't the Union (North) against the Confederate (South), it was about the blacks against the whites.  There were stereotypes everywhere! Of what good girls were, what mulattoes were like, of the relationship between black men and white women, of faithful black servants, and the relationship between whites, etc. It was a strong story that either evoke feelings to fight prejudice or to support for the KKK. You'd have to know a little bit about film history and US history. Remember also, that Griffith was a poor, Southern boy growing up. He would hear stories of the ""good ole days"" before the Civil War from his father who was a colonel of the Confederacy."

","Decidedly, this WWI Americas is very conservative: after a War propaganda (Lusitania), an anti-abortion eugenic pamphlet (My children), here we have an Aryan movie, in which old white enemies during the Secession War become new allies to fight the new Black Power!
What's upsetting is that the movie opens very differently as maybe the only good movie that brings together Lincoln and a family around the war. Usually, we have movie about Lincoln or about the war but never the 2 scales at the same time. Here it's done and it's quite brilliant in production and in cast.
The second part is interesting because previous movies stop at the end of the war (Victory, Emancipation, ...) when all seems good and right while in fact it wasn't this peaceful and empowering road.
But here the change is drastic because it's indeed a KKK propaganda: it's maybe the first movie in which i see indeed black people harassing, threatening, humiliating white people, their children, their vote... It's strange and as a citizen, i would be interested if the facts told in the movie are true or not. So that's why it's a good historical piece because you have a lot of things in it to think and that's explain why this is the last DVD in my french for old movies.

"mark835","8","1","4","12 February 2014"," Magnificent and Repulsive
","I'm not as cinematically sophisticated as most of the people who have reviewed this film, but I would like to make two points:<br/><br/>1. It's hard to believe this film is 100 years old. It flows like a modern movie from beginning to end. When viewing it, I made the initial adjustment to it being a silent film in a very short time, and after that, I was just caught up in the plot and flow. Griffith had no panning, no zooming and very few long shots or close ups. Practically every scene was done in medium shot — and obviously there's no dialog — but the film is put together so well that I hardly noticed its ""old-fashioned"" quality.<br/><br/>2. The film is unbelievably racist. Unbelievably! Hey, I knew it was racist before watching it, but I never never dreamed it would be as bad as it was. It makes a person's heart ache to think that people really were — and are — that bigoted. It is so tragic that such a brilliant, well-made film had such an obnoxious message.<br/><br/>Both of the above points are reasons for people to watch this movie today. In a nutshell, TBOAN shows that Griffith was a true genius as a film maker, but also how deeply entrenched the roots of racism are in American society."

","Before taking this movie out from my school library I was warned that it is "" three hours long, and good luck in staying awake."" Trying not to go into it with preconceived notions I took the film for what it was worth. Considering it was produced nearly one hundred years ago, it was good. I tried to put myself in the shoes of an audience member, sitting in a theater in 1915. The visuals were certainly good for its day. I actually didn't grow bored with this film, believe it or not. I did the best I could do following the plot. I am a big civil war fan, so that may be why this film appealed to me. For me it was very interesting to look back into the year 1915 whilst virtually looking back to the 1860s. I thought the acting in the film was very good all around. Without the presence of sound, they still seem to illustrate what they're talking about. The score of music selected for the film is interesting, some of it I enjoyed, it played a crucial part in some of the battle scenes. It was interesting to see the mindset of the average family back in that time period, and the role of African Americans. It really opens up the eyes of someone viewing it in todays age, how far we have come, and how lost and confused we have been in the past.<br/><br/>Interesting portrayal of historical characters. Casting director was on the money when it came to casting Abraham Lincoln. I was also impressed with the budget they must have been working with. There were a vast amount of extras, not sure if they got paid for their service.. most likely not. All in all it was an interesting view into our past as a nation. I have to say, something peculiar stuck out when I was about half way through the film. I realized that all these people that were in this movie are surely dead and gone, and most likely have been for almost a half a century."
"Steffi_P","8","1","4","5 September 2009"," ""The dark side of wrong""
","In writing these comments, I don't normally look into the political or ethical issues of the films in question, but in the case of Birth of a Nation I feel I must, due to its significance in cinema history and its appalling and conspicuous racism. While most buffs who view the picture today will be able to ignore that racism, the fact of it still causes a number of problems. As it was DW Griffith's most famous and successful picture, it has been taken as representative of his whole career and personality. Consequently, some of today's writers have attempted to downplay Griffith's contributions to cinematic form (see for example John Steinle's woefully uninformed essay at sensesofcinema.com). Others have stated that Birth is overrated compared to Griffith's less objectionable pictures, or even that the less racist first half is also technically superior to the second.<br/><br/>None of these attempts to reassess the quality of Birth or Griffith's work as a whole is particularly convincing, and they are little more than a ridiculous assumption that a director's views are synonymous with their talent (a misunderstanding for which the auteur theory is at least partly to blame). Anyone who has seen more than a handful of Griffith's pictures will know that he made pictures putting forward many different and conflicting views – see for example the Biograph shorts The Red Man's View, His Trust and The Rose of Kentucky – but the fact that he made Birth of a Nation proves he was certainly a naïve and unconscious racist, although not a hateful one. Still, this doesn't detract from his being a master craftsman of the cinema, and to deny Griffith's influence would be to misrepresent cinematic history.<br/><br/>So with that said, let's have a look at the picture itself. Birth of a Nation's greatest asset is perhaps its portrayal of family life and romantic love. Griffith's tableaux are a beautiful blend of naturalism and the style of renaissance painting. He paints a nostalgic picture of the Old South, linking its romantic imagery with the emotional heart of the story – for example Henry Walthall having his first glimpse of Lillian Gish's portrait while standing in a field of cotton. By contrast many of the action sequences are actually rather dull. The main battle scene in the first half is a bit of a mess, with too many indistinct god-shots of people running round, a bit of flag-waving and some puffs of smoke. The one exception is the final ride-to-the-rescue, which is, unfortunately, perhaps the best Griffith ever constructed. I say ""unfortunately"", because it's also completely abhorrent, racially. While I can appreciate it objectively, I can't enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's often overlooked that, aside from his technical innovations, Griffith's pictures were also at the forefront of revolutionising screen acting. They took us from the grimacing and pantomime of the mid-1900s to the subtle yet expressive performances which we see here. In Birth of a Nation, it's particularly nice to see Lillian Gish at her peak, before she descended into a style which consisted of nothing but childish gestures and over-the-top hysterics. Another standout is Raoul Walsh as John Wilkes Booth, who brings a powerful presence to his small yet pivotal role. On the downside, perennial villains George Siegmann and Walter Long are simply hammy stereotypes, indicative of the crudeness of many reconstruction scenes. Griffith defenders who claim the first part is better than the second are at least right in terms of the quality of acting and level of realism! <br/><br/>As a cinematic achievement, Birth of a Nation is surpassed by Intolerance and many of Griffith's short pictures. It is still however an example of his sensitivity to cinematic form and a culmination of his pioneering work of the previous six years. Today, discussion of it seems to be either at an infantile level (see the message boards below ;) ) or simply non-existent. Griffith's pictures are not only integral to the development of cinematic language, they are also beautifully made works of entertainment, and acknowledging this does not make someone a racist by association. Let's not throw Griffith's baby out with its bigoted bathwater."
"m.muehlheim","7","1","4","18 August 2009"," Groundbreaking and Hideous
","It is difficult to rate a film that is both stylistically brilliant and ideologically repugnant. Griffith's classic is a thoroughly racist account of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction period; it is also a groundbreaking piece of early silent cinema.<br/><br/>Of course, at the time of its ""birth,"" the US was indeed a profoundly racist nation; in addition to slavery, there was the genocide committed against Native Americans. It is sadly appropriate, then, that a film intended as a paean to national unity today constitutes a sober reminder of a more than shameful past. (And I haven't even mentioned the film's depiction of women...) Griffith's film had a huge influence on cinematographic storytelling and is certainly too important to dismiss - even if one somehow wishes one could."

","While he was a film critic for ""The Nation"" James Agee wrote a critique on D.W. Griffith explaining why, in his opinion, he was one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live. He talked mostly about his technical expertise, as well as Griffith's ability to manipulate his audience like any great filmmaker could. However, at one point he defends Griffith's political stance on both the American Civil War and Slavery. Agee goes on to claim that Griffith takes a neutral stance in ""The Birth of a Nation"" and depicts the slaves as any southerner would...<br/><br/>Look, Griffith may have depicted black America as any southerner would...as a racist, but shame on Mr. Agee for arriving at the ignorant and disgusting argument that Griffith depicted both sides equally. At no point in this film is there an equal depiction of the former slaves versus their masters. At the end of the film he shows ""crazed"" African Americans busting through a shed door trying to get to the innocent, and pure, white ladies. No one can save these maidens of the south except for...the KKK!!! Hurray, the KKK is here...<br/><br/>Pardon my French, but screw that, Mr. Agee. ""The Birth of a Nation"" is studied for it's technical achievements and for Griffith's mastery of editing, not for historical accuracy, of which there is none. It doesn't matter if Agee wrote that critique at the end of the 1940's, it is still racist and ignorant and anyone with any sense can see that Griffith's film is just that. It's time that someone questioned James Agee's expertise on this matter as well. Just because Agee is considered one of the premier film critics in American history doesn't mean his word right, let alone the divine word of God. Good lord, he called ""The Birth of a Nation"" a fair and equal look at two lifestyles.<br/><br/>It is time now, in the 21st century to stop clinging to these old critics and look at things for ourselves, starting with this film. ""The Birth of a Nation"" may very well be a milestone for technical innovation in film, but it's racist, ignorant and it inspired more racists for years to come. This film was shown to hoards of Klan members throughout the 20th century, and indeed no other film has been shown to more people in the history of cinema. In the history of American film, a Racist movie has been seen by more people than anything else. It crafted a mythology about the Klan that endured well into the 1960's, and in some places in America it still exists. Why is it that we continue to glorify this film? There are plenty of other films that use these same techniques without being completely ignorant.<br/><br/>It's the 21st century and it's time to move on."
"TxSoccer83","7","1","4","25 April 2008"," Great film, wrong ideas!
","I recently viewed ""The Birth of a Nation"", which was directed by D.W. Griffith. I must say that as sick as it made me the film, for its time in history, was put together in a fashion that the audience could relate to. The film is focused around the story of two families, one Northern and one Southern, and how their lives would become caught in the whirlwind during Civil War. It focuses on two sons who fought in the war, and the effects their fighting would have on their families, mainly focusing on how one son would go on to be the founder/creator of what is now know as the Klu Klux Klan. The irony in the film is how intense role reversal is presented in the film. When one speaks of the Klu Klux Klan now, well those of us who wish to banish terrorism, we see the evilness and sheer horror that this organization has produced. But in Griffith's film the Klan plays the role of the hero. Hero? Well the movie titters on the definition of hero. It is common knowledge that in most cinematic films the hero stands up for all citizens, in place of what law enforcement is lacking. This is true to an extent with Griffith, but who qualifies as citizens is called into question.<br/><br/>For a film that cost $100,000 and used 13-reel film, the movie was shot quite well. The film distinguishes itself from other movies in its era. The editing from the film is broad to say the least. Griffith toys with long shots in the film, especially during enormous battle scenes of that war. He never loses focus on that is actually happening on the battle field. Although it is quite difficult to distinguish certain actors in the scene, it's still wonderfully caught on camera. I think if you were to compare the battle scenes to other shots in the film, one might find that there are many BCU (Big Close-Up) shots. Take for instance the scene where Flora takes a nose dive to her death. As insane as the scene in, Griffith does capture the horror in her eyes and the fear that is causation from Gus. Although there are two sides to every story and I'm sure Griffith had his. I must state my stance on the film. I personally felt that Griffith could have used his gift, and it was a gift, no matter how sick he portrayed it, to create a masterpiece the all of humanity could enjoy. This films negative view of African American is a shame to our country. I don't understand how the film actually passed production stages. I understand that there wasn't a stern hand, in terms of regulation in the film industry, but that's still no excuse. The showing of this movie in certain parts of the country can purely be defined as an allocation to join a terrorist organization. The word terrorist might seem harsh, but let's take a moment to understand the actions of the Klan in the movie. There is no unified statement that clarifies what they all stand for. What is unified is the violence blacks are faced with when not compliant with what whites thought their role was. From what I tool from the film, the role of blacks was to be sub-servant to all whites in the post Civil War period. <br/><br/>It is astounding to realize that ""The Birth of a Nation"" is one of the first full length films in cinematic history. Realize that in this time out country was in turmoil and on the edge of destruction. This film is almost a fleeting hope for the side that lost, with the re-enactment of the assassination of President Lincoln, I still amazed that this was allowed in theaters. I do praise Griffith in his boldness to try different angles in the film. He explores slightly vertical angles, while maintaining pose and centralizing the films characters. The scene in which the confederate soldiers are marching off to battle, he captures the emotion of the town. This is illustrated with the fireworks and jeers of approval as the soldiers march off to war. It's quite another scene when ""the little Colonel"" (Ben Cameron) returns back from the war to find that there is no crowd or fireworks waiting for him. I enjoyed this scene because it shows a failing aspect of the film. One could interpret this scene as a reflective thought, on the part of Camerons, emotional self possibly ponder what was all the fighting for. I understand that he stands for certain causes, but the Mise en scène of this can be seen in the motion of the shot. As the camera is angled in front of Cameron and the focus in entirely based on how he might not understand, the reaction of the town, due to his return."

It's all the more remarkable that it was the first film of its type--feature length--and that so few silent films in the years that followed came anywhere near equaling its achievements. My own favorite moment is at the very end of the first half, when a weary Ben Cameron comes home at the end of the war and is slowly coaxed inside by the outstretched arms of his family. <br/><br/>If only Griffiths had stopped there. The second half of the film devolves into lurid melodrama, and as if that wasn't bad enough, displays a sickening racism and disregard for historical fact. Don't try to excuse it  as being a product of its time; the NAACP protested when it was released, and President Woodrow Wilson had to backpedal on his initial praise of the film.<br/><br/>

Never has there ever been any critic to find fault with Director D.W. Griffith's innovative story telling, bold camera work and general brilliance in bringing the story from the printed page. Always there is the caveat, attached to any other positive and praiseworthy aspects that it tells the story of the Post Civil War Period. Known as the the Reconstruction, the painful time was told from the point of view of the South; namely the former Slave Holding 'Aristocracy'.<br/><br/>UNFORNUTELY, THIS ONE fact haunts the film and seems to set it apart and denigrate it as somehow being evil, contemptible and utterly without any social redeeming qualities.

This of course is total absurdity to anyone; regardless of whatever the point of view.<br/><br/>AS THE STORY is unfolded, it reveals the changes that occur with the end of the American War between the States; all the while making extensive use of footnoting as a tool of checking the veracity of what is being portrayed.<br/><br/>THE FILM PORTRAYS President Abraham Lincoln as the just and fair man he truly was. His announced policy was to treat the Southern Cesessionist States as if nothing had ever happened.<br/><br/>THIS, OF COURSE, as we all know, never came to pass; owing to President Lincoln's assassination.<br/><br/>ENTER THE TRUE villains of the story; that being a faction of the Republican Party known as the Radical Republicans.

The emergence of the Klan, it would appear, was quite similar to other events in the world.

In this respect, it surpasses GONE WITH THE WIND in its boldness and it did so without one of those super budget epics; that would come down pike in latter.<br/><br/>INSPITE OF ITS blunt treatment of so many of these unpleasant topics, BIRTH OF A NATION doesn't gloss over any of it as say GONE WITH THE WIND DOES. As an example, we offer the manner in which the latter day film glosses over the Klan; opting instead for having Ashley Wilkes lead a moonlight raid of a shanty town, but without the white sheeted garb. The KKK was not even mentioned, not once."

","I just watched this for the second time, the first being many years ago, and I enjoyed it much more now that I'm older. Knowing the history of the time period this film takes place, it is interesting to watch it from the Southern view. This film was made only about 50 years after the Civil War, and because of that, for me, it holds more of a truth about the war that we might not see today in cinema. The story was enjoyable, yet very negative at times. It was interesting seeing the role of President Lincoln portrayed during the war, especially his assassination. The storyline of the brothers, and their family, was easy to relate to after knowing family members who have children serving overseas today in the military. The cinematography and imagery is bold and powerful for the time it was made. I can only imagine the controversy this film caused in the North when it came out. I read that their was a sequel made by a different director called The Fall of a Nation. It is now considered to be a lost film from what I read on Wikipedia. Too bad, I would have enjoyed seeing it."

","""Birth of a Nation"" can rattle any viewer to the core because of both the brazen images that it conjures, but also, made in 1915, it forces the viewer to change the way they watch movies. There are no spoken words, just the loud notes of the orchestra playing ""Dixie"", or ""Star Spangled Banner"", or just tunes to carry us to the next scene. This film also depicts the racial tensions of the time rather honestly. Griffith has been marked a racist for his work on this film, the images of white actors playing African Americans, or the depiction of the power of the Klu Klux Klan can rattle any viewer to the core. Isn't that the point? ""Birth of a Nation"" is not only a stronger, more influential film than ""Gone With the Wind"", but it challenges the typical popcorn-to-couch viewer. One could show similarities between the two films by saying that there are sweeping landscapes and powerful battle scenes in both films, but Griffith takes it a step further by showing us the history of racism, a.k.a. the birth of a fearing nation. He begins with the Civil War, most specifically two families that were friends prior to the War, but find themselves eventually on dueling sides of the battlefield. It is this brother-against-brother war that fuels the future events of the South. Griffith's film also develops the power of Abe Lincoln throughout these times. It shows his compassion, his desire to unify the country, and to assist in the redevelopment of the South. This, sadly, gives a further reason as to why his assassination took place, and how the North used this to push the South into further disarray.<br/><br/>To modern standards, ""Birth of a Nation"" is racist. Griffith's depiction of African Americans in the army, voting, and taking office is very difficult to watch in 2008, but there is a moment of truth to his images. The new rule from the North brought too much power to one particular person, thus destroying any level of equality for this already war-ravished nation. In the same vein, Griffith's portrayal of the KKK to today's modern standards is also considered racist. To have an organization, fueled by hatred, be the heroines of the film, is again, difficult to watch in 2008  but Griffith, I believe, sees this and with that final scene of the KKK demonstrates how they have transformed into an entity of hatred, instead of encouraged by change. Griffith credits the birth of the KKK as a group that merely wanted to have a voice in the South, a group that wanted to have equality across the board, so in retaliation, they organized, and the KKK was formed. Having never read ""The Clansmen"", one does question how detailed Griffith went when pulling source material for his film from this book. Watching how the KKK regains power is necessary to this story, because Griffith is able to take these historically accurate moments and show us where we went wrong. ""Birth of a Nation"" is a film that points the finger inward, depicting casualties from both the North and South, both white and black, and both rich and poor. The underlining meaning to ""Birth of a Nation"" is that corruption and evil lurk from all different places and that perhaps the best response isn't the greatest action.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to end this review by expressing my feelings toward this film. This was an emotional, exhausting, and powerful film to watch. Why it isn't on everyone's ""Top Ten"" lists is beyond me, outside of the fact that perhaps the depiction of the KKK or African Americans is a bit hard to swallow. I would agree that this film is racist, but in the context of the time, I think Griffith was right to do what he did to create this masterpiece. I am not racist myself, but if I had a child, and wanted to show them a darker side to our great nation, this would be the film I would showcase. Not only does it show racism, but is shows ""why"". It is a courageous film from its historical basis, but a sad film from its honesty. Everyone should watch ""Birth of a Nation"", it is a bold entry into not just the world of cinema (the first real epic), but it is one of the few films to really paint a dirty picture of the Civil War. While we all agree that the Civil War (or any war) is unjust, ""Birth of a Nation"" takes us to next level to show its repercussions.<br/><br/>Overall, I initially had trouble training my eyes to watch a non-talking film. The music was fantastic, the scenes were detailed, and the story captured my attention until the very end. This was a historical epic  surprisingly, an epic that takes you away from you comfort zone. It forces you to root for an evil organization, to shake your head at the images of African Americans, and see the corruption of the North (a side we typically see as sympathetic to the cause). My argument is that this film is a classic  alas, a forgotten classic. While film schools, film geeks, and non-commercial film literature feels that ""Birth of a Nation"" is considered the ultimate classic, there is a strong majority that fear the message in this film  that fear the images that Griffith has created  thus they push away, and on so many lists of films you will find ""Gone With the Wind"", a glossier, less engaging film. In conclusion, ""Birth of a Nation"" is exactly what the title describes. It is the birth of our current society, complete with racism, hatred, confusion, corruption, epic battles, and greed. It is a film that should be catapulted to the top, not forgotten at the bottom.<br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","Birth of a Nation, like all D.W. Griffith movies, is groundbreaking and beautifully shot. It is almost hard to believe that is was shot in 1915. The acting by Henry B. Walthall and Lillian Gish is very good. Yet everything good about this movie is outweighed by its total lack of credibility. Its theme that the Southern whites were the valiant victims of the blacks would be laughable if not so upsetting. The statement before the beginning of Act 2, that this movie was only a representation of the history of the nation, and that no offense was meant towards any race does nothing to dismiss the omnipresent racism throughout the picture."

So, good filmmaking - bad history.  On a note of fact, the Ku-Klux Klan was founded by General Nathan Bedford Forrest CSA.

","Judged on the basis of this film alone - which would not, of course, be fair - D.W. Griffith shows no signs of being a great director.  He may have been a pioneering director, but that's not the same thing.<br/><br/>The techniques on display in ""Birth of a Nation"" don't show a lot of promise, anyway.  The one modern audiences will immediately notice is tinting (battle scenes are red, domestic scenes are sepia, etc.).  But although monochrome remained the industry default for about thirty years after the first appearance of three-strip technicolor (in 1932), tinting had completely vanished by 1930 or so - because, however fashionable it may have once been, it's a lousy technique.  Griffith's trick of drawing our attention to something by blacking out the rest of the screen - destroying the sense of frame on which cinema depends - also deservedly vanished from the common repertoire.  (Not that it was used to much effect.)  And while Griffith may have ""invented"" the close-up (between you and me, he didn't), his meagre use of them in this particular film doesn't prevent the work from being uncomfortably stagy.<br/><br/>I stress again that it would be unfair to judge Griffith from this film alone.  I haven't seen his later work; no doubt he improved.  But it would be ridiculous to give him a reputation by making allowances for the fact that he lacked the technical and cultural resources that were around a generation or so later.  You might as well call W.S. Gilbert a great director, or Charles Dickens - very likely they, too, could have made good films if they'd had the resources.  Let's keep the debate above board and judge by actual results. ...My remarks above refer to part one, which wasn't, exactly, BADLY made, and at least pleasant to watch.  But part two makes up for this.  Yes, I know a work can be morally evil and aesthetically great, and racism needn't be an artistic flaw.  But sometimes it IS an artistic flaw - for instance, here.  Does the blatant racism of the second half weaken the characterisation?  YES.  Does it make the conflict between the good guys and the bad guys seem hopelessly contrived?  Yes.  Do we get the curious feeling that we're watching cartoon blacks pasted on top of a photo-realistic painting?  Yes again.  This is all quite apart from the fact that Griffith (unlike Tolkein in ""The Lord of the Rings"", who exhibits artistically justified racism towards orcs) purports to tell a more-or-less true story about the real world.<br/><br/>There's a difference between learning to respect conventions that are different from later ones, and learning to respect conventions that are inferior to later ones.  ""The Birth of a Nation"" demands that we do the latter - with regard to both moral AND cinematic conventions.  We can only regard it as a great work of art by being dishonest with ourselves.  An epic like ""Metropolis"" belongs in cinemas; ""The Birth of a Nation"" belongs in a museum."

","History is rather unique. It is for the most part stable and unchanging, or as my chemistry professor said history is 20/20. However history is just that, its History. We should not forget what we once were nor should we revive it. With ""Birth of a Nation, The"" we have a great example of this. We should use this film to demonstrate the levels our country fell to at this time. It is a great film to gauge how far we have come since then. If we try to forget films like this people may come and replace them. Even if their message is outdated to the nth degree we should still look at them. Some of the greatest films are those films that are the most controversial. If you're a history or film professor I recommend it to show to your class, as well as other films like Hitler's ""Triumph of the Will"".  However, I can not stress this enough, make it VERY clear to them that it is outdated and should no longer be taken literally. Also in finality both of these films are blatant propaganda films, watch them first and grade their merit to your unit before using them.

""Birth of a Nation"" is not a great movie own its own merit, in fact it is not even a good movie. I am not arguing that it is not a racist piece of trash; it is. This said, the movie was and is significant because it served as a landmark for freedom of expression. In 1915 only the printed media was protected by the first amendment, movies were not protected under freedom of speech. ""Birth of a Nation"" was often censored by municipalities and was rightfully protested by the NAACP. D.W. Griffith went on to write a book called ""The Rise and Fall of Free Speech in America"" in which he argued that film, recordings and advertising should enjoy the same protection under the law as newspapers and magazines. Because of Griffith's film producers and directors today can make movies without fear of governmental reprisal. The next time you are watching ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Trainspotting"", ""Chasing Amy"" or any other controversial film remember that the reason you can do so is partially because of that offensive movie ""Birth of a Nation""."

It's length can be considered in itself a stepping stone in film-making. Being around three hours is quite an accomplishment for a film even by today's standards. The hand-tinting in the movie, particularly in the scenes of the home and the burning of Atlanta, the colors used (in this case, red and yellow) really heightened the dramatic feeling of that particular scene. The assassination of President Lincoln conveyed such a sense of realism (notice the term realism, not reality) that one would think that the whole event was real, and that there was a camera there at the time (sadly though, there was no camera to record the event). Overall, the movie is still a remarkable testament to the ability of the film crew and production company."

Griffith is definitely a southerner, and coming from that environment, back in those days, this is the story that he grew up hearing. He grew up amongst racists that convinced him that they had a good reason to do what they did.

","I've watched this while on a binge of silent-era films and I knew I would come to this film eventually. I expected the racist propaganda, but I was still a bit shocked by how overt it was. Regardless, I knew that it had been praised for its technical and artistic brilliance so I knew it was a must watch. Honestly, I was severely disappointed.<br/><br/>The characters are paper thin with little explanation of their motives. This is especially true of the antagonists such as Austin Stoneman and Silas Lynch, who seems to want to do what they do just because they are bad people who need mustaches to twirl. <br/><br/>The acting is also pretty atrocious, even making allowances for the theatrical nature of acting at the time. It sometimes looks like some actors are smiling or laughing while in peril or under attack and supposed to be showing fear and terror. <br/><br/>The story structure is also pretty poor and different events in the narrative seem to be very loosely connected. Large swaths of the film could have been removed in order to tell a better story. This is even true compared to contemporary films like Les Vampires, released in the same year. Pacing suffers, particularly in the first half of the film in which it languishes introducing characters that won't be relevant for another 2+ hours. <br/><br/>The themes are unclear or appear contradictory as well. Griffith's opening intertitles point out that the film is meant to show the horror of war, but the treatment of Ben Cameron's actions during the war are glorified and shown as heroic. Likewise, the final intervention of the KKK is shown as heroic and glamorous rather than horrifying, complete with trumpet fanfares. It's not subtle. Aside from that, there are several references to insidious plans and evil agendas of ""carpetbaggers and scalawags"" but it's never clear what those plans are or what makes them so insidious. I was left to assume that this evil agenda was equality between the races. In the final minutes of the film there's a reference to ""Aryan birthright"" without ever explaining what that birthright would be, leaving me to assume that Griffith meant White Supremacy.<br/><br/>My research has shown that the film is notable for it's advancements in cinematography, but it doesn't really show. Griffith has gotten credit for introducing intercutting, tracking shots, and close-ups but there are earlier examples of each, several more effective than Griffith's in this film. Intercutting, tracking shots, and close-ups were used in The Great Train Robbery in 1903. 1903 also had a famous example of a close-up in Little Doctor and the Sick Kitten. All of these techniques already existed.<br/><br/>Even aside from the horrific racist propaganda, it's just not a good film and there are much better films from the time period. For example, Buster Keaton's silent film The General features a Confederate soldier protagonist with clear motives, amazing shot composition, and a tight story."

","I resolved to watch ""The Birth of a Nation"" because of its contribution to cinema, but by the time I finished this three-hour epic, it was the last thing on my mind. I think people should watch this film, but not for that reason. After all, I could say that ""Traffic Crossing Leeds Bridge"" (1888) is a must-see for its contribution to cinema as the first real moving picture, but nobody's going to watch it.<br/><br/>No, what makes this film imperative is the thing that everyone remembers it for: its vile racism and bigotry. This is not your average Hollywood racism. This is not the black guy being the first to die in the horror movie, or the poor urban boy talking ebonics, or the trigger-happy man who's always armed. This is a blatant sermon against a class of people. This is an indictment of an entire race. This is D.W. Griffith saying: ""These people are animals. They are controlled by their base instincts and are incapable of governing themselves or treating others with respect.""<br/><br/>His claim: that the ""radical negro minority"" (a direct quote) is trying to usurp the white man's power and crush him under heel. The last half of the film is dedicated to showing how insidiously the black men try to wrest control from the oh-so-beleaguered white men. They are shifty-eyed and animalistic. The only black people portrayed in a good light are the very few former slaves that stay in league with their masters and refuse to vote for supporters of their own, and they are beaten up for it. But in the end the ""glorious"" Ku Klux Klan comes in and saves the day. One of the last shots in the movie shows the men in their full klan regalia on horses, lining up in front of the black peoples' houses on election day to discourage them from going to the polls. The black men, seeing this, go back inside and don't vote. And this is supposed to be part of the happy-ending epilogue!<br/><br/>I have never been so furious while watching a movie. I am not black. But I am gay, and the rhetoric leveled against the African Americans in this movie was SO similar to the rhetoric currently leveled against the LGBT community that it was actually scary. They both stir up a fear against the minority with claims that this ""radical"" and ""militant"" group of people is trying to take away the rights of the majority. They both present their minority in question as carnal beings devoid of conscience. Hell, ""Birth of a Nation"" even appeals to the Bible at the beginning. This is bigotry, pure and simple.<br/><br/>And that is why everyone should watch this movie, or at least know exactly what is has to say against black people. It is for this reason I give this movie a 10/10. Were this movie made today, I would give it a 1. As things stand, though, this kind of intolerance against black people in no longer accepted (though racism is far from dead; we still have a long way to go and a lot to answer for). But this kind of the intolerance still exists--against gays, against Muslims, and others. That is why we need to watch ""Birth of a Nation""--to see the bold face of this intolerance and feel the brutal injustice of it all."

Was Griffith indeed promoting his supposedly racist views, or was he merely depicting that period of time as an accurate, historical epic film? While I did find some of the scenes disturbing, I had to keep in mind that Griffith was born in Kentucky during the Civil War. Every where around him were the sad results that racism and bigotry brought forth. But to say that he was a racist because of the simple fact that he came from a very racially divided region, is not only wrong, but rather ignorant. Yes, white actors did indeed play Negroes in black face. Yes, he did portray blacks as ignorant, dirty and violent people. But keep in mind that the audience of films at that time were what we would call ""lower"" middle-class white male citizens. The upper class looked at film as a vile, sinful form of ""entertainment"". Therefor, I believe that Griffith was only trying to make a film that he knew people would go to. If he mad a film depicting blacks in a lighter, more forgiving way, no one would have watched it and we wouldn't be discussing it today, nearly a century later.<br/><br/>P.S.

"akash_sebastian","6","0","1","28 August 2015"," Milestone in filmmaking; Terrific first half, and a racist second.
","Hmm... So, where should I start? Before I deal with the plot and its aspects, let be clear that 'Birth of a Nation' is a milestone in cinematic storytelling; the scale of the production was the largest of its time, and the scope of its story, with the way it uses focusing, different-angled views and cross-cutting so dynamically to smoothen the flow of the story, is simply extraordinary. It showed what film could be and how effectively stories could be told through the medium.<br/><br/>So the film is a two-part three-hour epic, of which the first part (Civil War era) is truly terrific in every sense. The story, the history, the anti-war sentiment and the spectacular battlefield scenes, which are brilliant in scale, action and realism. Everything from the initial introduction of the lead characters to the assassination of President Lincoln, the first part is incredible and important, both as history of film and US. Actually, the first part itself can be seen as an entire film (90 minutes), and I could recommend it to any cinephile and be sure of their satisfaction.<br/><br/>But the second part (Reconstruction Era)... It's a deplorable chain of one racist scene after the other. I've always thought that movies dealing with history should represent the events in an impartial way, and liberty and imagination are applicable only when it comes to characters' personal lives. But here, the way the events are depicted and heroes are created, one would cringe or roll their eyes on almost every scene. But as Roger Ebert says about the film, ""As slavery is the great sin of America, so 'The Birth of a Nation' is Griffith's sin, for which he tried to atone all the rest of his life. If we are to see this film, we must see it all, and deal with it all."" And in many ways, he's right. The second part is important as well, historically, in understanding how Griffith and the majority of America thought about the whole thing, even in 1915. While making the film, he genuinely believed in those sentiments, and that's why he even adapted the book. he didn't think it was racist, and if he didn't believe that most people in his country thought this way, he wouldn't have made such a large scale epic. People got the spark they required and the second emergence of KKK occurred; it just goes to prove that he wasn't one of the few people who thought so.<br/><br/>After he became aware of the nature of his themes, he's been quite apologetic, and gave us a grand apology cum love letter in 'Intolerance'. So, despite all the racist views of the film's second half, Griffith's technical wizardry can't be ignored.<br/><br/>It's an 8 for the first part, and 4 for the second. So, that makes it a 6 (on 10) for the entire film."
"guisreis","3","0","5","24 August 2015"," One of the most openly racist movies ever made: it also brought bad technical consequences
","It could be only an important film in the history of motion pictures that had a too large extent, but it is something much worse: it is one of the most openly racist movies ever made. The ridiculous ""black"" makeup on white actors, the racist words such as ""negro"" and the caricature-like way black characters talk can be viewed since the beginning. Though, the second part of the film, about reconstruction after civil war, is the direst. While black representatives are portrayed as savages with no respect, as beastly cowards, whites are shown as poor victims of the majority. D. G. Griffith was a talented director and was able to make some cute or funny short scenes and beautifully filmed footage, besides his importance in the narrative innovation. Though, his social and political views are repulsive. In a country where black people did not have even de jure the same rights as the whites until some decades later, narrating history as if the role of the two races had been the reverse is simply dishonest. The same may be told about calling equal rights as ""vicious doctrines"", or calling Ku Kux Klan as ""the organization that saved the South from the anarchy of black rule"", or talking about ""defence of Aryan birthright"" (Nazi Germany has deserved so much concern in USA but a similar speech inside the country, although criticized, strangely does not seem to have called so much attention). The indefensible antipathy of the director for the legalization of inter-racial marriage is advocated through the confusion between marriage proposal and rape menace, racial prejudice and honor, and the ridiculous plot of a forced marriage attempt (some critics pledge not to make a confusion between politics and artistic work, but how to ignore the awful screenplay and makeup?). Don't worry, ""helpless"" white ""victims"" of the black ""mob"" ""abuse"" after the end of slavery: KKK masked vigilantes are there to save the day and ""make the negroes know their proper place"" in Grifitth's epic. Disgusting and unbearable."

Gish would go on to be a familiar face yet always being associated with this. Mae Marsh plays the suicide victim whose understanding of race has been corrupted by warped political views. Henry B. Waltthall plays the soldier who begins the Klan. He seeks revenge on who he perceives as the enemy without thought upon his own sin.

"vissini95","6","0","1","8 February 2015"," The birth of an art... and a racist propaganda.
","I watched The Birth of a Nation today, exactly one century after its original release. As a big movie fan I always considered this film to be the first real film, the first big example of cinema as an art and a form of entertainment. After watching the film, my view has been completely justified.<br/><br/>The film is the first ever to resemble a modern film, the first that the director is not just taking pictures and making them appear as being continuous, but is considering the artistic quality of his work with a similar way as a director of a play.The actors are starting to really act and not just posing for the camera and let the intertitles (remember,sound did not appear in films for over a decade after the film) explain the story.For the first time in film true sentiments such as love,passion and mourning are shown in a realistic way and techniques as making-up and editing a film also make their inaugural appearance. Furthermore, it is the first blockbuster,with a big production cost and much bigger box-office profit, as advertising and promoting the film was another first for the industry invented by director D.W. Griffith.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, on purpose or not, Griffith made another innovation. He showed how a film can be used as a propaganda tool and a way to send a message to the public,with the exact same way as the other arts do.But the message Mr.Griffith wanted to send,being a Southerner and a son of a Confederate soldier himself,was at least a despicable one,full of racism and hatred for the blacks and every man who believes in racial equality. Certainly a film director may alter history for better artistic quality, but in The Birth of a Nation the history of the US during the Civil War and Reconstruction Era is not altered; it's raped. The use of propaganda in this film is perfectly shown if you considered that it is partly responsible for the formation of an extremely dangerous Ku Klux Klan who used it for recruiting purposes as it shows the original KKK as heroic. Thus, Mr.Griffith is indirectly responsible for a great number of racial and hate crimes committed by the KKK in the next years. <br/><br/>In fact, I don't think there is any film in history more important for the industry as The Birth of a Nation, as techniques we now consider routine were invented by Griffith for this film. Thus, Griffith has to be given the credit of being ""the father of film making"" (as Charlie Chaplin described him) but his racist point of view, matched only by Nazi propaganda films 25 years later, means this film should not be held in high esteem for its content."
"jwvongoethe1800","3","0","4","19 August 2014"," Only two kinds of people like this movie: Fans of the early days of cinema, and KKK members.
","This movie drips almost as much racism than a propaganda film from Nazi- Germany. The book where this film is based of is called ""The Clansman: An Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan"". Everyone hates the KKK, but this movie is mostly known as a cinematic masterpiece, while it is nothing but KKK propaganda.<br/><br/>The movie takes place in the Confederate States during the American civil war, when a family is torn apart during the days of war. The first 15 minutes of the film is the only good part of the film, because it shows the effects of the war on ordinary family's. It even has an scene in which two brothers are in the opposite armies and meet each other on the battlefield and died together.Than came the Union army with his Negro soldiers acting as bandits, while murdering and rapping Innocent woman and children. And than the KKK comes to the rescue to save the South from the tyranny of black people.<br/><br/>Do you see why I did not like this movie. It is straight up KKK propaganda and depicts Afro-Americans as criminals and the KKK as heroes. The Negro's are all played by black-faced white actors. From a technical view is this film impressive with his open fields with hundreds of people in one scene, but the racism is all over the place.<br/><br/>For fans of cinema: It is worth a watch.

"tavm","5","0","2","11 February 2014"," D.W. Griffith's The Birth of a Nation is still great in epic scope, but awful in promoting race relations
","All right, after previously seeing this on VHS cassette back in the '90s, since it's Black History Month, I decided to again watch this on YouTube. My verdict: It's quite awesome seeing various filming techniques either invented or improved by director D.W. Griffith, not to mention his risk in making such a long movie (remember, many films of the time were usually shorts of either 10 or 20-minute length). And during the first part before the intermission, one gets involved in the saga of the two families-the Stonemans of the North and the Camerons of the South. And the Civil War battle scenes retain their awesome power though more close-ups would've helped. By the second part, however, which emphasizes the exaggeration of the way various blacks and northern ""Carpetbaggers"" ruined the Southern way of life and how the Ku Klux Klan ""saved"" them, one can't help constantly rolling eyes at the racist way one views those exaggerations including noticing how many of those ""blacks"" look obviously like Caucasions in burnt cork. I mean, how ridiculous does that scene with Walter Long-familiar to me because of his subsequent work as one of Laurel & Hardy's nemeses-as a buck named Gus chasing innocent Mae Marsh look now? And then there's the mulatto Silas Lynch character then going after another virginal heroine played by Lillian Gish. Oh, if you're willing to be manipulated, yeah, they're effective. But it's scenes like those that set back positive race relations back 50 years. As negative as those scenes are, they were probably a lightning rod for the NAACP to take action in taking positive steps in presentation of making their race look like a better round up of human beings for the most part. And because of the Klan's rejuvenation as a result of this film's success, the Civil Rights era of the '50s and '60s probably became possible because-having been used to being harassed constantly-African-Americans would eventually become effective with their non-violent methods not to mention making more intelligent arguments. So on that note, I recommend The Birth of a Nation with reservations. P.S. Looking at the cast list on Wikipedia, I found out one of the cast members was a woman named Madame Sul-Te-Wan. She's one African-American in this movie that would subsequently appear in other classics like the original King Kong and Carmen Jones."

I couldn't believe a society could be so sick that it would turn out an ARTIST warped enough to create The Birth of a Nation. And yet. I am something of a film buff and consider my knowledge of early cinema slightly above average, and this is the greatest silent film I've seen. I barely stirred for three silent hours. The film is the most artistically advanced I've ever seen. It's absolutely riveting and absolutely horrifying. In the words of Roger Ebert ""'The Birth of a Nation' is not a bad film because it argues for evil. Like Riefenstahl's 'The Triumph of the Will,' it is a great film that argues for evil. To understand how it does so is to learn a great deal about film, and even something about evil."" I couldn't agree more. Is it wrong to love this film? I don't think so.

It kept me interested in the story, which is quite an accomplishment, especially without the use of any spoken dialog whatsoever. Despite how despicable it's ideas are, it is a brilliantly told story of War, Reconstruction, and the men who set out to save their way of life. Love it or hate it, this was the first epic film, and the effort put into every last detail of it's immense scope is certainly something to be admired. It is a film which has been wrongly ignored and hidden from modern movie goers, who are, apparently, too sensitive to take the subject matter. The same can be said for the director, DW Griffith, who should rightly be a household name, but is instead unknown or forgotten to most people under the age of 70. So, it is what it is: A film to be watched and remembered by anyone who is fascinated by early cinema, and those who are interested in history, but do not wish to dwell on it."

"PWNYCNY","8","0","2","2 March 2012"," Epic movie with glaring flaws.
","This movie is actually two separate movies under one title, the first dealing with the Civil War itself and the second with Reconstruction. Also, the movie's title is misleading. The title should have been A Nation Reborn or A Nation Torn Asunder. Part 1 is vastly superior to part 2. Unlike part 2, part 1 of Birth of a Nation is powerful and compelling work of cinema. This movie lays out a coherent and plausible story involving two families who serve as metaphors for the North and South. Moreover,this movie effectively portrays the the carnage and chaos of war (e.g.,the sacking of Piedmont and the Cameron home; the intense battle scenes; the burning of Atlanta) and the loss suffered by the families in what is a senseless struggle (e.g., Mrs. Cameron losing two sons) as well as the graphic and historically accurate depiction of the assassination of Presdient Lincoln and the subsequent political consequences in terms of North-South relations. Also impressive was the acting of Lillian Gish, who plays Elsie Stoneman, and Josephine Crowell, who play Mrs. Cameron. Both give performances that epitomize what women were going through on the home fronts. There is nothing in this part of the movie that is corny or contrived. However, the movie goes off on a tangent in Part 2. The plot becomes contrived, highly melodramatic, and overtly racist, relying heavily on caricature to portray certain characters in a negative way. Blacks are portrayed in an openly offensive manner and the plot becomes muddled as the movie attempts to rewrite history. Nevertheless it still contains impressive elements: 1. Two outstanding actresses in principal roles: Lillian Gish and Mae Marsh. 2.Several spectacular exterior chase scenes. 3. Elaborate sets. 4. The story proceeds at a brisk pace, i.e., it's not boring. 5. There is an intermixing of close-up shots, wide-angle shots, and iris shots which depict the story from different perspectives. 6. The music is emotionally evocative (although at times unduly repetitive). 7. Extensive use of extras, especially in complex exterior shots. 8. Generally excellent acting (although at times stagy). 9. The cast includes African-Americans as extras (in a time when Jim Crowism was legal). It should also be noted that this movie was highly profitable, meaning that it is a product that resonated with the public and that was ranked number 44 on the AFI's list of the 100 best American movies (although it was subsequently removed from the list), meaning that the film industry itself had judged this movie to be worthy of positive recognition. However, primarily because of part 2, the movie in total ultimately fails as a work a drama. The slanted and myopic treatment of the causes of the Civil War shown in part 1and coupled with the hysterical portrayal of Reconstruction in part 2, makes the movie's story untenable and thereby undermines its strength as a drama. At best, this movie is an impressive antique of early movie making; at worst, a shameless attempt at historical revision and an appeal to racism.<br/><br/>One other point. The Birth of a Nation is an epic. If one buys into the movie's fundamental premise, that the Civil War was an unnecessary sectional conflict instigated by abolitionists and Northern politicians whose actions lacked political legitimacy and were therefore illegal, then the plot, including the depiction of the Ku Klux Klan and the overtly racist scenes, makes sense. Some aspects of the movie are excellent, e.g, Lillian Gish and Josephine Crowell's strong, commanding performances; the depictions of the battle scenes and the burning of Atlanta; Mrs. Cameron pleading for her son's life; Colonel Cameron's return home, and President Lincoln's assassination are especially compelling. One may disagree with the movie's political premise but it would be a difficult to summarily dismiss this movie as unworthy of serious consideration as a work of cinema."

","This silent drama directed by D.W. Griffith is regarded as one of the most controversial films of its time. The aggression of the KKK, American or not, is hard to handle, mostly because it's so true. However, if you look past the racism, into the film itself, it was very well made for its time. Griffith used a plot involving families who are separated by war, which is still a very popular idea used in many films today. Camera angle shots in the film were considered highly advanced film tactics for its time; for example the perch overlooking the valley during Sherman's march. When its all said and done, I think the American public should be satisfied that our culture as come so far since the Civil War era."

The way that Griffith made close up and far away shots by putting a circle around the people or scene that he was trying to make. The music all the way through the film also helped narrate the film and help explain what was going on or what was going to happen next by the change in music.The other thing that I saw helpful was the stage directions about what was happening or what was said during the scene. The beginning of the movie was a little slow up to the point just before the Civil War and then after that it moved along but became very graphic during the reconstruction part of the film.

"jerrytt","10","0","10","29 November 2010"," More truth than not!
","Firstly, I'd like to preface the following review with my honest opinion, than my honest evaluation: Any reference to accept an anti-black, Hispanic or Caucasian attitude would be totally wrong.<br/><br/>With that said, any idiot from the world (mostly, the northern Yankee) would not accept, understand or take the word of one who almost lived the life, but certainly lived within the Southern boundary below the Mason-Dixon line. It cannot be done, never having walked in the shoes of those who have.<br/><br/>Regarding reference to blacks: There are some respectable black people who deserve recognition for living respectable lives after the civil war. That's why I call them respectable blacks and never negative, insulting terms or remarks. They deserve my praise.<br/><br/>In the movie, exaggeration is not only privy to the Negroes within the movie, because Caucasians are also exaggerated in their actions and the reasons for their retaliation.<br/><br/>In America, post-civil war lives were raped in more than one manner; that being physically, mentally, and economically by NORTHERN and Westerners who wanted Southerners to receive punitive actions for wanting sovernty and states rights within their boundaries. Slavey was a small part of it, being there were only a small portion of people who owned plantations and slaves. Read the facts.<br/><br/>Everyone knows that if you punish the perpetrator of actions deemed by society (northern) as either illegal or immoral, there will be the physicals principle of retaliation: for any one action, there is a reaction. Therefore, it's seen in the penal system, the society of ""socialists"" who wish everyone to be ""owned by the government"" in another form of slavery--that being society is minimized into an ownership role by any socialist/communist-based government wanting to rule a life and steal his/her liberty.<br/><br/>That's what happened to the South before, during and especially post-civil war days of ""raping the land, the people and their states rights"". Placing instead, puppets to rule the punished, confiscate all that was owned and give it to others less deserving (sound familiar to today's government under Obama and the socialists in office?). It's called the ""Robbing Hood phenomena"". Take from everyone else to ""distribute the wealth"" (the socialist system).<br/><br/>The KKK was formed to protect their lives,their property, their trampled states rights, their sovereign states government, their loved ones and their fortunes. It's the reaction to a that despicable action deemed forced upon the southerners who were now suppressed/oppressed post civil-war. Today, it would be black and Hispanic gangs who do the same in gangs that the government feel would ""kill themselves"" in their action (nullification). What??? This movie, yes, was an exaggeration as any movie I've seen these past 50 years. Hollywood has that effect in their movies to influence others in a negative light rather than better moral ones that don't need the raping, the killing, the torturing, and in effect--helps guide the mindless into following into a lifestyle which eliminates God, goodness, and in a positive light. Because of that, crime is enhanced to be glorified while goodness is condemned as corny or out of today's reality. Those who view the trash have embraced the lifestyle of immorality, homicide, sex, drugs, etc. as the right thing to do because it feels good.<br/><br/>This movie, is straight on.

","I've heard about this moving for years, but finally had a chance to record and see it on TCM. Robert Osborne said that it is still considered the most controversial movies ever made in the U.S.<br/><br/>I can see why. This is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen. For flick made in 1915, it scene creation, action and special effects are amazing. The battle scene toward the end of the war, the battle of Petersberg I believe, is one of the best, very likely the most accurate presentation of Civil War hand-to-hand combat ever done.<br/><br/>The second half, reconstruction, is disturbing to say the least. The treatment of blacks and the presentation of the KKK takes you aback.<br/><br/>The only real disappointment is the sappy ending.<br/><br/>Everyone should see this movie at least once. I had planned on doing that very thing, but now am convinced I should get a copy. I will watch this again."

","So I'm not really into history however this movie helped me understand this time period way better than I have ever learned it in school or read out of a text book. From the battles to the guerrillas revenge to the death of Mr. Abraham Lincoln. Speaking of the president one thing I found funny was that the scene of him in the theater was the exact same one from the movie ""The Gold Rush"" it was like it was copied and pasted from one movie to the other. Another thing I'm curious to know is if people during this time were really as scary as they look in the movie or if its just because of the fact that its a black and white film. I'm not sure if there was makeup back then or if the bags under the actors eyes are just because they were tired. I mean seriously the guy who plays the presidents looks so scary; even some of the African Americans don't look real, they look like their skin was painted. On a positive note the background music to this movie was more entertaining because its a bunch of different instruments instead of just piano."

","Back when there was no internet or breast augs or Conan O'Brien, people got their entertainment by watching the first moving pictures. D.W. Griffiths's THE BIRTH OF A NATION is one such ""movie."" Nearly a century after its release (1915) it stands today on the horns of a grand dichotomy: that of being a pioneering film - and a racist piece of poop. <br/><br/>Griffiths lifted the story from a play and a novel, both written by white supremacist and reverend (no contradiction there!) Thomas F. Dixon Jr. - The Clansman and The Leopard's Spots.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF A NATION comes in two segments, the first dealing with the friendship between a family from the North and a family from the South, and how the Civil War forces them to take opposing sides; the tragedy reaches its zenith when the two families' sons meet bayonet to bayonet on the battlefield. <br/><br/>The second half of BIRTH deals with Reconstruction - and the magnificence of the Ku Klux Klan in keeping African Americans at bay as they were on the verge of taking over White Civilization. No kidding!<br/><br/>With BIRTH's historical place in filmdom is pretty much unassailable, it is hard to rail against this progenitor of today's trillion dollar industry. It is a massive achievement - there are epic battle scenes, split screens, process shots, special effects (tinting the filmstock) and cutaways (a brave new technique) - D.W. Griffiths showing the industry the heights that film ""making"" could scale. On the other hand, whenever a movie promotes hypocrisy, ignorance or wrongheadedness, the movie rates low, because it misuses a great artistic tool to further idiocy. <br/><br/>And BIRTH's second half is freakishly hypocritical, provincially ignorant and overwhelmingly wrongheaded. <br/><br/>Movie is ""bad"" because ignorance and hypocritical Christianity are held up as sanctimoniously right. The last frames show the Ku Klux Klan not allowing blacks to vote at gunpoint, and then an overlay of Jesus with a fake beard overseeing a town of frolicking people - frolicking WHITE people - a text overlay blurting, ""Dare we dream of a day when the Prince of Brotherly Love shall rule."" Uh, over just us Whiteys, of course. <br/><br/>After the Civil War, a subplot grows to fruition - Silas Lynch, a mulatto (a white guy face-painted in Light Darkie - it just keeps getting worse, don't it?), starts a black congress, which immediately starts acting like Whitey thinks a black congress would act - boozing and arguing, with their shoeless feet up on the tables, making laws that Whitey should salute them and that they pass the right to intermarry... It's all patently ridiculous - yet here it is, in a motion picture of the time.<br/><br/>When I heard THE BIRTH OF A NATION was racist, I thought, ""How bad can it possibly be?"" This black congress is reprehensible, but I've seen worse. Remember those Shirley Temple movies?! Well, think of the most racist thing you can think of - say, Rush Limbaugh - and then multiply by the Ku Klux Klan. Add Glenn Beck. Stir.<br/><br/>Then it gets REALLY racist - as blacks overrun the town, vandalizing and chasing white women in uncontrolled bestial lust (which the sophisticated Christian whites would *never* do!), and one of the young milky-faced stars from the first half of the film (the one they call ""Little Colonel"" - pertaining to his white manhood, mayhaps?) gets the idea to form the Ku Klux Klan... with white man-hoods... Black soldier Gus (Walter Long - another white guy in blackface) pursues one of the virginal white chicks until she jumps off a cliff rather than be molested by him. Gus is executed by the Klan, beginning a race war. <br/><br/>And then - the Hero Shots. As the whole town is ransacked by blacks (and white guys in blackface), Little Colonel rounds up Klan members and rides thousands strong like the Cavalry coming to the rescue. The Ku Klux Klan is unequivocally the hero - there is no gray area, it IS all black... and uh, white. <br/><br/>These guys are so serious, even their horses are covered in white sheets! There are literally thousands of white-sheeted Klanfolk, all gutlessly bedecked in their hoods, which in those times were white helmets with long spikes on top - in another of those great scenes that Griffiths sets up, but for the promotion of ignorance! I've never seen so much amassed redneck in one place. Except maybe a Lynyrd Skynyrd concert. <br/><br/>Lillian Gish is probably the only actress worth mentioning here. She plays a girl who at first hated Little Colonel for his involvement with the Klan. But she is not displaying ethics; it is only a character trait so she can arc to loving him when he saves her in his sheet. Also proving the utility of being a Klan member - chicks dig it. <br/><br/>After the rousing parade of Klansmen through cheering city streets, we dissolve to the next election, where we see blacks coming out of their homes and being greeted by armed Klansmen on horseback with guns drawn to stop them from voting. In that great American tradition of: One White Man - One vote. <br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF A NATION is the closest thing to an Emmett Brown time machine; a window not just on how people used to live, but the intellectualism of the time, and also the stunted attitudes of ""All men created equal - except black people."" <br/><br/>If this is THE BIRTH OF A NATION, I want an abortion."
"jt-hix2112","7","0","3","3 February 2010"," Disturbing yet entertaining
","This is one of the most controversial movies I have ever seen. There's a lot of hype over it as being extremely racist and boy did it deliver in that regard. Really the best way to look at this film is to view it as how some people thought of the Civil War and Reconstruction in the early 20th century. Many people bash DW Griffith for being a racist, yet I've heard he was shocked that so many people were offended by his film. I prefer not to be quite as hard on him – he's a product of the times. Yeah he's a racist, but a lot of people were that way. He wasn't trying to be offensive. Woodrow Wilson, a progressive reformer, loved this movie. Go figure, it's just the way America was. That doesn't make it right or make this film not racist, it's just a good look at how people thought.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie was entertaining. The battle scenes and ending (once you get past the shocking fact that the KKK is the heroic force) was exciting to watch and I especially enjoyed the portrayal of Lincoln's assassination, it was very dramatic. The story is quite complex for 1915 and the film should be commended for this. Seeing the KKK portrayed in a positive light is quite hard to stomach. Both images of the Klan and the way black Americans are presented are disturbing for a modern audience. At times it is so ridiculous and offensive, it's just funny.<br/><br/>Watch this for its historical impact on cinema, its interesting story, its shock value (for the modern audience), or for its look into American society in 1915."

","To me, the racially controversial 1915 silent film, ""The Birth of a Nation"" was nothing more than an opportunity to get some well needed shut eye. From the length of the movie, to the lagging music, it just wasn't doing it for me. Despite my personal opinion, there were some positive things to take from the film. I did appreciate the filming techniques that were used, for example the usage of cellophane to add color to the screen. This was a big deal, especially for the time it was made. Also, the scene in which Abraham Lincoln was shot was pretty intense. All in all I give ""The Birth of a Nation"" 1 out of 6 chicken nuggets."
"DieHardWasntThatGood","3","0","2","22 September 2009"," Meh.
","I really couldn't get into this movie. In fact, I fell asleep for a few minutes about every 20 minutes. I really enjoyed their use of red cellophane paper. It really added a grisly feel to the ""action"". I do not recommend this film to anyone with narcolepsy. I am not really interested in history and historical films, so I will seldom refer to The Birth of a Nation in any regard, forevermore. The most memorable scene, however, was the assassination of former President Abraham Lincoln. A powerful event in American history captured for the first time on film? Nice. The music was definitely a nice touch, though. The superb use of the score during the changes from scene to scene, from action shot to action shot, I was blown away."

","This movie was difficult to follow. Not so much the plot and the clearly racist themes but the character development. Some of the mannerisms and body language of the characters were odd, perhaps because of the age of the film. I haven't watched many silent films, either. While the second part is clearly disturbing, I found it more compelling than the first part. The mention of the Aryan birthright angered me. The action and battle scenes were amazing for the period in which it was made. I thought the use of color was a good way to change the mood of the scene. It felt a little like Gone with the Wind. The interspersing love story was a bit strange."

","Short and painful, Once I thought this was the most perfect movie ever, in ways I still do, however after reading Movies And Methods II, a critical approach would be to mull over all the images until up to the Klan Race and then switch over to the even more spectacular entangled web of magic presented by Oscar Micheaux in his Within Our Gates, which in many ways out guns the original. Although I once thought Godfather was in a way racist, I am learning the value of changing metaphors, which means it isn't at all, in it's own way. So take this as an abstract and seek further reviews of this film in Entertainment Today, although even a movie like Big Momma's House, Fahrenheit 451, and Salman Rushdie's Satanic Verses (which I feel that I have in some way also slammed for no reason except hubris, now deserves a place, in my new non-hierarchical approach to cinema enthusiasm.) --Peace out, Aaron Sheley"
"ignatz928","6","0","3","16 June 2005"," One of the most controversial films of all time
","This 1914 D.W. Griffith historical epic is a legendary film, both for it's (according to film scholars, at least) pioneering use of narrative techniques and for its glorification of the Ku Klux Klan. It is often credited for defining the ""grammar"" by which filmmakers tell stories, and for encouraging a resurgence in the KKK. It's often referred to in reviews as a disturbing masterpiece. To me, on the other, the movie seemed more like a disturbing relic of history, impressive at times but generally more interesting as a piece of history than as an actual story. Perhaps the blame lies with the print's inevitably less-than-pristine condition, but I doubt it. Gone With the Wind, which covers similar ground, may not have been as innovative as Birth of a Nation, but it stands up much better now, even leaving aside the question of racism. Birth of a Nation isn't a bad movie, aside from the racism, but it's also not anything special. The movie first runs into problems in its first half when it attempts to integrate history with drama. Actually, there isn't much of an attempt to combine the fictional story with historical reenactments, at least not until the second half. Griffith just cuts from recreations of famous incidents (Sherman's March, the burning of Atlanta, Grant and Lee at Appomattox) to the fictional characters in unidentified battles. The battle scenes seem to have been a big deal at the time, but, for the most part, I didn't find them to be especially impressive, since the sequences consist mostly of long shots of puffs of white smokes. The second half, which is what has gotten the movie into hot water, at least works better as a story and has more of a focus. The chase and rescue at the end doesn't seem that innovative anymore, but it is still exciting- assuming, of course, that you can overlook what's actually going on in the scene."

","or how sore losers stain the birth of a nation. Putting aside the controversy for a moment, this is an overly long early exercise in what movies could be. Important in that it accomplished many firsts in filmdom, this movie deserves respect. It may be the first epic. The sad fact is that it has not aged as well as it could have. It is boring and melodramatic in places. There is even an obvious use of the same piece of footage several times during a battle. If this movie was remade shot for shot today, it would not be very critically or commercially successful, although it is not a bad movie. The story is OK, the acting, primitive as it is, is good, and the entire production has credibility. The major flaw is making the KKK the protagonist. Their ideals, their methods, and their actions are repugnant. The KKK made a stain on the south and the nation as a whole that remains today. Nobody, except those in the KKK, will feel anything for them. It is important however to remember that not every southerner is in KKK and that this movie should not be condemned for using them in it's story."

Unfortunatley most of the people who have put a comment up here are ignorant racists who can't possibly give a real reason why they would like this movie other than it portrayed them as the heroes.
