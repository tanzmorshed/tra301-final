"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","255","280","31 October 2003"," One of my favorite movies of all time!
","Seriously, I know that sounds stupid as this is an animated movie, but why can't we have a favorite movie that's animated? If you ask me this is Disney's best animated film of all time. Why do you ask? The animation is just beautiful, the story is powerful and moving, the characters are terrific, the villain is one of Disney's most monstrous and the songs are out of this world incredible! Not only is it my favorite animated movie, this is one of my favorite soundtracks, with the strong power of Elton John The Lion King is absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to watch still to this day. I have to say also that this story is just so beautiful, it's still one of the movies that will always bring a tear to my eye. When I was 17 years old, I begged my dad to take me to the re-release of The Lion King, him and I being the only adults besides the parents who took their children to see the movie, Simba's father dies and I started balling! My dad looks around and said ""Krissy, stop it!"" and I just said ""But it's so saaaaad! Simba's daddy!"", yes I'm a sap, I can't help it, this is a powerful movie.<br/><br/>In the Pride Lands, Rafiki, a wise old monkey, anoints Simba, the newborn cub of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, and presents him to a gathering of animals at Pride Rock. Taking advantage of the cub's naive nature, Simba's scheming uncle Scar, who is very angry because Simba's birth means that he's no longer next in line to the throne tells him about the elephant graveyard, a place where Mufasa has forbidden Simba to go. Simba asks his mother if he can go to the water-hole with his best friend, Nala, but they go to the graveyard instead. There, the cubs are met by Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, 3 hyenas who try to kill them, but they are rescued by Mufasa. But Scar doesn't give up there, he lures Simba into a gorge for a ""surprise from his father"" while the hyenas create a wildebeest stampede. Alerted by Scar, Mufasa races to rescue Simba from the stampede. He saves his son but is left clinging to the edge of a steep cliff. Scar flings his brother into the stampede below. Simba sees his father fall and rushes down the cliff after him, only to find him dead. Scar convinces Simba that he was responsible for his father's death and recommends that he runs away from the Pride Lands to avoid punishment. In a distant desert, Simba is found unconscious by Timon and Pumbaa, a duo who adopt and raise the cub under their worry-free philosophy, Hakuna Matata. When Simba has grown into an adult he is discovered by Nala, who tells him that Scar, through his irresponsibility, has turned the Pride Lands into a barren wasteland. She asks Simba to return and take his place as king but Simba refuses, still believing he caused his father's death. Rafiki arrives and persuades Simba to return to the Pride Lands, and face Scar once and for all.<br/><br/>I know that still that Beauty and the Beast is the only animated film to get a best picture nomination, but I don't understand why The Lion King didn't get the same treatment. I adore this film with such a passion, I will always defend it to the high end. I still watch this movie, ever since it's theatrical release in 1994, I still sing, dance, and rehears the lines back and forth. How could you not at least with Hakuna Matata? Timon is my idol, he's so care free, funny, and awesome during his drag hula scene ""Luau! If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat, eat my buddy Pumbaa here, 'cause he's a tasty treat come on down and dine, on this tasty swine, all you gotta is get in line, are you achin',? For some bacon? He's a big pig. You can be a big pig, too. Oy! Ahhhh!"", best scene ever in film history! OK, not in history, but one of my favorites, it always has me on the floor laughing till my stomach hurts. If you seriously haven't seen this movie, see it! Who said that animated movies can't be true art? The Lion King is a fantastic film and deserves all it's praise and more.<br/><br/>10/10"

"Maintenance_Guys","Null","140","162","7 August 2006"," This is what kid's movies should be like...
","I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it. I believe that everybody should see this movie, regardless of your age. It may just be the last good movie that Disney will ever do without the help of Pixar."

","The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! My personal favorite character is Rafiki, the Baboon! I still cant forget the line he says to Simbe, ""Past can hurt, but as I see it, you can either run from it, or learn from it!"" it is so true! i loved Zazu's weirdness, and shenzi's humor, above all, i loved Pumba's innocence and Timon's intelligence! In short, i found the film the best film ever... The voice cast is also great. Mathew did complete justice to Simba, and what can I say about Mufasa, He is the best King, and dad anyone can ever get! The movie is not meant for kids, its meant to teach every adult a lesson...to find our place in the great ""Circle Of Life"". I give this film a perfect 10."

"Special-K88","Null","89","107","14 March 2002"," simply a wonderful, heartfelt tale for all ages
","Delightful animated feature from Walt Disney Pictures about a naive young lion cub destined for greatness. Born the son of a beloved and authoritative king he's groomed to be the next ruler of the kingdom, but along the way he encounters tragic detours at the hands of his villainous uncle and scheming hyena henchmen. Years later—as an adult—he decides to embrace his destiny and take his proper place in the Circle of Life. Warm, intelligent, laugh-out loud funny film is a triumph in every aspect; unforgettable songs, snappy dialogue, remarkable animation, and a stellar cast of voices make this a treat for all ages.

"suicune_tudor","10","199","253","28 November 2005"," A living masterpiece
","This is truly one of the best Disney movies ever. I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again. I simply LOOOOVED the music. It's one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard. And, speaking of soundtrack, I just can't tell in words how much I love the song ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"". Is one of my favorite songs ever. I truly believe that this motion picture could easily be nominated for The Best Picture, but The Best Song and the Best Original Score is really enough. I wonder if they will ever think to make a prequel of this movie in order to understand who is Mufasa, Scar, Sarabi and the other characters. In short, this movie will be remembered in the next 100 years. Truly."
"chadgeri","10","120","152","22 April 2002"," By far, the greatest Disney movie ever made...
","This movie is, quite seriously, the Citizen Kane of Disney animation. Every animated movie from Disney ever since has been a failed attempt to recreate the masterpiece that this film is. This movie is an anomaly in a market usually dominated by formulaic kiddie-fare. Unlike most films from animation studios, this movie will enthrall you, whether you're 5 years old, or 50. An epic plot, intriguing characters, great music and hillarious moments make this film a family classic that will endure through the ages. 10/10"
"kaydrelia","10","24","28","21 July 2019"," Masterpiece, the new one doesnt compare
","Watched the new one, and I think I had a disgusted look on my face the entire time. The music, the visuals, the dialogue, the voice acting, etc. Rewatched this one and remembered why this was my favorite Disney movie growing up. From mufasa's death to the goofy hyenas, to the bond between rafiki, simba and mufasa. The music that everyone knows every word to, and scar's ability to deliver each line perfectly. This movie is magic, the new one seems to tech focused and forgot what made lion king so beloved to begin with, its unfortunate. Hoping the circle of life makes it way around and the end of remakes draws close (see what I did there lol). Until then, lion king from the 90s will stay on my shelf and my kids will watch with me. This new one will never end up in my cart and I wont confuse my kids by watching it either. Thank you 90s Disney for the magic!"
"movieguy1021","9","116","153","28 December 2002"," The Lion King: 9/10
","Released Christmas Day in 2002 to IMAX and large format screens, The Lion King makes a triumphant return to the screen after eight years. Its every bit as majestic and great as it has been before.<br/><br/>The Lion King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) just had a baby cub named Simba. All of the animals come to the ceremony, except for Mufasa's brother Scar (Jeremy Irons). Scar desperately wants to be King, but can't. As long as Mufasa and Simba are there. Soon Simba is able to walk and talk and is voiced by Jonathon Taylor Thomas. After hearing about an elephant graveyard from Scar, he and his friend Nala (Niketa Calame) visit it. They meet three bumbling hyenas: Banzai (Cheech Marin), Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), and Ed (Jim Cummings), but they manage to leave unhurt. Scar is upset that the hyenas didn't do the job, so he orders a stampede to wipe out both of them, but it only takes care of Mufasa. Scar convinces Simba that he killed Mufasa, not Scar. So Simba flees into exile.<br/><br/>The Lion King really benefits from the larger screen. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more, and you can really savor the animation. Disney didn't need any humans, so they could spend all of the time on a great story and lush landscapes. In fact, its camera movement was so majestic that you actually felt like you were part of the pride of lions.<br/><br/>The music boomed and really created the atmosphere. Although I had seen this picture before, I still was tense because of the way the music played out. Most of the time, I would just roll my eyes at the attempt to make me nervous. But Hans Zimmer's music really bowled me over and made my heart do calisthenics. Unlike such new Disney pics like Lilo and Stitch, the songs actually did some good. They took you out of a somewhat dreary mood and put a smile on your face and made your feet want to tap along. There were only a few, but they were very entertaining. And the Circle of Life song at the beginning was beautiful, with its perfect pictures and perfect sound.<br/><br/>I really like James Earl Jones (he's pretty diverse), and this time was no exception. He seemed to act like he didn't want to do this role, but he couldn't contain his excitement for wanting to do voice-overs again (he had done some work in The Simpsons before). Matthew Broderick redeemed himself for me (after the atrocious Ferris Bueller's Day Off) by showing a strong voicing as the adult Simba. Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg, and Jim Cummings really had good chemistry together, even though they didn't have much screen time. Irons was really good and creepy as Scar (one of those who you can't help but hate), and if that is him really singing, brava!<br/><br/>Be warned, The Lion King isn't really for youngsters. It had intense thematic elements that should have warranted a PG, instead of those that don't deserve it (Lilo and Stitch, again). The mood that the music and the script brought out could damper your day, so be warned.<br/><br/>This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say `haha, he's dead', you say `Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made.<br/><br/>The Lion King is a majestic movie, not without humor, that is for almost all to see.<br/><br/>My rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Rated G for intense thematic elements."

","""The best movie I ever watched in any form or any in language"".<br/><br/>No, I am not exaggerating! It is the best movie ever, whether in human form or in animated. I can't find a single flaw in The Lion King (1994). Someone could argue that the story is not original, Disney just twisted it. Someone could also argue that i didn't watch that much of movies to judge ""The Best Ever"" but as I said, this the best movie I ever saw. The story is nice and free flowing and without any unnecessary bumpers. One can not recognized the voices behind the characters, because the characters are so prominent. Music! Let me say I am not very fond of English pop songs, but I could hum almost most of the songs of this movie, so I would say, music is that nice. Animation is superb, landscapes are eye catching, dialogues are sharp and comedy is at its best. What more might I say?<br/><br/>Beside everything, you can say how crazy I am about this movie by my name. <br/><br/>Enjoy the movie, don't leave the seat. Hakuna Matata!"

"Dontcallmekeys","10","27","34","21 July 2005"," A Timeless Film
","Ah...""The Lion King."" There's so much I can say about this movie but all my comments always come down to one thing: this movie is beautiful. Pure genius. A timeless story. I might be a little biased in my beliefs, seeing as the first movie I remember seeing in theatres is ""The Lion King"" and I still watch it on a regular basis and know all the words but I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who agree with what I have to say. ""The Lion King"" is beautiful; hands down, it is the best Disney film ever created.<br/><br/>The story is something that everyone can relate to, whether they are a lion ;) or not. Simba is destined to become king one day and just can't wait to rule the throne; everyone can relate to wanting to grow up and become an adult, to do whatever they want and not have to worry about anything. His father tries to teach him that, despite the fact that he will one day be grown and king, his life will not be easy. Simba has to learn his lesson the hard way when his Uncle Scar, who, too, wants the throne, kills his father and convinces Simba that it was his fault. Suddenly, growing up doesn't seem so great anymore (I can *really* relate to that).<br/><br/>And so, Simba flees his home and comes across Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts. They teach Simba the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, something that idealizes a life free of stress, worry and responsibility. Now, don't we all wish we could live this way? No worries for the rest of our days... But when Simba's childhood friend Nala returns, he realizes that he can't live Hakuna Matata forever, for he does have a responsibility to his pride and his homeland. Simba understands that he must grow up, as we all do, and does what's right.<br/><br/>The songs are catchy and fit the movie well (the original songs, of course, though ""The Morning Report"" isn't too bad) and the score is haunting and beautiful. Along with the art work, the music captures the heart of Africa.<br/><br/>With the types of shows that children watch these days (boy, doesn't that make me sound old?), it's a wonder they'll learn in virtues and values at all. ""The Lion King"" is a great teacher when it comes to learning lessons that will carry throughout their lifetime. ""The Lion King"" teaches children that it's all right to be a kid but you must understand and accept responsibility for things you can and cannot control. Everyone has a place in The Circle of Life and we must find it; the film also teaches that we will encounter bad and even terrible things during our lifetime but we must accept them and move on. These are important, meaningful lessons; heck, I even used them in my SAT essay! ""The Lion King"" is a film for every generation and is a powerful film that all children should see. I'm past my childhood now and I still watch it whenever I get the chance; I look forward to sharing it with my children.<br/><br/>A timeless film!"
"svenshinhan","10","32","43","6 June 2005"," Even after 11 Years, it's still the King.
","I first saw The Lion King in 1994, when I was 8 years old. Ever since then, I have seen it at least 100 times. I have seen it at least that much because I watched it once every week for almost a year and a half.<br/><br/>Recently, I became interested in it again, after having seen The Lion King 3 (or 1,5 if you prefer). It kind of surprised me how I was still intrigued and impressed by the whole thing. It was a magical experience that was almost as good as the very first time (I hadn't seen it in years).<br/><br/>Everything about The Lion King is so good, that I can watch it over and over again, just like in the old days. The story begins light-hearted and it has a very nice and fun atmosphere. Very stereotypical characters, as always with Disney, but ever so unique in their own way. As the story progresses, it gets very serious, dramatic and sad as well, I actually cried when I saw it the first time (hey, I was 8, give me a break).<br/><br/>Then two of the greatest characters in the history of Disney cartoons get introduced. Timon & Pumbaa set a new height considering comedy in cartoons. Again, very stereotypical, but unique in their own way (I loved Lion King 3 because of them).<br/><br/>Another thing I absolutely love about this is the awesome music in it. When I was young I didn't pay attention to it as much as I do now, but the music adds so much to the whole movie.<br/><br/>It was very obvious, even from just the intro alone, that Disney worked very hard on this masterpiece. I will definitely never forget The Lion King. I still watch it occasionally and I've never been bored.<br/><br/>That's another thing I like about this: the songs. Every major Disney picture has a few songs in it and most of the time they are very memorable. It's the same story here, the songs are very memorable and overall just brilliant. ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can't Wait to be King"" will always have a special place in my heart.<br/><br/>I knew the entire script of the Dutch dubbed version when I was young, having seen it so many times. Kind of pathetic, I know, but I liked it that much. Still do.<br/><br/>The King among Disney Cartoons for me."
"MaPMoT","10","11","13","8 September 2013"," They don't make movies like that anymore
","That was the first movie I've ever watched in a cinema. I was a kid and I remember crying while watching - I was in love with the characters and I was feeling them. They felt so real to me. Now... actually, as a grown person, now is the same. Characters are so believable and so realistic. Watching the movie as an adult brings a whole new meaning. The good and the bad characters from the movie are like the people I meet everyday in real life. The story is full of morals which I think are really important for young kids these days. I think that The Lion King is a must for every child and adult! With it's characters and plot, it can really move you and the kids might actually learn something from it. It is far better than modern cartoons full of meaningless action and dialogue."

"moviesleuth2","10","18","24","9 August 2009"," A dazzling, joyous piece of film-making
","Of all the animation classics from the Walt Disney Company, there is perhaps none that is more celebrated than ""The Lion King."" Its acclaim is understandable: this is quite simply a glorious work of art.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" gets off to a fantastic start. The film's opening number, ""The Circle of Life,"" is outstanding. The song lasts for about four minutes, but from the first sound, the audience is floored. Not even National Geographic can capture something this beautiful and dramatic. Not only is this easily the greatest moment in film animation, this is one of the greatest sequences in film history.<br/><br/>The story that follows is not as majestic, but the film has to tell a story. Actually, the rest of the film holds up quite well. The story takes place in Africa, where the lions rule. Their king, Mufasa (James Earl Jones) has just been blessed with a son, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas), who goes in front of his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) as next in line for the throne. Scar is furious, and sets in motion plans to usurp the throne for himself. After a tragedy occurs and Mufasa is killed, Scar persuades Simba to flee, leaving himself as king. Simba grows up in exile, but he learns that while he can run away from his past, he can never escape it.<br/><br/>When viewing the film, it is obvious that ""The Lion King"" is quite different from its predecessors (and successors). This is an epic story that contains more dramatic power than all the other Disney films combined. While there are definitely some light-hearted moments, there is no denying the dark drama that takes up the bulk of the story. While it could be argued that Disney is the champion of family entertainment, this film is not for the very young. Some of the sequences are very dark and violent, many bordering on frightening, even for the older crowd.<br/><br/>The voice actors are terrific. Jonathan Taylor Thomas brings a large dose of innocence to Young Simba. He's mischievous, but also terribly naive. His older counterpart, voiced by Matthew Broderick, equals him. He's older, but no less mature. The voices are so similar that it's almost impossible not to believe that they are the same character at different ages. Perhaps no one could have been better suited for the role of Mufasa than James Earl Jones. His baritone voice gives the Mufasa a quality of great power and wisdom; there is no question that his role is king. As Scar, Jeremy Irons is pitch-perfect. The drawing of the character is villainous, but Irons' vocal work complements the animation to create one of the most memorable, and vicious, villains in Disney history. He's unquestionably evil, but he's also clever, which makes him all the more dangerous. Manipulation, not violence is his greatest weapon. Providing some much needed comic relief are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon and Pumbaa, two other outcasts (a meerkat and a warthog), and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. While there is definite fun from these characters, neither the actors nor the filmmakers allow them to go over-the-top and destroy the mood of the film.<br/><br/>Disney's animated features are known for their gorgeous artwork. Nowhere is this more apparent than in ""The Lion King."" Every single frame is jaw-dropping. The colors are rich, and the drawings are sharp and beautiful. One of the pitfalls of animation (both computer and hand-drawn) is that there is sometimes a visible distance between the subject and the background, making it seem as if the figure animation was cut and pasted on the background (this is obviously what happens, but it is up to the artists to make sure that it isn't noticeable). There is none of that here.<br/><br/>Throughout the Golden Age of Disney animation, the films have been musicals. ""The Lion King"" is no different, and the songs are brilliant. All of the numbers are standouts (""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" won the Oscar, but in my opinion, ""The Circle of Life"" was better). In the cases of Simba and Nala (Simba's girlfriend), both young and old, there is a noticeable difference between the speaking and singing parts (everyone else does their own singing and speaking), but never mind. It still works, and that's what's important.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" is not flawless, but on first viewing, they aren't noticeable, and it is likely that the young won't ever notice them. ""Beauty and the Beast"" was the first animated film to get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture (it lost to ""The Silence of the Lambs""), and is thus far the only animated film to receive such an honor. That being the case, it's hard to understand why ""The Lion King"" was not given the same distinction. The two films are more or less equal in quality, and the nominees for the honor that year were not strong.<br/><br/>If you haven't already, see ""The Lion King."" You won't be disappointed."

","The Lion King is not just my favourite animated movie, its one of my favourite movies in its own right. The animation was amazing, and captured the essences of the Savannah brilliantly. The story and plot was one which people of all ages, not just children, could follow and understand, an impressive achievement for an animated movie, one scene in particular wouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, no matter what age the viewer may be, such was its emotional power. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen, particularly James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons, and of course Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella, who at times were flat out hilarious as Timon and Pumba. The music and songs didn't disrupt the scenes they were in, if anything they added to it, particularly the opening song The Circle Of Life which was the best opening to an animated movie I've seen so far. Some have criticized the portrayal of certain animals like the hyena's and the movie doesn't depict life on the plains accurately, well the correct response to that is, its only a story and it isn't meant to as its not a nature documentary. This is a timeless classic which will never age, the fact that it took twenty years for another animated movie to overtake it as the highest-grossing animated movie is a testament to just how brilliant this movie is. A classic which all the family will enjoy."

Surely this is even more traumatic than the death of Bambi's mother. And yet, I have to rank this as one of Disney's very best--the color, design, characterizations,and music are all superb. The use of earth tones, so different from Disney's usual bright palette, is stunning and perfect for the story. (And here I want to add that the soundtrack is also excellent--my only quibble being that the powerful ""Circle Of Life"" should have won for best song instead of the pretty but vapid ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". But that being said, I believe that, like ""Beauty and the Beast,"" should have been nominated as picture of the year. If you haven't seen this, what are waiting for?--arnie113<br/><br/>_________________________"

","The Lion King is a classic from Disney. I remember going to the movie theater/cinema and watching the film...I was exactly 8 years old. And until now, with 19 years old, the good sensation of watching this movie is the same as that time. My mother even bought me Simba's doll! =)<br/><br/>The story takes place in Africa, where Simba, son of Mufasa, is very well protected by his dad.(sometimes with the help of Zazu, a bird that is kind of a counselor of the king Mufasa)Everything goes well, but there is one problem: Scar, Mufasa's brother, is jealous because he is not the king of the jungle, and decides to do a plan to kill Simba and Mufasa. Simba escapes, but Mufasa dies; Scar tells Simba that he is guilty for Mufasa's death,and the terrified Simba runs away, too sad of what happened. Far from his kingdom, Simba meets Pumbaa and Timon, who takes care of him and teaches about Hakuna's Matata philosophy. Everything will be very well for a long time, until Simba meet again his childhood friend Nala ,who tells him about the horrible things Scar is doing in the old Kingdom."

","This is in my top 3 animation films of all time. I don't think that any animation film before it managed to enter the hearts of both children and adults at once like this one. An ensemble cast with such a gripping tale, great music and superb animation, made this one of the all time greats. The characters are so well flushed out and each scene is so memorable. I cannot stress just how good this film is. Without a doubt the peak of Disney and to this day they have not made anything this original and so influential. The creators gave us such a good villain and great hero's that in my opinion shows that an animated film can be just as good or if not better than a real life film."
"boberdorf","10","9","12","18 September 2011"," The True Classic Disney Movie!
","This may be an unorthodox way to start a review, but hey it's as meaningful as i'll ever be for a review. My lucky number is 14. I was born on August 14th. My birth sign is Leo (Lion), my State Football Team is the Lions, and its been 14 years since i'v seen my favorite movie from my childhood; The Lion King for the first time. And now I had the honor to experience it in the theater. <br/><br/>From the moment the black screen faded to the rising sun along on the African Plane, with opening Zulu lyrics playing to Circle of Life, I got chills up my spine and my lips were shaking as they were forming the biggest smile I think i'v ever had. Now of all the films to come out these past years like the final Harry Potter, Avatar, Inception, Super 8, Transformers, etc. I want make this clear; The Lion King was the funnest time i'v ever had at the Movies! I don't even care for it being part of the 3D effect.<br/><br/>I wanted to see it in the theater as if it was the opening weekend back in 1994. It's still The Lion King, but in a sentimental way (If your a 90's kid) it makes you completely feel dropped back into your seat like it's was the first time viewing it. The story of a young lion prince, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick) framed into killing his father Mufasa (James Earl Jones) by his evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Then flees from his past and meets Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumba (Ernie Sabella) whom teach him ""Hakuna Matata"" (Literally meaning No Worries). And in the end Simba returns to be the one true king. The story may be considered Hamlet with lions, but it's so much more than that. Most in part of the fun characters, humor, and still having the true drama and emotion that makes The Lion King what it is. <br/><br/>The 3D added depth to the film and actually didn't give me a headache. Zazu flying overhead Pride Rock, the music sequences, and the stampede scene are better than ever, yet I'm sure the new generation seeing it will probably be emotionally scarred for life. I don't want to be a ""Lion King is the Best Disney Movie Ever"" Guy without mentioning it has a flaw. Which is its quick resolve with the last 40 minutes of the movie. Yeah, Simba is intervened by his old childhood friend Nala and crazy shaman blue butt monkey Rafiki to go back home from his 'time away from home' that almost feels like the 10 second log scene in Hakuna Matata. In any way it still doesn't turn you away. <br/><br/>Then add the key ingredient to a classic Disney Movie; Songs! Just another element that adds to the formula. Elton John and Tim Rice won an Oscar for their work on this film! And who's to say they don't deserve it? Circle of Life, Just Can't Wait to be King, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel the Love Tonight, and even Timons Hula Song! It took every bone in my body not to sing in the theater but hey, now there's another reason for multiple viewings. I want to say to those who are curious, there is no ""Morning Report"" song in the film! Disneys Classic 2D Animated films are true Disney.<br/><br/>Disney mixed meaningful and powerful themes with maximum entertainment in a perfect way that are what make true classics. Today any critic from the New York Times can slap a comment on a movie saying it's a ""classic"" when really they can't say in 10 years people will be talking about it. But hey, Hakuna Matata! In the end if you want a luxury of seeing (Arguably) Disneys best film on the big screen than don't hold back. It will really make you feel like a kid for an hour and a half, and also give you witness to Disneys most beautiful masterpiece that isn't just Dinsey's Best, but possibly one of the greatest achievements ever made.....The Lion King!"

"JakeRalston","10","3","3","1 December 2019"," The Best Disney Movie Ever Made
","10/10, despite all their recent success, Disney has yet to do better."
"tomgillespie2002","10","3","3","27 July 2016"," As close to animated perfection as you can get
","Disney's The Lion King capped a highly lucrative 5 years for the House of Mouse, who were, before The Little Mermaid came along in 1989 and turned their fortunes around, in real danger. It seems ridiculous to think that the studio that now routinely make billions of dollars a year with their Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm output, as well as their recent fondness for re-imagining their so-called 'Disney Animated Classics' series in live-action, could have ever been in danger of actually going under. Yet Mermaid made the millions, Beauty and the Beast (1991) won critical adoration, and Aladdin (1992) charmed, and the rest is history.<br/><br/>I remember seeing The Lion King in cinemas back in 1994 with my mum, and not being particularly over-awed. I didn't shed a tear when Mufasa was betrayed, nor was I singing the songs to myself in the car ride home. However, it felt like I was the only one, as the film's popularity seemed to increase each year, with home release re- masters, soundtracks and a theatre production jamming every one of my senses, even now, 22 years later. It was because of this, and partially because I'm an old-school (1930's-60's) Disney loyalist, that I shunned The Lion King for all these years. After finally viewing it again, I wish I had a time machine to slap the 10 year old version of myself, as this is about as close to animated perfection as you can get.<br/><br/>For anyone who has somehow never seen the film, The Lion King tells the story of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones), a respected and formidable beast who rules over the Pride Lands of Africa. The arrival of his new son and heir, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas and Matthew Broderick), is cause for celebration across the plains, except, that is, for Mufasa's weak and envious brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) and his hyena friends (Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings). When Scar's plan to usurp Mustafa's throne ends in tragedy, Simba flees with guilt and shame, finding unlikely friends in the slow-witted warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and motor-mouthed meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane). As Scar's rule leaves Simba's former homeland a hyena-ridden wasteland, will the would-be king fulfil his destiny and take back his crown?<br/><br/>From the enchanting, wordless opening scene in which Simba is shown off to the crowd to the tune of Circle of Life, to the savage, expressionistic climax which sees hero and villain have their final showdown, I felt completely immersed in this world, regardless of the fact that I knew the story back to front. This is Disney at its most thoughtful, magical and hilarious. Perhaps taking a page from Studio Ghibli's environmentally-aware book, the film shows a real respect for the natural world despite anthropomophising its characters and dabbling in pseudo-mysticism. Lane and Sabella shine as Timon and Pumbaa, two of Disney's most beloved comedic side- kicks, who also get to belt out one of their most beloved tunes in Hakuna Matata. I'll most likely never be convinced that Disney will manage to recreate the beauty and warmth of the likes of Dumbo (1940) and Bambi (1942) during their Golden Age, but The Lion King is the closest it's ever come."
"mkcross","10","3","3","12 May 2014"," Best Disney Movie Ever
","The lion king is by far the best Disney movie ever made The animation was amazing, the characters were amazing, the story was great it was just a excellent movie. The only thing that I found a bit extreme was killing of Mufasa though to be fair I never found it that sad and I'd be lying if I said balled my eyes out as a kid, but overall, It was such a great movie that one scene like that really doesn't screw up the rest of the movie and that was probably the only thing in the entire movie that it would have been OK not to show. I Still lave the lion king to this day and I'm almost 21 years old and from the looks of I will love this movie until the day I die."

Hope they make more movies that will keep people or viewers wanting more. I believe that this is a great family movie to watch together."
"thrwmbsbgkdoepmcjrmrdw","10","3","3","20 April 2011"," Excellent Movie
","I love Disney always have and probably always will. But The Lion King in many ways stands out from the rest. And it's not just cause the prince is a lion. You feel the pain and hurt and betrayal along with Simba. You learn and grow along with Simba. You love along with Simba. As with most Disney animals their facial expressions say more than words could say and when Timon laughs about the Kings of the past being in the stars, Simba really needs to say nothing at all. It's all there written in his face and they way he carries himself as he leaves. It's almost a coming of age story. As a young cub he had the world at his paws. Then he sees it slip away with the death of his father and being driven out by the hyenas. Only to later on come back and see that Pride Rock is really home and fight for what is rightfully his. Pop some popcorn and sit back, relax and enjoy!"
"atlihafsteinsson","Null","3","3","30 August 2010"," Undeniably a Masterpiece
","Probably what bugs me about The Lion King is the character design of the lions. Basically, everything I find visually engaging about lions is all but left out of the character design. Beauty & the Beast and Aladdin both had far stronger character designs, as indeed did many previous Disney films centring around animals. It would, however, be foolish of me to fish for any other faults that are simply non-existent.<br/><br/>The Lion King is a masterpiece. Good story? Check. A royal lion cub who's a bit on the spoiled side sees his world fall apart when his father dies in a wildebeest stampede. Tricked into thinking he was responsible, he flees and adopts a life of ease with the carefree duo Timon and Pumbaa.<br/><br/>This is some epic stuff. Though I decided not to include The Lion King in my favourites list of animated movies, my breath is still taken away when Simbaa sees those wildebeest run down into the canyon. That whole scene is one of the most heartbreaking scenes of cinema I have ever seen. There are real highs and lows here, a quality that most of the old Disney movies sorely lacked (and this coming from a big fan).<br/><br/>Another big plus is the music. The soundtrack goes the whole scale. When all is well in Simbaa's life, there is hopeful music echoing of the jungle and the savannah. Then things get darker and the music gets deeper and more epic than anyone who's not heard it can imagine. ""Be Prepared"" is excellent and rightfully scary as the following scene testifies. The stampede score is one of the most ground-shaking pieces of music I have ever heard. When that all gets too much, there's ""Hakuna Matata"", the ultimate anthem for carefree living, to soothe the soul. Personally, Elton John's original version of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (in the end credits) is the stronger of the two presented; I can hardly fight back tears every time I hear it. ""The Circle of Life"" set the tone for how movies should start and not for no reason. The whole audio part of this movie is a complete bullseye.<br/><br/>The characters themselves, even if I really dislike most of the designs, are mostly very good. Scar is wickedly ambitious. Rafiki shows that wise characters can also be tremendously funny, and it's not for no reason that Timon and Pumbaa got their own show; they are wonderful. Equally great are the three hyenas. Then of course, there's Sazu (wonderfully voiced by Rowan Atkinson), the unfortunate bird who's the butt of the crown, no matter on which side of the family he's standing.<br/><br/>With a stunning climax, soaring music and a roaring (sic), engaging story, The Lion King is a movie that hits every mark it needs right. It hits home with the audience and makes them feel for this world. It may not hit the mark with my aesthetic senses, but to pretend that the movie was lesser because of that would be foolish of me. The Lion King is a masterpiece, on par with the Beauty & the Beast."
"Avwillfan89","10","3","3","13 April 2010"," Of all the Disney movies growing up, this one has always been my favorite
","Yes, definitely my favorite hand drawn animated movie of all time. It was my favorite as a child and it still is now. This is an epic and cult tale based loosely on Shakespeare's Hamlet. Set in between Kenya or Tanzania, Africa at an unknown time, the king and queen of pride rock christen their son, Simba, as the new prince. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), however, longs for the throne, so he conjures up several plans with the hyenas to get rid of the king Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Simba. The first one doesn't work, but in the second he is half successful. Luring Simba in a stampede of wilder-beasts (The goose bump-giving score by Hans Zimmer as powerful as ever at this point) Scar gets Mufasa to save him but then, as the king climbs to the top of a rock, Scar claws him and releases him. Simba then finds his father's dead body on the ground, and while mourning him, his uncle arrives, and convinces him it was his own fault, sending him away, with the hyenas on his tail to finish him off. <br/><br/>Simba escapes everything and runs far away. He almost dies in the desert but is then rescued by meerkat Timon (Nathan Lane) and Warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) who teach him to adapt to a sort of hippie life of good times and bug eating. Now grown, Simba (Matthew Broderick) has a run in with Nala (Moira Kelly) his childhood friend, while she hunts Pumbaa. They fall in love and she tries to convince him to go back, but he refuses. Later, while in the grasslands, he meets up with the baboon that christened him, Rafiki, and he leads him out to speak with the ghost of his father, who reminds him of who he really is and what he must do. He speeds off back to his kingdom, now degrading under the false king, to reclaim his throne and set peace to Pride Rock.<br/><br/>I couldn't give my opinion about this film without explaining the plot, if you'll forgive me. It really is a Disney classic that's unique in so many ways. The scene in which Simba tries to wake his dead father is horribly tragic, but extremely powerful. Disney already did something similar with Bambi, with the implication that the protagonist's mother had been killed. But it had never reached to the extent that the audience saw the death or the dead body of one of the parents. The Lion King is a 100 times more powerful than Bambi. Even though I never cried at that scene, I was always very uncomfortable with it. The script is also really cool and witty and should have been nominated for the 1994 Academy Awards, along with the winner Pulp Fiction."

","I don't remember seeing this movie for the first time. It came out when I was one year old. But I do know that for as long as I can remember this movie has been my favorite movie ever. I have a collection of lion stuffed animals and my favorite animal is to this day the lion. This movie has even impacted how I want to spend my life when I get out of school. Before I found out about the Broadway production of this play, I didn't know anything about theatre, but because The Lion King was made into a Broadway adaptation, I have developed a love for the theatre. While I still haven't fulfilled my dream of seeing the stage adaptation of this movie, I do have a passion for other parts of theatre, both being on stage and off and plan to major in performing arts in college. I fully believe that if it were not for my love of this movie that I would not have this passion today. The movie itself though is, in my opinion, the best Disney movie every. It has a wonderful plot that draws from classic inspirations and has some of the deepest and most motivated characters in the Disney franchise."

","I first watched this movie when I was about 3. lol, back then I didn't appreciate it, but I now have the video downstairs in my collection. The Lion King has many wonderful, comprehensible morals which are built up right to the very end. Plenty of action, a well designed plot, great animations, (I personally like the songs). It is a very well thought out film, and although it may appear to be for younger audiences, I would still encourage everyone to see it at least twice. <br/><br/>This video is basically a biography of a young lion born to a ""royal"" family (the lion being the ""king of beasts"") Symba lives the life that many of us can relate to, curioius when young, and he grows up to be a great and mighty king due to his experiences along the way. Faced, however, by an ""evil uncle"", he must face many hardships along the way, including separation from his family for a long time. All these years of pain, and renewed love of the friendship that he bonds with an unlikely couple of Timone an pumba, This film really touches the viewer on an emotional level.<br/><br/>A superb production."
"codydennison","10","8","11","5 August 2017"," One of the best of the best
","I hadn't thought much of The Lion King back then because I'd watch anything. But now that I'm older, I can see why many people agree that it's one of the best movies, and I agree. There may be spoilers ahead, so you have been warned.<br/><br/>The animation's great, I really like the songs (especially Circle Of Life and Be Prepared), and I also like the characters (like Mufasa, Rafiki, and Timon and Pumbaa). Out of Disney's protagonists, I feel that Simba's story is one that'll always be told for many years to come. From a cub who can't wait to be king to an exiled prince whose father had been killed by his uncle and finally to be a king, retaking the Pridelands from his cruel uncle Scar. This movie has some hidden good values as well, such as heroism, faith, hope, and reconciliation.<br/><br/>That's why I think that The Lion King is not only one of the best Disney movies, but it's also one of the best animated movies ever. So on a scale from one to ten, I'd give it a perfect ten, and I'd definitely recommend this...and even though The Lion King (1994) will always be better than The Lion King (2019), I hope the remake will be good."

","This is the most incredible movie I have ever seen. Sounds silly? It may, considering it is an animated film which a majority of people don't take seriously when in the subject of the greatest movies anyone has ever seen. I personally love animated anything, whether it be cartoons, movies, shorts, etc. The Lion King *IS* the king of all Disney films. We all know the tragic tale of the death of Simba's father, even if we had not seen the movie, thus recognition and praise this movie receives absolutely deserves it no less. This is my favourite movie. The art is simply fantastic. The animation is just breathtaking. The story -- though based off of 'Hamlet' -- is beautiful and will leave you in tears. The voice actors and actresses did an impeccable job for each of the characters' personalities. I especially adore the music. The Lion King had introduced me to African music and I have loved it ever since. The songs in the movie such as ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" (one sung by Elton John, and one sung by Kristle Edwards along with the voices of adult Simba and Nala, both pieces of which I love and listen to everyday) and ""Hakuna Matata"" are divine and catchy, not to mention adorable. <br/><br/>I cannot say how much I love this film. I'm in love with it. The producers and directors and every person who had contributed to the making of it did a marvelous job. Overall, this movie is PERFECT.

","I believe that a great movie is one that clearly conveys a strong message. One that you can use to justify your views on various topics. Only a hand full of movies delivered the aforementioned attribute as well as The Lion King. Although this film's plot is enough to prove its brilliance, factors like voice-acting, background themes, dialogs, etc give an attentive viewer more to be impressed with. Case in point: James Earl Jones's voice boosted Mufasa's powerful appearance. The voice had a commanding tone which rivaled Mufasa's powerful roar. Likewise, there are many details that can make this movie the face of Disney. It has been more than 10 years since its release, and it still boasts a strong stance against far more graphically advanced movies. Kids as well as adults can enjoy this flick, possibly without snacks. I rate this film a ten out of ten while suggesting that everyone watch it at least once."

Elton John got an Oscar I believe, but can't see why.<br/><br/>Best parts of the movie are the interactions between Simba and Scar.

"thediggens","9","4","5","5 June 2014"," A Modern Classic
","The Lion King is by general consensus the greatest Disney film from their glorious renaissance period (1989-1999), and is undoubtedly worthy of such recognition. Notably, it is the highest rated Western animation on IMDb's own Top 250, which while flawed and imprecise is a good indicator of quality.<br/><br/>A loose adaption of Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King is visually stunning, the peak of hand-drawn animation, with a strong voice cast and a wide selection of memorable tunes. It is a tight ~80 minutes, and one sometimes forgets just how quick the movie moves, yet it does so deftly. The characters are well defined, and the arc of Simba's growth, the core of the film, evolves satisfyingly. One could question whether more time should have been spent on Simba's growth in the middle act (there is incredulous imagery as Simba grows exponentially next to the stasis of Timon and Pumba), but to meander so would ask it to be an entirely different film.<br/><br/>While it is not uncommon for a side character or two overshadow the main (see the Genie in Aladdin), Matthew Broderick and Jonathan Taylor Thomas (adult and young Simba respectively) are at risk from nearly all of the phenomenal cast. James Earl Jones is a commanding presence, and Jeremy Irons as Scar steals every scene. The 'fools' of the film, be it Timon & Pumba, the Hyena trio or even Zazu, all provide the levity believably, that would otherwise leave an incredibly sombre film. Nala is powerful, though one must note that she seems at times far more capable than Simba to actually achieve anything. Nevertheless, Simba's coming-of-age arc, while predictable, is enjoyable, helped along by fantastic charisma and choice songs.<br/><br/>The fact that the film has spawned a wildly successful musical gives a strong indication of the quality of the music, but what is less said is how beautiful the film is. As The Lion King was being released, works were already moving away from hand-drawn animation, with Toy Story released a year later. And The Lion King might be the peak of hand-drawn, with an enormous palate of creativity and variety. The opening vista for 'Circle of Life', the bursts of colour in 'Can't wait to be King' and the sombre tone of 'Be Prepared' all are gorgeous. Yet, special mention must go to the Stampede scene, one of the finest scenes of animation ever.<br/><br/>One thing I've developed from multiple viewings is how Timon and Pumba might be the weakest part of the movie. First, their 'life lessons' are essentially reversed by Rafiki. Certainly they are qualified to the point of being narratively sidelined. They feel contrived and even a detraction from the meat of the movie. Their role is the fast food portion of the film- the quick fix over more meatier bits of the film. The entertainment provided is enjoyable regardless, and is essential to round off the movie as Disney.<br/><br/>The Lion King is endlessly re-watchable, catchy, fun, while remaining a fantastic piece of cinema and an invaluable part of the Disney canon. Magnificent."

"amelia-seecharan","9","4","5","29 November 2011"," A Moralistic Approach in The Lion King
","The Lion King (1994) Movie Review Directed by: Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers <br/><br/>The Lion King is more than just a Disney animation. Its two Oscar wins was well-deserved. The main characters – Simba, Mufasa, Scar, Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa exemplify the different traits present in our society. Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff work together to direct a film that not only shows us the beauty of life and nature, but the moral values we should all seek to sustain who we are. Roger Allers is credited for writing some of the best known Disney classic films such as Beauty and the Beast (1991) and Aladdin (1992). Robert Minkoff not only directed The Lion King but other movies such as Stuart Little (1999) and The Forbidden Kingdom (2008). These two directors teamed together to play a role in a film that had a moralistic approach. Life is wonderful – don't run away from it, appreciate it and always know family and friends can help you in ways you'd never expect.<br/><br/>Looking beyond the obvious characters on screen, each of them can be characterized by a specific expectation. Simba must transition from a young cub (boy) to a leader (adult). Mufasa must rule a land and protect his family; he went as far as he could to protect his son – to the point where he lost his life. Mufasa's fatherly actions teach us that with true love, a parent is willing to exceed limitations to secure his own child. Scar is a representation of evil, greed, and jealousy. He was willing to kill his own brother and nephew to assume a higher rank. He is often portrayed with many high angles, a sign of his dominance and leadership amongst the hyenas and the power he holds over them. Timon and Pumbaa represent the friends who support and guide you when you're troubled. The comedic sense of the duo lightens up the mood of young Simba, giving the viewer reassurance upon Simba's faith and emotions. Nala gives the film a romantic turn, adding on to the idea that love and support can guide someone in the right direction. <br/><br/>A major influence that aided the communication in the film was the musical score. In the scene in which Mufasa explains to Simba what the stars in the sky were, a significant musical score plays in the background. This same musical score appears again when Simba is grown and tells Timon and Pumba his father's explanation of the stars. As Simba walks away from his two friends, it presents itself as Simba's remembers his father. This music appears more than once in the film, setting up a connection between previous and present scenes, it was placed at each particular point of the film for a reason. The color and lighting tones between Mufasa and Scar gave way to the differences between them. The darker tones represented Scar's faded thoughts. The little lighting provided in his scenes showed that he was of a sadistic nature whereas Mufasa is presented in brighter lighting among nature and mostly outdoors. Scar is usually located in the interior of a cave or other dwelling – enclosing him in the darkness that eventually drives his jealousy. <br/><br/>Cultural aspects of Africa are introduced immediately in the beginning of the film with the first song. The majority of the animals also show the beauty of nature and the variety of animal life that exists. The song ""The Circle of Life"" sets off a major theme of the film – creating the idea that life is a constant circle, there is life and then there is death. After Mufasa dies, a new ruler had to assume his position – Simba. The circle kept going until the film concluded with a new life – the child of Simba and Nala. Once again, the circle has fulfilled its goal of life and death. <br/><br/>""The amazing thing is that I think when we (Rob Minkoff and Roger Allers) made this movie; it's safe to say that we didn't really fully understand the impact this movie was going to have on people.and how long it was going to kind of stick around."" The Lion King shares that universal theme that we are all part of ""the circle of life"", live life with true happiness and do the right thing. Take out time to love those who care and not to back down from fear – face it. Rob Winkoff and Roger Allers may not have realized it when the film was released in 1994, but The Lion King has become a Disney classic, true to the standards of morality and teaching us how magical and complex life is truly is."

","Personally I enjoy most of Disney movies but this one has a special place for many reasons. The main one is that it brings me back to my childhood, and at that time I enjoyed the movie so much. I even had the VHS in English and Spanish version. Then the film came out on DVD and I also bought it. When it first came out on IMAX for any reason I couldn't go to see it again so now for the 3D release I definitely was not going to miss that opportunity. And all I can say is that this film will be forever inmortal. At the theater that I went there were people in the mid 20s like myself singing the songs, repeating the lines, it is just something that you don't see everyday. About the movie, everything has been said before: it is just so perfect, so balanced, it is a treat for the eyes for its amazing animation, it makes you laugh histerically with lovable characters like timon and pumba, it has a lot of emotional moments (spoilers) yes mufasas death is very sad but what really gets to me is when mufasa gets into the stampede to protect simba that is just heart breaking for me its not the death itself but the events that occur before his dead. Also at the very end when Simba takes his place as king is just magical, powerful it gives me chills when the bones are washed away by the rain while simba listens the voice of his father ""remember"" definitely this is pure gold a movie for old and young and a gem that will absolutely will pass the test of time."
"LordDynamo","Null","4","5","18 August 2011"," A true masterpiece! Of ""royal"" splendour
","It is everyday that you get a film. However, it is not everyday that you get a film that is original and inspirational. The Lion King is a perfect example of that for it's a masterpiece that I guarantee will entertain people of all ages! The plot is pretty straightforward, but I think it has creativity in every way. It follows Simba, a young lion cub who is destined to become the new king of the African Savannah, after his father, Mufasa. However, Mufasa's jealous brother, Scar wishes to claim the throne for himself and intends to kill both Mufasa and Simba, with the help of a dastardly yet comical pack of hyenas. Going into self-exile when told that he is responsible for his father's death by a planned wildebeest stampede (we all know who really did it, don't we?), Simba grows up while befriending the famous duo, Timon and Pumbaa, then is eventually persuaded to defeat his uncle Scar and become the rightful king. A plot such as this is so compelling, it is uncanny. As for the characters, each and every one of them is brilliantly made, and the voice actors are well chosen, my personal favourites being James Earl Jones as the voice of Mufasa, Whoopi Goldberg (well known for her role in Sister Act) as the lead hyena Shenzi and the fabulous Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, a hornbill and the king's majordomo. And let's not forget Nathan Lane as Timon and Jeremy Irons as Scar! The rest of the film is equally fantastic. The main reason I love TLK is that its characters are animals, in the African Savannah (I am a big fan of African wildlife)! For those who have not seen The Lion King, watch it! Now! I promise you will praise the film for all it's worth (made even better with its unique and epic soundtrack) and you will not regret watching it. As a conclusion, I give The Lion King a 10 and recommend it highly."

","I first heard of this wonderful Disney feature when I popped in the Aladdin tape, and I knew it was going to be my favorite. A year later, I saw it in a theatre as a double feature paired with Angels in the Outfield. It was so good I did not want to see it come to an end. I begged to see it again and I got my chance at a library and it was just as mesmerizing. I finally got it on video and to this day it never fails to impress. With gorgeous animation, memorable characters, unbelievable score, and a well thought out story with a great message for anyone of any age (""We are all connected in the the great circle of life"", said Mufasa), what's not to like? My favorite song is Hakuna Matata (of course!) but I have many of these songs stuck in my head from time to time. To top it all off, I recently saw the Broadway musical and you owe it to yourself to see it.<br/><br/>Hakuna Matata!"

It won 2 Oscars one of them for best original song in the shape of ""can you feel the love tonight"". Personally i much prefferd and thought that ""the circle of life"" ""I just cant wait to be king"" or ""Hakuna Matata"".

"bitteralmonds","Null","14","25","4 May 2005"," A Question of Values
","While I don't deny that 'The Lion King'is well animated and has a terrific score, I believe it principally a capitalist parable. Recall the scene where Mufasa walks with Simba through the plains and explains the 'natural order of things'--where the strong prey upon the weak to maintain overall balance and perfection. ""We eat the antelope, the antelope eat the grass, etc."" (trickle-down effect?) And that thrilling opening scene, where all of the animals gather to witness Simba's birth. Isn't there something a little twisted about a bunch of zebras and antelopes gathering to bray joyously about the birth of yet another lion? <br/><br/>The lions are the heroes, and we're lead to believe that the establishment rules with an even paw. The underdogs (hyenas) are villains, and when they challenge the established order, the result is chaos and decay. Simba's decision to live the hakuna matata philosophy throws the kingdom's delicate balance out of whack. Only when power returns to the son of the old king is the land restored. The messages? Don't question the established order. It is natural and fair for the strong to take down the weak. Do your job, fulfill your function. It's best if power stays in the same hands for generation after generation. Now, this may be all well and good in the actual ecosystem of the savanna or whatever, but Disney's whole gimmick is to blur the line between animal and human, and give animals human characteristics and values. <br/><br/>Don't underestimate the power of these messages--children obsess over animated characters. I remember as a child fighting with my friends over who would get to play 'Cinderella' in our make-believe game. Merchandise (dolls, toys, halloween costumes, spin off books, amusement parks) reinforces the message, serving as a constant reminder. <br/><br/>So it's simply a question of what values you want your children to absorb. If they include: social darwinism, unquestioning defense of the status quo, and contempt for the underdog, this is the film for you. Otherwise, I would stick to muppets."

","So...I'm going to try not to be too biased here...I'm going to compose myself the best I can...But, I'm not going to lie, that's going to be really hard seeing as though I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS MOVIE!!! I know a lot of people say this film is overrated and all that jazz, but LOOK AT THIS FILM and tell me you don't love it too!<br/><br/>ANIMATION: Spectacular! This movie looks great! Of course it has an epic, grand quality about it, and the animation really takes it to another level! The stampede scene has got to be one of the biggest scenes ever put to traditional animation!<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: This movie brings us the Tim Rice/Elton John team. Even though there's no Alan Menken or Howard Ashman, these songs are still great! They fit the movie's tone, they're not out of place, and they are ALL memorable! This Disney movie has the best soundtrack - there is no Number One hit song from this film - ALL the songs are Number One! I don't just love the songs, but I am in mad love with Hans Zimmer's score! It's beautiful! It tells the story and fits the mood perfectly! The main theme, ""Lea Halalela,"" is fan-frickin-tastic! Gosh, if that theme were a woman, I'd marry her! But the music is what takes us to Africa (which country are we in? I don't know...), and if it weren't for Lebo M's contributions, NO music in this movie would be great!<br/><br/>ROMANCE: For as much as I love this movie, I have to admit that this is one of the weak aspects of the film. I love the ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" number; I love the song, and I love looking at the animation. But...why is the song here? Why is this scene here? First of all, it doesn't match the story at all. It feels like the scene takes place because...Disney movies have romance scenes! Secondly, I don't believe Simba and Nala are in love. Look at how other Disney films show love: characters are smiling, singing, happy, and would do anything to be with their romantic interest. Here, Simba and Nala are arguing and yelling at each other after the scene. I'll tell you what, though, if you look at Nala as she's laying on her back during the song number, look at how she looks at Simba. That says, ""I want you, lion man.""<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: I am in love with these characters! Much like the ""Beauty and the Beast"" gang, there's not a person...or animal...in this movie I don't dislike! My two favorite characters are Mufasa and Rafiki. Mufasa wreaks of power! The reason we hate Scar so much is because he kills Mufasa, who we love so much! He is the father of Disney movie fathers - Disney fathers period! He says one of my favorite lines: ""Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" OOOH, that line just OOZES power - just BLEEDS power!!! Rafiki is awesome because he is both funny and wise. He knows just what to say and just what to do for the right moment. He has funny lines like ""It means you are a baboon, and I am not!"" Yet he knows when to hit Simba over the head with a stick and tell him to learn from his mistakes. Go Rafiki!<br/><br/>STORY: I think the story is excellent. I love watching it, I love watching Simba's arc, I think it is brilliant...Though, there's one other problem the movie has that lies in the story. After Mufasa dies and Simba cries over his body, Scar comes and tells him to run away. Question: if they're all alone, why doesn't Scar just kill Simba himself? At first I thought it was because he didn't want Simba's blood on his hands, but that can't be right. First of all, he has Mufasa's blood on his hands. Second of all, he has a violent fight with Simba at the end of the movie. If Scar wants the throne so badly that he puts together an attack against two children, a Nazi team of hyenas, and a wildebeest stampede, I don't think he was above killing a child. The movie could have been over just like that; why didn't he kill Simba? The only reason I can come up with is ""If he killed him, there'd be no movie."" Well, that's weak. If that's the case, then the movie didn't need to happen. We should have gotten a better reason for the following events that took place.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Despite the two problems I have with the movie, I still adore it! It's epic, it's dramatic, it's funny, it's musical! It is large! It has one of the saddest moments ever in Disney. It is one of the studio's biggest movies for a reason! Find out for yourself in the big Circle of Life! BOOYIKA!"
"yahwehisagape","9","5","7","12 May 2014"," The Lion King
","The Lion King is acclaimed to be one of the best and if not the best Disney film of all time. Well lets find out. The plot of the movie is about a young cub named Simba and plans on becoming king, but when Simbas evil uncle Scar kills Simbas father Mufasa. Scar tells his hyena henchmen to run Simba out into the jungle and make him never return. Simba makes new friends in the jungle and decides never to return because he rather lives a life with no problems whatsoever. When his childhood friend Nala informs him that Scar has taken over Simba comes back and stops his evil uncle. I personally find the plot very interesting and exiting. It's like you want to know what happens next every moment. Now the moment that everyone remembers and one of Disney's most saddest moment is when Scar lets the stampede out to kill Mufasa. I mean come on haven't we got enough with Bambis Mom! Mufasas death in my opinion is more sad. The main reason is that with Mufasas death there are not any flying birds after it. With Mufasa they keep it silent like if its at a funeral So after watching this film its now clear to me why its called one of the best. In my opinion its not THE best because it does have its flaws here and there./Cough,cough/ Timon and Pumba! Sorry had a couple idiots stuck in my throat. Still, its one of the best, but by a landslide Not the very best."

It provides a colorful and multi-emotional experience while subtly delivering an important life message, enjoyable for people of all ages. Not many films are so enveloping as to successfully simultaneously deliver an action-packed adventure, romance, and comedy. Throughout the entire film, the audience is entranced by the wondrous diegesis that is created, and so easily mourns when it is supposed to mourn and laughs when it is supposed to laugh. The Lion King uses animals as opposed to humans (as in Shakespeare's Hamlet), but this contributes to the experience and message rather than takes away from them. Under all the emotion, this charming film makes a social statement, that the circle of life must inevitably continue, and death should be accepted as long it is part of the natural cycle. As a perfect mix of an emotional experience and a moral message, it's no wonder that The Lion King raked in so much revenue and is seen as one of the best films in Disney history.<br/><br/>In many parts of the narrative, the audience is completely wrapped up by the magical atmosphere that the film creates, with help from its beautiful original score. In the scene where Mufasa dies, the audience follows Simba, both visually and emotionally, through the discovery of his father's limp body and the acceptance of his passing away. The audience feels the fear and desperation of the little Simba cub as he sees Mufasa motionless on the floor. The audience weeps for Simba as he tries to ""wake up"" his father. Later in the film, when adult Simba meets Nala, the musical accompaniment, ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (composed by Elton John) (1994), really creates the romantic mood that devours the audience's heart. When Timon and Pumbaa break the audience out of that oneiric state with their funny antics, and even when they break the fourth wall, they offer a reprieve from the intense emotion present in the rest of the film. These reprieves strengthen the emotions created rather than diminish them. They are an asset to the deep emotions awakened by The Lion King.<br/><br/>The use of lions instead of humans might be expected to reduce the emotional intensity of the film, but instead it actually, in some ways, increases it. With animals, the audience experiences defamilarization, as the death of a lion, although still sad, is less taboo and tragic than a death of human. If human Scar had murdered human Mufasa, the audience would experience boundless hate for Scar, rather than experiencing the sadness of Simba as it was supposed to. Using animals also made the diegesis much more colorful and kid-friendly. Using human characters would have created a whole other unwanted experience.<br/><br/>Aside from the emotional aspect of the film, The Lion King also disguises a powerful social statement. At the end of the film, the child of Simba and Nala is declared the heir of the pride, as Simba was at the beginning of the film. This metaphorically completes ""The Circle of Life"" (also composed by Elton John) (1994), the title of the opening score. The audience learns that Mufasa's death was inevitable, and sooner or later Simba will die too. Death must happen to complete the cycle, and the past should not be clung on to. This important message is what makes The Lion King more than a simple narrative and a delight for 5-year-olds and 50-year-olds alike.<br/><br/>The Lion King was made 17 years ago, yet still stands as an artful classic, despite it being an animation movie. This is a result of the intense emotional experience that an audience can't help but be enveloped by, and a powerful life lesson that is delivered flawlessly. Throughout the action, romance, and sudden comedy, the audience follows without any difficulty at all, and at the end, learns a valuable lesson. The choice to use animals also benefited the film. Aside from making the film more kid-friendly, it precisely manipulated the audience's feelings. The Lion King is a shining gem in film history, a gem that will truly stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The Lion King will remain one of my favorite films for a long time, and if you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should."

"mr-blue_00","10","2","2","20 October 2019"," A masterpiece
","Arguably Disney's best film of all time, the Lion King is beautifully set in the African Serengeti. The soundtrack is perfect, the dialogue is excellent, and the voice performances by the actors are top notch. As an adult, I appreciate the humor that I missed as a kid and that is what sets this film apart; it can be watched by audiences of all ages. James Earl Jones was most fitting as Mufasa, as were the rest of the actors in their roles. A true epic."

"Tweekums","10","2","2","8 August 2019"," A Disney classic
","In the African savannah King Mufasa, a lion, rules over the Pride Lands. He explains to his son, a young cub named Simba, that one day he will be the king... but before that he has a lot to learn. There are dangers, even for lions. The greatest danger comes from Simba's Uncle Scar; an embittered lion with a Machiavellian streak. Scar wants to rule but to do that he needs to rid himself of Mufasa and Simba... he has plans. One day Scar's plan works; Mufasa is dead and Simba leaves the Pride Lands believing he is to blame for his father's death. He grows up learning to take things easy with new friends Pumbaa and Timon, a warthog and meerkat. Scar now rules the pride with the help of the hyenas. When Simba learns of how bad things have got in the Pride Lands he will have to decide whether to continue the easy life or fight to make things better.<br/><br/>This film is definitely one of Disney's classics; it has a fine story, some great characters and catchy songs. Simba is a decent protagonist even if the plot demands that he isn't too strong early on and Scar is a great villain; as are his trio of hyena acolytes. Given the film's 'U' certificate I was surprised at how dark it is in places; some scenes might disturb younger viewers as characters are often in real danger. The voice cast is very impressive; notably Jeremy Irons, as Scar, James Earl Jones, as Mufasa, and Rowan Atkinson, as Zazu the hornbill who is Mufasa's majordomo. As one would expect from Disney the animation and character designs are all really good. Overall I'd definitely recommend this for all but the youngest children and adults alike."
"jmgiovine","10","2","2","30 July 2019"," It places itself among the best animated productions of all time.
","Oscillating between big and colorful, the newest member of the Disney Renaissance marks a higher mark in terms of the stakes of the animation house, with a grand and epic story that possesses all the great Shakespearean traits, as well as the beautiful animation and the scope behind it, filled with charming, catchy and memorable songs, an amazing score, a worthy voice-casting and the best and unique elements every single animated flick should showcase, all in amazing-great deliverance."
"Ryan_Barbakins","9","2","2","18 July 2019"," The art form of Animation at its Finest!
","The Lion King is an artistic masterpiece. The combination of different colors and shapes portraying this Shakespearean story result in a cinematic experience you will not want to miss. All of the characters leave an impact on the audience through the beautiful character development and relationships. This makes the meat of the film engaging and heart-breaking.
Mufasa's death scene is sad, because we sympathize with Simba and his father's relationship that was previously established. Some consider it to be the saddest scene in cinema history, and I can't argue against that. When Nala finds Simba after many years of sorrow in the Pride Land, their love which was foreshadowed at the beginning feels deserved and romantic. Even as a kid I always found that scene compelling.
The main thing that makes this story and the characters work is the animation. Nobody would have cried over Mufasa's death if we couldn't see Simba's emotion portrayed in the animation. Every character is personified, because in animation you are able to do this. This is why I am not excited at all for the Live Action remake. You can't take away emotion from the movie and expect the audience to relate. Disney remaking their animated films in live action in general is not a good artistic idea. It is always a downgrade from the original, because you cannot portray emotion on inanimate objects or animals in the real world. That is why the animated versions are always better.
But in the end, even though the live action version will most likely be terrible, at least we still have the beauty of the original."

","If you enjoy reading my reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>First of all, this is (obviously) a SPOILER review. I mean, who hasn't seen this movie yet? If by some extraordinary circumstances you're one of those unlucky souls, stop. Spend the next hour and a half watching this animated masterpiece and come back here. I will still avoid mentioning key details because I'm just used to it, and The Lion King has so many things to compliment that I don't really need to get in-depth on spoilers. So, in case you haven't notice it through my Twitter or occasional mentions in other reviews, The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time (animated or not)!<br/><br/>I rewatched it for the 312358th time this last weekend, and I cried more than when I was just a child. That's how much this movie means to me. The sense of nostalgia plus the overwhelming emotions throughout the runtime are tear-inducing aspects that I can't simply avoid. I literally cried (waterfalls) in four (!) different scenes. The opening sequence (Circle of Life) filled my eyes with nostalgia's tears. Mufasa's tragic moment obviously wrecked me (one of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the history of cinema). Simba receiving the whole ""remember who you are"" speech from Mufasa in the clouds is incredibly inspirational and therefore worthy of some sobbing. Finally, one of the last scenes, Simba climbing his way to the top of Pride Rock with Hans Zimmer's score, leaving me absolutely destroyed.<br/><br/>And I want to pick up on that last aspect: the score. It's one of the most crucial technical features of a film, in my opinion. It can transform an ""okay"" scene into something magical or something pretty terrible, depending on what kind of score it is. Consequently, it can make a ""good"" movie turn into a ""great"" one. Hans Zimmer is one of my favorite composers ever. His soundtracks are always filled with such an epic vibe. Even if the film itself isn't that good, his scores are still able to elevate it in some way. The Lion King is one of his most memorable scores due to how emotionally compelling it is, even in the subtlest moments.<br/><br/>During the stampede sequence, the score doesn't lend you time to breathe. Its high rhythm and continuously growing music keep any viewer at the edge of the seat, waiting for it to be over. Then, when Simba descends and approaches his dad, the score is so subtle. Completely opposite to the previous sumptuous and grand sound. It's that nuance plus the impact of the scene itself that make me cry. In the last scene that I mentioned above, it's solely the score that brings in the chill-inducing tears. If Simba climbed Pride Rock with no soundtrack, it would just be a good ending. However, from the exact moment that the score fades in, it instantly turns that sequence into an epic finale. The slow-motion walk to the top, the immersive score, Simba's roar ... Damn it, I'm crying again!<br/><br/>The animation is some of Disney's best. It's not by chance that the Disney Renaissance Era (1989-1999), which was the return to form by Disney, has the best animation quality of its history, and a lot of the memorable movies that marked everyone's childhood. Its expressiveness and ease to make animals emote elevates the story and its characters. There's no need for any kind of dialogue when you can see how the characters are reacting and understand what they're feeling. The wide shots are beautiful to look at and worthy of being anyone's wallpaper even today.<br/><br/>The songs are remarkable and they influenced an entire generation. Can You Feel the Love Tonight, Circle of Life, Be Prepared, Hakuna Matata, ... Every single song is someone's favorite. The voice work is perfect. James Earl Jones gives such an outstanding vocal performance that even when discussing his career's biggest role, Darth Vader isn't the obvious choice. Jeremy Irons and his raspy voice elevate Scar as the villainous character. If you close your eyes and only hear every character's voice, without having watched the film previously, you can easily identify who's the ""bad guy"", and that's unbelievably good. Everyone else is amazing, but these two gentlemen are astonishing, and they deserve to be remembered forever as the voices of these iconic roles.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, in the end, the two pillars of every movie always matter the most: story and characters. The Lion King has an especially compelling screenplay, one that teaches its viewers how to handle loss, but also how to grow up and overcome our worst fears. It's true that most people cry watching this film, but those same people are filled with joy by the end because they accompanied Simba's journey. From being a reckless and innocent cub to becoming the king that everyone needed, while also making his father extremely proud. Even though it's a very tragic movie, Timon and Pumbaa are two hilarious characters that keep bringing some sense of happiness by delivering some well-needed laughs. Their laid-back lifestyle is something that everyone desires, but when you have responsibilities, you can't just hide from them. You must learn how to be what everyone needs you to be, without losing the essence of who you are.<br/><br/>It's a masterpiece! It doesn't matter if it's an animated film. It doesn't matter if it was ""made for kids"". People need to stop looking at animated flicks as something juvenile that only children can watch while parents can do something else. If parents watched this kind of inspirational animated movies as well, maybe the world would be a better place. The Lion King is one of my favorite films of all-time, and it's undeniably one of Disney's best original movies. From the gorgeous animation to the beautiful score, from the emotionally compelling story to the life journey Simba goes through, from the chill-inducing tearful moments to the loud laughs ... The Lion King is just perfect. Hopefully, its ""live-action"" remake will keep its essence and deliver these feelings once again."
"punch87","10","2","2","11 July 2019"," The best of Disney animation.
","With its remarkable narrative, memorable characters, stunning animation, and brilliant music, The Lion King remains the very pinnacle of Disney's animated achievements."
"caseyt-48511","10","2","2","11 July 2019"," The King, Has Returned
","What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? But I'll try. Simply, I believe The Lion King is the greatest animated movie ever made. It has some tough competition believe me. There's Wall-e, Toy Story, Spirited Away, Fantasia etc. But as an overall film, The Lion King stand above the pride.
The animation, is just beautiful. It holds up so well over 25 years later. Even in an age where 3D animation is getting better and better, the classic hand drawn look of the film never ceases to amaze me. The movements of the characters and the lush backgrounds are beyond superb and the entire animation team should be commended.
The characters are so memorable and lovable. Simba, our reluctant hero, must overcome his past and insecurities to save his people. Matthew Broderick is great as Simba as well. Scar is one of cinemas best villains. A great example of how a villain can be so in the wrong but also understandable and even sympathetic. His motives make sense, but his methods are detestable. Jeramy Irons captures all of that wonderfully in his performance. Mufasa, played by the amazing James Earl Jones, shows us how a monarch should behave. He's respectable and never takes more than he needs. He teaches his son to respect the world and the creatures who inhabit it. The rest of the cast of characters keeps us entertained throughout. Timon and Pumba are brilliant comic relief and Rafiki reminds me a lot of Yoda. He's a wise old master who helps our hero discover his calling.
The music is so great. Several songs are performed by The amazing Elton John. Tim Rice wrote the lyrics. While the songs are rightfully praised, the musical score by Hans Zimmer is one of the best in movie history, bar none. This is Lawrence of Arabia and Star Wars levels of epic music. It has so many iconic themes and it rightfully won the Oscar for best score.
It has a deceitfully simple plot, but once you unfold it more, you see the extra layers to it. The story has been interpreted in numerous ways, but I've always seen it as an allegory against unchecked and abused power. Scar is a dictator, through and through. Mufasa was a benevolent king who only took what he needed and, despite the predator-pray relationship, respected the world around him. Scar on the other hand, cares nothing for the people but only his own gain and glory. Simba realizes that he must stop Scar to save his people and return peace to the land. He has great power, so he must have great responsibility. He can't rule over the people with an iron paw but with a gentle and compassionate one. It's a story that resonates with me. I always find something different about it every time I watch it. Of course, you can interpret it any many other ways I'm sure, this is just my take.
All in all, The Lion King is a masterpiece of animated cinema. It is the Disney company's greatest achievement and is rightfully celebrated as not just one of the best animated movies ever, but as one of the best movies ever made, period."

"Lotusproduction","10","2","2","10 June 2018"," In June 1994, Disney unveiled what would become one of its most beloved animated titles, The Lion King.
","From the stealthy array of talent selected to perform the voices, including such deep-tone stalwarts as James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons, one almost expects a tragedy in the Shakespearean tradition. And, in certain aspects, The Lion King does fit this bill. Instead of the house of Hanover or Stuart, the drama centers on the reign of the mighty lion Mufasa (Jones), the king of a perfectly balanced African kingdom of animals who thrive in stunning abundance. A beneficent monarch, Mufasa, raises his young male cub, Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then Matthew Broderick as an adult) to know that ""we are all connected in the great circle of life.""<br/><br/>But, even in this teeming ecosystem, there is rancor; Mufasa's avaricious younger brother, the dark lion Scar (Irons), plots to become king. He orchestrates a bloody internecine intrigue, killing Mufasa and sending the young Simba into exile in the wilderness.<br/><br/>Essentially, The Lion King is a coming-of-age story as the young Simba grows and matures to a point where he is ready to reclaim his birthright and, more importantly, carry on the harmonious work of his father. While weighty in theme, and propelled by several remarkable moral lessons, The Lion King's screenplay (by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton) bursts along at a spectacular dramatic gait, nourished with light humor, tending romance and frisky escapades.<br/><br/>Directors Roger Allen and Rob Minkoff, respectful of both the story's epic grandeur and personal power, have fashioned a radiantly multidimensional film.<br/><br/>The crowning glories of The Lion King must be bestowed upon the legions of animators who contributed to its majestic, playful and glowing look. Composer Hans Zimmer's throbbing, percussive musical score also is a highlight, while the songs of Tim Rice and Elton John not only propel the plot but add cheerful zest to the splendid terrain of The Lion King. - Duane Byrge"

"LimeLion","10","2","2","30 April 2018"," A Film that Animated Film Makers today should take notes from.
","Lion King is not only an animation masterpiece but a film masterpiece overall. The technique of cinematography and visual story telling used in Lion King is some of the best seen in Film. Each scene provides a purpose to strike an emotion within you. Complimented by the outstanding soundtrack, the story can be easily told without a word being said, although the characters voice actors and dialogue is just as good. The animation is fluid and beautiful and feels life like in every frame. Lion King is easily some of Disney's best two-dimensional animation work.<br/><br/>The cast is charming, memorable, and their personalities never feels forced or unnecessary. Their voice actors all feel appropriate and their voices distinguish them perfectly, making them feel alive with personality. Each of the characters have their place and don't get in the way of one another with their importance to the plot. At the same time, the characters are never just there for the party. They all contribute to the overall plot and they're all likable in their own rights.<br/><br/>Simba, the main character, is the perfect token example of character growth and development throughout The Lion King. Simba starts a curious child and as he grows and discovers more about who he is, he becomes the hero of the story. <br/><br/>Nala, while the romance is not the main focus of the story, is the perfect contrast to Simba to allow him to grow and mature after his father is gone. Her character allows Simba's growth to shine and develop the pivitol theme of the story.<br/><br/>Scar is an amazing villain, to say the least. He sadistic, yet charming personality, and foul selfish character, makes him an excellent memorable villain.<br/><br/>Comedic Relief in the Lion King is perfectly done. The characters, Timon and Pumbaa, being the film's more lighthearted and comedic personalities are done with subtlety. Many times a comedic relief character can feel forced and irritating but Lion King approached these two and added more emotional depth to them. Their reactions and dialogue is appropriate to the scenario and they're much better characters for it.<br/><br/>While I do enjoy Lion King the most of all animated films, nothing is absolutely perfect and neither is The Lion King. Luckily, most of the cons with The Lion King are mostly nit picks.<br/><br/>The effects that the villain, Scar, had on Pride Rock were not shown until the end of the film. There was much build up to Scar taking over pride rock but after he had taken over he was not shown in the film for quite some time.<br/><br/>The third hyena character of the hyena trio, Ed, is nothing more than a stereotypical funny idiot character. He's only supposed to be ""funny"" because he is an idiot. This is a one-dimensional, and forgettable character.<br/><br/>Simba's mother, Sarabi, had very few screen time. This is a flaw in my opinion, as she was the last thread of leadership for the Pride Rock lions under scar's rule aside from Nala. It would've added more to her character and would have made her more memorable of a character. <br/><br/>Aside from these few nitpicks, The Lion King is absolute masterpiece and should be regarded as such. The Lion King is a film, modern animated film makers should be taking notes from."

"TheMovieDiorama","9","2","2","26 February 2018"," The Lion King is one of Disney's greatest animated musicals.
","If I was tasked to rank every Disney animation, this universally beloved feature would most definitely be in the upper echelon. It's quite rare these days to find someone who has not seen this...and if you haven't well, I'm disappointed in you. The story revolves around the 'Circle of Life', paraphrasing nature's way of taking and giving back life to earth. As current lion king Mufasa teaches his son Simba how to be a great king, his brother Scar secretly plans to obtain the throne of Pride Rock for himself. There's not much I can say that everybody else hasn't mentioned. Hans Zimmer composing yet another epic orchestral masterpiece. The first time that the music and animation blended together in perfect harmony. Elton John and Tim Rice's musical numbers are some of the best Disney has to offer. Literally every song is memorable, my personal favourite being ""Just Can't Wait To Be King"". The animation is absolutely beautiful and still holds well even by today's standards. The effortless blend of red sunsets and green grassy plains. The computer animation used during the wildebeest stampede might look slightly dated, but it doesn't detract from the enjoyment to be had here. Then we come to the voice acting...oh God damn it's perfect. James Earl Jones as Mufasa was inspired. Jeremy Irons as Scar was sensational. Heck, even Rowan Atkinson as Zazu worked! Every actor provided a voice that gave life to the animation. Not a single voice felt out of place. A nice light comedic script to balance the more powerful themes it conveys such as fatherhood, death and facing your past. The inclusion of Timon and Pumbaa was just the comedy the film required, and I'm sure children will adore these two. Whilst this is undoubtedly one of Disney's best, I do find the third act slightly unmemorable compared to the amazing first two acts. It just feels slightly rushed and concludes far too rapidly. Minor gripe aside, The Lion King is a film that is indefinitely adored by everyone."

","For a long time I have been deeply thinking about what I really think of The Lion King. After watching all the animated Disney movies I can see its brilliance, even though it isn't a personal favorite of mine and there are other animated Disney movies I think deserve more attention.<br/><br/>Let me make it clear. TLK is among the most beautifully animated Disney movies. The stampede scene is just huge and intimidating, the intro scene is by far the most iconic scene from any Disney movie along with one of the most iconic and grandest songs ever to be in a movie. The backgrounds are amazing, the whole animation aspect of it is amazing. On that spot it is an undoubted masterpiece.<br/><br/>And I must admit that the culmination of the stampede scene with Simba, Mufasa and Scar will for ever be the most emotionally charged scene in a Disney movie if not in a movie in general.<br/><br/>The voice acting is good. James Earl Jones is never a disappointment with his booming voice. Jeremy Irons does make a great, slimy, backstabbing, power hungry villain, but falls a little flat when he comes to power compared to both earlier power hungry villains like Maleficent and Jafar and my personal favorite Frollo. But that's a nit-pick, because story-wise it's essential, because we see how young Simba dreams of being a king who can do whatever he wants and that is what Scar turns into when he comes to power.<br/><br/>""The Circle of Life"" which as mentioned before is perhaps the grandest Disney song ever and one of the most iconic openings of any movie. Not just in Disney, but in general. The rest of the music is catchy and memorable and serves the story well. I am not as fond of ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" as I am of earlier love songs like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""A Whole New World"" simply because the love aspect is kind of disturbing since lions live in prides which consist of family, so therefore making Simba and Nala relatives. ""Be Prepared"" has a great visual appeal and serves the scene well, but when I listen to it on its own it comes off as just another ""I-want-power-because-I'm-evil"" song. The african inspiration in the music is amazing, nothing more to say.<br/><br/>I must admit that I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa, but I don't hate them, not at all. They raised Simba, but the fact that they had a tv-show and a direct-to-video film, the latter which I think is garbage, just made me think badly of them.<br/><br/>It is my personal opinion. I feel at times TLK is a little overrated, but it is undoubtedly a great movie."
"reshmasudhakar","10","2","2","18 June 2017"," ""The Lion King""- An epic animated movie
","The Disney's ""The Lion King"" is an animated musical film directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and produced by Dan Hahn in 1994. This movie was basically an inspiration from William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The Lion King, in my opinion, is an epic movie with a full package of adventures in life. It is a movie filled with happiness, love, family, emotions, lessons etc. The movie is generally based on the subject or theme 'Authority'. In the beginning introduction song, we can see that the entire forest bows down to one true dedicated King, Mufasa the Lion, as we all know, Lion is the King of the Jungle. The movie tells us the story of a King, Mufasa and his son, Simba who is the next king to be. After an unfortunate incident happened to Mufasa, Scar his brother guilty Simba into thinking that he was the reason for the incident. This makes Simba leave his kingdom and run away from his family. The journey of Simba succeeding his father's pride land is the movie, 'The Lion King'. 'The Lion King' is known as the Disney's best ever animation film and I couldn't agree more. To begin with, the voices done for every character suits their personality. The king, Mufasa's voice describe him as a king- strong and ruling, his brother and/or the evil uncle's voice has the grudge, just as his character in the movie. Zazu the bird's character is more toward the funny side so does his voice. The softness and humor in Rafiki's voice represented his character as a caring, fun-filled well-wisher. The roles that each character of the movie represents have done a great job in acting. Since it is a musical film, the voices have higher expectations and I believe that this movie has met with all the expectations. When it comes to animation, it is important to make everything seem so perfect, otherwise, it is easy to point out the mistakes. In that case, this movie has done its best job. I believe that no matter how great the story is, it wouldn't attract or reach the audience if the cinematography is a failure. We all have witnessed the grand success of the film. I would like to talk about the two techniques that I admired about the movie: camera angle, camera movement of the film. Camera angles were extraordinary in this movie. Starting from introduction scene, where Rafiki lifts Simba to show the world that the future king has been born, the angle was so perfect that along with the song, it definitely gives a goosebumps moment. The camera movement throughout the movie was an eye treat to the audience. Especially during the songs, the flow in the movement will definitely make everyone want to dance. Overall, 'The Lion King' has met with all the requirements for a fun-filled entertainment package."

","I agree with the above opinions, the film is a wonderful story about love and friendship. It is dedicated at people of all ages. The plot is surprising and interesting. While watching, the viewer can feel attaches to the character. Dialogues are very funny at times, but there are also sad moments that cause some tears. Ideal film for the whole family, but also for lonely evenings. Despite many years, animations in this film look beautiful and surprisingly fresh. The music used in the movie is also great. This movie has been a huge success for Disney. I think everyone should see him at least once."

"eleagece","10","2","2","29 January 2017"," Disney's best
","The Lion King has everything: Hans Zimmer's music, the delicious animation and the wonderful drawings, the superb acting with Mufasa on top and of course the great story this movie tells: it's about life and its stages, the hardness of loss and the difficulty in changing, it's about not running away from your problems, about believing in yourself, about evil, friendship, justice and love...<br/><br/>In the 90s Disney movies got an unusual balance: the stories weren't yet the postmodern crap we have today and they had overcome the rancidity from before. The technology was still paper and pencil and the brand new technologies were just used to create epic scenes from scratch. It's not strange that from The little Mermaid (1989) to Tarzan (1999) it was Disney's second youth and just at the half of the decade they peaked with The Lion King (1994).<br/><br/>If in 2017 we see Bambi (1942) as a timeless classic I'm sure that in 2070 people will see The Lion King the same way. And that is huge"

When Timon leaves his colony because he doesn't fit in, he meets the lonely Pumbaa. Together Timon and Pumbaa search for a new home, having adventures along the way and eventually meeting up with lion prince Simba (Matthew Broderick), who is in exile from his home and must challenge the evil Scar for the title of Lion King. <br/><br/>really i enjoyed the movie very much <br/><br/>and its a impressive movie also <3 <br/><br/>i will never forgot these memories <br/><br/>Most interest thing my nieces fab movie I lion king <br/><br/>The Lion King was released on June 15, 1994, to a positive reaction from critics, who praised the film for its music, story and animation; it finished its run as the highest-grossing release of 1994. Following a 3D re-release in 2011, with earnings of over US $968 million worldwide as of 2011, the film is the highest- grossing hand-drawn animated film in history, the highest-grossing 2D animated film in the United States, the sixth highest-grossing animated film of all time, and the 29th-highest-grossing feature film of all time. The Lion King garnered two Academy Awards for its achievement in music and the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. The film has led to many derived works, such as a Broadway adaptation; two direct-to-video follow-ups—the sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride (1998) and the prequel/parallel The Lion King 1½ (2004)—and two television series, Timon and Pumbaa and The Lion Guard.<br/><br/>The Lion King is a 1994 American animated epic musical film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 32nd animated feature in the Walt Disney Animated Classics series. The story takes place in a kingdom of lions in Africa, and was influenced by William Shakespeare's Hamlet. The film was produced during a period known as the Disney Renaissance. The Lion King was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, produced by Don Hahn, and has a screenplay credited to Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton. Its original songs were written by composer Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, and original scores were written by Hans Zimmer. The film features an ensemble voice cast that includes Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkinson, Robert Guillaume, Madge Sinclair, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings.<br/><br/>The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young lion who is to succeed his father, Mufasa, as king; however, after Simba's uncle Scar murders Mufasa, Simba is manipulated into thinking he was responsible and flees into exile in shame and despair. Upon maturation living with two wastrels, Simba is given some valuable perspective from his childhood friend, Nala, and his shaman, Rafiki, before returning to challenge Scar to end his tyranny.<br/><br/>Development of The Lion King began in 1988 during a meeting between Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider while promoting Oliver & Company in Europe. Thomas Disch wrote a film treatment, and Woolverton developed the first scripts while George Scribner was signed on as director, being later joined by Allers. Production began in 1991 concurrently with Pocahontas, which wound up attracting most of Disney's top animators. Some time after the staff traveled to Hell's Gate National Park in Kenya to research on the film's setting and animals, Scribner left production disagreeing with the decision to turn the film into a musical, and was replaced by Minkoff. When Hahn joined the project, he was dissatisfied with the script and the story was promptly rewritten. Nearly 20 minutes of animation sequences were produced at Disney-MGM Studios in Florida. Computer animation was also used in several scenes, most notably in the wildebeest stampede sequence."

","This has grossed $987.5 million worldwide. Considering it a better movie than the Wild. Anyways, let's talk about the movie. In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion rules over the animals as king. The birth of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi's son Simba creates envy and resentment in Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, who knows his nephew now replaces him as heir to the throne. After Simba has grown into a young cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and the Circle of Life. Later that day, Scar tricks Simba and his best friend Nala into exploring a forbidden elephant graveyard, despite the protests of Mufasa's hornbill majordomo Zazu. At the graveyard, three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai and Ed attack the cubs before Mufasa, alerted by Zazu, rescues them and forgives Simba for his actions. That night, the hyenas, who are allied with Scar, plot with him to kill Mufasa and Simba. The next day Scar lures Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there while he gets Mufasa. On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into the gorge. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, where he is trampled to death. After Simba finds Mufasa's body, Scar convinces him he was responsible for his father's death and advises Simba to flee the kingdom. As Simba leaves, Scar orders Shenzi, Banzai and Ed to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. That night, Scar announces to the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing a pack of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands. After running far away, Simba collapses from exhaustion in a desert. Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog, find him and nurse him back to health. Simba subsequently grows up with them in the jungle, living a carefree life with his friends under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). When he is a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reconcile and fall in love. Nala urges Simba to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off, leaving Nala disappointed and angry. As Simba exits the jungle, he encounters Mufasa's mandrill friend and adviser, Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that Mufasa is ""alive"" and takes him to a pond. There Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as the king of the Pride Lands. Simba realizes he can no longer run from his past and goes home. Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa join him, and agree to help him fight. At the Pride Lands, Simba sees Scar hit Sarabi and confronts him, but Scar taunts Simba over his ""part"" in Mufasa's death. However, when Scar pushes Simba to the edge of Pride Rock, he reveals that he killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba roars back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, insisting that he is family and placing the blame on the hyenas. Simba no longer believes Scar, but spares his life on the grounds of forever leaving the Pride Lands. Scar appears to comply, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce fight, Simba throws his uncle off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and eaten alive by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba ascends to the top of Pride Rock and takes over the kingdom as the rain falls again. Sometime later, with Pride Rock restored to its former glory, Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands, and the Circle of Life continues."

Love it even to this day.If you have young children, you probably know the plot but I will not spoil that in this review. The voice actors are awesome in their delivery and really drives the emotions home. The story is not an original trope, but it still holds well in the test of time. If you haven't seen this film in a while, you should check this out with a new generation of fans. This movie makes for a good family night film or a good conversation piece among a group of film and animation enthusiasts. Again, a great film for the whole family.

Right from the start you want to know the story of the adorable baby lion. It has very memorable characters including Simba of course, and Timon and Pumba are hilarious sidekicks. As a child I remember being frightened by the villain, Scar. The music is by far the best part of this movie. After all these years, I can still sing along. ""Hakuna Matata,"" which means no worries, will be a favorite for many. I use ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" as a lullaby for my baby.

I think that it is quite educational for every person who watches that!Despite it analyzes an animal kingdom, you can easily locate a man society in which everyone tries to be on the highest level without calculating the other ones, no matter if they are relatives or friends or anything else. Important values presented in this movie such as friendship, co-operation, love, anti-racism messages and -of course- family! Last but not least, is the music of the film.

It also depresses me on how Simba thinks it's all his fault. But then he grows up and Nala finds him. She tells him what Scar has done to Pride Rock,Simba becomes all fierce and sexy. Then Simba goes back with Nala and brings Timon and Pumbaa with him. The diversion that Timon and Pumbaa create is hilarious. If I could watch it on VHS again, I would. Also if you're looking for a Disney film for a younger child, I would suggest this one."

","There are too many good things to say about this movie. Even though it is technically an original story by Disney, I personally consider it the definitive version of Shakespeare's Hamlet. And they don't even sugar coat it that much. Not like in Bambi, where they just hint at the mother dying. Here you actually SEE the body. The characters are all likable, all the way down to the two best, Timon and Pumbaa. As a kid, I always found them incredibly funny. The villain is probably for me the best Disney has ever done as well. Scar really has that clever acting of Jeremy Irons and his interaction with James Earl Jones is extremely believable. And I real like the clever message it's sending through the scene with Rafiki and Simba. ""The past can hurt. But the way I see it you can either run from it or... learn from it."" The songs are all memorable, even down to my favorite ""Circle of Life"" and the animation is a brilliant combination of traditional with a little CG thrown here or there. God bless this movie. It is nothing short of an epic masterpiece."

"kaitlintomasello","10","2","2","14 October 2015"," Never Listen to Your Sketchy Uncle
","The story opens well and makes you begin to care for the animals who live at Pride Rock. You feel like Symba is kind of spoiled (even though there are only 3 male lions in all the Pride Lands). The story introduces Nala and Symba's relationship as ""just friends"" which we all know that in a Disney Movie it means they will get married by the end. When Mufasa died, the world cried. Next, the third male lion takes over Pride Rock (since no other males are there to challenge him.) Symba has been forced to live with two hooligans in the wild growing up eating bugs. That is not healthy for a growing lion. He needed real meat, which is probably why Symba was a lot smaller than his dad. When Symba finally comes back, him and the lionesses fight with an army of thousands of hyenas, somehow winning. But who cares! Scar is eaten alive for his betrayal of the hyenas and eventually the damage of years of drought and fire and famine are replaced in a very short amount of time. They all lived happily ever after. <br/><br/>The movie The Lion King was an excellent movie that could be watched many times over. It gave amazing life lessons, like how to find who you are and never to listen it your sketch uncle. Over all this movie can emotionally move pretty much everyone, if it doesn't then you likely have no soul."

He wants to be just like his dad, and be just as brave as his dad. One day, Mufasa gets a message about a herd of animals being on the move and it is to concern the King. The King sees his son clenched to a branch hanging on for his dear life. Mufasa goes to save his son, and in the process, his brother Scar chose to murder him instead of saving his life. Simba did not see Scar kill his father so Scar simply blamed Simba for his death. He forced Simba to run away and never come back. <br/><br/>Simba gets out of the pride lands and goes to search for his own identity and find who he really is. He hates himself because he believes he has killed his father. Simba then meets Timon and Pumbaa. Timon and Pumbaa are a meerkat and a warthog. They welcomed Simba and told Simba about themselves by singing a song ""Hakuna Matata."" One day, Simba was out and ran into a beautiful lady lion.

","This film tells the story of Simba, a lion cub who is son of Mufasa, the king of the savanna. Directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff, two veterans of Disney, featured several well-known actors to the voices of the English version, as Matthew Broderick (adult Simba), James Earl Jones (Mufasa), Jeremy Irons (Scar, the villain) Rowan Atkinson (Zazu, the king's collaborator) and Whoopi Goldberg (Shenzi, one of the hyenas).<br/><br/>It is one of the biggest hits in the history of Disney studios so far, a magical film that tells a story of a young cub who, after being victim of a tragedy and family hatreds, goes in search of his place in the world. And he will have the help of two of the most beloved Disney characters: Timon and Pumba, an unlikely (a meerkat and a warthog) but inseparable pair of friends. The songs of this movie were written and composed by Tim Rice, Sir Elton John and Hans Zimmer. Some of them have become big hits which are still remembered and sung, especially ""I Just Can not Wait To Be King"", ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Can you feel the love tonight"".<br/><br/>For all this reasons, ""The Lion King"" is a timeless film which will be seen and remembered by generations children and adults, while there is cinema."

","The Lion King will forever be my favorite Disney movie.<br/><br/>The scenes can be very emotional at times, the scenes can make you smile and laugh, the scenes can make you cry. This is the only movie that has gotten me to bawl my eyes out, and that's saying something because I rarely ever cry. The movie also shows some romantic scenes, but, for once, the two individuals knew each other as kids and don't fall in love at first sight, they already loved each other and they admit it to each other at that point. The movie shows many funny scenes, and some can give great inspiration if you want some new comebacks to use in real-life -cough couch- the hyena scenes. There's also a lot of singing in this movie, but, really, who doesn't love singing wild animals?<br/><br/>This is also a family movie, so you can sit down as a teenager with your grandparents or as a parent with your younger children, and it's certain that everyone will enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie for everyone, as well as its sequel! <3"
"mechtamizh","8","2","2","3 July 2015"," Brilliant story line
","Excellent movie which I would cherish all through my life. The whole movie is well scripted with screenplay smoothly flowing like a river. The narrators have given life to the characters through their graceful voices. This movie was a benchmark for all the animated cartoons featured later in the history of films. The movie revolves around the emotions of father lion towards its cub and vice versa. This movie is definitely one among st the favorites of 90's kids. I was really moved and touched by the climax sequence and the scene where the dad lion will be assassinated.Though there are sequels made, my favorite still remains this one."
"sharky_55","9","2","2","26 June 2015"," Through despair and hope
","When marketing The Lion King for the first time way back in 1994, Disney made the brave decision to have its first cinematic trailer consisting entirely of the opening sequence of the film. It's a decision that highlighted the enormous strength and beauty of that opening scene where the animals of the Pridelands gather for the coronation of young Simba while the iconic Circle of Life accompanies his introduction. It's a gorgeous spectacle of animation and music which immediately grips the audience's attention and establishes the setting. The cell-shaded 2D animation of the wide range of animals combines easily with the matte painted backgrounds which add visual depth and beautiful scenery in likes of waterholes, mountain ranges, lush forests and waterfalls. The foreground and background blend seamlessly and the world of The Lion King is endlessly alive and breathing even with its limited selection of camera movements. It's at once more inviting than the relatively sterile 3D environments of some more modern Disney works (Big Hero 6 comes to mind). <br/><br/>The film's soundtrack is similarly impressive. Elton John and Tim Rice combine to bring five original songs that still draw applause, recognition and sing-a-longs even two decades later. The opening Zulu choral vocals of The Circle of Life are powerful and evocative, while the animated choreography that combines with I Just Can't Wait to Be King makes for a jaunty upbeat tune. Hans Zimmer's score goes from strength to strength, drawing upon traditional African choral themes and percussion which resonates during the film's emotional moments. <br/><br/>The voice acting is unique and enduring. The booming bass tones of James Earl Jones makes for a imposing father figure in Mufusa, in contrast to Jeremy Irons' Scar, rich with haughty disdain for his pride-mates. A fun filled exile in the middle of the film is characterised by that of the jovial Timon and Pumbaa, while young Simba's voice grows into the deeper tones of Matthew Broderick, during an excellent and colour filled montage over Hakuna Matata. The three hyena cronies of Scar are also distinct despite their ugly cloned appearances, boasting the voice work of Whoopi Goldberg, Marin and Cummings as the overly enthusiastic, sassy and hot-headed henchmen. <br/><br/>The story is a simple if not effective one, drawing upon similar themes from Hamlet. It's a tale of Simba's quest for redemption and revenge after being falsely exiled for his father's death. The traditional coming of age plot is well paced and is earmarked by several deeply emotional moments, the most significant of those being Simba's grief at the realisation of his father's death (Jonathan Taylor Thomas's voice acting in this scene is heartbreaking). There's plenty of emotional depth in the portrayal of Simba through the themes of ostracization, loss, guilt and growing up which makes this film appropriate for both adult and children alike. The Lion King has a rightful place in Disney's elite as a vibrant, poignant and visually immersive film."
"hufft-61896","10","2","2","22 April 2015"," Greatest Movie ever made!
","The Lion King is not only my favorite Disney movie, it's my favorite movie PERIOD. The film was a major box office success and won several academy awards, including ""Best Original Song"". And for darn good reason. I have loved The Lion King from the moment I first watched it as a kid. The good stuff in this film is really good. Oh, man, where do I begin? First of all, the story. <br/><br/>I like how this movie isn't based on a book or fairy tale. I also love how this film manages to accomplish a pretty solid story when there are no people in this movie, just animals. Now that I mentioned that, I should say that the characters are memorable. Simba is fun to watch, particularly as a kid. Mufasa is also a very like able character. The hyenas are funny and Timon and Pumbaa make great comic relief. Scar was also a very well-done villain. <br/><br/>The voice-acting here is terrific. All the actors play who they are supposed to be perfectly. I also loved the animation in this movie. This is the best-looking hand-drawn animated film. It looks best in scenes like the opening scene, the stampede, and the battle between Simba and Scar. I also LOVED the songs. Every one is great to listen to, and my favorite is ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"". <br/><br/>I don't know what more to say. I adore it. I've seen it a million times and plan on watching it a million times more."

","This movie truly is a classic and one of the best films I have ever seen, even after 21 years since its release. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious and so is Rafiki the baboon.<br/><br/>The story of growing up between Simba and Mufasa is especially touching and can teach a lot to us today. And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.<br/><br/>And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great. This movie has a great voice cast, awesome animation, a great storyline, and as with all of the early to mid 90s Disney films, an absolutely perfect soundtrack.<br/><br/>Truly deserving of its tag as Disney's best film until Frozen, it will always be a classic to me."

","Honestly I have a cousin with a mental disorder who would watch this movie over and over and at that time my mother was pregnant with me and ever since i was born i grew up watching both The Lion King and Lion King 2 and i'm 16 almost 17 and i still watch this movie like a thousand times. I love how they show us many different morals in life in a unique way; like when Mufasa explains the circle of life to Simba and how we are all one. Also when Mufasa explains to Simba that There will be a time where he has to leave (death) and Simba would have to take over. Mufasa also shows that it takes great responsibility to be King and there are moments where even the brave get scared. It also shows that when we're young we get carried away with growing up and we want to change things when we grow up but when we get older then we realize the purpose on why it was the way it is. Finally teaching running away from your problems isn't the solution because it will catch up to you (when Nala goes to look for food in the oasis where Simba had been living since he ran away)"

""It means no worries, for the rest of your days. It's our problem free, philosophy, Hakuna Matata."" I even re-watched the movie when it came back out into theaters in 3D!

Also the DVD purchase would be a great gift for any Disney fan. The story in the Lion King is easy to follow and suspenseful for children and adults. The part in the movie when the father dies is quite sad and may make smaller children upset. The words in the music are catchy and fun to sing along with.

"classicsoncall","8","2","2","17 November 2014"," ""...we are all connected in the great circle of life"".
","If this came out when I was a kid it would have been my favorite Disney film. My generation had ""Lady and the Tramp"" (1955) and ""101 Dalmations"" (1961). Me, I was always fascinated by wild animals and when it comes to lions, the idea that they were the 'King of Beasts' was icing on the cake. That's why I never missed a Tarzan or Jungle Jim flick when they came on TV back in the day.<br/><br/>Well I'm not a kid anymore, so I guess there's no reason to qualify it. This can still be my favorite Disney movie. There are some good lessons here for youngsters, the whole circle of life business and the idea that being brave doesn't mean you have to go looking for trouble. Animation wise it resembles a lot of the older Disney pictures, only natural since it was the last of their hand drawn features. There's a simplicity to the style that's missing from the high tech wizardry of present day animated films. I don't think that means there's a better or worse here, times and technology change so why not movies.<br/><br/>Cool comical characters like Timon and Pumbaa, and regal heroes like Mufasa and the adult Simba make this a fun picture. I especially liked the scene where Simba as a cub stepped in his father's footprint making him realize he had big paws to fill someday. The conflict with Scar and the hyenas was positioned well to help Simba understand that early failure is not indicative of future success. Colorful, quick paced and energetic, ""The Lion King"" is a delightful film experience."

I believe that each of us has cried in the scene where Simba's father is killed by Scar, and everyone rejoiced at the end of the movie when Simba gets justice. Each of us also laughed in every scene with Timon and Pumba. Two very different animals but this does not prevent them from being friends.

"lagudafuad","8","2","2","27 December 2012"," No worries this is a classic
","Hakuna Matata, the catchphrase that this movie made many say for years, the movie is full of action and fun, that has made it one of the best 2D animation one could see, the movie dialogue is also intriguing and funny, the movie which seems to be in three parts, the first being Simba's life in Pride rock, his life with Timon and Pumbaa where he loses some of his Lion instincts and the last part where he goes back to Pride rock to reclaim his throne. <br/><br/>The Lion King was the first Disney animated feature to be a total original story, all other animations before it have been based on an already existing work. The idea of the movie was conceived during the promotion of Oliver & Company, the idea was basic: a story about animals that will be set in Africa. The filmmakers, then went ahead to build the story taking ideas from the lives of Joseph and Moses (from the Bible) and William Shakespeare's Hamlet.<br/><br/>The movie production began during the time of the production of Pocahontas, many of the animators and directors at Disney felt that not many people will want to sit and watch a little Lion cub who is framed for murder (murder of his father) by his uncle, for that reason alone many of the animators wanted to work on Pocahontas instead, but to their surprise although both were financially successful, Lion King made more money (it has become the highest grossing 2D animation ever) and received more positive reviews.<br/><br/>The voice casting for Lion King, was full of stars from Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg (just to mention a few) and even Disney's long time voice artist Jim Cummings was also available in this unending list of star voice actors.<br/><br/>The movie plot of Lion king is about a lion cub named Simba who gets framed for murdering his father (Mufasa voiced by James Earl Jones) by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons). Simba runs away from his right as heir to the throne and meets and befriends a meerkat, Timon (Nathan Lane) and a warthog Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella). Things were going well but the past that Simba ran from found him where he was hiding and now Simba (Matthew Broderick) has to go back to Pride Rock to face his past.<br/><br/>Lion King is a nice animation to own and watch again. Two home video sequels were done of the movie, The Lion King 2 (not worth watching at all) and The Lion King 11/2 (good enough to be seen), and a series about Timon and Pumbaa was also done, which was amusing.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"info-130-288696","Null","2","2","5 October 2011"," The Lion King 3D: a reissue that feels like a new release
","For Disney The Lion King really is the cat that got the cream. Since the original film opened 17 years ago the film has taken $4.6 billion worldwide and has spawned one of the most successful shows in Broadway history.<br/><br/>With such success one could be forgiven for thinking that the film's new release in 3D was just Disney finding a way of milking a successful franchise. Yet with The Lion King it doesn't feel this way.<br/><br/>The story deserves to be told again for a new audience. Those who grew up with this film will perhaps now have children of their own, or merely want to escape back to their childhood. Either way The Lion King has aged well, the story is as compelling, as emotional and as funny as ever.<br/><br/>This stems from its characters, the story's moral heart and the performances which bring it all to life. Watch any other Disney film and you will struggle to find a character as evil as Scar, nor a scene as moving as Simba's last with his father Mufasa. The cast including Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick and Rowan Atkinson deliver each line with relish.<br/><br/>Yet at the risk of stating the obvious, it is Hans Zimmer's soundtrack and Elton John/Tim Rice's songs which really makes the film sing. People across the world may know the words to ""Hakuna Matata"", ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"", but what's forgotten is how important they are to the story and how well the whole film fits together with its musical moments.<br/><br/>However despite its status as a timeless classic 3D doesn't work particularly well with the 2D animations of old Disney films. For a start the characters still sing about a circle of life rather than a sphere. To be serious, if you watch this film expecting to have to cower to avoid a herd of wildebeest then you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>But the 3D does have its own charms, different to other 3D films. There is theatricality about this version of The Lion King that allows you to take in the beauty of the African backdrop whilst still focussing on the story front of stage. It makes each scene's colours more vibrant, stopping a brilliant story beginning to look visually tired and old.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that The Lion King came out 17 years ago, watching this reissue feels like a new release. That is partly due to the facelift Disney has given it but really it is because it was such a good film in the first place. For that alone watching Simba's journey again is well worthwhile.<br/><br/>Verdict:  With a story this good Disney could do little wrong and they haven't.<br/><br/>For more reviews read http://www.theupcoming.co.uk"

","This is a great family movie that takes viewers through and makes us think about the circle of life. It makes us think about how our choices affect those around us. It might bring up the idea of death a little early for real young children. Mufasa's death while tragic shows a father's love and what he will do to protect his child all the while showing how greed and the need for power (Skar) can destroy families (in this case the pride). Yes, it is cartoon form, and this takes the edge off the subject since they are fictional characters.

I normally do not care for musical numbers, but these were excellent enough to draw me in. James Earl Jones does excellent voice work as Simba's proud and powerful father. It is more dramatically staged than any previous animated film and still remains a powerful work of art to this very day.

"gigan-92","10","2","2","16 December 2010"," Childhood Gem
","Is there anyone who didn't love this film? Besides the one sentence/one-star reviews that always bring a film down these days? Probably one of Disney's greatest animated films ever, easily surpassing the many before it and many after it. The story is dynamic and much more involving than alas ""Cinderella"", ""Beauty and the Best"", and plenty of others that I not need say. Many Disney films seem to me oh so similar in premise and characters, this one stand s out as a truly unique and very different tale. And with the voice talents of Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Rowan Atkinson, plus many, many others, the characters seemed much more human to me than the repeated after repeated princess in distress who is best friends with nature as well.how dull! And to think these are merely anthropomorphic animals, how ironic. In my humble opinion, this also Matthew Broderick's best performance ever.<br/><br/>And as if having Hans Zimmer score the film wasn't a grand achievement in itself, Elton John and Tim Rice add to the score beautifully. The end result is a tale so epic if you look at it from a glance it evokes the scope of a Greek tragedy. In fact, amongst the many over-rated Disney Renaissance era films, this is one of the few where I can watch it again and again without ever tiring of it."

"ssvikas","8","2","2","10 January 2010"," A fine animated story with lively characters and lovely music!
","One of those 90’s classics that I had enjoyed during my schooldays was a beauty to watch again recently. Though the story is just an odd family drama where the less capable brother overthrows the king by deceit while his son runs away; only to return years later to undo the injustice and regain his throne. Where “Lion King” excels is getting this story out of animated animals and put in a way that kids would love.<br/><br/>Pride Rock in Africa is where the earth is green and animals live in peace in the reign of the great lion Mufasa (James Earl Jones) who is assisted by an old wise monkey Rafiki and a loyal bird Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Plotting with the hyenas, Scar (Jeremy Irons) causes a wildebeest stampede and kills Mufasa while Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/ Matthew Broderick) takes the blame for putting his father in fatality’s way.<br/><br/>Consequently, Simba runs away to a distant land where he grows up in the company of Timon, a meerkat and Pumba a warthog, characters so lively that their “Hakuna Matata”, the no-worry song is one of its biggest hits with its infectious positivity. In a chance encounter with his former playmate and destined lover Nala reminds him of his unfinished business at home. Wiser now, Simba returns to claim his due!<br/><br/>Made in times that can nostalgically be remembered as the days when animation still had the old artistic beauty with just the right mix of CGI. “Beauty and the Beast” and “Anastasia” too come from a similar time and won accolades for their Music. Though its sequels or games weren’t too appealing, the original is still a masterpiece. You can’t just miss those adorable characters, each filled with life and character! <br/><br/>No description of “Lion King” can be complete without a befitting praise to its songs. While Hans Zimmer won the Oscar for the best score, Elton John’s Can You Feel the Love Tonight in the credits is its best song. The judicious mix of African vocals in “Circle of Life” the deep darkness of “Be Prepared” and childish fun of “Can’t wait to be king” keep ringing much after the movie is over and even after years pass by! <br/><br/>With its short runtime of just over an hour, it doesn’t take away much of your time but doesn’t at all fail to take you into itself. Neatly edited, there is never a time that you get bored with it. Though technology has moved light years after Lion King, I’d still say that if you have missed watching it back then, better run and grab the DVD!"

","The Lion King has always served as my all time favorite movie. It captures the childhood memories you long for as you continuously grow older. It's simplistic ability to entertain and provoke joyful feelings is something rarely found in movies currently being made. The lesson of believing in yourself, and overcoming struggles is important for kids to learn. It teaches one about the ability to trust, but also to know that this world is not perfect. The characters will leave your stomach hurting from the laughter produced, and the songs will have you singing. The animation is nothing to be overlooked, and its rather perfect nature will leave you in awe. There is no contest that this movie will forever remain a classic.

"jerekra","10","2","2","4 August 2009"," Tremendously Moving Film.
","The Lion King is one of the best animated films that I have seen along with Aladdin. It is highly moving and one of the most emotional films that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Simba is a young lion who is the heir apparent as King of the pridelands to his father Mufasa. However his evil Uncle Scar wants to be king. When tragedy hits Simba, he leaves the pridelands despite the fact that it is his destiny to be the next king.<br/><br/>As far as animation goes, this is legendary. All of the animals look like they do in real life. The scenery is amazing.<br/><br/>The songs are good also, not nearly to the level of Aladdins songs, but pretty good. However the non singing music in the background is outstanding.<br/><br/>As far as villains go, I think Scar has to be one of the most evil. He is an evil lion who alligns with HYENAS!!!! In case you are not well informed as far as animals go, Hyenas and Lions are bitter enemies who hate each other. The idea of a lion turning his back on lion kind and alligning with hyenas is unthinkable. One of the most evil villains who does help make a great conflict.<br/><br/>All of the characters are great. Especially Mufasa, voiced by legendary James Earl Jones. The lessons that he tries to teach his son are phenomenal and ones that envoke a lot of emotion. This film has a lot of moments that are tremondously moving and make me want to cry at parts. Also it has the saddest moment in movie history in my opinion, I wont give it away though.<br/><br/>As far as voice acting goes, this film has the best cast to my knowledge. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Johnathon Taylor Thomas, and many other great voices.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best films that I have ever seen. Highly recommended."
"blackburnj-1","10","2","2","8 July 2009"," An absolute classic
","This was Disney's B-movie production. The studio was convinced that the following year's ""Pocahontas"" was going to rake in the cash and the praise. However, armed with a story lifted from ""Hamlet"" and some of the all-time great Disney songs, ""The Lion King"" became the last great film to come out of Disney's hand-drawn animations, and the last in a golden era which included ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"". The young generation who grew up with this film have a level of affection for it that very few films have achieved. Their parents have a similar fondness for it. Now, some years on, that young generation can appreciate it as a family film once more with their children, but can also appreciate the superior level of craft which is in this film.<br/><br/>From the breathtaking opening, the power of the songs is immediately apparent. ""The Circle of Life"" with the sun breaking across the plain is striking and iconic, for parent and child alike. The energy of ""I just can't wait to be king"" is contrasted with the scheming moodiness of ""Be Prepared"". ""Hakuna Matata"" is still adored and is delightfully witty (it has the most intelligent fart joke ever) and ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" is up there with ""Beauty and the Beast"" in the pantheon of great Disney love songs.<br/><br/>The songs complement a story which is simple, effective and daring. Like many of the best Disney films, there is darkness here that the young viewer can deal with but gives the film added depth. The death of Mufasa can still bring the butchest teenager to tears. However, there is also a wealth of humour which ranges from intelligent and witty to absurd and hilarious (""What do you want me to do? Dress in drag and do the hula?""). Also, this is a proper story. The trials of Simba are thoroughly engaging and the world he finds himself in is richly populated by entertaining characters. The stand outs are the comic Timon and Pumbaa and Jeremy Irons's deliciously voiced villain, Scar (""I'm surrounded by idiots."").<br/><br/>The film is also a fine example of technical class. It looks stunning – one of Disney's most beautifully drawn films – has a fine score by Hans Zimmer to accompany the award winning songs and was a major step forward in CG effects – the thrilling stampede sequence being almost entirely created in computers.<br/><br/>This was a generation defining film, far superior and far more successful than ""Pocahontas"" (the VHS was the highest seller of all time). It was and is adored by millions. It has been somewhat forgotten, particularly after the advent of CG animation two years later with the magnificent ""Toy Story"". This film, however, deserves better as it is an undoubted classic to be enjoyed by young and old alike."

","No other Disney movie will get the appreciation I give to this marvelous work of art. In the future, this will be a movie I will treasure with my kids. Unlike other Disney classics, The Lion King is the one that will stay with me until the time I die. I watch the film to this very day, and it gives me goose bumps to remember the film that I treasured in my childhood. The landscapes are very well made, the voices are so good, the music is very fascinating, especially the background music. The plot is simple yet awesome and made in such a great way. I introduced this film to my little cousins and they loved it. Lion King is a true work of art that should never be spoiled. I also still play the Lion King Super Nintendo video-game, which I also had in my childhood. Definitely this film will be adored in many generations, and I'm sure I will enjoy it when I'm older. Its worth watching more that 1,000 times."
"Science_Fantasy_Guy","10","2","2","24 November 2008"," A movie I've loved since I could tie my shoes.
","First off, I have to admit that this review will most likely be peppered with sentiment and generational bias, as this was the very first film I was ever exposed to. I was a total child of the '90s (indeed, sometimes I still say ""NOT!"" at the end of a sentence not (pun intended, sorry)), and one of the fondest memories I have from that period in my life was when my dad took my brother and sister and I to see The Lion King on the big screen in 1994, when I was only six years old. Although my memories of that experience are obviously now only very feint (about the only parts of the film I can recall from that screening are the Hakuna Matata scene and the stampede), The Lion King is a movie that has practically become part of my life.<br/><br/>Influenced heavily by Shakespeare's Hamlet, The Lion King follows the adventures of Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a lion cub and Matthew Broderick as an adult lion), a curious and mischievous lion cub who ""just can't wait to be king."" Framed for the murder of his father Mufasa (the commanding voice of James Earl Jones) and exiled from the Pride Lands by his jealous and power-mad uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons, voicing the kids' movie villain that has plagued the nightmares of more children than any other since the Wicked Witch of the West), Simba escapes to a rainforest paradise inhabited by Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane, pricelessly hilarious) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). However, destiny calls thanks in part to a reunion with childhood best friend Nala (voiced by Niketa Calame as a cub and Moira Kelly as a lioness), and Simba gallantly returns to the Pride Lands to at last confront his sins and take his rightful place as King of the Pride Lands.<br/><br/>The Lion King is, without serious rivals, my absolute favourite animated film of all. And the reasons why? Firstly, the afore-mentioned nostalgic significance. But it goes much deeper than that. When I was a boy, I was completely oblivious to all the actual themes in the film, such as courage, loyalty, redemption and facing one's sins (although over the years it did teach me to learn from my mistakes). Now, as a far more experienced and worldly 20-year-old, I can watch The Lion King back and  with now recognizing and understanding those themes, and seeing how ambiguously and intricately they're woven into the plot, so they're not shoved down the viewer's throat  I now know and appreciate what a rare film The Lion King really is.<br/><br/>On top of that, the traditional animation holds up very well against the now-dominant form that is computer animation, the screenplay by Irene Mecchi, Jonathan Roberts and Linda Woolverton is resplendent with by turns exuberance, humour, emotion and timeless and universal themes of the heart, and the soundtrack  powered by those amazing Elton John/Tim Rice standards ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" and ""Circle of Life"" and Hans Zimmer's mouth-watering score  is second to none. Don't get me wrong, most other works in the Disney cannon are great, but this one will forever the jewel in the crown in my eyes. <br/><br/>And I still have the VHS tape. And cry when Mufasa dies. And know all the words to every song.<br/><br/>Thanks for the memories, Rob, Roger and co. The Lion King is one that movie that I'll certainly be introducing my kids to someday."

","The Lion King is easily Disney's most successful and entertaining film ever! Every character is unique in their own way. The Music is not of this world. Circle of Life is the song I want on my funeral. (Listen to the lyrics and you'll see why) Each song is so reminiscent towards my long lost childhood. For some reason, I Just Can't Wait To Be King excels most on that. Hans Zimmer score is the greatest I've heard in my life. Thank God he took the Oscar home! This film is most tragic to me, and uplifting at the same time. It's sad that Disney will never ever make a film just like this again. But hey, they couldn't even if they tried! So from the story, to the voice acting, animation, music, and so on, this is the GREATEST film ever!"
"choirgirl988","10","2","2","4 September 2008"," My Favorite Film Period!
","I'm just going to come right out and say it, I think this is ""Sensational""! I grew up in the 2nd Golden Disney era, and while the other films were brilliant, The Lion King was the one that always stood out. It's profound coming-of-age story has filled me with joy and heartache. In fact the older I become, the more I can appreciate the art, script, and journey the filmmakers went through.<br/><br/>The aspects of this films are excellent as far as I'm concerned. I'll start with the animation. It's stunning! The artists and animators alike went the full nine yards to grab the audience's imagination and put them on Safari ride. It's precision as well as colorful nature has turned the savanna into a combination of a documentary and fantasy.<br/><br/>The music is a blast to listen to! Elton John & Tim Rice were right on the money. They combine elements of pop-show-tunes and moving ballads, so it remains catchy, fresh, easy, and moving all at the same time. The score by Hans Zimmer has been nothing short of splendid. It captures the essence within the first five minutes. The power and majesty of the score awakens the senses and even heart. And credit should absolutely be given to Lebo M for providing the culture and spirit of South Africa. Sirli all these very different of equally talented men into one project and you have something magnificent.<br/><br/>And finally- what a remarkable cast! If it hadn't been for these fantastic men & women, we wouldn't have the characters with the same amount of depth or hysteria. Each actor borough a critical but top notch performance. And a standing ovation to them should be given. James Earl Jones, Jermy Irons, Matthew Broderict, Johnathan Taylor Thomas, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, Rowan Atkins, Moria Kelley, Robert Guillume, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings should all be immensely proud to have been apart of this project.<br/><br/>All in all this film couldn't be anymore entertaining to me. Filled with drama,laughter,suspense,adventure,romance and tragedy. It's become one of the most beloved and acclaimed thematic experiences. And it thrills me to know people around the world continue to celebrate it."
"TheFemaleSuperJew","10","2","2","8 July 2008"," The Best Disney Movie EVER
","Out of all the Disney movies I've seen, The Lion King is one of the most remarkable films of all time. The story was touching, the characters were unbelievable, and the music was beautiful.The actors were chosen rightly for their characters & their personalities. Though the movie is rated G, some of the scenes my be too intense & disturbing for younger children. In this meaning, it is an outstanding movie, but in my opinion should be rated PG due to the fighting scenes and darkness of some death scenes. However, it's a great movie to share with the whole family. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be amazed! It's a classic for years & years to come."
"joychipmunk","10","2","2","4 July 2008"," Amazing Movie for all Ages!
","You truly have not seen an animated movie until you have seen ""The Lion King"". It is witty, exquisitely animated, and charming. The plot line is original and although I am well aware that it was copied from ""Hamlet"", as far as animated movies go, it was daring. Little Simba is absolutely the cutest animal ever, except for possibly Dumbo... While all of these factors have made it one of my favorite movies, there is one more that definitely separates it from all the other Disney movies, and that is the voice talent. James Earl Jones is wonderful as Mufasa as well as Jeremy Irons as the devious Scar. The bottom line is that you must watch this movie because it has a great message for younger kids, as well as a few jokes that children won't understand, for adults."
"Cirkuit100","10","2","2","21 February 2008"," Best Animated film I have ever seen
","What can I say about this piece of art that hasn't been said yet...? Maybe, why Disney has sold the soul of the animation art to CGI.<br/><br/>This film will remain in history as one of the biggest successes of animation, why? You just have to watch the movie and you'll agree.<br/><br/>As many late 80' and 90' Disney films the Lion King is composed as a theatrical musical. It's full of great music, that fits perfectly with both relaxed and heart-breaking moments in the film; Hanz Zammer, Tim Rice and Elton John did a very good work here.<br/><br/>Voice cast is just wonderful, specially Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, is just one of the finest performing I have ever heard.<br/><br/>Animation, flawless, beautiful, one of the best of history. A true example of traditional animation.<br/><br/>Story is thought to be suitable for both child and adults. There are tons of cultural references; including associations, movie references, famous quotes, and very complex characters. I have done myself a very large analysis on the Lion King and I was surprised about how many things you can extract from a ""Kids movie"". Also there are many funny moments kids will enjoy and two memorable gags.<br/><br/>As contras, I've nearly nothing about the film itself. Maybe the Kimba controversy... Disney should have admitted the influence; and the complete absence of important female roles that Disney is so used to. I've also note that the way ""bad"" characters are colored, some signs, are somewhat offensive as they are very stereotypical.<br/><br/>My advice, this movie is a MUST for anyone. I have watch it over 10 times already and I'm not getting tired of it. You won't regret it!"
"gmanpackerfan","10","2","2","16 February 2008"," The epitome of a masterpiece.
","I am one of those teenagers who grew up in the time of Lion King, and back then I totally enjoyed it. But, having just seen it recently, I feel as if I must write this review. While not considering myself a movie buff, I have seen plenty of movies on AFI's top 250. However, even after seeing some of the best movies of all time, none of them compare to this one. (Biased) This is the best movie of all time, and let me explain. It expresses emotions that no other movie does, and because it is an animated children's movie, it is innocent while doing so. And I don't think anyone can disagree to the fact that the voice acting is loaded with talent, or the fact that the opening song is the most memorable of all time. The animation is fantastic, and HAND DRAWN! No matter how good computer animated films are, they will never achieve the 2D masterpieces Disney had in the 1990s. And this one is the most masterful of all, without a doubt. In a time of movies mostly about immoral behavior, and when the ethics of America are crashing down, we must all go back to happy days of our youth, with the Lion King."
"catarinafidalgo15","10","2","2","3 February 2008"," Not just some love story
","The Lion King is about a young cub, Simba, who is destined to be king of his animal kingdom. But his Uncle Scar has something to say about that since he's second in line for the throne. To prevent Simba from getting the throne, he kills Simba's father, Mufasa, and drives Simba out of the kingdom. Simba then meets Timon and Pumba who tell him ""Hakuna Matata"", no worries. But when Simba's old friend, Nala, comes to see him as an adult and tells him that Scar has destroyed the kingdom, Simba must confront his past and Scar to win back the throne!I believe this movie was a great tribute to all animation, and something that every movie should hope to accomplish. This movie I think is better than any other Disney movie simply because it is more ""real"" than any other one. It also has a lot more catchy music than films like Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast. One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing that's been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. Not just some love story with problems. It contains everything from romance to action, from happiness to sadness. You cannot get enough of this film. Disney sure has done a great job on this film and it truly deserves the title ""A Masterpiece."" It seems that animated motion pictures nowadays lack the true epic quality that makes am movie memorable and try to make up for that lacking in weird attempts at modern comedy that appeals to a young audience. Disney's serious efforts in producing something extraordinary as in The Lion King are no longer showing."
"blanche_blake","10","2","2","3 February 2008"," great film!
","The Lion King is a great film. Its lavish landscapes will be able to capture you more. The message is very positive. There is a little bit of Hamlet in the plot. Previous films were routine love stories where boy and girl meet, know each other, fall in love and stay together in the very end. This film is much more than that. Simba is a young prince and his father is the King, who is respected and loved by all. The prince is next in line to the throne. He is innocent and naive and eagerly wants to grow up and take his place as King. Scar, king's evil extremely jealous brother, wants to be King himself, and he is ready to go to any means to get what he wants. Simba, along with his best friend Nala, is having a happy childhood - until one fateful day, where his father is cruelly killed by Scar, right in front of Simba's own eyes, hurting him for life. When Scar tricks Simba into believing that he killed his own beloved dad, Simba runs away, far away, never to return. He meets Timon and Pumbaa, who teach him some important lessons: Life is worth living. And Hakuna Matata - no worries. Simba grows from a small cub with a painful past, into a handsome and mature young lion. When Simba and Nala meet again after all these years, he falls in love with her and Simba's life takes a dramatic turn. It is a truly great combination of drama, comedy, romance, life lessons, and musical songs in a Disney movie."

His voice matches with that of the feisty young cub perfectly. Matthew Broderick, who takes over the part of Simba as an adult, is just as good as his younger counterpart, if not better. I loved the voice of Mufasa, James Earl Jones, his voice is so calming and deep, and sounds wise, perfect for Mufasa, the ageing but immensely respected leader. Jeremy Irons as Scar is so perfectly done, ditto with Rowan Atkinson as Zazu. Timon and Pumbaa's voice overs were done with great finesse and very tastefully, and the voices and characters are very lovable. I thought Nala's older voice, Moira Kelly was miscast. The young girl who played her younger part was much better though.<br/><br/>Heartwrenching and loved by many, The Lion King is one that cannot be missed."
"mk-ajjampur","10","2","2","1 December 2007"," Lovely lovely movie
","Writing about this film brings with it a feeling of nostalgia for times gone by. This was in fact the very FIRST movie that I watched on the big screen; way back in 1994. I can still recall the awe and the wonder I had when I sat in the rows (somewhere in the middle I think) and looked up at screen. Ah, the good old days...Anyway, to cut to the chase, the movie itself is a triumph and one of the best animated movies that I've seen. While the story itself is essentially about the eventual triumph of good over evil, this hackneyed theme does not stop the story from being poignant or touching. In fact, one might say that that it actually serves as the moral for a story that after all was aimed at children. The central character of the movie is Simba, the baby cub of Mufasa, the king of the lion pride. The movie begins with his birth and unfolds as we watch Simba mature from a young cub to a youthful lion (the transition occurring in the wilderness after his evil uncle Scar kills off his father). The movie concludes with Simba regaining his rightful place in the ""circle of life"" and becoming a father himself (after an epic fight with Scar. The battle was one of the best scenes of the movie. Extremely Powerful.) And as far as the animation goes, everything is top notch. The songs of the movie were hit songs with ""Hakuna Matata"" becoming a sort of an anthem for a while, I think. All in all, a great movie that should be watched, if only for its songs and some scenes."

","Looking back on my childhood, The Lion King was definitely one of the best films ever made! Because it's Disney, it automatically has that quintessential cute factor, but The Lion King is also a powerful story. I love the theme in this movie - that while you cannot change the past, you should learn from it and take responsibility. The ending is one of the most powerful scenes. Even more, I love the characters. Who doesn't love Simba's courage (his childhood was definitely not ideal!), Mufasa's glory, Rafiki's quirky wisdom, and of course, Timon and Pumbaa's comic relief?<br/><br/>I'll admit I'm slightly biased because The Lion King was also made in my generation, so I feel a certain connection towards it. But this movie really is the perfect combination of profound life lessons, humour, and entertainment. The songs are catchy as with all Disney, and some, like the ""Circle of Life,"" even have some meaningful lyrics. Also, the background music compliments the action in the movie very well. The voice acting is brilliant, with a strong vocal cast nailing their respective roles. Too bad Disney films aren't made this way now...The Lion King was definitely on the money."

One of the first movies I really came to love. Little kids and parents will both enjoy this classic kid's movie from Disney, despite being an older movie.<br/><br/>It's easy to understand The Lion King's success if you look at the cast. It's got Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Matthew Broderick, Nathan Lane, etc. These are great actors, and they do all of their parts well. The comedy was pulled of well, the dramatic scenes were awesome, and the songs are just plain wonderful. I honestly wish Disney made more stuff like this, since I feel some of their recent stuff is horrible. This movie had the plot, scenery, and dialog of a truly great kid's movie.<br/><br/>The story is that Simba is a young prince, son of king Mufasa, and heir to the pride-lands. The pride-lands are the beautiful plains where many peaceful animals live. Scar, Mefusa's brother, is outraged that Simba is before him in line for the throne. Scar's corrupt soul only desires to be ruler, so he plots with the outcast hyenas of the out-lands to kill Mefusa and Simba. During the scheme, Mefusa dies while Simba escapes. Simba, however, thinks he's responsible for his father's death because of a chat with Scar. Scar becomes ruler, and his hyena henchmen take over the pride-lands and devour everything.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Simba is rescued and befriended by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog who live carefree lives in a beautiful land away from the pride-lands. Simba learns to live without responsibilities or worries, and puts his past behind him. Then he runs into his old best friend, Nala. Nala tells Simba of what has happened to his homelands, and with some counseling from a baboon named Rafiki, Simba returns home. Accompanied by Nala, Timon, Pumbaa, and even Rafiki, Simba fights scar and takes his place as king.<br/><br/>I still have my original VHS copy of this movie, and I still watch it to this day.

Scar and his hyena followers then go after Mufasa's rightful successor and son, the cuddly lion cub Simba. Thankfully, Scar doesn't marry Simba's mother, and the cub's childhood sweetheart, Nala, doesn't go bonkers and jump in the river. This is Disney, after all, so you can rest assured that the tragedy will eventually find its way to a silver lining and a happy ending. There are lots of laughs along the way with the cheeky meerkat Timon (Lane) providing more than his share. He and a worm-eating warthog named Pumbaa get to sing an infectious ditty called ""Hakuna Matata,"" which is translated as, ""Don't worry, be happy."" Parents shouldn't be surprised if they are called upon to see it more than once. No problem. Hakuna matata."
"TheLittleSongbird","10","8","14","17 February 2009"," This is my sister's favourite film, and one of mine!
","This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write like that. The best song is ""Can you feel the Love Tonight?"" but the others go without fault, ""Circle of Life"" is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic, and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10.

"lunacy_wishes","3","20","44","26 December 2009"," Very overrated
","I find many people describe this film with extreme fondness. I watched it again today after not watching it since I was a child, maybe a little over ten years ago. I really cannot believe the big fuss and when I read reviews on here to see what everyone loved about it I couldn't really find anything and to be honest it just seemed that everyone was stating the obvious 'the songs,' which were the only terrific thing about the entire film, and the fact that they 'loved it as a child,' but children love what everyone else loves, can you really point out something that can really be admired? Do people not consider the incoherence of the plot? I have seen many reviewers see the film as I do, and they tend to point out the things that people don't seem to realise, such as the extremely annoying characters and the fact that the characters are almost... scrambled-like throughout. It's hardly a story. And I know you could say well maybe I liked it as a child because it is a child's film but as many people have stated it is not - because of the violence and depression. What irritated me most is how the film makes you feel sad at the death of Simba's father, yet Simba himself just runs away and almost immediately seems to feel indifferent towards the situation! He just DOESN'T care! He starts singing hakuna matata for goodness sake!!<br/><br/>I struggle to see why this film is so loved."
"ed-554","3","21","47","27 December 2011"," Overrated pap
","A little balance, I hope, to offset the rants of some of the single-star-ers: after years of having ""The Lion King"" simmering in the background of my film-going conscience, we finally bought it for the kids for Christmas and watched it tonight for the first and, at least for me, last time.<br/><br/>The Simba/Kimba thing has been mentioned here enough, so I'm going to focus on this from a story-and-character point of view. <br/><br/> half-hearted (read: rather pathetic) attempt at explaining away the ""we eat animals but when we die we become grass so what goes around etc."" concept (or restated, the prey animals know their place in the big picture and consent to being eaten  nice if you're the lion), but let's not get too deep into the mythologies this film supports (patriarchy-as-common-sense, benevolent dictators, ma-'n'-pa family model as the ideal, Africa as one big national park) <br/><br/> poor character development. Simba is just shallow and his change of heart towards the end is cheesy. <br/><br/> by comparison with films like ""Toy Story"" or even the ""Ice Age"" franchise, the writers simply seemed to lack imagination. Perhaps they cancelled each other out, considering that this was definitely not the brainchild of a single writer whatever, the result is pretty watery <br/><br/> Scar is barely scary, nor is his scar ever explained. He comes off as being effete and lazy and conniving, which is fine, but like all the other characters here he's completely two-dimensional from start to finish. A mediocre villain at best. <br/><br/> A lot of the Americanisms in the dialogue left me cold: this was clearly pitched at a Disney-loving US-English audience <br/><br/> Mostly cheesy humor. Second time I've used cheesy here, must mean something. Lots of mediocre puns, a few good ones. And somehow, references in films like this to classic lines from far more adult and accomplished films like ""In the Heat of the Night"" and ""Taxi Driver"" (both get a nod from Pumbaa in his ""Are you talking to *me*? -- THEY CALL ME MR. PIG!"" sequence) come off as cheap and Disney-American in the worst sense. Some brightish moments when Fuzu is the unwilling object of a ""pounce"" lesson and the look on Nala's face after her dip in the pond, some decent character voice work from Rowan Atkinson and Jeremy Irons despite the lines they were given. <br/><br/> Characters appear at opportune moments with no sense of them being there for any other reason than an easy out on the writers' part: Musafa rescuing Simba from the hyenas, e.g. or Simba rescuing Timon and Pumbaa from Nala. <br/><br/> The orchestral music is overblown, the songs largely forgettable. Strange, considering the involvement of Tim Rice. I'll leave Elton out of this: apart from ""Tommy"" I was never a fan. Although Timon's anti-romance intro to ""Can you feel the love tonight"" is pretty good (just the intro, though). <br/><br/> Just why the heck did the river run dry just because Scar took over the pride? <br/><br/> For a ""family film"" this is pretty high on the violence scale, not least the slow motion and totally uninspired slugfest between Simba and Scar. <br/><br/> Enormous plot holes and missing info: Did Simba really get that big and strong on bugs alone? Why did Scar have so much access to little Simba when Mustafa obviously mistrusted his brother? Where was Simba's mum all this time? Just how did Simba pull himself back onto that rock at the end when Scar had him dead to rights? Etcetera. <br/><br/> Some egregious examples of explaining away plot points in the dialogue, especially how Nala just happens to stumble across Simba again. <br/><br/> Cloying and sentimental far too much of the time.<br/><br/>Okay, that's my two cents for now. I could go on, but would it be worth the effort? The best I can hope for is to persuade a couple of potential viewers to make better use of their time than with soft-boiled tripe like this."
"C22Man","7","6","10","10 February 2014"," Very good, But not Disney's best like everyone claims
","The Lion King is viewed by most as the peak in Disney's renaissance period and remains, to this date, the highest grossing 2D animated film of all time. With Disney on such a high expectations were, while this was increased by the superb vocal talent and wonderful animation, and for many those expectations were met. Though a lot are going to disagree with me, I have to come out and say that I think the film is kind of overrated. That doesn't mean I dislike it as a matter of fact I agree that it does have fantastic elements, but for the heaps of praise it gets I'm not sure if it holds up well enough.<br/><br/>The story is effectively a toned down Hamlet. A lion prince named Simba is born, meaning that his cruel uncle Scar is now second in line to the throne. Scar plots to kill both King Mufasa and Simba, succeeding in killing Mufasa and making Simba believe he was at fault. Simba flees the kingdom and remains in exile for a number of years, until figures of the past challenge him and he must return home to take his rightful place as king. The story is a very interesting one, it is a much more mature than you would expect from Disney and I really enjoy it for that reason. Everything that happens seems to happen for a reason and there isn't any filler as far as the plot goes. After all this is a very big story and telling it in a cohesive mature manner works very well.<br/><br/>The other impressive feature is the animation. It's clear that the animators put a lot of work in to create such a visually pleasing place for this to all happen in. The colours used give the place such a bright beautiful look and it is actually quite authentic looking too. Scenes of bird flying over the vivid landscape or of the sun shining over the land are so beautiful to look at. The character designs were also very good, like the contrast between the powerful Mufasa and the slimy Scar. The sheer scope of things is another wonderful aspect, such as when Scar's paw first comes down or the later Wildebeest stampede. Even things like the backgrounds look massive which gives an extra size to this world.<br/><br/>The characters are rather hit and miss. Simba is a bit of a bland lead, he is just a kid for most of it but he does come off as a bit too boring and even obnoxious at times. He doesn't get any better the older he gets and Matthew Broderick's voice only adds to the dullness. Mufasa is just a brilliant character. He is designed wonderfully, has some really interesting characteristics and James Earl Jones' booming voice is perfect for it. A lot of people rate Scar as a top villain yet for me he's just decent. He is enjoyably devious and Jeremy Irons clearly has fun with the role, but he does come off as not that smart and a bit snivelling in the end. Zazu is very funny with Rowan Atkinson delivering some good lines and Rafiki is also very likable for coming across as a good friend. I'm not a big fan of Timon and Pumbaa as they come off as a bit annoying and wink at the camera too much, though they do have some amusing scenes. The Hyenas were daft but entertaining, while I think Nala was underplayed too much.<br/><br/>I do have issues with the film. The message that it is trying to get across is an interesting one in how we must learn from the past to move forward. The problem is that when Simba confronts his past nobody believes him until Scar says what really happened. Looking at this you can't help but feel Simba would have been better off lying and that harms the whole point of the message. Also I think a lot of the comedic elements feel very misplaced. For a story as grand and serious as this I can't help but find that the comedy is too trivial at times which is distracting. As mentioned Timon and Pumbaa just feel a bit misplaced because they're jokes are slightly too silly. If done well, like with Zazu or the hyenas antics, then its nice relief but otherwise it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Also I really find that the songs are a mixed bag. 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' and 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' just come off as your typical pop songs and there isn't anything truly catchy or memorable about them. 'Hakuna Matata' is another one everyone loves, but for me it's just annoying. On the other hand however, 'Circle of Life' is a brilliantly grand number that opens the film perfectly and 'Be Prepared' is really catchy with some very enjoyable singing from Jeremy Irons. <br/><br/>Elsewhere there are some really memorable sequences here. The circle of life opening is something that everyone should remember, the wildebeest chase is visually stunning as well as pulse-pounding, Simba talking to Mufasa in the clouds is sadly beautiful and the final battle sequence does have some great images. Also I thought it was very brave decision to actually show the body of Mufasa after his death. In fact going on from that the movie does have a very strong emotional core running throughout that is very welcoming and smartly used.<br/><br/>On the whole I do think that The Lion King is a very accomplished piece from Disney, I just don't find it as engaging as most people do. This is a big story with a lot of big elements, I just find that whilst most of the work some of them aren't quite as successful. I do wish other Disney films were as acclaimed as The Lion King, but I still find an entertaining and well-made film."
"OllieSuave-007","8","5","8","1 November 2013"," Exciting original story from Disney.
","This movie's story was written solely by Disney Studios, about a young lion, Simba, who was forced into exile by his evil Uncle Scar, who wants to take control of the jungle before Simba claims it. Life in the jungle declines under Scar's rule as Simba abandons his identity and meets new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, in another part of the jungle.<br/><br/>Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff directed an exciting movie, adopting more of what I think are some of mainstream Hollywood's intense drama and comedy styles, seen in such parts like Uncle Scar and his crafty hyena goons chasing away poor Simba like gangsters pursuing a helpless hero, and the parts of the more modern day jokes and punchlines made by Timon and Pumbaa. The movie is also full of drama and action that will attract an audience of all ages, providing a great source of entertainment. It is compelling to see how Simba tries to wrestle his way out of his doubts as he tries to find his true identity and compelling to see Simba's family try to overcome adversary under Scar's rule. This is also a powerful story about courage, duty and identity (noticable as Simba tries to find his way) and the importance of family. <br/><br/>Hans Zimmer did a good job on the music score and Elton John wrote some memorable songs like ""Circle of Life"" and ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight."" The toe-tapping ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"" is my favorite.<br/><br/>The characters are likable and, like the plot's style, take on more of a mainstream Hollywood approach. This movie differs from the more earlier films such as ""Cinderella"" and ""The Jungle Book,"" and even the later films such as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" ""The Lion King"" doesn't have that Disney touch you've come to expect and love in many of the fairytale and adventure movies, signaling that Disney films have evolved immensely over time. Even though it's not one of the more conventional Disney films, ""The Lion King"" is still a very good movie to watch due to its original concept, captivating story and memorable characters.<br/><br/>Grade B+"

"andrewmerritt-31652","9","3","4","15 July 2019"," The king of all animated films.
","The Lion King is an animated Disney film featuring voice of Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, and James Earl Jones. The film revolves around a future king who is tricked by his evil uncle to never return. This film is also inspired by the Shakespeare play Hamlet which both films have the same plot line, except The Lion King is more appropriate for children than Hamlet. And that's what makes this movie so perfect in every way is that the screenwriters decided to take a classic Shakespeare play and make their own version made for kids, while at the same time not following Hamlet down to detail. Before the new Lion King comes out I thought I watched the original where it all began. The animation that went into this film is beautiful as everyone involved really took the time to develop a film that has passion and soul to it. And the voice acting is top notch too from James Earl Jones as Mufasa to Jeremy Irons as Scar. In all of Disney movies there will never be a better voice actor as Jeremy Irons. Ever delivery is chilling and sends goosebumps thinking about it that if there was ever someone to narrate my life he would make that list. I don't know how the new Lion King will turn out, but I know that this Lion King trumps the new one, and all Disney films. And while this may be he king of all animated films, the soundtrack provided was average with one or two songs that are excellent to listen too. So before you watch the new one take a moment to go back where it all began and experience a movie so hypnotic and beautiful from start to finish."
"shotgun-69216","10","3","4","11 July 2019"," What Animation should Strive to be
","I loved this movie as a kid. I watched it plenty of times, and enjoyed it every single one of those. Now, over time, a lot of entertainment aimed at kids loses some of it's value. In many cases, it can ruin the experience if you go back and re-watch it as an adult.<br/><br/>The Lion King is not like those. The Lion King is just as good as when I was a kid, and that's not just with nostalgia glasses on. Sure, the story's been done before, and it does share some striking similarities to a much older anime, but it still holds my attention and provides great character moments. This movie, if released for the first time today as is, would likely still be one of the best movies of all time."

","All Disney movies are good, except for maybe Princess and the Frog. This movie was released during, I would say, Disney's golden age of movies when Aladdin, Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Pocahontas were made. While Mickey Mouse will always be Disney's flagship character, the princesses from these movies laid the ground work for what we know Disneyland to be today. I believe that the animals in the movies also offer a certain mysticism that contributes to the magic of what Disney and Disneyland is today. And like many other cartoon Disney movies, Lion King is a classic because of the plot, songs, and the art work. I would definitely recommend any child to see Lion King because it is always fun seeing a movie and then visiting the theme park where all your favorite characters live."

"gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297","10","3","4","24 June 2014"," An African anthropomorphic animated epic from Disney now celebrates it's 20th anniversary!
","Back at the 1930s, a person named Walt Disney made his first company in the Hollywood industry known as the ""Walt Disney Animation Studios"". Then, after making a few animated shorts, they made their very first full length feature film ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs"" based on a fairy tale from the Brothers Grimm. When it was first released, it was well-received globally from critics and audiences and started the trend, thus making the genre very successful. When Walt Disney died in 1966, however, Disney went towards the Dark Ages and were trying to find a way to get them back on track. Then, in 1989, when The Little Mermaid was released and became a hit, they started their new trend known as the Disney Renaissance with The Rescuers Down Under, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. However, the only Renaissance film that was considered to be the most successful was this, ""The Lion King"", an anthropomorphic African feature film based on the religious stories of Joseph and Moses and also based on the Shakespearean play Hamlet.<br/><br/>It tells the story about a young cub named Simba who's destined to become king of the jungle. However, his evil ruthless uncle Scar kills Simba's father Mufasa in a stampede of wildebeests and blames it on Simba, causing him to run away from Pride Rock. A few years later, after meeting two comic-relief sidekicks named Timon and Pumbaa, Simba grows up, away from responsibility. However, a wise baboon named Rafiki informs Simba that he has to take responsibility and return to Pride Rock to set things right.<br/><br/>With that said, I want to sum up this film in only one word: fantastic. Not only is it one of Disney's best since Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, Bambi, Beauty and the Beast, and so on and so forth, but it's one of the best Disney Renaissance films, period. Thanks to it's reviews on Rottentomatoes, there are a lot of good things to say about it.<br/><br/>The story is extremely compelling. Not only does it expand on the world it's created in Africa and it's Mythos, perfectly, but it does a great job at sending really good morals about responsibility and facing your past. Also, the mixture of comical moments along with some really dark ones (consider how this had a darker tone like ""The Black Cauldron"" and ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" two years later) are blended perfectly to make it appeal to a family audience and it shows. Oh, and I also forgot to mention that this film has a notable scene where Simba cries over the death of his father, Mufasa and I gotta tell you, it made me shed some tears. No, really. I did.<br/><br/>Anyway, the animation is breathtakingly beautiful. The world of Africa, Pride Rock, the Pride Lands, Scar's lair, the Elephant Graveyard, the Stampede scene, and the African Jungle where Timon and Pumbaa live are beautiful to look at even by 2D animation standards. Also, the character animation and designs are amazing and the facial expressions in them are solid.<br/><br/>As for the characters, they're very likable. Simba, both child and adult, is nice it made me relate to him, Nala is also a good character both child and adult as well. The comic reliefs are also good. Timon and Pumbaa are extremely funny as is their chemistry together, Zazu is a very funny bird, and the three hyenas, Shenzai, Banzai, and Ed are laugh-out-loud hilarious. The characters that standout the most, however, would have to go to Mufasa, the intimidating, but wise father, Rafiki, the also wise baboon, and Scar, the ruthless uncle with great motives that explains why he wants to rule all of Pride Rock. The voice acting is top-notch with a killer cast including James Earl Jones, Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, and Matthew Broderick.<br/><br/>The third and last thing would have to go to the music score from Hans Zimmer. This is the film that introduced me to this guy when I was a kid and I listened to his other scores for future movies such as the The Prince of Egypt, the Dark Knight Trilogy, the two Kung Fu Panda films, and Man of Steel (all of which were beautiful and solid that made those movies worth it). His score here, like the films that preceded this, is beautiful and compelling. It has an African choir, it helps represent the themes perfectly and the action music is thrilling it would send chills down your spine. The songs, written by Elton John and lyricist Tim Rice, are wonderful and will always be timeless. The Circle of Life opens the film very brilliantly, I Just Can't Wait To Be King is good with an upbeat tone, Be Prepared, a creepy, but spine-tingly awesome, Hakuna Matata is a pretty good comedy song that means no worries to me, & Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a solid romance song that represents Simba's relationship with Nala very well.<br/><br/>Overall, The Lion King has been a childhood favorite of mine and as a young adult, it still holds up along with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and all of the other Disney films in the past. It's compelling, it's epic, it's beautiful, and it's a sight that you'll never want to miss. To those who are Disney fans, go watch it. To those who aren't, however, still go watch it. A solid recommendation! :)"

Im not one of those people that really like musical movies but the songs in this movie were the best. I would sing along with them and I'm 17 now and you might still catch me singing some of them. The way how Simba comes back and take over what is really is and take the name of king will really touch you. This shows that you could take control or scare someone when there young but one day they have to grow up and become a man.

"StevePulaski","10","3","4","14 August 2012"," A real Disney beauty
","The opening scene of The Lion King will show where you stand with this film in terms of what generation you were born in. People born outside of this generation (say, anytime before 1980) will find it pleasing and enjoyable. Those from this current generation (1981 and beyond, myself included) will be simply in awe and, if one were to recall this from their childhood (who from this time period hasn't seen this?) they may even shed a few tears.<br/><br/>I did and I'm not afraid to admit it. The Lion King is a dashingly fierce achievement from Disney, one with gripping scenes of delight and uncompromising beauty and charm. Its songs seem more than just standard Disney archetypes, but those of true power and importance, especially ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""Circle of Life,"" the opening ballad.<br/><br/>The story concerns Simba, a feisty cub whose parents, Mufasa and Sarabi, carry a very respected reputation throughout the land. Mufasa is ""the king of the jungle"" and Simba ""can't wait to be king,"" and for that reason, is always getting into some sort of trouble. Mufasa's brother, Scar, is jealous and holds an incredible disdain for his brother and Simba. When Simba gets himself into big trouble, causing a wild stampede of hyenas (which, by the way, is just breathtakingly slick and stylish), Mufasa is killed by Scar, when trying to rescue Simba. Scar makes Simba feel as if he was responsible for the death of his father and implores him to run away.<br/><br/>So he does, and Scar takes the throne in no time, running the Pride Lands into the ground and completely ruining the consistency and order Mufasa took so long to build.<br/><br/>Upon running away, Simba meets up with Timon, a meerkat, and Pumba, a warthog in ""the jungle, the mighty jungle."" They teach the naive little cub how to thrive in the jungle, and fast-forward a few years, and Simba is older, stronger, even feistier than before, and with a full grown mane.<br/><br/>The Lion King collectively merges the classic Shakespearean story of Hamlet with the divine simplicity and the ""walk on the other side of the road"" formula of their 1967 hit Jungle Book into a true achievement in every category. There's a beautiful thing about the way the film conceives emotions and builds on locations. From the first frame to the last, it is littered with evocative landscapes, some of which are hard to believe they're only hand-drawn, pre-CGI work. The use of lighting and darkness can be vaguely called ""animation noir"" before it became a real standard, with the sunlit landscapes of the Pride Lands and the excellent use of darkness when it came to showcasing the Scar character, is truly masterful and beyond words.<br/><br/>It is also interesting to note that The Lion King sort of kicks off Disney's ""dare to be different"" phase that it maintained well into the 2000's with films like Atlantis: The Lost Empire and Lilo and Stitch truly pushing what the company can really do. The Lion King's story, mainly centered around guilt, power, and redemption, is a lot darker with only occasional touches of humor breaking through the melancholic presence of the story. The youngsters may have a hard time coping. I know if I saw this any younger than six it would've been uncomfortable. Though it seems that with the abundance of re-releases the film is getting, the story appeals to those of all ages.<br/><br/>NOTE: It's a shame that Disney has stooped to the level of manipulation and tampering with this grandiose animated achievement. To see it get a 3D re-release and multiple re-releases on DVD just to become lucrative for the company, also equipped with a surcharge, is somewhat heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Voiced by: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella, and Rowan Atkinson.

","""The Lion King"" is a very good movie. It's entertaining and funny. It's moving and overall a very satisfying film. But if I went through this review listing everything that's good about ""The Lion King"" it would be to long. It does have all of the characteristics and a technically fine movie so I will just go over some of the little things that kept me from giving this film a slightly higher rating.<br/><br/>The story, while completely technically proficient with all beats hit, felt a little thin to me. The story works fine, but it doesn't really explore the world of ""The Lion King"" and flesh out the atmosphere as I feel it should. It felt like there were missing scenes now and then.<br/><br/>The only other complaint is rather minor. I felt the animation was a little poor at times. While this film is mostly quite beautiful and a joy to behold, at some points the animation just felt limited. Mostly it was because of lack of detail in the environments, and small amount of character environment interaction. However like I said this amounts to be a small complaint.<br/><br/>Overall this is just a really good film. 7.9/10"
"lesleyharris30","9","3","4","10 October 2011"," A Terrific Adventure for all Ages,
","The Lion King is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a great voice cast. It's an absolute classic that still holds up today as a beautifully animated and exhilarating film, I become warped in to this universe every time I watch it and almost immediately because of its beautiful opening image, we really care for these characters and support them on the journey they are headed on, it can be quite dark at times, very emotional, but it never forgets to add some great comic relief. I felt like the film could have taken more time to develop Scar's character, it needed to make its audience more aware of his motives, not just his plans on achieving them, I would have liked to have seen longer scenes between him and the hyenas, as this is when the villain is truly honest about who he really is, and he is certainly one of the greatest Disney villains there is. The characters and voice acting in this film are certainly the best part and save it from being a boring animation with talking animals, Simba, Timon, Pumba, Mufasa, Nala, Rafiki, Zazu and Scar are all characters that I remember fondly from my childhood, as I watched this film again and again, and still today love them just as much as ever, as I understand some of their lines, particularly from Timon, that I never did when I was younger. Beautifully animated, jam packed with great songs, memorable characters and emotional scenes, the Lion King is easily some of Disney's greatest work, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good family film. <br/><br/>A young lion cub runs away from home after believing he accidentally killed his father, although it was actually his uncle, who intends on becoming the King of Pride Rock."

","""The Lion King"" is essentially a retelling of ""Hamlet"" set on the Savannah and casted with lions. Simba (Prince Hamlet) is the child of Mufasa (King Hamlet) and Sarabi (Gertrude), the heir apparent of the Savannah. His uncle Scar (Claudius), however, has ambitions for the throne. Aligning himself with a pack of hyenas, Scar succeeds in killing his brother and taking the throne for himself. The Hyenas, unable to kill Simba, chase him into a desert and leave him for dead. He grows up mentored by the meerkat Timon (Rosencrantz) and the warthog Pumba (Guildenstern) until Nala (Ophelia), a childhood friend, finds him and convinces him to return home and take his place as king.<br/><br/>Despite abundant opportunities to become a derivative child-friendly adaptation of the Shakespeare play, ""The Lion King"" succeeds as a unique and family-friendly experience. It conveys the emotions of tragic loss and unforgivable betrayal that, while devastating and heartbreaking, are still appropriate for the entire family. Even moreso than Bambi's mother's, Mufasa's death is a heartrenching experience (and I am not above admitting that I cried watching Simba search for his father in the deserted gorge in which he died).<br/><br/>The animation is easily the most breathtaking of Disney's 2-D features: brilliantly capturing the majesty of the African Savannah. The Pride Lands are bright and crisp while the elephant graveyard is nightmarishly grim. The landscape upon Simba's return is nothing short of haunting.<br/><br/>The film demonstrates an elegant mastery of visual symbolism rare in films produced since the early sixties. The song ""Be Prepared"" contains evocative visual allusions to the Third Reich, aligning Scar's reign with that of Hitler's. Gothic tradition holds that the natural world is a reflection of the social order; as such, the barren Pride Lands, littered with bones and scorched flora, with bent, stunted trees in the foreground reflects the unnatural ascension of Scar to the throne. In a moment of catharsis etched into every child's memory, the post-battle rain washes away the last remnants of Scar's reign, cleansing the Pride Lands and its inhabitants.<br/><br/>A host of prominent actors lend their vocal talents to this film, including the James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, Cheech Marin, Whoopi Goldberg. Elton John rounds out the vocal ensemble, lending his voice to a number of Tim Rice's exceptional musical numbers.<br/><br/>This is film is a true classic and easy to for all viewers, young and old, to enjoy together. It is a rare person who will not find something to like in it (genuinely funny quips, thrilling musical numbers, well-crafted script, exceptional voice talents). If you get the slightest opportunity to see this film, I recommend that you take it."

As for the sex, don't worry, your children will not learn about sex from cartoon, sex is in their instinct, as soon as they reach five, they will notice the difference, and will do some experiment with their body, and that is natural...so don't say how grossed you are because you noticed sex everywhere, because that is your perverted mind, kids are still too young to notice it everywhere... and I was mad when I read some bad comments that said how it is unbelievable that there is only one male lion , and all others are female, well it is not only BELIEVABLE, but it is TRUTH, there is only one male lion in pack of lions, no more, so you ,,smart'' people could learn something from this cartoon, It would be like watching National Geographic...

","Throughout the early 1990s, Disney animation appeared to be unstoppable. ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Aladdin"" and ""The Lion King"" in quick succession had set a new standard for animation. Unfortunately for Disney, ""The Lion King"" would be its last hurrah for a while, or really for good. Pixar would soon pick up the torch, and now Pixar is king of the jungle.<br/><br/>But as for ""The Lion King"".......""Beauty and the Beast"" is probably my favorite Disney animated film, but this one is a close second. It's the darkest and most ambitious and it's got superb animation. The song score by Elton John is the weakest in the above-mentioned string of films, but the orchestral score by Hans Zimmer is the best. The film doesn't shy away from the savagery of the natural world, or the difficult emotions surrounding life and death, and for that I applaud it.<br/><br/>Grade: A"

""Hamlet"" is a tale of ambition, lust, power, betrayal while ""The Lion King"" treats the same situations but such in a magical way that you can't help but adore.<br/><br/>When I first watched this movie in theaters, I felt powerful. The events are dedicated 100% for children but adults can enjoy them too. To this day, I watch when possible this movie and it always makes me feel very good.

"Hitchcoc","9","3","4","28 March 2006"," Wonderful Music and Rhythms
","This is an outstanding work of animation. I realize that it has been criticized for political incorrectness. The fact of the matter is that it has strong female characters as well as male, and it's about a vision of monarchy. I have the greatest respect for female role models but I really don't see this as a worthy criticism. It's a great story of defeat and betrayal and renewal. It has delightful individual characters, dressed up to show their beings in a clever way. It has the most despicable villains with Scar and the Hyenas. It has the Henry II thing about duty. It doesn't glorify fooling around as one of my colleagues told me. The free life is OK but at some time you must follow your heart and redeem yourself. The music is outstanding; another triumph or the Disney team. There are three or four numbers that are so critical to a complete understanding of the events of the story. The sound effects person should have been rewarded because sound is so critical in this. From the stampede to the forbidden areas of the kingdom. I watched this about sixty times with my small children and never really tired of it. I would put this at the top of any list of animated adventures."

The African land scape's are beautiful and so are the animations of the animals itself.<br/><br/>What makes ""The Lion King"" such a special movie is the emotional dept the story has. The story plays a significant role in the movie and it has some good adult moments. The entire movie has a more of an adult feeling, unlike earlier made Disney's that mainly focused on only young children.

Also the three hyenas are voiced perfectly by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings. Jeremy Irons who voices the main villain Scar really brings his character to live and makes the movie even more worth watching.<br/><br/>There are some typical Disney songs that are good. Also surprising good is the musical score itself composed by Hans Zimmer who also received an Oscar for it. His first and only one but hopefully not his last.

","One of the greatest films ever made, The Lion King is the very pinnacle of Disney's Renaissance Era that didn't just mark a creative high for the legendary animation studio but remains their most impressive work to date. An astounding masterpiece for all ages that's perfectly balanced in the smallest of aspects & still hasn't aged a day, this is without a doubt the greatest Disney film of all time.<br/><br/>Set in the Pride Lands of Africa, The Lion King tells the story of a young lion prince who flees into exile after the death of his father when his uncle tricks him into believing that he is the one responsible for the king's demise. Growing up with two outcasts & embracing their carefree attitude, he is ultimately forced to confront his past after a chance encounter with an old friend & decides to return to his homeland.<br/><br/>Directed by Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff, the film opens on such a grand note that its prologue alone is much better than most features turn out to be in their entire runtime. The whole story has an epic feel to it despite its grounded simplicity, the plot unfolds like a soothing breeze, the themes are handled with care, entertainment is top-notch and its carefully carved out characters add even more richness to the story.<br/><br/>Each frame of its beautifully rendered animation is a work of spellbinding craftsmanship. Characters are brilliantly sketched too & do manage to express emotions amazingly well. Cinematography makes expert use of colour palettes & vibrant use of camera. Editing provides a frenetic pace to the whole narrative & is at its best during the musical numbers, while CGI is seamlessly integrated into its hand-drawn imagery.<br/><br/>Although nearly every character in the picture has a well-defined arc, what makes them so much fun is the pitch-perfect voice cast that infuses new life into these characters & provide them their very own souls. James Earl Jones brings a king-like imposing quality to Mufasa, Matthew Broderick does well as Simba, Jeremy Irons is thrilling as Scar while both Nathan Lane & Ernie Sabella steal the show as Timon & Pumbaa with their impeccable timing & perfect chemistry.<br/><br/>And last but not the least, I'd like to talk about its magnificent score. Composed by Hans Zimmer who was just starting out back then, the exquisitely arranged & masterfully orchestrated score elevates what was already an incredibly fascinating tale to such a grandeur level of epicness that even today, it remains the finest use of music in any animation feature out there. And further strengthening this aspect are catchy songs written by Tim Rice & Elton John.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, The Lion King is an extraordinary blend of a highly gripping story, deftly written screenplay, state-of-the-art animation, cleverly drawn characters voiced by wisely chosen cast, terrific use of humour, skillful camera-work, tight editing as well as an outstanding score plus sensational songs, all of which work in seamless harmony in order to set an entirely new benchmark for its medium & effortlessly succeed.<br/><br/>An emotionally stirring adventure that's full of heart, passion & creativity from start to finish, The Lion King is an unabashedly hilarious, occasionally melancholic, extremely intimate, thoroughly enjoyable, delightfully engaging, intensely thrilling, wildly entertaining & immensely satisfying fable about life, death, identity, responsibility & resurrection that borrows from William Shakespeare's Hamlet yet is able to carve out its very own identity before it is finished.<br/><br/>Marking the last great high for Disney's Renaissance Era that came crashing down soon after the advent of Pixar Animation Studios, The Lion King is a work of cinematic perfection that still stands tall & remains unblemished by the test of time and, for the epic this timeless classic is in every sense of the word, will continue to do so comfortably for a very foreseeable future. Absolutely worth your time & money, the crown jewel of Walt Disney Animation comes one hundred percent recommended."

","A young lion cub named Simba is born, knowing that he will be the future king of the jungle. But after he is tricked into thinking that he killed his own father, the young cub runs away and goes into exile. When he grows older, he is forced to come back.<br/><br/>It's pretty much common knowledge that Lion King is one of the best movies Disney has ever made. It embodies everything that makes Disney so great – excellent story, great characters, strong soundtrack, and a very capable cast of actors lending their voices.<br/><br/>For me, the story is the best thing. Hamlet is one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, and the writers have done a great job of transferring that to the animal kingdom. The scene between Simba and the ghost of Mufasa, in particular, is very emotional and tugs at the heart-strings. I'm surprised that the film was as short as it was, to be honest, I think it could have been fleshed out a little more. But what we do get is great.<br/><br/>Simba also probably ranks up there as one of Disney's greatest creations. It is a brilliantly-crafted character, very well-voiced by Matthew Broderick. As a kid, I remember how beloved Timon and Pumbaa were, but I didn't really see the appeal. Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Scar (Jeremy Irons) are also very good. Coincidentally, 'The Lion King' marks the first time a major Disney character dies, which once again re-establishes the strength of the story.<br/><br/>My only gripe with this movie is probably just the length. A little more time and the film could have been even better. But between the emotion, the brilliant songs ('Circle Of Life' is my personal favourite) and the fun characters, you have a classic. Not just a Disney classic, but a cinema classic.<br/><br/>I'll stop masturbating now."
"talarisw","10","4","6","13 January 2012"," Walt Disney's 32nd animated feature film about Simba, a future lion king who must fight his evil Uncle for the throne.
","I wish Walt Disney was alive to see this, he would of loved it! This is probably the ultimate Disney movie. What makes the Disney movies so great are how they take themselves so seriously despite being a kids cartoon. I don't care how old you are but you're be lying if you said this movie didn't move you. This movie is similar to Disney's 2nd greatest film, Bambi. They both begin with the birth of an animal who is destined to be king of his domain, they both lose one of their parents, and the story ends with them both taking their place as king. The film's also a lot like Shakesphere's Hamlet, a story about a man who kills his own brother so he can be king. In fact, this is the first original Disney story and what a great story it is. In Disney's tradition the animation is fantastic and realistic looking. The African landscape looks awesome and very detailed. I love the idea of a lion king, because we are know lions are the king of the jungle. So take a lion king, Bambi, hamlet, and you got your self a good story. But every story needs good characters and in the tradition of classic Disney movies this has a lot of good characters. I love James Earl Jones as Moffassa, his voice is perfect for the role. He sounds authoritative and loving. Simba, the star of the story, is likable and sympathetic. You feel for him and root for him. You can't help but to love Timon & Pumba and they provide good comic relief. The hyenas are likable, even though their bad. But Shenzi, Bonzi and ED are not as evil as Scar, but are mostly indifferent, they only care about their own self interest. I wish they would've done a spin-off with the hyenas like they did with Timon & Pumba. Then there's Scar, who has to be the most evil villain in any Disney movie. I also think he is an underrated villain, I mean I never see his name on any ""greatest villain list"", he's one of the best villains ever! He killed his own brother, tried to kill his nephew, made his nephew think that he killed his father, and lied to everyone in pride rock! In fact, he might be too dark for little kids. The music is great, and I know sometime it's hard to sit through musicals, but the songs fit well into the story. And how can you not love the ""Akuta Motta"" song! That song's my philosophy too, I believe in ""No worries for the rest of your days!"" But the best song, hands down is ""circle of life"". Written by Elton John and sung by Carmen Twillie. If the movie dosen't move you, the song will. In fact, that's what makes this movie really epic, is the underlying theme about the circle of life and I like how the movie came full circle at the end of the story, ending how the film began! The lyrics are great! ""It's the circle of life, and it moves us all, through faith and hope, through despair and love, until we find our way on the path unwinding, in the circle of life!"" This film has the best opening of any movie, it's truly epic. The only problem I have with this movie, is how the story gets a little convoluted towards the end, but that's because they had a lot of story they were trying to wrap up. And I also think it's funny how were in Africa but Simba sounds American, Scar sounds English and Rafiki sounds Jamecain, or how that Buffalo stamp peed went on forever. The directors Roger Allers & Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job, on this timeless classic!"
"FMJBoyGenius","10","4","6","28 September 2011"," The One True King of animated films!
","This is my all-time favorite movie! This movie has been a part of my life since I was an infant. I am now 18, which has given me plenty of time to ponder why this film has been and continues to be a huge success. I think it's so popular for one reason: It appeals to both young and old film viewers, and here's why.<br/><br/>First, for kids, it has great music, it's funny, and has great characters, voiced by an extraordinary cast, which are qualities that make a great animated film. It's easy for an animated film to entertain children, but it's really something when adults are touched by it as well. I think one of the reasons adults like this movie so much is that it does not act like a children's film. It acts like a drama made for adults. The plot is fairly simple, but its themes, emotion, and the psychology of the characters within are things that only mature audiences will truly understand. The plot is basically about a young cub, named Simba. He loves his father, Mufasa, is eager to become king one day, and is fascinated by all he sees and hears. His life takes a very bad turn when his uncle, Scar, kills his father in order to gain the throne. He sends the cub into exile. Simba meets some new friends, Timon and Pumbaa, who raise him with a no worries lifestyle until his best friend from home, Nala, and a wise baboon, Rafiki, encourage him to return home and claim his rightful place as king. As I said, this plot is very basic. However, what is not so basic is the feelings of guilt that Simba feels for the death of his father and the psychological trauma that he has to endure for the rest of the film. Again, what is not so simple is the themes. Simba's father appears to him in the clouds and tells him ""Remember who you are."" This message basically states that a person cannot shirk their responsibilities, a message that a toddler cannot begin to understand. In addition to that, the film sums up what life is all about: Going through hard times, dealing with it, and coming out stronger because you endured it. I think the adults that watch this film grasp that concept and appreciate it. My own grandmother, who's in her eighties, bought her own copy of this film!<br/><br/>In addition to these things, the film has other elements that cannot be ignored. The first is definitely the wonderful music and songs. Hans Zimmer made the score for this film and won a much deserved Oscar for it. Elton John and Tim Rice also won Oscars for their brilliant work on this film. The songs that they created, like Circle of Life, Hakuna Matata, and Can You Feel the Love Tonight, are so well written that you can't help but be touched by them. The African words sung by Lebo M. contribute highly to the majesty of the film. When Lebo's team first sings, you automatically know that you're in Africa. From his birth to his ascension as king, Simba's journey is wondrously captured through the music and songs that the film provides. Another thing that makes this film so wonderful is the animation. Every single tree, animal, and background that appears on the screen is a stunning work of art. People that do not like this movie will usually admit that the animation is absolutely stunning. It has to be wonderful when the animators actually went to Africa and brought lions into their studio! While all of the other things about this film are wonderful, my personal favorite is the villain, Scar. He is so wonderfully voiced, animated, and brought to life that you love him, hate him, and may even be scared by him all at once. Jeremy Irons, Andreas Deja, and everyone else who worked on this character created one of the best villains in film history. He is the only animated villain to be nominated for an MTV best villain award, and is widely considered to be one of the best Disney villains of all time. Scar is so magnificent that he is in the same category with Hannibal Lecter and Ledger's Joker. The Lion King has many wonderful things that make it spectacular, but, for me, it would not be the same without Scar. A very close second to Scar is Mufasa. He is so incredibly voiced that I cannot imagine anyone else playing him. James Earl Jones brings the qualities of a commanding leader and a wonderful, loving father at the same time to this character that you can't help but feel sad when he is killed. These two characters alone make the film worth seeing. Add everything else that is great about it, and you have one of the best films ever made.<br/><br/>The Lion King has been entertaining audiences for 17 years and will do so for many years more. With its great vocal talent, animation, songs, music, and themes, the Lion King has earned its spot in IMDb's top 250 films ever made. I do not thing it will be leaving the list any time soon. It's a real shame that it was not nominated for best picture. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wishes to see a children's film that goes beyond the typical feel good animated film. With the possible exception of Beauty and the Beast, this is definitely the King of all animated films! If you haven't seen it, in 2D or 3D, I strongly encourage you to do so. You won't regret it!"

","They're re-releasing Lion King in 3D for the next two weeks, so I thought it would be a good time to look back on one of Disney's most popular films. All I can say is after watching this movie countless of times as a kid it still holds up today.<br/><br/>The story is about a young lion cub named Simba who is next in line to be the king of the jungle. Simba is rather mischievous and gets into trouble a lot with his friend Nala. His uncle Scar is jealous of Simba because he gets to be the king, so he hatches a plan with his Hyena goons to kill Simba and King Mufasa. They succeed in killing Mufasa but Simba escapes and blames himself for Mufasa's death. He goes into exile and meets two jungle bums Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the Hakuna Matata(no worries) life style and Simba grows up without a care in the world. But the lions in Pride Rock don't have it so good. Scar has let everything go to ruin and is too stubborn to leave to go look for food and water. Nala leaves to find help and finds Simba. She tries to convince him to come home but he still blames himself for Mufasa's death(not knowing it was Scar who killed him to begin with). Simba must now make a decision to either run from his past or challenge Scar to become the next king.<br/><br/>I haven't really done the plot justice by paraphrasing it but I'm sure a good many people are already quite familiar with this movie. Everything in it is top notch. The animation, the all-star cast of characters, the epic score by Hans Zimmer and the catchy tunes from Elton John and Tim Rice. Much like the old Disney movies this movie isn't afraid to get dark. There's numerous assassination attempts(one that succeeds), dark themes you wouldn't find in most kid's films nowadays, and a few jokes aimed towards the older audience. What is not to love about this movie? The only bad thing I can think about this film doesn't come from the original edit. It's the song ""Morning Report"" that comes from the special edition released a few years back. The song worked well for the Broadway show but in the movie it just slows things down and seems unnecessary next to the other songs. But still it doesn't change my opinion of the actual movie. I am going to see it in 3D? Probably. But even if the 3D turns out bad it'll be nice to see what it might have been like to watch it on the big screen."

It is a good feel movie because even though there is betrayal and death in the film life continues.<br/><br/>Least favorite parts: Hard to pick anything that I dislike in this film, but I guess Simba having to think it was his fault for his father's death all those years sucked. lol<br/><br/>Favorite parts: Music <br/><br/>Recommendation: Movie that should be own.

When Simba becomes an adult, he ventures back home to take on Scar and his hyena sidekicks. Even by today standards, this film has very good animation. Disney always does a good job with animation. The songs and score is excellent and praise-worthy. My favorite songs are ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata."" The voice acting is full of brand-name talent such as James Earl Jones, Matthew Broderick, and Whoopi Goldberg. I do think that this movie is too violent for a G rating. It should be rated PG.

","To call this a ""simple kids film"" is to not understand this film at all. Along the lines of Bambi, there's a lot of dark subject matter to be explored (the death of a parent) and even deeper is the use of texts like The Odyssey and Hamlet as seemingly interesting inspirations incorporated into a Disney film with heart, charm, and glorious music.<br/><br/>The acting is all well done. Everyone gives it their A-game, especially James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jeremy Irons. Broderick is okay, though cannot deliver his lines without a huge effort on his behalf.<br/><br/>The animation is stunning. Such vivid imagery and color is used in the opening shots that it sets the standard for the rest of the picture.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer's score is the second-greatest I've ever heard (next to The Lord of the Rings films, which I count as one film). The sweeping ""king of the past"" theme is gorgeous, and the haunting cues for Scar are terrifying. The musical numbers written by Tim Rice are great, and are sure to be remembered for ages. Elton John's, Can You Feel the Love Tonight? is so grand and beautiful, it was completely deserving of the Best Original Song Academy Award.<br/><br/>The story is confined to 90-minutes, though I could've watched twice of that. The film's pace is never dulling, and always inspiring. From the sheer horror Simba faces when seeing his dead father, to the simply masterpiece of a scene where the rains wash away Scar's destroying of Pride Rock, and Simba's ascension as king... just beautiful.<br/><br/>Overall, right alongside Finding Nemo, The Lion King is the best film Disney has ever produced. From its story to it's execution, it is flawlessly excellent. I highly recommend you see this film if you haven't already."

Watching the movie in class brings out tissues and ""It's my allergy"" excuses all around, as Simba nudges his father's still body, begging him to wake up.

"OldAle1","3","19","44","13 September 2009"," ""Hamlet"" it ain't - good Disney, it ain't either, I'm afraid to say
","For starters, I've been a big Disney and animation fan all my life; seeing Pinocchio at a pretty early age and ""Robin Hood"" on its initial release made huge impacts on me, and by the time this film came out I'd caught up with all of the Disney features. I loved - and still love - the early work, and have mixed reactions to most of the stuff from ""Peter Pan"" through ""Oliver and Company"" with a few exceptions. ""The Little Mermaid"" seemed like a return to form - and a return to the fairy tales that the company always seemed to do best with, and I liked ""Beauty and the Beast"" even more. ""Aladdin"" was alas a major step down - still pretty solid in the animation department, but Robin Williams' shtick was for me completely out of place and irritating. It was of course their biggest hit to that point, and they took some of the lessons they'd learned - less romance, more slapstick and gross humor, celebrity voices - and applied them to ""The Lion King"" with even more spectacular results.<br/><br/>For 15 years this film has ranked among my worst films of all time, and every time I mention that I get people reacting as if I told them I was the Antichrist. Seriously - I think more people will get bent out of shape if you tell them you hate ""The Lion King"" than if your feelings are negative about ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"", or ""2001"". It's always struck me as weird, because I know I'm not the only person to dislike it, and in fact none of the friends I saw it with when it came out liked it much - though none of them hated it like I did either.<br/><br/>I think that the main problem for me in 1994 is that the elements that I disliked from ""Aladdin"" in particular seemed amped-up several degrees here. I hated Whoopi and Cheech, hated the music, hated above all what I saw at the time was an infantilist assault on intelligence and wit - the smartest and coolest character in the film, Scar, also is pure evil, and all of the ""good"" characters are white-bread, boring, stupid. Dumb and strong triumphs over smart and clever; the songs sucked; the animation was coarser and less interesting than in the previous couple of films. I suspect that there were a lot of personal issues that contributed to my overwhelming hatred of the film, too, but those are lost to me at the moment.<br/><br/>I'm pleased to say on this re-watch that I don't HATE the film anymore. But I still don't like it. The issues with the treatment of Scar - not sure what I was thinking there, that was over-the-top on my part. Sure Jeremy Irons' voicing of him is in many ways a typical smart but venal character, a Godless intellectual I suppose - but it's not really that overstated or deliberate, it doesn't come off as anti-intellectual to me anymore. James Earl Jones' Mufasa may not be a genius, but he doesn't come off as a dumb noble-hearted brute either, and nobody can really beat Jones in that kind of role. The opening sequences are somewhat impressive, and the film is rarely boring. I actually sort of liked the shaman baboon character Rafiki (Robert Guillaume), and it's good that young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) takes a fair amount of screen time to grow up.<br/><br/>But...I still hate the music; ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" I actually found tolerable in relation to the other songs, but even it was so cloying and just banal that I had a hard time not fast-forwarding. This is purely a matter of taste, I make no bones about it - I like very little of Elton John's post-1970s work and so it's not surprising really. I still find the hyena characters irritating, unfunny, and way over-used. The female characters are essentially just there to move the action forward - no, the film ain't obviously racist like I guess I thought it was (though it's rather confusing in its racial and ethnic undertones) but it's definitely a boys' film. Timon and Pumbaa are gross and annoying and the film as a whole just has no sparkle, no wit to me. The animation doesn't have the zip or the beauty of the previous few films; the direction and pacing seem more inevitable than exciting, the ""spectacular"" scenes like the stampede that kills Mufasa just don't come off as all that spectacular as the digital help is too obvious and cheap-looking.<br/><br/>In any case, it wasn't torture to watch anymore, and it's actually reawakened an interest in going back through the Disney feature canon, re-watching some of the ones I don't remember well and catching up with a few of the newer ones that I never bothered with after being disappointed by this and ""Pocahontas"" in succession."

","This was my favourite movie for the longest time. The music, the animation, the voice actors, they all did a great job. But looking at it again there are somethings that don't work, such as why did Scar reign cause a drought? But anyway I still found many things that I still enjoyed. The comedy for me works very well, I laugh so hard whenever I see this movie. The songs, although all very catching, listening to them again I found some were annoying and were just alright. But I found that the orchestral score greatly outshines the singing ones. The voice actors, especially James Earl Jones, do a great job and I see them fit into their roles perfectly. The movie also gets some of its story from one of Shakespeare's greatest works, Hamlet. And finally, the animation is spectacular. Every bit looks grand and big. The style looks great. The scenes go from colourful and cheery to dark and violent. The climax, almost similar in power to Bambi, is one of the best in Disney's history, mixing powerful emotions and visuals. All in all, I must say it's still one of my favourite of Disney movies."

","Difficult to deny the worldwide success of this Disney animated musical from which already has sprung a sequel, a theatrical show and now, we hear a live-action remake in the near future. And yet watching it for the first time, I'd be lion sorry, lying if I said I thought it was top drawer Disney. I've liked Elton John's music too for many years too but again didn't feel the songs he contributed (with Tim Rice as his lyricist) were his best work even if it did give his career an unexpected boost at the time.<br/><br/>So what's not to like...well I struggled a little to side with the ruling Mafusa who when asked why it was okay for lions to eat antelopes, lamely proffered the line that lions turn back into grass when they die which then feeds the antelopes as part of the circle of life...that's not my understanding about evolution in the animal kingdom, where I thought survival of the fittest was the raison d'etre. <br/><br/>I know the film is almost 25 years old but I also thought the animation quality wasn't of the highest while the characters repeat stock situations and emotions which Disney still peddles today, i.e. rebellious youngster leaves home before returning to heroically save the day against big bad baddie, in this case Simba's uncle Scar. Oh and of course there are cute side-attractions a-plenty, like the meerkat that thinks it's Groucho Marx, his less-than-sharp wild boar sidekick that definitely isn't a pig and a witch doctor funky gibbon all helping Simba in some way or other. I didn't really think the hyenas who support Scar were especially malevolent either.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just an old stick-in-the-mud but I just didn't think ""The Lion King"" lived up to expectations. No worries though or as they say in the film Hakuna Matata."

"briguy128","3","12","30","1 May 2007"," The Beginning of the End
","I am simply amazed at how much positive response this emotional hodgepodge has received since its release back in the summer of 1994. As a young teenager back then, I saw it opening weekend on the big screen and remember thinking that it was a very visually engrossing film. In terms of capturing realistic movements and sweeping scenery, the animation in THE LION KING had easily surpassed any of its animated predecessors, and for that I found the movie fantastic. As an adult now, I realize just how superficial my initial attitude toward the film was. If there's one thing that today's overabundance of CGI has taught me, it's that there's more to a film than just ""looking good"". You need story, compelling characters, an original and well-defined conflict, and, especially in the case of animation, an artistic hand with which to draw. There's no denying that many talented artists were at work on THE LION KING, unfortunately too much effort was put forth in animation achievements and too little in developing a solid story and a clever script. Like many other IMDb users, there's no denying that this film was adapted from Shakespeare's HAMLET, just as Disney's 1988 film OLIVER AND COMPANY was adapted from Dickens' OLIVER TWIST. I wonder why Disney did not acknowledge its blatant robbery of subject matter. This is unfortunately just a minor detail in my dislike for THE LION KING. This was, in my opinion, the first in a series of many films that signaled the deterioration of Disney's traditional hand drawn animation department. No doubt about it, they were in a definite slump in the 1980's: THE FOX AND THE HOUND, THE GREAT MOUSE DETECTIVE, THE BLACK CAULDRON (ugh!), but with a fresh new crew in their animation department and a galvanizing reinvention of the formula for animated musicals in THE LITTLE MERMAID, it seemed that Disney had gotten back on its feet. Alas, THE LITTLE MERMAID, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, and ALADDIN were merely Disney's Indian summer, for with THE LION KING came a completely new generation of animated films. With THE LION KING and its followers, viewers were bombarded with a predictable stories, numerous pop culture references, an obnoxious slew of celebrity voices, dated 90's pop songs, campy humor, and heaping spoonfuls of sugary melodrama. Don't get me wrong, many of Disney's previous efforts had many of the same deficits and only a handful of them would I consider near-perfect, but the animated flicks of old never attempted to sell out their audiences in the way that THE LION KING did. Yet somehow all of these flaws are what made THE LION KING the most successful animated film in Disney history. Call me old school, but I do not think that Walt would have approved of this. Since THE LION KING's release and the replacement of traditional animation with CGI, animation I feel has lost its art. I dare you to re-watch LADY AND THE TRAMP, BAMBI, SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS, or anything made pre-1960 and compare it to such 90's fares as THE LION KING. You will notice that the films today no longer resemble moving paintings as they once did and as was the original intention of animation. Still, my opinion of THE LION KING, as well as the rubbish that followed (POCAHONTAS THE HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME, HERCULES...okay, MULAN was not bad up until its pop-music ending..THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE???!!!) seems to be the minority. None of these later Disney flicks were works of art, they were just another form of advertisement---predictable story with the feel-good moral of an ending, comic relief sidekicks, a pop song rolling during the end credits, etc. Yes, they all have very admirable morals (what makes a true hero???...it is important to embrace diversity...who's the real monster here???)but (gasp!!!) that's unnecessary political propaganda. Disney wasn't always that wholesome (Does anyone remember the Siamese Cat song from LADY AND THE TRAMP or ""What made the Red Man Red"" from PETER PAN?) and, even when they did take America's sensitivity into consideration, it never overwhelmed the entire project. Oh well, censorship is a completely different subject that needs not be addressed in this review. The point that I'm trying to make is that somewhere along the road animation was no longer considered art but simply cheap entertainment guaranteed to make money. And when I hear praise for films like THE LION KING for merely manipulating the general population with special effects, melodramatic plot twists, pop songs, and cheesy one-liners (not to mention lame attempts at comedy via ninja-fighting), I think back to when an animated film was not just a movie, but an idea, a seed, a creative project, an event, and and art form, and I am saddened."
"rjackson7","2","41","128","20 March 2005"," This movie really is rubbish
","I apologise to all those captivated by the African landscapes and orchestral harmonies, but this movie is disjointed and shallow. The mass of names credited with the ""Story"" says it all - this movie is a bunch of disconnected scenes thrown together with absolutely no character cohesion at all. Some examples:<br/><br/>Simba and Narla bicker and argue. They then sing ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" They then IMMEDIATELY continue to bicker and argue, and part ways.<br/><br/>Simba goes from little kid to mature adult - Timon and Pumba do not age a day.<br/><br/>After Mufasa safely brings himself and Simba up the cliff, he is then thrown to his death, and Simba never sees this as unusual or even wonder why.<br/><br/>There are absolutely no male lions anywhere in the entire movie other than Mufasa, Scar and Simba - an entire tribe of Lions at pride rock, with no males at all.<br/><br/>Timon and Pumba play absolutely no role in the plot, meaning or interest of the movie. They are shallow comic diversions that have no place being there. Their theme song (Hakuna Matata) contradicts the entire message of the movie, which is to live up to your responsibilities instead of ignoring them.<br/><br/>Not one lion in Pride Rock EVER wonders what happened to Simba, and nor does the annoying bird Zazu, who was right there when it all happened - this is utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>Scar would never have simply admitted to killing Mufasa.<br/><br/>After years of constant threats and derision, Mufasa is surprised when Scar turns against him, as if he never suspected a thing...<br/><br/>I could go on for a long time. This movie makes no sense, it is too scary and murderous for young children, and it completely lacks any emotional involvement with any character. The young Simba is utterly arrogant, the old Simba completely distant, and his change of character totally unbelievable and contrived.<br/><br/>Yes, this movie ""deals"" with many grand themes - it deals with them in the same way a food processor would ""deal"" with a 3 course meal - mash it all up into random unpalatable rubbish. Yes, the themes are there, but the movie has nothing to say about any of them, and they are presented in a completely disjointed manner. Comparisons to Hamlet is one of the greatest insults possible to Shakespeare.<br/><br/>If you want a good kids movie, The Lion King IS NOT IT."
"kira02bit","3","8","18","10 October 2014"," Clichéd story and passive central character make for a weak Disney entry
","Unlike the majority of its Walt Disney brethren, The Lion King was written directly for the screen and does not find its roots in either a fairy tale or popular children's literature. It relates the story of the young lion Simba, who is destined to become king of the pride one day when his regal father Mufasa steps down. This does not sit well with Mufasa's villainous brother Scar, who concocts a scheme to eliminate Mufasa and then convince a guilt-stricken Simba that the death is his own fault and he should exile himself from the pride. Simba befriends the unlikely duo of a meercat and warthog and they become friends during his exile, until his childhood friend Nala arrives to apprise Simba of the ruin that Scar's villainy has left the pride and beg for Simba's return.<br/><br/>Although the plot is fairly familiar and clichéd for a new story, there is a lot that could be done here. Unfortunately, Simba is such a passive, uninteresting central character that it is difficult to care much about what happens. Other than Simba, Mufasa and Scar, the pride pretty much blurs together. Simba's mother is a virtual non-entity and Simba's female friend Nala is gone for so much of the running time that you nearly forget she is a character in the film. Other than the comical meercat and warthog team (well voiced by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella), none of the supporting characters are especially memorable, and that duo has little to no impact on the climax. It also does not help that Scar (lazily voiced by Jeremy Irons) is a fairly dull villain. His first act number where he sings about his nefarious plans is disturbing, not only because of Irons horrendous singing, but because someone had the ill-conceived notion of having hordes of his hyena henchmen goose-stepping in the background like Nazi soldiers, which adds a heavy weight that this slight film cannot carry. The film also has a fair amount of dead spots between songs and fight scenes.<br/><br/>The animation is typically first-rate, but not as impressive or imaginative as that found in its predecessors, even as recent as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. The vocal talent is a mixed bag as well. While Lane and Sabella are stand-outs and James Earl Jones provides the suitably dignified tones for Mufasa, Matthew Broderick is an incredibly bland choice to voice the adult Simba. Ditto, Moira Kelly is not much better as Nala. Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin are not particularly menacing as some of the hyenas.<br/><br/>Huge gaps in the story seem to smack of really lazy writing. Mufasa is supposed to be an insightful leader, yet is completely blind-sided by the evil plots of his nasty brother, whose perfidy is ridiculously blatant. Once Scar is king and demonstrates that he is terrible, the film would have us believe that not only are there no other male lions to challenge him, but that the lionesses would passively put up with him destroying the pride without any show of resistance. This, of course, sets up the scene for Simba to return as a savior and rescue the pride while facing down Scar, but there are several things wrong. First, the film never convinces us that there is a need for anyone to await Simba's return when the pride could have banded together themselves to challenge Scar and his minions instead of suffering. And second, Simba does nothing during the course of the film to demonstrate that he could be anyone's savior other than that he is Mufasa's son and the plot rather ham-handedly demands it of him.<br/><br/>I am also not a fan of the soundtrack written by Elton John. The film opens with the ""The Circle of Life,"" which is a sequence that heralds the birth of Simba, introduces the main characters and sets the stage. Unfortunately, I find this song comes off like one of the worst examples of faux-inspirational Christian rock. ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" sung by the young Simba feels like a third-rate Michael Jackson riff. ""Hakuna Matata"" is probably the best of the songs, but it is surprisingly forgettable. And the less said about the dirge-like love ballad ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", the better. It is a horrible song badly shoe-horned into the film. Old childhood friends Simba and Nala rediscover each other and then immediately start fighting, then the film pauses for the love ballad, before they go back to fighting and parting. It is a clumsily staged sequence and one that more often than not has the little ones tuning out. Ironically, the song that sticks with the viewer after the film ends is ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", the old 1950s nutshell which gets a few bars sung in the film and easily outclasses John's pretentious and precious piffles.<br/><br/>Purportedly this is Walt Disney's biggest box office success, but it is hard to understand why or how given some of the landmark classics in animation that Disney has provided in the past. I don't find the film fun, or memorable, or particularly astonishing. In fact, barring the dreadful Hercules, I would rank this as one of the worst of the Disney films."

","The Lion King made a big splash when it was released in the mid-90's. I missed it then, but saw it recently because of my 3 yr old son. I've also seen other animated-family comedies like Shrek, Finding Nemo and Ice Age in recent weeks. Given the leaps in digital technology achieved in the past decade, The Lion King looks very dated. The animation and colors are not as realistic and vivid as 21st century Pixar-Disney offerings.<br/><br/>This is basically a child-friendly take on the Hamlet tale with Denmark replaced by the African jungle and people replaced by lions, and other animals, notably a parrot, hyenas etc. The Elton John soundtrack is still quite good, with The Morning Report and Hakuna Matata standing out. The dialogue is not nearly as witty as that of Ice Age or Nemo but still appealing for kids. We have James Earl Jones and Jeremy Irons voices for two vital characters, and both have magnificent voices for animated movies. Irons even sings a song or two and has a pretty pleasant voice."

"ElMaruecan82","10","3","5","16 October 2011"," Remember what Disney used to be ...
","It's an interesting coincidence that ""The Lion King"" was released one year before the groundbreaking ""Toy Story"": the first animated feature in 3D that would pave the way for a new kind of family entertainment. ""The Lion King"" is the Disney Renaissance period at its pinnacle and probably the last hand-drawn Disney classic.<br/><br/>Now, I won't mention Pixar and the 3D animated features again, because I want, for once, to take a big plunge and get back to that magical year that was 1994. Disney Renaissance was this unexpected animated streak that started with ""The Little Mermaid"" and brought up memorable masterpieces such as ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"", which finally elevated the world of Animation to the same level of spectacular greatness and respectability than live-action films. But I think there are two words that get often mixed up : masterpieces and classics, a movie can be an excellent technical accomplishment but for some reasons, it gets less recognition than a minor film. I like ""Mermaid"", the two B's and I'm a big fan of ""Aladdin"", they might be classic in terms or notoriety, but there are more of animated masterpieces, while it can be said about ""The Lion King"" that it's not only a masterpiece, but also a timeless classic.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" is not an exhilarating adventure, nor a passionate romance, not a comic film, it's a wonderful coming-of-age story, focusing on the most universal values that guide our lives. On that level, the film is to Disney Renaissance what ""Bambi"" was to the Golden Age. And the comparison here is not fortuitous, ""The Lion King"" works almost as an adult drama whose most important theme is succession and passing of time, with the interesting notion that Simba, the central character, must conquer a lost title back. From the opening, we get the full meaning of the eternal cycle of time, with a rising sun announcing the birth of the new Prince, and all the animals of the savanna coming to pay respect to the King Mufasa's newborn son. The opening sequence of ""The Lion King"" with Elton John's ""Circle of Life"" is probably one of Disney greatest movie moments ever, and the proof, it it ever was needed, of that Disney capability to touch hearts and command our feelings with the simple magic use of motion and colors.<br/><br/>This sequence and every following frame highlight the perfect mastery of every technical element : the animation, the dazzling cinematography with the perfect use of reliefs and colors to illustrate the diversity of a rich animal microcosm, the direction, the music, I mean both the score and the songs, the characters and probably more than anything, the story. It's about succession, family, life and death, jealousy and betrayal with the villain whose no one but the King's brother, Scar, whose suave voice from Jeremy Irons, provides a touch I would qualify as 'Shakespearian', a more sophisticated word for 'universal'. But forget these big words, because to understand why ""The Lion King"" is such an endearing classic, we have to regard it through the eyes of those who discovered the film as kids. <br/><br/>In ""The Lion King"", there's no romance, it's not about getting the girl, or the boy, the main character is a kid who wants to become like his father, who learns about the meaning of life, of courage and more than anything, of his identity, something sacred based on two pivotal elements : heritage and family, the past and the future, the very position in the circle of life. We can all relate to Simba as kids and as adults. And generally, the Disney stories that are centered on a kid are more appealing : ""Dumbo"" was about difference's acceptance, ""Pinocchio"" about responsibilities, ""The Fox and the Hound"" about tolerance, ""Jungle Book"" about  not that one was just pure fun  Romances rely on so many elements of predictability it easily undermines their appeal, and to recognize Disney romances, they're generally the ones where you most remember the scene-stealing sidekicks or comic relief characters.<br/><br/>In ""The Lion King"", Simba is the heart of the story, and we follow him during an epic journey in life, with his father and mentor, Mufasa, the King with that naturally authoritarian James Earl Jones' voice. Just thinking of the scene where they play at night gives me shudders, and I mean it : any boy close to his father can understand that level of tenderness and love  and of course, it makes the following sequence even more horrific, but this is what makes the film so memorable. Generations of kids have been traumatized by Bambi mom's death, why sparing ours? As usual, in Disney films, death, if not part of life, is part of a learning process, tragic but necessary. This is ""The Lion King"", a wonderful story, populated by a gallery of (literally) colorful characters following an extraordinary soundtrack with so many unforgettable catchy songs, that lurched the film into pop culture memories : ""Hakuna Matata !"" <br/><br/>If there was ever a music associated with 1994, it would belong to ""The Lion King"", and I'm glad it won an Oscar for this, as I'm glad Hans Zimmer won for the score too, as it probably is the musical expression of the film's emotional power. The conclusion of the film where Simba gets back on the top of the rock and starts roaring give me thrills (just thinking of it) and never fails to make me cry.<br/><br/>There are no words to describe what makes ""The Lion King"" so great. It's like the Disney team decided to combine all the efforts for a last masterpiece ... that would become one of the greatest animated films ever. So great I would have loved that the ghost of Walt Disney would haunt them every once in a while, saying : ""Remember who you are"""

","'The Lion King' is a Disney animation about a lion cub named Simba who runs away from his responsibility after thinking that he is to blame for his father's fate. Along the way, Simba meets Timon and Pumba, the comical sidekicks. It's a sad film, but it is a film about life, and it is realistic in that sense. However, 'The Lion King' is probably my least favourite Disney animation. Although Timon and Pumba are supposed to provide the comic relief, I found the couple very annoying. Yes, this film had huge success in the 1990s, but I was never impressed with it. Most people seem to really enjoy this film, so I am probably in the majority for giving it a low rating, but I just did not think it was that good of a film."

Now just hear me out, this movie is the reason that I have assembled my love for movies in the first place. It changed everything and guided me into a world off good versus evil and how you always can move away from tragedy in your life and take the path that fate have chosen for you. The Lion King is a movie that will be watched for generations to come and the new remake off the film here in 2019 is not gonna bring the magic back all, I know that because you can't do a movie twice that already have been made so perfectly by Walt Disney himself, its just not gonna happen.

Of course, as far as I can tell, I'm not exactly the peer group for this title, so I won't be judging too hard.<br/><br/>The movie tells a nice story. One of those typical stories of good and evil, betrayal and loyalty and the difficulties of finding yourself. Wouldn't it be for the animals, it could as well be some historical drama. Whilest you don't get bored, partly due to the humorous sidekicks, the plot in itself is not really all to innovative.<br/><br/>The big strength of the film is in my eyes the soundtrack, that produced quite a few classics that even I could recall. Singing in movies is always a risky thing but in this case reminds me of the old day Disney movies, where singing was almost something like a brand mark.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" is short, but I'm sure children will be able to fall in love with the exceptionally drawn characters quite easily and therefor have their fun.

This means he will grow up to ascend the throne after Mustafa, to the envy of his evil uncle Scar, who forms an alliance with the hyenas of the barrens, personally killing Mustafa and arranging to have them kill Simba, who disappears into the wilderness. Years later, he re-emerges to claim his rightful place and take down the evil Scar.<br/><br/>It's a scary thing when you start to notice you're getting older, when films you remember seeing when they first came out are re-released for a new generation, especially when you remember seeing them when you were so young. What with the recent re-release of Jurassic Park and now this 3D re release of one of Disney's more original works, not adapted from any old fairy tales or children's stories. But, with the onslaught of admittedly amazing Pixar wonders that tend to do the rounds more nowadays, The Lion King is a timely reminder of just how well Disney can do when left to it's own devices.<br/><br/>While you often get infinitely more cynical as an adult, the timeless wonders of Disney animations are an opportunity to re-connect with your inner child and appreciate something that works on a more superficial appeal than what is required to appreciate more gritty, hard hitting adult stuff. That said, as well as having fluffy kids appeal (most notably with the I Just Can't Wait to be King and Hakuna Matada musical interludes) TLK also plays out with themes of a more traditional Greek tragedy, of jealousy, murder and revenge that gives it an under lyingly more darker tone...I do remember parents being advised to watch with younger children on the back of the video I used to own and maybe it's not that hard to see why.<br/><br/>It's hard to recall a really bad Disney animation, and The Lion King is not only no exception, it's a prime example of why they hold such timeless appeal for child and adult alike, an animation masterpiece that will always hold an appeal to anyone who sees it (and even more so if you first saw it when you were young.) *****"

This caused us to pause the movie on numerous occasions in an attempt to explain. This was a great educational experience for her, but took too much discussion and took a little bit away from the flow of the film. On another note, the movie was rather short (88 minutes) which is actually great for an animated movie.

","The best Disney animated move ever made, ""The Lion King"", was recently re-released in theaters everywhere, in crystal clear, high definition 3-D. I was super excited because ""The Lion King"" is my all-time favorite Disney animated movie, and the thought of watching this spectacular movie in 3-D, it felt like I'm seeing it for the first time. Everything in the movie is still memorable to this day. The memorable characters we all know and love, including Simba, Timon, Pumbaa, Nala, Rafiki, Mufasa, Scar, and the Hyenas, are still the characters we know from our childhood. Also, Hans Zimmer's incredible music score is breathtaking and exhilarating, and it helped tell the story. Speaking of that, the story is an example of what happens when Shakespeare's Hamlet has lions! It's thrilling, funny, breathtaking, heartbreaking, and it has a message that's truly uplifting. But the best part of the whole movie, is the beautiful and memorable songs brought to us, by Elton John and Tim Rice. Everyday, almost everybody sings to ""Circle of Life"", ""Hakuna Matata"", ""Just Can't Wait to Be King"", and the forever-classic ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"". I hope that all audiences will enjoy a movie like ""The Lion King"", for the characters, the songs, and it's beautiful heart.

In short, it was a wonderfully magical time just seeing such a classically made drawn animated movie by the best artists Disney had to offer with great music and songs by Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and Tim Rice and perfect voices provided by James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Matthew Broderick, Robert Guillaume, Jeremy Irons as the villainous Scar, and especially, Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as the great comic relief of Timon and Pumbaa! If there was one slight flaw, it's that how stupid was Scar to reveal his role in killing his brother just as nephew Simba was at death's door. But it did provide Simba to get over himself quickly so maybe that was necessary. Otherwise, The Lion King is one of the greatest experiences I've had at the movies. P.S.

"Diego_rjc","10","2","3","26 February 2010"," One of Disney's best animated flicks
","The Walt Disney Company is without a doubt the biggest animation studio of all time. They created the genre back in 1937 with 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' and kept making animated movies, even until today. The company holds credit for some truly all-time classics, such as the own 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs', 'Cinderella', 'Sleeping Beauty', etc. But back in 1994, when 'The Lion King' came out, it seemed like Disney was losing its touch, without the magic of the movies in former times. But 'The Lion King' changed that, showing that Disney still had it what it took to make a great movie, and they managed to make one of their best flicks.<br/><br/>'The Lion King' tells the story of Sinbad, a young lion, son of the village's king, Mufasa. But the brother of Mufasa, Scar, always wanted to be king, and he feels threatened once Sinbad is born, because the throne goes to Sinbad, not to him. He then performs an elaborated plan to kill his own brother and convince the young Sinbad that he did it. Now Sinbad runs away because of shame, only to be persuaded to come back already as a grown lion and try to rule the kingdom instead of Scar. 'The Lion King's story is assumed as been a crossover of 'Hamlet' and 'Bambi'. It does have lots of elements of both's story, but the movie hold its own rights by telling the story, in a very excellent manner. The character study and development is amazing, extremely well-written script, except for a few parts, where characters make stupid choices, but it's really minor and you don't realize it. One thing I didn't like is the movie's running time, I mean, of course it's a children's movie, but it could run a little longer, showing missing parts like Sinbad growing up with Timom and Pumbaa. And talking about them, these are some of the best and most charismatic characters in an animated movie. They really stole the whole show. And the charisma Timom and Pumbaa have left, the main character doesn't. I really didn't like him, and when he grows up he is just like his father, you can't really distinguish them.<br/><br/>The voice-acting in here is truly great. I think that the movie is quite well-cast, with some famous names like Matthew Broderick as the main character, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, the king's adviser, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi, one of the hyenas, and others not so- famous names, like Nathan Lane as Timon and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. In my opinion, the best member of the cast is Jeremy Irons. He managed to put such a depth on the villain, Scar, which I dare to say it's one of the best performances by an actor in a animated movie. It really blew me off. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella were also great as Timon and Pumbaa. Excellent chemistry between both.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by two people, Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. Generally, people say that directing an animated picture is easier than a live-action one, because you can put the camera wherever you want. It's true some times, but the animation has other challenges than a normal picture, and the both directors did a good job, except in the final fight scene. The use of slow-motion bothered me, it seemed like one lame action picture. But aside from this, the rest of the movie is greatly directed and animated. As for the animation, it's simply fantastic, there's nothing more to say about it. It one one the best 2-D animation ever. All the character's moves, the background, the effects of light and shadow, the representation of Africa's nature, the effect of depth and mainly the effects of fire and water are so real, but at the same time they have a beautiful, unique style. Thumbs up for the animators and the art-director, they used the huge movie's budget to animate it perfectly.<br/><br/>This movie is also well-known by having one of the best soundtrack of an animated picture. It's true indeed. Elton John's and Tim Rice's songs are great for a children's film, but it's Hanz Zimmer's original music score that sets the mood perfectly. It has such a depth, such a soul to it, it's hard to imagine the movie without it. All the sequences are perfectly composed and executed, but it's the opening scene that still gives me chills every time I watch it. It's one of the best introductions to a movie of all time. That's mainly because of the perfect score and also the great cinematography, another perfect aspect about this movie. It's an animated movie, yes, but it has an excellent cinematography. There some scenes with a groundbreaking photography, the kind of thing to set the bar for others to come. <br/><br/>Overral, 'The Lion King' is one of the best Disney's animated flicks and one of the best animated movies off all time. Personally, been a Pixar fan, I still prefer 3-D animation, but I can't deny that the 2-D animation here is excellent, with some great effects. The voice acting is nice, and Jeremy Irons delivered an incredible performance. Hanz Zimmer's original music score is one of the best of all time, together with the cinematography. 'The Lion King' proved Dysney still had it on them to make excellent pictures, but unfortunately they didn't make anything that even comes close to 'The Lion King' after it. It's a true shame.<br/><br/>9/10"

I liked ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Aladdin"", but they weren't my favorites (""Beauty and the Beast"" I liked when I was older, since it's a more mature movie). <br/><br/>I remember seeing ""Lion King"" in theaters when I was 10 and it was a life experience. I was totally blown away of the opening and the rest of the film.

So I got really sick of it.<br/><br/>But I'm still enjoying it this movie now. ""Lion King"" has some of the greatest moments in Disney history ever. My favorite characters are Simba, Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa. Scar is a good and unusual villain, although he's never been my favorite Disney villain. As a kid I liked the hyenas, but now I think they're annoying.<br/><br/>The songs are very memorable (except ""Be Prepared""), ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"" is one of the most beautiful love songs ever. The score of Hans Zimmer is also great. The animation is absolutely stunning and gorgeous. <br/><br/>It's ironic to think that this film, who is based on a loose script (ok, it's has borrowed from other stories), was going to be Disney's most successful financial feature ever. The only bad thing in this movie it's the moral becomes a little bit overwhelming beyond the story. Besides that, Lion King it's a excellent movie and it's a shame that the movies afterwards didn't restore Disney's reputation (even some of those movies were great)."

However, Nala doesn't go insane and die, Simba doesn't go insane, he just goes on a ""simbacation"" and some other things. The main reason that it seems very similar is because both stories are full of Archetypes, which if you don't know what that is, look it up. it's very interesting. It is a great movie and i really don't have a problem with the comparisons to Hamlet. In my AP English class we discussed that very comparison and then discussed why it's not quite the same. Overall, good."

","From its stunning sound to the masterful music, The Lion King is an adventure of two forms. First, the story takes you through the trials of Simba, a lion cub trying to find his place in the circle of life. As the viewer grows with Simba, the movie takes a detour to journey to the center of you heart. Through the Lion King, viewers can travel to the depths of their own souls and identify with the struggles of Simba as he tries to find his place in the Circle of Life. Disney's masterpiece has garnered unprecedented support and created a fan base all its own, while establishing itself as one of the defining images of our culture today. Don't miss out! The Lion King is every bit the King of animated features."

","The film is such a heart-warming story. The movie is about a young lion named simba, who is tricked into thinking he is responsible for his father's death, and then leaves the pride with guilt and goes off on his own. He grows up alone, but on the way he meets a lifelong friend who has its funny moments, its action, and it's really the perfect movie for kids. For adults, the acting was great, the story was good, and it was predictable, but not when I was a kid. So it's a warm movie"
"Jeremy_Urquhart","10","1","1","20 April 2020"," One of the best animated films of all time
","The Lion King was pretty much my favourite movie growing up. It was one of those movies I probably watched dozens of times between the age of 2 and 6, so much so I probably had the entire film committed to memory at some point. So I definitely had fond memories of it, and still felt a great deal of emotional attachment towards the film, but for a while I started thinking- is the movie actually any good? Or was it just overwhelming nostalgia telling me that the movie was better than it really is in cold, cynical, objective reality?<br/><br/>I went and watched the film when it was re-released in cinemas back in 2011- in 3D, of course, which was resoundingly ""meh,"" but the whole gimmicky 3D stuff didn't even matter. I was getting to see one of my most fondly remembered childhood films on the big screen, and it was kinda exciting. Of course, the excitement could have led me to be massively let down when viewing the film as an older and (slightly) more mature individual, but thankfully, to my relief, the movie was awesome. I enjoyed it just as much at 17 as I had enjoyed it at 4, and came to realise that the movie was indeed a great one. Nostalgia may have helped a bit, but I still think from a more objective standpoint this is a damn great film- almost certainly my favourite animated movie of all time.<br/><br/>Of course it's hard to pick a favourite animation film in a universe where Pixar exists. My pick for my favourite animation film could easily go to almost any of Pixar's masterpieces, but I guess I just feel a bit more connected to The Lion King. There's definitely something very special about it, but it's all a bit tough to put into words.<br/><br/>I guess all I can really say is that it's a movie that's just fundamentally effective. Does that make sense? I don't know. There's just so many good components of this movie, and they all come together so well to deliver an extremely satisfying experience.<br/><br/>For starters, the story is a fantastic one, dealing with themes of fate, death, pride, betrayal, and other things you don't usually see in a kid's film. The film can get pretty dark at times, but thankfully never to an overwhelming extent, because this does have to be child accessible after all. And I'm also thankful for the fact this movie's not all doom and gloom because it allows for some great humour. I still think Timon and Pumba are a hilarious duo- if you told me you thought they were annoying as hell, I wouldn't argue, but for some reason they never got on my nerves and I found them hysterical. Oh, and Rowan Atkinson as the frequently abused bird servant Zazu is fantastic.<br/><br/>That's another thing worth mentioning- the voice acting. It's great across the board, and serious props has to go to whoever helped cast this movie, as there were some incredibly great choices here. Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones... even Matthew Broderick is perfectly suited to his character.<br/><br/>The animation and the overall look of the film is brilliant too. There's so much colour in this movie, and it really didn't need a gimmicky 3D conversion for one to become completely immersed in the film's world.<br/><br/>And yeah, the music needs a mention too. I know everybody loves all the really memorable songs from the movie, and I imagine I'm not the only person who will never forget the particularly catchy ones (I'm looking at you 'I just can't wait to be king'), but I think more credit needs to go to Hans Zimmer's brilliant score. Zimmer is maybe one of the most praised composers still working today, and while I often find his music works very well with the movies he writes it for, the pieces of music themselves are usually kind of underwhelming to listen to by themselves. However, his score for The Lion King I think is absolutely brilliant, and I also believe his instrumental stuff is just as good as the undeniably catchy and more well-known Elton John songs.<br/><br/>So, just watch this movie. You don't need to be a kid to enjoy it. Who says animated films are only for kids anyways?"

","""The lion king"" is a film that can accompany people to grow up, it brings people moved, the aftertaste is deep and long. The first time I saw it, I cried twice, once mufasa died and simba cried out in despair, and once at the end of the film simba stood on the rock of glory again and everything came back to life. The story is set on the African savannah full of vitality. The magnificent savannah sets off the profound themes of love, responsibility, growth and life cycle into a grand epic, showing a new and magnificent world, and letting us experience the life of love and adventure. This connotation transcends any culture or country, because human beings cannot change the laws of nature, and love is the emotion that human beings always pursue. The reason why this is a film with the growth of people, because from the film we can see their own growth. Like the protagonist simba, childhood carefree, naughty and brave."

Do you choose to bury the trauma and live a simple life, or do you choose to face it and overcome it and live a glorious life? When Rafiki says ""It's time"", it means that Simba has completed his baptism of life. At the end of the movie, Simba steps heavily on the stone of glory in the rain in the tragic music. When he inherits the country, what he is about to face is not the smooth and glorious life, but the real and cruel life. But this is the real world. When you step out, you are your own king!"

","The Lion King<br/><br/>Do you want to set the mood for a movie? You need to realize that music is the best way to create an ambience to a scene, and it's, besides visuals, the most important thing in a movie.<br/><br/>Simba is a lion, the son of a king, but the nephew of a frustrated, evil almost-king.
Simba goes from place to place discovering new things, until one day, his father dies in the hands of his uncle, who claims the throne and exiles Simba. The little lion goes far away from the pride and is found by a warthog and a meerkat, Timon and Pumba, the ones that some time later, convince him to go back and claim the throne, so he does.<br/><br/>I heard that this movie was based on Hamlet, but the emotional impact that the Lion King has on kids is huge, not just because of the story, but the music that goes with it creates such a synesthesia that you cannot disconnect your feelings from it. Hanz Zimmer did a really great job on this soundtrack.<br/><br/>This movie is, in my opinion, one of the most revolutionary animated movies of all time, but without its music, the impact wouldn't be as huge as it is. The Lion king is the complement of its story, characters, emotionality and music. A total masterpiece."

","The Lion King is one of the movies that Ihad seen in my childhood. It is a phenomenon of the ages. There is no film like it or never will be. Animated or not, this film is the best in everything. Characters have been portrayed so well in their contrasts and similarities, each being unique. The story is about every theme - Paternal and Maternal Love, Romance, Comedy, Betrayal, Guilt, Redemption and Reclamation. I saw the new one, and believe me, it sucked totally. Wouldn't even come within miles of this film. The jungle book is even more lively than the new one in 2019.
Which brings me back to our Classic.
The music is so genuine, 'Circle of Life', 'Be Prepared', ' I Just Can't Wait To Be King', Hakuna Matata', 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' are so memorable. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer is epic. The cinematography grips you from the moment you watch it till the end. The animation is so genuine and heartfelt. It gives me the chills, the song of 'Be Prepared'. Overall a classic for the ages.❤❤❤"

","On June ,1994 Disney directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff creates one of the most breathtaking and legendary movies of all centuries.For my childish mind at that time this was a huge amazement and wonder ,not only because it was greatly animated film ,but also due to the fact that scriptwriters had made an excellent work while writing the plot.This Walt Disney presentation should have cut a huge swathe through all age groups .Young children and adults alike well warn to its nourishingly wise storyline.
A film that only get better with repeat viewings and age, The Lion King is a fantastic animated masterpiece that is among Disney's finest achievements. Stellar voice work, great musical score, beautiful to look at and emotionally complex and riveting. Questions which their parents will have to answer. Dad, is Mufasa really dead? Can this happen? He is the king!
The Lion King is a fun, often funny, and at some times tragic animation and some of the most iconic movie moments in cinema. The music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. n't really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn't run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody.<br/><br/>Diana :)
Disney is one of the few animation companies that creates animated films not only for children, but also for adults. The creations of the studio evoke a wide range of emotions in people of all ages. And here it doesn't matter how old you are. The important thing is that they leave a huge impression after viewing.
The lion king is one of the most popular animated films that are remembered for all time. This animation is both soulful, sincere and heartbreaking, as it describes the full path of becoming the lion king. Everyone will find his own in it. And thanks to this style, Walt Disney became famous throughout the world.
The ""Lion king"" is an allegory. The main characters in the film are exclusively the inhabitants of the African savannah. Mufasa, the father of Simba, is the personification of power: the majestic and strong king of . Sherkhan is the exact opposite, cunning, greedy and envious. Given the fact that the Lion King is one of the few cartoons in which, looking at the characters, you can see people. As we can see all the best and worst human qualities are transferred to the screen, and the viewer sees people in animals.
The Lion King is an amazing cartoon. The whole picture is wonderful in it: landscapes of Africa, portrayal of characters; music by the talented Hanz Zimmer and songs performed by Elton John; humor and, of course, the plot itself.
""The Lion King"" is a masterpiece of world animation, which is known and loved all over the world, therefore I advise everyone, even strongly recommend viewing it to both children and adults."

","The Lion King is the one Disney film that I know and remember by heart and has always been my favorite Disney film and a childhood favorite of mine.<br/><br/>The Lion King tells the story of a young lion, Simba (voiced by Johnathan Taylor Thomas), who is the son of the king of the pride lands, Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). Mufasa has a deliciously evil brother, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons) that later on sets up a stampede to kill Mufasa and Simba. However, Simba manages to escape. He meets a meerkat, Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella), and befriends them and grows up with them. Simba, now an adult (voiced by Matthew Broderick) comes across an old friend, Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly) and she tells him that the pride lands are in danger from Scar and his hyena minions. Simba must return and defeat Scar once and for all.<br/><br/>This movie has outstanding animation, a very great story, and the pacing is excellent.<br/><br/>The voice cast all did a great job too. Other big actors that are in this are Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, and Jim Cummings as the three hyenas; Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. There's also Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, the blue hornbill, and Robert Guillaume as Rafiki, an old baboon that is essentially the shaman of the pride lands.<br/><br/>There is absolutely nothing wrong with The Lion King. It is a childhood favorite of mine, and still holds up 25 years later."

","What an interesting (and albeit fun) way to tell Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" in a cartoonish fashion set in the Animal Kingdom.<br/><br/>Yet, despite the familiar base story, it came out EPIC as hell-- Becoming one of Disney's best animated films ever produced! (Explanation followed~)<br/><br/>You know a movie is just darn good when it leaves you emotionally riled up each time you watch it. And Lion King just does that.
Especially the beginning, the goosebumps-- *shivers*
But apart from the epic narrative, the morale in it as just as powerful: ""Remembeing who you are and that running away from your past / responsibilities won't fix anything. Instead embrace your past mistakes, learn from it and move on. Also remembering that worrying most of the time won't help either. Remeber to have fun once in a while.(Hakuna Matata!)<br/><br/>Growing up with this movie has been one hell of a ride, and continues to leave me feeling thrilled each time.

"Benslie","10","1","1","21 July 2019"," One of the greats
","First of all, the music in this film is just so iconic and no matter what generation you are a part of you have heard these songs more than once. It's not just the songs that I'm talking about the score, composed by Hans Zimmer, is spectacular. The score fits so well with every scene and it helps to intensify the scene. The entire movie is just filled with incredible music. The animation in this film is stunning and, in my opinion, looks better than some of the animated movies we have now a day. The animals have amazing detail on them and you can easily tell that the animators put a lot of effort into making each and every detail. Not just with the animals but the background as well. This is best shown in the ""I Just can't Wait to be King"" song where the animators took the time to change up the backgrounds to help convey that this is a dream sequence. I know it's weird to mention cinematography in an animated film but honestly, this film almost feels like a live-action film and I will do whatever I want because the cinematography is outstanding in this film. From shots where they are showing a bright scene and then quickly changing to dark is just amazing. The characters in this film feel three-dimensional and anybody can easily relate to one or more of the characters. From the people who are free and easy-going like Timon and Pumbaa to the protective parent like Mufasa they all are relatable and had great voice casting. Everybody was perfectly voice casted and I could easily see them as that character. I only really had a problem sometimes with Matthew Broderick where a couple of times I couldn't really hear it. This film has a great message in it that you shouldn't run away from your problems but deal with them right then and there in the present. In the end, this film is perfect for anybody and everybody."

It helped to tell the story and it was absolutely perfect.<br/><br/>The humour ... spot on. Music was at the right level that gave you goosebumps and that made you feel something.

The wisest words anyone could ever take to heart, ""The past can hurt, but you can either run from it or learn from it"". Wise words from a wise mandrill.<br/><br/>When it comes right down to it, this legendary classic will always have a place in my heart. I'm glad I grew up with it. I'm glad most 90's kids did.

Everytime watching it feels like it's a first time."
"Noah_Biondi","9","1","1","15 October 2018"," A Powerful Roar
","Quick warning: This review DOES contain some minor spoilers like plot elements, but there's nothing too major and I'm sure most of you reading this have already seen the movie.<br/><br/>Many people consider Disney's The Lion King to be one of their greatest films ever made, often praising the emotions, the character development, the humor, and the musical aspects. These much-praised aspects of the film are indeed worthy to be titled one of the best by Disney.<br/><br/>What's the story? A lion cub crowned prince is tricked by a treacherous uncle into thinking he caused his father's death and flees into exile in despair, only to learn in adulthood his identity and his responsibilities.<br/><br/>There are many great things to say about this movie, but without a doubt the best aspect of the whole movie is the animation. The way it breathes fresh air onto the environments, the designs of the animals, as well as having tons of color and energy, is very well done, and renders beautifully onto the screen. It's certainly one of the best looking Disney movies of all time. Another great thing about this movie is that the emotion is played very well. Unlike some other emotional films like The Good Dinosaur, the emotional scenes are appropriately emotional and they don't overdo anything on a sad scene. The reason why Mufasa's death is considered one of the most heartbreaking scenes in cinema history is because they play the emotion on very well, and they don't go absolutely crazy on making it sad. The musical numbers are not just catchy and timeless, they're examples of what Disney can do by taking a simple plot and turning it into a revolutionary musical. Many of the songs, like The Circle of Life and Hakuna Matata are well known by pretty much everyone. The only criticism I have to give is that sometimes it skips over some important plot elements, making some scenes feel either a bit rushed, or dragged on just to hit the film's 88 minute runtime. Fortunately, those scenes are uncommon, and the rest of the movie is fantastic for the most part.<br/><br/>In conclusion, The Lion King is a powerful and uplifting Disney story that continues to be one of Disney's most iconic and exemplary films ever made. No matter what upcoming releases Disney pushes out, this film will always be remembered for an eternity."

"kmhf-25079","10","1","1","17 August 2018"," The Lion King: once again about a Masterpiece
","In a difficult situation is a person who undertakes to once again address to the topic of ""The Lion King"". According to the number of mentions in the media and among the conversations of ordinary people, he has long been on the same level with such parables as ""Titanic"", ""Terminator"" and ""Cleopatra"". And say about this cartoon, that either new extremely difficult. This with one hand.<br/><br/>On the other hand, taking into account all said before now of course it is difficult to find someone who hadn't watched ""The Lion King"".<br/><br/>Accordingly, in the details of the plot go there is no sense of the subtleties of the characters, too, can not be explained for the same reason.<br/><br/>But there is an opportunity to focus on the story of the inner features of the masterpiece for which it is so loved for quite a long period of time.<br/><br/>I'll start with the fact that the theme of giving animals human qualities in animation (and in some cases, and feature films) is not new.<br/><br/>Remember the series ""Goofy and his team"", ""TaleSpin"", ""Duck stories"", ""Darkwing Duck"" ?These stories, familiar to us since childhood, serve as a brilliant confirmation of the above theory. <br/><br/>But here's the amazing thing. None of these failed to achieve the naturalness of what is happening in ""The Lion King"".<br/><br/>The characters of this cartoon do not wear human clothes and do not try to behave like people, which does not always appropriate comic and increases the sense of realism of the screen image.<br/><br/>After 10-15 minutes after you start watching you began to think that animals really can talk, although an hour ago you were firmly convinced of the opposite. <br/><br/>Not only that, the animals suddenly started talking in human language, their emotions may be quite to compete in the sincerity of the feelings and actions of living people.<br/><br/>Even the famous Konstantin Stanislavsky would not find a reason to say his famous ""I do not believe!"" because the cartoon characters constantly and sincerely empathize.<br/><br/>Many eternal philosophical questions are raised by ""The Lion King"": ""What is life? What's its meaning?"", ""How to find your way?"", ""Will we seem right that we as or think in 15 years when we're 25?"". All these questions the viewer will find the answer looking and reviewing this wonderful cartoon in which there was a place for all spiritual manifestations of man. Even the main negative character of the film Mufasa's brother Scar figure is not as unambiguous as it may seem at first.<br/><br/>Of course in the struggle for power, he does not shun the lowest methods, but in all he is not right from a political point of view?<br/><br/>He and his older brother just have diametrically different views on how to rule the state.<br/><br/>Mufasa mostly relies on his strength, he, in modern parlance, professes a totalitarian regime.<br/><br/>Scar in the soul is more democratic. He says plainly: ""With regard to mind I got the lion's share, but on the part of brute force is out of a genetic misfire"". He's cunning and hypocritical on occasion. Isn't that an important quality for a politician? Isn't that an important quality for a sovereign? <br/><br/>Our unforgettable Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin would estimate that for certain.<br/><br/>Someone can argue with that citing the example of what happened to the Pride Lands during the reign of Scar. Recognize, Liony played too much and made a huge mistake: did not secure the support of the people and too much dissolved hyenas -traditional enemies of lions. Scar not change his nature and whether he in this situation behave wiser cartoon would end quite differently.<br/><br/>Anyway, but nevertheless this story has a happy ending and despite the controversy of many moments I am convinced that this happy end heroes deserved. They made the right choice although for many of them it was not easy to make.<br/><br/>Even Timon and Pumbaa decided support his friend Simba in a difficult minute. Quote: ""Simba, if this is important to you we are with you until the end"". Timon<br/><br/>And they have always been true Epicureans and never bothered with complex issues of morality and law.<br/><br/>Well, when you need to help loved ones, each of us can become better and it's wonderful. <br/><br/>I in turn hope that this wonderful cartoon called ""The Lion King"" will help to become better for everyone who will watch it."

"cinephile-27690","10","1","1","5 August 2018"," The Movie That Means So Much More To Me Now.
","I did not watch this a whole lot as a kid-at least, not as much as when I watched Toy Story or Beauty and the Beast. As a kid, I think it was too serious and while it was not boring it wasn't thrilling.(Roger Ebert made note of this on his TV show.) <br/><br/>I watched it at age 9 shortly after my father passed away. ""Long live the king."" Ouch. I avoided it until 10th grade after purchasing one at a Goodwill.
 While I don't own a copy now, on VHS or DVD I have seen it about-I kid you not-8 times in a span of about a year or so! Partly that's because I was in a phase of consistently watching kid movies. Another, and the main one I prefer to dwell on, is that it has a deeper impact now than ever.<br/><br/> The movie opens up with the best opening to a movie ever-the song ""Circle of Life."" This song has a lot of meaning on how every life has purpose. And that's pretty much the whole message-and it touches me now than it could have as a kid.<br/><br/> What else could I praise about it? All the songs are great. (Well, while it's good, I find Can You Feel The Love Tonight to be the weakest song.)<br/><br/> I always think that I would hate animating this movie-there are no humans, just lions, birds, elephants, a warthog, a lemur, hyenas, etc. The fact of that factor being accomplished is a success in itself. (Sorry, that was hard to write grammatically!) <br/><br/>The voice talent is effective. Johnathan Taylor Thomas is the Young SImba while Matthew Broderick is the adult. James Earl Jones and Madge Sinclair, the king and queen of Coming To America, are the king and queen here. Rowan Atkinson is Zazu, Whoopi Goldberg is a hyena, Scar is Jeremy Irons, and many more are flying through my head.<br/><br/> The Lion King is a favorite Disney movie of many, like my Grandma, my youth Pastor, my cousin(who names it as his favorite movie,period),and also my actress crush(along with Let It Shine.)(It's actually 13th for me right now-but I love a lot of Disney movies.) <br/><br/>Anyways, The Lion King is well loved-and that love is well earned."
"veronicasmith-19875","Null","1","1","20 July 2018"," The Lion King will work your tear glands- irrespective of your age
","One of the most beloved animated films The Lion King is a great take on Shakespeare's Hamlet. It must have been clever on the part of the studio heads to use the Shakespearean template and apply it to one of the most beloved of animals- the Lion. The animation is gorgeous, the voice actors are very good and the soundtrack, albeit criticized as not being as memorable as other Disney films in some corners usually gets it right. The spectacular ""circle of life"" to open the film should be singled out. This is one of the best films of the Disney Renaissance period."

The songs are memorable and it makes a classic play's plot easy to follow but changes the ending to where it's happy and kid friendly.

"viniciussantosanjos","10","1","1","5 April 2018"," Life changing
","The Lion King is a movie about teachings, it can, and probably will, change your life for good, if you really understand what it is about, wich is very easy, you will talk with your familly with a different way, you will valorize them much more, your familly and friends, just everybody you trully like and love. It shows that our passing through here will end, we born, learn, grow, conquer and go away, it's like the Circle of life. There are dialogues during the movie that teaches how to handle mourning, that calm down and really help people that are struggling with something rough. As we accompany Simba on his journey to become a true King, we gonna feel in our on skin, the rage that some characters pass, the true sadness as if we have lost a friend or a relative, that really maked me cry so hard that my face got bugged, the happiness of a true friendship that makes me laugh and feel so well. It's a mix of emotions in their most sincere way.
The movie works 100% both for kids and adults, having aspects that they both gonna take and will touch their feelings. A very important quote on the movie, that is even more important for kids, is that you have to obey your parents, you have to trust in them, otherwise you gonna put yourself in danger and with problems. There is one specific moment that Simba say to Mufasa that they gonna play together forever, and Mufasa just say and prepare his son to his death, showing for us also, that one day our loved ones also gonna go, but at the same time it declares that they gonna live forever on the sky and will always be watching for us, very emotional and important moment. And later on the movie, Simba look at a reflection of himself and se his father, showing that our ones that are already gone will always live in us forever and be part of everything that we are.
Another very important matter that will impacts in literally all of us, independent of the age or anything, is about the past. Sometimes we need to change, wich is good, but is hard, because of our past most of the time, that we runs away from it. And we have to choose if we gonna run away or face it and learn with it. Also that you can't forget who you are and from where did you came from, DON'T FORGET WHO YOU ARE. Confront your guilt, assume your role in life and grow, mature. Face what there is new in life, not fear it, but go into it.
The characters Timon and Pumba are just genious, just like that, two great philosophers, all about the Hakuna Matata thing, is a thing you take for your life, that bad things happen, but head up and keep going, a not worries, problem-free.. maybe true happiness.
Even with all that said, all the things that it teachs that are completely necessary for life, it also have a great story, cleary based on Hamlet and Kimba for example, even if Disney don't admits it, with great characters every single one having their purpose that are all perfectly done and interpretate. The viusuals are all great, the visuals are stunning, showing the hole environment. They introduced a lot of animals, showing how some respect the king, how some hate it, show that some animals are marginals, they don't rock with the rest of the forest, demonstrating that some places are nice and others aren't, it is all much well done in just 1h30min. all worked out. With possibly the best prologue ever made. It shows the time passing, the transition between Simba kid and adult, happens in a brillaint way, inserting into the music, it is natural, doesn't seem any strange or wrong, you can feel the time. The villain is great, you see how Scar is moved by jealousy, he does his wickedness with something behind it all, he is frightener and you will hate him, he is pure evil and manipulative, when he shows up, the colors refers to hell, with red collors, and sometimes refering even to nazism, Scar is that big one as a villain.
Now the soundtracks are phenomenal, Hans Zimmer did a job that is at the same level as the entire movie, it just makes it even more great, the song will talk to us during the hole movie in a way that really a very few movies does, will make us scary or even more sad than we already were because of the scene for example, in some moments of dialogue he takes the violin into a hole other level that the music kind feel like is one with everything, is perfect. The musics are phenomenal and so memorable, that you just don't stop singing never ever in your life again, once that you watch it in any language, it will be stucked in your mind, together with all the feelings of the moments. The musics pretty much help to give us an entertaining teaching, all the musics lycris have a meaning that will help you to get all thoose teaching that i did mentioned before.
The Lion King is one of the movies that is just necessary for you to watch by yourself, and principally to watch with your kids, once that you got kids, watch it with them, multiple times, it will make their lifes more complety and understandable."

","First movie I remember seeing, the standards for animated movies have been set high"
"WhimsicalVonia","9","1","1","17 September 2017"," The Best of the Classics (Maybe even better appreciated by adults than children)
","I cannot believe I forgot how phenomenal this classic is; one I watched at least a few times as a child, learning things I never knew I learned from it until now. Perhaps a better way to put it is that I cannot believe I have not rewatched this as an adult until now. For there are things in this children's classic that I strongly believe cannot be properly appreciated except as an adult.<br/><br/>This is not to say that it is not a great children's masterpiece, for by far the most amazing thing is how much I remember. From specific scenes like the iconic raising of the baby lion to young Nala and Simba frolicking, the initial hyena scene in the elephant graveyard to Scar's ruthless murder, Timon, Pumbaa, & Simba walking across the log bridge singing ""Hakuna Matata to Rafiki's cave drawing, I was honestly shocked to find myself saying some lines out loud, more than two decades later.<br/><br/>Hans Zimmer has an amazing soundtrack, as expected. The vocals by Elton John are some of his best. I remembered almost all the songs, singing along, bringing back childhood memories. I cannot believe I remembered them all, in order of my best favorite to most favorite ( I like them all; I could not bring myself to say least favorite): ""Hakuna Matata"", ""I Just Can't Wait To Be King"", ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight"", ""Circle Of Life"", ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", ""Be Prepared"", ""I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Cocunuts"".<br/><br/>I was impressed on this viewing by what a daunting figure they managed to create in Mufasa, the first impression he gives as both a loving fatherly figure but also a King to be feared not an easy feat, especially in animation. I have always appreciated how Scar was presented, obviously not a good guy; a memorable villain, but not unnecessarily overdone. Side characters were a pleasure and not extraneous as has unfortunately become the standard in children's animation today. There is Zazu the somewhat nuisance of a Dodo, Rafiki, probably my favorite. No one can forget Timon and Pumbaa, which maybe should not even be considered to be side characters. The love we can clearly see in Nala and Simba's eyes- as young cubs, but especially as adults- is not something to be left unmentioned, considering that this is 2D animation in 1994. Sarabi, the hyenas, they all had their important roles.<br/><br/>Children can definitely gain a lot from this classic masterpiece. I only learned today how much I did. As adults, however, I am tempted to say we can gain even more.<br/><br/>There is only one thing left for me to do. Watch the Broadway musical."

","The Lion King is Disney's best movie ever cause it shows us how to face and solve problems we face and how to deal with the past even thought it is very rough. When i first saw this movie and saw Mufasa risk his life to save simba that made me almost cry cause it shows that parents will do anything to make sure that you will always be okay even though it turns out bad when simba finds out his father passed away. Still to this day this movie makes me think of how i should face the past and determined my future cause i always don't know what do in my life all the times but like simba when he faces his past he knows what is right and what to do"

","""The Lion King"" has been such an important part of so many childhoods since it came out, but what is so remarkable is that, whereas some childhood entertainment loses a lot of luster once the nostalgia- goggles come off, I find my appreciation for this film to grow the older I get. I personally don't believe Disney has yet created a more beautiful film, since it isn't just a detailed rendition of African wildlife, but its such a deliriously colorful and expressively animated film to boot. The story is honest in its portrayal of the corruption that exists in the world, but more importantly, in the hope that good moral judgement can overcome such corruption. The voice cast is pitch- perfect, the soundtrack remains the absolute greatest in animated film history, and the script (while perhaps not wholly original) deftly balances searing emotional truths with charmingly silly antics."

The themes are universal - love, family relations, betrayal, growing up...so everyone can relate to the story and feel the emotions.

"Aly200","10","1","1","13 February 2017"," A Disney Masterpiece from its '90s peak
","While compared at times to ""Bambi"" due to the similarities in its central story, ""The Lion King"" is so much more than a modern retelling of Disney's 1942 film. Ushering in the full blown revamped Disney brand, this Academy Award winning film is also one of the most mature from Disney's high point period. <br/><br/>Focusing on the life of young lion cub and future king, Simba, we follow the naive cub as his life is uprooted in a terrible tragedy and forces him to run away, but years later return and fight for his rightful place.<br/><br/>Disney assembles one of their greatest voice casts to portray the vast arrays of characters from the African savanna. James Earl Jones brings his distinctly deep voice to the wise king of Pride Rock, Mufasa, while English thespian Jeremy Irons voices his wicked brother, Scar, the film's central villain and most foppish bad guy in the Disney cannon. Child star Johnathan Taylor Thomas voices the young Simba to youthful perfection while Matthew Broderick voices the adult Simba (as I've grown up, Broderick's vocal performance is mismatched for Simba's adulthood when Simba finally grows up and takes responsibility for his past). Comedic talents Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin voice two of Scar's hyena lackeys, Shenzi and Banzai, with a mostly maniacal laughing performance from veteran voice actor, Jim Cummings, as third hyena lackey, Ed. And stealing the film's comedic spotlight are Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella as Timon, the meerkat, and Phumba, the warthog. The duo are the characters who taught us all that ""Hakuna Matata"" means 'no worries' and made us laugh with their constant bickering and hilarious exchanges and actions.<br/><br/>Following in Disney's tradition for using live reference models, the animation team traveled to Kenya to sketch the landscape of the savanna. The company also had live animals from lions, meerkats, warthogs and various birds brought into the studio by zookeepers in addition to seeing the wildlife in action in their native habitat. <br/><br/>Complimenting the amazing visuals is the Oscar winning score by Hans Zimmer and Oscar winning songwriting team of Elton John and Tim Rice. Zimmer's instrumental score paints the dramatic picture in musical tones, but does express joy at the film's happiest moments, while Sir Elton and Tim Rice add the dramatic and comedic lyrics to compliment Zimmer's lush orchestral score."

It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will never forget.The best Disney animated film ever...This film had it all, it was funny, emotional, had family drama, and above all, great animation and songs! I really enjoyed it when I first seen it, about when I was 6, and since then I watched it over and over again.This is one movie where you can feel for the characters. You don't say 'haha, he's dead', you say 'Gasp! I'm so sad!' If it weren't for the gifted scriptwriters, this movie would be kaput and a nothing, not the best Disney movie ever made."

","""THE LION KING"" is the best animated movie in the Movies history. Whenever I used to go to my uncles house for holidays, I used to watch his movie at least twice a day along with my another favourite movie ""THE JUNGLE BOOK"". Even my uncle and others used to get irritated by me, but that din't stop me. Especially the songs and ""THE CIRCLE OF LIFE"" is my favourite song, sentiment, background score what not, every aspect caught my heart. Still I will watch this movie whenever I get the chance, especially I love the scene between Young Simba and Mufasa where Mufasa saves the kid from hyenas. And the animation is of other world. And I urge every kid in my locality whenever they come to me, to watch this movie just for the sake of Dialogues. I kind of loved the line from the baboon about the past of simba and what to do with his future. And the conversation between Simba with Mufasa from the heaven."

","Disney, Pixar, Ghibli... all of them have created wonderful movies which I can call classics. If I have to chose my 2nd most favorite movie, it will be really hard. However, if I have to choose my most favorite, there is no other than Lion King. Although it is a Disney movie, it is not just a movie for kids. You will enjoy this movie no matter how old you are. A classical plot, of course since it is inspired by Hamlet, can be easy to predict, but you will find all the little things and details combine together to make such a masterpiece. The opening - and of course the ending, the songs, Hakuna Matata, the lessons, the magnificent African view, the characters, the voice... The lessons in the movie is sure worth notice. The past can be hurt, but it is in the past! Sure, not typical magical Disney with a fantasy world. It's dark, betrayal, death, the fallen... But hey, that's what make it great!"

","This film is not only an incredible narrative but a wonderfully brilliant and imaginative score that puts this musical at number one permanently. <br/><br/>Each character has been thoroughly fleshed out and that is very satisfying for an animated film. It seems The Lion King created the landscape in which all animated features were to be based off. The film captures the African culture and the importance of the pride lands in this beautiful representation of wild life and the circle of life. From its rich visuals, and incredible music from Elton John and Hanz Zimmer there will never be a musical that nearly reaches this epic animated film.<br/><br/>It will be hard to ever reach the success and popularity of The Lion King.

It was a lesson learned from a youth and took that and made it a positive at the end of the day. The film Simba was a young lioness who was very Innocent and naive as a youngster. Only to be manipulated by his so called uncle that ended up persuading him that he was the reason his dad got killed. But to only realized as he become older that all of it was a lie. He found out that his uncle was the one to have set him up. So in revenge, he goes back as an adult lion to fight for his pride and territory.

It took me through an emotional carousel in days when I was little and even years later when I watched it again I couldn't resist shedding the tears again.

","The Lion King is a Disney classic. The young cub, Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas), will one day inherit the Pride Land. That is until Scar, Simba's uncle (voice of Jeremy Irons), selfishly intervenes. With Mufasa, Simba's father (voice of James Earl Jones) out of the picture, Simba believes that Scar's doings are all his fault as he retreats to the desert. In the desert he finds an oasis where he befriends Timon and Pumbaa (voices of Nate Lane and Ernie Sabella). Simba, (voice of Matthew Broaderick), grows up as years pass and Scar is ruling over the Pride Land in the place of Mufasa. Living in the poor conditions Scar has provided Nala, a friend from Simba's childhood (voice of Moria Kelly), sets out to find the lost Prince. Once she discovers what Simba has retreated to, she begins to talk sense into him and brings him home to reclaim what was rightfully his. <br/><br/>The Lion King is a G rated film falling in the category of kid friendly and family night approved. This movie will take you on a musical journey. The soundtracks are catchy and also let you dip your feet into a different kind of culture. While watching this movie you can instantly tell this is a Disney classic. The animation is full of color and all sorts of different animals. In the opening scenes you almost feel as if you are there in Africa, with the way the animators made everything look so life like. Both the animation and the sound tracks will entertain your children for hours. Directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff did a fantastic job stringing together a beautiful story line enhanced with great visual and auditory effects. This movie wasn't just created for children either, there is a deeper connection as well. As a child watching this movie I never acknowledged or even knew why Simba coming back to claim what was his was such a big deal. Now as I've experienced a little bit of life I've learned that running away from a problem isn't going to fix anything. Mistakes are apart of being human. Introducing this idea to children at a young age may have long term effects. I think that the messages behind this film are so important. As a child, even now, I still need to be reminded to keeping fighting and to fight to the end for what's mine. That isn't the only message hidden within The Lion King. There are also messages parallel to the Bible too. An example of this being Simba running from his problems, he was scared but also ashamed. I related this to the devil wanting us to be so consumed with shame that we run too. After seeing almost every Disney movie out there, you could say I'm rather experienced. With that being said The Lion King is probably one of my favorite Disney movies. I loved it as a child when bright colors and peppy music were my thing, but now I love it more for the deeper connections I see. I give this movie a rating of a perfect ten. From the story line to the animation to the thoughts behind the movie, I love it!! I don't believe anyone would argue, after seeing the film that it is one of the greatest children's movies out there to this day."
"bsilbor","Null","1","1","8 September 2016"," Not just king of the lions.
","Deep in Disney's renaissance period, and before computer animation stole the cartoon industry, The Lion King is one of the most mature animated movies out there, and, by extension, the best animated movie by Disney. This movie deals with a multitude of different harrowing, real-world struggles, like the death of a close family member, growing up, and accepting responsibility for your own actions. The animation is classical, the voice acting is terrific, the story is a great twist on Shakespeare's, Hamlet, and, above all, Hans Zimmer's score is sad, and gut-wrenching. In my humble opinion, this movie is the pinnacle of Disney's creations and deserves all the hype that it generates."

","By far the most enjoyable Disney movie of all time, it will never get old. An absolute classic if I ever did see one. It has action, comedy, adventure, emotion, drama and romance, what more do you need. A story of how a young lion cub is led to believe that he is responsible for his fathers tragic death manages to overcome his fears and guilt from the past and rise to save the kingdom of Pride Rock. Simba, the Son of King Mufasa, runs away from his home and makes friends with a Puma and Meerkat who teach him the ways of survival in the wild. Evil uncle, Scar, takes over Pride Rock and fills it with misery.

"lizzieejohnson","8","1","1","4 August 2016"," Really Good!
","The Lion King is a story that we all know. After watching it as a very young child, I decided to watch it again as a 15 year old. This story follows Simba, the next in line to be King. His father, Mufasa is killed by Scar, his brother, however Simba is taught by Scar that it is his fault. He runs away, only to meet new people and learn new outlooks on how to live life. I review this film in the mind of a child. It was warming to the heart, action packed (but not too much because you know, kids) and even enriching to the mind. Just what you want in a film for children, and what Disney generally delivers. It however does not have the magic that people are expecting in a Disney film, but that is not to be expected. It did not however make me feel as child like as other Disney films. This movie is solid, and a great watch for all of the family."

Although the movie came out when in 1994 this is a movie that the whole family enjoy. One of my all time favorite movies 22 years later. It doesn't get any better than this movie people. The characters, voice overs, and soundtrack is all a in quality. My suggestion is even if you have watched the movie before (which I'm sure you have) grab your loved ones some snacks and turn on the surround sound watch it. As we get older and there are very few greats out like this one it will make you feel good to pass the movie down to the little people of your family. Thank you for your time and enjoy. Blessing to you all."
"iswimlikeagirl","10","1","1","23 May 2016"," This Movie is a Must Watch for Everyone No Matter your Age
","The Lion King is a timeless classic that should be shared with every generation. The evident message of freedom from the past and finding the strength to move on is something that so many people not only need to be told can happen but can see it happen. With all the colorful scenery and talking animals it's easy to get lost in the magic and wrapped up in child-like awe. From the rising of the sun to the echoing roars that fill your hearts with hope, there isn't a single moment of boredom or loss of interest. The first time experiencing the fun playfulness of Nala and Simba in an attempt to lose Zazu and sneak off the elephant graveyard will make you think Mufasa's tone is a little too strict for the situation. But as the conversation between the two lions continues it becomes evident that Mufasa's only concern is his son's safety and comprehension of what a big responsibility being king really is. Simba's uncle Scar hatches a plan to murder Mufasa and blames Simba for the ""accident."" This sadly is a representation of how many children and teens will see a negative situation. Unfortunately they see it as their fault and like Simba they run away from their past thinking that once it's behind them they never have to face it again. The thing is, like Nala found Simba, a person's past will always find them. They can either choose to continue running, which usually doesn't last long (another situation also represented by Simba), they can face it with only the people from their past that still love them (Nala), or they can trust a little and let in the people from their past and present and accept help from them all. There are so many life lesson's in the Lion King and the fun songs and goofy comments from Scar are just what wraps it all up in a nice neat bow."
"Angels_Blade13","10","1","1","6 May 2016"," A wonderful kid's movie
","The lion king is a wonderful kid movie that even someone older can love. This movie holds adult jokes that go right over kids heads and make them wonder why their parents are laughing. The main villain (Scar) is by all rights the best Disney villain. He is sarcastic, sympathetic, and just straight up evil. The hero (Simba) is lovable although not sympathetic, his side-kicks more than make up for what he lacks. Timon and Pumba are funny, classic comedy relief characters. They lead Simba through adulthood teaching him Hakuna Matata (do no quote me on the spelling). With wonderful musical numbers, this is definitely one Disney movie that will not die."

","The Lion King is by far The Greatest Animated Movie of ALL TIME. Like most humans, The Lion King was an important part of our young lives. We frolicked with Simba and Nala, laughed along with Timon and Pumbaa, and fast forwarded through that really sad part that we can't even mention. We learned about right and wrong and the importance of following your heart. t has everything from youthful naiveté to unforeseen loss and betrayal, all things we face in life. It was one of the hardest Disney flicks to sit through (because of that unbearably tragic scene with which we're all familiar), but it certainly prepared me for trying to become the best possible version of myself."
"aliceboud","10","1","1","22 April 2016"," Over 20 years on, The Lion King is still a masterpiece
","The Lion King is undoubtedly one of Disney's greatest accomplishments. Packed full of compelling characters, exciting animation and an incredible, award winning soundtrack, this film is sure to delight both children and adults. Whilst the vibrant colours and animals attract and demand the attention of younger audiences, adults are sure to enjoy the sometimes philosophical messages and questions that this film suggests-making this a film for all the family to enjoy. <br/><br/>This film's storyline is downright Shakespearian at times (as it even draws inspiration from Hamlet), focusing on the power struggles between the generations in a royal family, set against the backdrop of the African pride lands. The strong storyline ensures that this film is not overshadowed by its soundtrack; something which would have easily occurred due to the instantly iconic songs filling this film.<br/><br/>Another area that this film gets spot on is the characters, with their personalities and flaws which are all too easy to relate to. While the protagonist is certainly interesting and well voiced, the true stars of this film are the side characters, who are all handled in their own right. From the wise and powerful father figure of Mufasa to the comedic duo of Timon and Pumba, not to mention the witch doctor monkey Rafiki, this film gets everyone right. The villain is also extremely entertaining and memorable (if a little intimidating to young children at times). <br/><br/>The soundtrack of The Lion King is again incredibly strong, with even the 'weaker' songs still being enjoyable and not out of place. The beginning scene, featuring the well-known 'Circle of Life' is a cinematic delight, featuring beautifully crafted animation and the perfect introduction to this film. The Oscar winning 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight' is again brilliant, but perhaps the uplifting 'Hakuna Matata' is the true musical highlight. <br/><br/>The Lion King is full of poignant themes and lines, which older viewers can certainly appreciate. Disney has not since this film been able to replicate what this film achieves, and this animated classic will surely stay that way for many years to come. So if for whatever reason you haven't seen The Lion King yet, don't miss out on one of Disney's greatest films ever. My personal favourite animated film ever, The Lion King is for all ages to enjoy, and is a timeless masterpiece."

","While I may be biased because I was young when this came out I always enjoyed the lion king. It had a good plot and was not designed too throw children off. Like all children's stories there is a problem and then an arc and a solution. I think Disney did a good job keeping the feeling of grief too a minimum. It almost seemed as though they were outlining Simba's strength through the loss of Mufasa. As a child I watched many movies but none I enjoyed as much as the lion king. It makes kids think about life and responsibility. It is about having strength and courage when you don't think you do. It shows kids it is,never too late too fix a mistake even if it is in the past.

"joshuafagan-64214","10","1","1","13 January 2016"," Phenomenal
","In late 1993, when audiences bored out of their minds from hearing about NAFTA went to the movies, they were greeting with a trailer that seemed to communicate one message: Summer 1994 belongs to Disney.<br/><br/>What was in the trailer, you might ask. One sequence and one sequence alone. But what a sequence it was. They showed the very beginning of the film, where the animals all across the continent are bowing down to the new lion prince and king-to-be, Simba. If you have seen this movie- and if you haven't, I really do feel sorry for you- you know why that is all they needed.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is far and away the best animated film Disney has ever produced or will ever produce. Most people of the critical persuasion prefer BatB, but I heartily disagree. Yes, BatB is probably a better movie plotwise and technically. But it's the kind of the film where I sit back and think, 'That was good. So was that. I love that angle. Those leaves are nice.' This is the kind of film that overloads me with grandeur and epicness and raw feats of animation and storytelling.<br/><br/>It taps into something deeper, something essential to the human mind and spirit. True, I should expect something of the sort saying that it is clearly based on Shakespeare's Hamlet, but this film takes its material and runs as fast as a gazelle on the African plains. I am often borderline by how attached I am to this film and what it does. It's lush in a way that no Disney film (Frozen comes closest) can live up to.<br/><br/>Most films strike me most the first time I see them, even films that I really like. Not this movie. Every time, it blows me away more and more. The more movies I see and the more things I experience, the more impressive this film becomes. It's extraordinary. At the top of the list of the extraordinary things it does is the animation. Comparing Western and Eastern 2-D animation is like comparing a mountain with a river, but I say here and now that this film somehow looks even better than Miyazaki's finest works, and believe me, that is not a compliment I through around lightly. The colors are so rich and the lines so well-defined. There are animated movies out there that want to make you think that you're not watching drawings. This film doesn't. This film proudly displays its art and soars with it.<br/><br/>There are too many good scenes in this film to count. I won't spoil them in case you are part of the group of poor unfortunate souls who haven't yet seen the film, but they roll in, one right after the other. The climax in particular sticks out to me. It's probably one of the most atmospheric scenes in all of cinema.<br/><br/>Some people throw around the word 'epic' lightly. I do not. I only say something is epic if it has the qualities of an epic. This does, which is impressive considering it is less than an hour and a half long. I wouldn't say it's quite as sprawling as LoTR or Princess Mononoke, but the way it manages do evoke the same feelings as those films in such a short running time is most impressive.<br/><br/>The characters are not the best part of the film, but they are not particularly annoying either. Simba is fine, though I like him considerably more as a child than an adult. Nala is sympathetic and grounded and one of my favorite characters in the film. I used to hate Zazu when I first watched this movie as a kid, but I can identify with him more and more as I grow up. Serabi isn't particularly dynamic, but she is likable enough. Timon and Pumbaa annoy me, but they don't make the film any worse, and any damage they do is undone by Mufasa. Played by James Earl Jones, he is one of the coolest, most captivating movie characters ever. When he says something, you listen. I think the role would have still been good without Jones, but with him, it is legendary.<br/><br/>Like most all 90's Disney movies, this is a musical, and a musical is nothing without great songs. I have forgiven a lot of subpar musicals because they had good songs, and I have bashed a lot of otherwise fine musicals for an excess of poor song numbers. The songs here are fantastic. <br/><br/>The Circle of Life would be my choice if I had to pick a new Disney song to replace When You Wish Upon a Star. It is anthemic. I Just Can't Wait to be King is one of my all time guilty pleasures. Whenever I'm feeling down in the dumps, I cue it up, and within five minutes I'm dancing to jungle drums. But my all time favorite is Can You Feel the Love Tonight? This was originally intended to be a joke duet sung by Timon and Pumbaa, but Elton John made them change it, and I thank him for it. Not only did this song win at the Oscars (three Lion King songs were nominated that year, forcing them to change the rules so only one song per movie is eligible), Elton John's version of it won Best Male Performance at the Grammy's. It won award after award and rightfully so. It is the most sweepingly romantic song I've ever heard. Listen to the Elton John version though. It's better than the one in the movie.<br/><br/>This isn't just a generational touchstone or an all-time classic. It's one of the best movies of all time and a sterling showcase for the power of animation."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","31 October 2015"," One of the finest, by any standard you care to set
","By the year 1994, The Walt Disney Animation Studio had been split in two. The A-team was working on Pocahontas, which was supposed to be their ultimate magnum opus, their new Sleeping Beauty, which would set the standard for animated movie greatness. Whereas the B-team was working on The Lion King, to give the audiences something to tide them over until Pocahontas would sweep them off their feet.<br/><br/>It's funny how these things work out sometimes. How blind people can be to their own work.<br/><br/>Because The Lion King was huge when it came out. It was a cultural phenomenon equally as groundbreaking as Jurassic Park a year earlier, and Disney would have to wait almost two decades until Frozen came along to achieve the same kind of wall to wall cultural hype that followed this movie from day one. And you know what? It earned that hype and recognition. It is a masterpiece, one of those perfect films that populate people's top lists. And it doesn't earn that through harsh themes, dark characters and cold, realistic truths about the human condition. It has those, being one of the most mature Disney films ever made, but at its core it's a movie about triumph, about accepting responsibility, about the fact that it's okay to be afraid, shocked and ashamed, but that at some point you have to well, let it go.<br/><br/>It's also one of the most colourful Disney films, with an amazing cast of identifiable, likable and instantly recognizable characters. All of its songs are born classics, the sound design in general is phenomenal, as is the voice acting. The story flows seamlessly and goes to some pretty dark places for an animated family film, but it never feels like it's unfair or doing it for the wrong reasons. It has dark scenes and themes because at some point kids need learn about them, and this is the perfect film to teach them.<br/><br/>The Lion King is my favourite Disney film. Has always been. It taught me that what I did or, even more importantly, didn't do affected not just me but all those around me. It taught me that those around me affect me as well and I should be respectful of the fact, of those connections. It taught me about bravery, friendship and family. It taught me that sometime truths can be used to manipulate people and that sometimes a lie is the sweetest truth there is. It is an important part of who I am today, and because of that it has my respect and love."

","My generation grew up mourning the death of Bambi's mother. Now comes ""The Lion King,"" with the death of Mufasa, the father of the lion cub who will someday be king. The Disney animators know that cute little cartoon characters are not sufficient to manufacture dreams. There have to be dark corners, frightening moments, and ancient archetypes like the crime of regicide. ""The Lion King,"" which is a superbly drawn animated feature, is surprisingly solemn in its subject matter, and may even be too intense for very young children.<br/><br/>The film is the latest in a series of annual media events from Disney, which with ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"" reinvented its franchise of animated feature films. The inspiration for these recent films comes from the earliest feature cartoons created by Walt Disney himself, who in movies like ""Dumbo,"" with the chaining of Mrs. Jumbo, and ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,"" with its wicked stepmother, tapped into primal fears and desires. Later Disney films drifted off into the neverland of innocuous ""children's movies,"" which were harmless but not very exciting. These most recent four animated features are once again true ""family films,"" in that they entertain adults as well as children.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" is the first Disney animated feature not based on an existing story. In another sense, it is based on half the stories in classical mythology. It tells the tale of the birth, childhood and eventual manhood of Simba, a lion cub. The cub's birth is announced in the opening sequence of the movie, called ""The Circle of Life,"" which is an evocative collaboration of music and animation to show all of the animals of the African veld gathering to hail their future king. The cute little cub is held aloft from a dramatic spur of rock, and all his future minions below hail him, in a staging that looks like the jungle equivalent of a political rally.<br/><br/>Of course this coming together of zebra and gazelle, monkey and wildebeest, fudges on the uncomfortable fact that many of these animals survive by eating one another. And all through ""The Lion King"" the filmmakers perform a balancing act between the fantasy of their story and the reality of the jungle. Early scenes show Simba as a cute, trusting little tike who believes everyone loves him. He is wrong. He has an enemy - his uncle Scar, the king's jealous brother, who wants to be king himself one day.<br/><br/>Villains are often the most memorable characters in a Disney animated film, and Scar is one of the great ones, aided by a pack of yipping hyenas who act as his storm troopers. With a voice by Jeremy Irons, and facial features suggestive of Irons' gift for sardonic concealment, Scar is a mannered, manipulative schemer who succeeds in bringing about the death of the king.<br/><br/>Worse, he convinces Simba that the cub is responsible, and the guilty little heir slinks off into the wastelands. (The movie makes a sly reference to a famous earlier role by Irons. When Simba tells him, ""You're so weird,"" he replies ""You have no idea,"" in exactly the tone he used in ""Reversal of Fortune."") It is an unwritten law that animated features have comic relief, usually in the form of a duet or trio of goofy characters who become buddies with the hero. This time they are a meerkat named Timon (voice by Nathan Lane) and a warthog named Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella), who cheer up Simba during his long exile.<br/><br/>The movie has a large cast of other colorful characters, including a hornbill named Zazu (Rowan Atkinson), who is confidant and adviser to King Mufasa (James Earl Jones). And there are the three hyenas (with voices by Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin and Jim Cummings), who are a tumbling, squabbling, yammering team of dirty tricks artists.<br/><br/>The early Disney cartoons were, of course, painstakingly animated by hand. There has been a lot of talk recently about computerized animation, as if a computer program could somehow create a movie. Not so. Human animators are responsible for the remarkably convincing portrayals of Scar and the other major characters, who somehow combine human and animal body language. But computers did assist with several remarkable sequences, including a stampede in which a herd seems to flow past the camera.<br/><br/>Despite the comic relief from the hyenas, the meerkat and the warthog, ""The Lion King"" is a little more subdued than ""Mermaid,"" ""Beauty"" and ""Aladdin."" The central theme is a grim one: A little cub is dispossessed, and feels responsible for the death of its father.<br/><br/>An uncle betrays a trust.<br/><br/>And beyond the gently rolling plans of the great savanna lies a wasteland of bones and ashes. Some of the musical comedy numbers break the mood, although with the exception of ""Circle of Life"" and ""Hakuna Matata,"" the songs in ""The Lion King"" are not as memorable as those in ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty."" Basically what we have here is a drama, with comedy occasionally lifting the mood. The result is a surprising seriousness; this isn't the mindless romp with cute animals that the ads might lead you to expect. Although the movie may be frightening and depressing to the very young, I think it's positive that ""The Lion King"" deals with real issues. By processing life's realities in stories, children can prepare themselves for more difficult lessons later on. The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to ""Hamlet,"" is a learning experience as well as an entertainment."

","I first saw The Lion King when I was about 5 years old, I was hooked from the start and found it was unlike any other Disney movie I have ever seen since then. Sure, there are heroes in Disney that search for their destiny in life in other films, but The Lion King tells it in a unique light, with a much deeper meaning. The Lion King has many great point, from the music, down to the detail for characters, with some really good lessons for Your kids that will possibly help them later in their lives. One thing I really enjoyed about this film was the Characters, I enjoyed how real they were, it made me feel like I was in the movie. The realistic behavior of Simba and Nala as children was on point, it shows how kids are innocent and don't know any better, while also showing the view point of an adult, and the dynamic between Father and son. I also liked the strong scenes in the film, when Mufasa appeared in the clouds to speak to Simba I was taken back, because it actually made me feel something in my heart, it deeply touched me. Further more I loved how the characters had flaws, but their good characteristics balanced with the bad (all except for Scar). The movie goes through points of development, and many emotions. The animation, and attention to detail in this movie was wonderful, it was extremely well done, well thought out, and well planned. This is truly Disney's best film as many people say, this movie will stick with me, and will forever remain timeless."

","Review Amazing, absolutely amazing; a masterpiece in American cinema! The Lion King was what originally got me interested in the art of film and is one of my all time favorites.<br/><br/>I had not actually seen The Lion King when it was released in 2012 for almost 5 years, and I was hoping it would hold up and I am so happy that it did. In fact, looking back I probably enjoy it more now than when I did when I was younger, there is so much more to talk about such as the music, the storytelling, the voice acting among many other elements. First of all, Simba; Simba is one of the most sympathetic Disney characters, we have all been in a situation where we have felt the need to step up and rise to an occasion and Simba represents that perfectly, he (as an adult) tries to come off as confident but you can tell he is hurting and is conflicted inside but eventually puts this fear aside to do what he knows he must. The supporting characters were all great, particularly the hyenas who I find a lot funnier now, maybe because of my twisted sense of humor. <br/><br/>Scar as the villain was awesome, one of the best movie villains ever. He is a silver-tonged devil, he manipulates his nephew and tries to get him killed then actually kills his own brother, which is a lot deeper when you really think about it. We also get some good humor out of him as well, you also see how pathetic he is when he takes over, showing how unfit he is to be king.<br/><br/>The songs were awesome, the opening sequence ""The Circle of Life"" is the greatest sequence ever and when I'm watching the film, I always watch it at least thrice. The songs range from being jumpy to traditionally African to menacing to slow and romantic, the greatest range in a Disney film. <br/><br/>Overall, Disney had it back then and still has it today."

The Lion King will be an all ages favorite for generations to come and people will be singing the music for their whole lives. The Lion King teaches you so many life lessons and all the while you're singing, dancing, and crying along with it. It also was backed by Elton John on the soundtrack which just makes it more epic."
"francia-554-418213","10","1","1","14 December 2012"," The King of Coincidence
","The recent release of The Lion King in 3D brought to my mind one of the most interesting cases of copying in the movie industry: Kimba, the White Lion versus Disney's The Lion King.<br/><br/>In one hand, ""Kimba, the White Lion"" was created in 1950 by Osamu Tezuka, one of the most important Japanese cartoonist. Its anime version was broadcast in 1965 in Japan and United States, being the first color animated television show created. In the other hand, ""The Lion King"" was released in 1994 with great success, becoming one of Disney's most important movie. Both stories are about a young lion that fights for the recovery of his lands and has to learn the responsibilities of being a king.<br/><br/>When Disney released ""The Lion King"", people from different countries found similarities between the two works, a lot of characters of ""The Lion King"" seemed to be almost copied from Kimba. For instance, Rafkin from The Lion King resembles to Kimba's mandrill Dan'l Baboon, also Scar in The Lion King is similar to Jamar from Kimba and both have the same dark color fur and a deformed eye. Likewise, the warthog Pumbaa looks like Kimba's Gargoyle T. Warthog. There are similar scenes as well: the King on the Pride Rock -one of the most famous images in both stories-, the betrayal of Kimba's aunt and his falling into the cliff (in ""The Lion King"" the scenes takes place with Simba's uncle), the stampede, the thorn patch and the image of Kimba's father among clouds. <br/><br/>The ""San Francisco Chronicle"" and ""The Los Angeles Times"", published articles pointing out the resemblance between the Lion King and the Japanese series. These articles focuses on Disney's affirmation of not having any previous knowledge of the Japanese show. This attitude annoyed people and fans around the world, but especially in Japan where people felt Disney overlooked Tezuka's work by plagiarizing Kimba. But, besides all the obvious similarities, Disney insisted that it never heard about Kimba, and declared that ""The Lion King"" was inspired by Shakespeare's plays ""Hamlet"" and ""Macbeth"". <br/><br/>Evidently, and considering all similarities, Japanese authors were upset with Disney's notorious inspiration of their classics. Their main claim was that Disney did not make any mention nor did any recognition to Tezuka's famous work. Tezuka's family also recognized the similarities between the two works but they decided, along with Tezuka Productions, not to start a legal process. They claimed that one of the main reasons was that Disney's and Tezuka's good personal and commercial relationship. In fact, Tezuka was a huge fan of Disney's work and at one time he had hoped to have Disney do an adaptation of Kimba. <br/><br/>Moreover, the definition of plagiarism includes the lack of own creativity by an artist, which is evident in The Lion King, and the failure of recognizing the material to its actual author; therefore, the most important issues addressed by the Tezuka's family and fans in general, is Disney's failure in recognizing Tezuka's work. It is clear that the Lion King has a different origin than the solely Disney's team imagination. For instance, in the book ""Perspectives on Plagiarism and Intellectual Property in a Postmodern World"", the author quotes Lomer and Ashmun's ""The Study and Practice of Writing English"", defining plagiarism as a matter of probity: ""The use of another's ideas or words without due acknowledgment is known as plagiarism; it is commonly regarded as a literary theft –as inexcusable as any other kind of dishonesty' This means, Disney's fault in not recognizing or giving any credit to Tezuka's Kimba is perhaps the major problem of the whole situation with The Lion King. Moreover, if it is only considered the sequence of time and how events happened, it can be observed that the fact of taking ideas from one job already existing can be called plagiarism. Kimba was first and the Lion King second; and considering that Disney should recognize that its idea was seen before and it should cite Tezuka's work.<br/><br/>There are lots of evidence indicating that Disney copied Kimba such as a striking screenshot from an early presentation of ""The Lion King"" with a white lion cub. Also, there are so many things in common between the two stories that it is hard to believe it was just coincidence. Thus, Disney's denial of any kind of plagiarism is merely sad.<br/><br/>In the end, the Lion King and Kimba are both very important works. Therefore, their value would not be diminished by saying that Kimba is the inspiration of The Lion King and with just one word of recognition to its author it would have made very happy not only a whole country, but it also would have set a precedent for future plagiarists."

","Now first of all, I like to say that at first I wasn't into loving this film, because my brother and my twin sister would tease me for liking Timon the meerkat (""...sitting in a tree, K-I-S-S-I-N-G...""). After that I started to hate the film. Why even listening to the film's songs reminded me of the teasing of my brother and sister. But it wasn't until in 1995, that I ""re-watch"" the film when we got it on VHS that I love it.<br/><br/>Anyway this film is a another jungle classic from Disney about a lion cub named Simba who is heir to the throne of the African savannah (aka ""The Pridelands""). But a tragedy forced him to flee, guilt-ridden, while his wicked uncle takes the throne. It would take some convincing and the courage to face his past to make Simba the king he destined. So that's all I could tell you folks, you will have to see the film for yourself how it ends.<br/><br/>Overall, I really love this film, and I don't have any particular scene. And also I thought the musical soundtrack was excellent."

I did not buy into it when I was 11 and I did not buy into later in my life. The only weak point that seems really forced. I guess another weak point is the scar song. It is a fun song, but it does not seem like it fits into the rest of the movie. I love the music and probably one of my one favorite soundtracks that I can think of.

","Because of the release of The Princess and the Frog, I will be reviewing Disney classics from the past. One of them is The lion king. A smart, funny, sad animated feature. Surely it isn't as good as Beauty and the beast, but it is still a lovable tale of excitement.<br/><br/>The lion king is the story of Simba(voiced by Johnathon Taylor Thomas). When Simba is born, it is announced that he will become king if his father(voiced by James Earl Jones) dies. The king's brother Scar(voiced by the great Jeremy Irons) isn't happy because he knows that he'll never be king.<br/><br/>So Scar pulls off an evil scheme and tricks Simba into believing that he is a murderer. So Simba runs off and Scar takes over. Later on in life, we see Simba(now voiced by Matthew Broderick)hanging around with Timone and Pumba(Timone is voiced by Nathan Lane). Also, when an old friend of Simba's walks back into his life he realizes many things. He also realizes what he must do.<br/><br/>The lion king isn't as good as Beauty and the beast or something like that. But it is indeed a great movie. It's a movie that you'll never forget. The characters are never going to be forgotten either. The lion king is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>The lion king:****/****"
"revere-7","8","1","1","27 October 2009"," Disney's last hurrah in the jungle
","Disney, for all practical purposes, invented the animated feature, and for decades pioneered the genre's significant advances like special effects animation, and the multi-plane camera. The studio was riding high in the late 80s and early 90s with top-notch films like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Toward the end of this new Golden Age of cell animation, Disney released one of their best – The Lion King. The film is a little less humorous than past efforts, but it's law-of-the-jungle theme (and some of the characters) hearkened back to The Jungle Book.<br/><br/>Like the Jungle Book, we have a child (this time a lion cub), and a tyrant ruler cat wants him dead. (Jeremy Irons' portrayal of Scar in The Lion King even sounds like George Sanders' portrayal of Shere Khan in The Jungle Book.) He's hidden away in the jungle where he befriends some fun-loving, off-the-wall jungle animals that provide not only comic relief, but some of the best songs of the film, before a climactic battle ends the tyrant's rule by fire. In fact, the parallels to The Jungle Book are so prevalent that one could call it a remake. But no matter, just like that film it's highly enjoyable, and a highpoint for Disney. Unfortunately, just like that film, which marked the end of Disney's first Golden Age, The Lion King was the last gasp of Disney's second Golden Age. After this came a long steady, slow decline into mediocrity beginning with well-worn tales like Pocahontas, Hercules and Tarzan, ultimately leading to such forgettable fare such as Treasure Planet and Home on the Range. A hole from which they might never have re-emerged were it not for the saving grace of Pixar."

Reason 3: The plot is very beautiful and it has made me want to read ""Hamlet"" on which the plot was based! Reason 4: This film has beautiful songs! My favourite is ""Can You Feel The Love Tonight?"" (written by Elton John) but I love all the others as well. Reason 5: I love the voices that were picked for all the characters. I especially like the sound of Jeremy Iron's (Scar), Rowan Atkinson's (Zazu), Nathan Lane's (Timon), Whoopi Goldberg's (Shenzi), James Earl Jones's (Mufasa) and Moira Kelly's (adult Nala) voices!<br/><br/>WARNING!

","I would like to know if anyone else agrees with me.  Is THE LION KING similar to Shakespeare's HAMLET?  I think there are many striking resemblances.  The major one is that in HAMLET Claudius killed his brother, Hamlet's father, to become king.  In THE LION KING Scar kills Mufasa, Simba's father, to become king.  Of course that is not the only similarity. If you agree with me, let me know."

","The first Disney animated film with no human characters and to be based on an original story is an overwhelming success not only in the box office but as a movie.

Along the way we see Simba growing up and discovering the not so perfect world. A great story with a detailed plot that will have you engrossed.

"kintopf432","5","12","36","20 January 2005"," Ambitious, but deeply flawed
","At the time, it seemed like an almost ominously good idea: an animated Disney film that was to plumb new depths of darkness and emotion. Critics have identified everything from ""Bambi"" to ""Hamlet"" to the Passion story as source material, and while some of those parallels might be more forced than others, some certainly have the ring of truth (""Hamlet"" in particular), and it's obvious that Disney was attempting to stretch here, with an animated feature more adult and literate than the three consecutive comic operas it had produced before it.<br/><br/>The movie made a bundle of money, of course, but somebody at Disney must have found something very wrong with it, as they never tried to duplicate the ""Lion King"" model again. (In fact, ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" can be viewed as its exact opposite  a film that tries to turn a dark, ambitious, literary work into a junk TV cartoon.) In terms of musical style, too, the subsequent diminishing-returns animated films from Disney mainly reverted to the Ashman/Menken mock-Broadway formula, instead of imitating this pop-rock precedent.<br/><br/>So, ""The Lion King"" is ambitious. But is it successful? As Mufasa and Scar would certainly agree, these things do not always go hand in hand. And despite its conceptual daring, ""The Lion King"" must be judged at best an artistic compromise, and at worst an all-out failure. The design, of course, is spectacular, and the first sequence stands not only with other animated films but with all movie musicals as one of the most memorable opening numbers of all time.<br/><br/>But it isn't long before things start to go wrong. Elton John's songs are tuneful enough, but Tim Rice's lyrics are surprisingly witless, suffering from vague language and clumsy imagery (""Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared""  bared ambitions?). It's surprising how much the Menken/Ashman team is missed  ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"" tried hard to be ""Under the Sea"" on the savanna, but Ashman's witty patter, almost more like something out of Gilbert and Sullivan than Broadway, is sorely lacking. (Ashman might actually have been the magic ingredient in the Disney recipe  they haven't made a decent non-Pixar animated feature since he died.) <br/><br/>Jeremy Irons, as Scar, essentially repeats Jonathan Freeman's campy Jafar from ""Aladdin,"" if anything achieving the remarkable feat of making this character even more mincing (""I must practice my curtsy,"" he sniffs when Mufasa reminds him of the rules of succession). And much of the adult appeal is squelched by the insertion of the most gratingly unfunny comic-relief characters into the mix. I find it nearly inconceivable that Disney should eventually have chosen to remake the film from the point of view of its worst characters.<br/><br/>Furthermore, over the decades Disney has been accused of racism and sexism in its cartoons, both rightly and wrongly  but it's hard to deny that both are genuinely present here. After all, why shouldn't the hyena caste (socially inferior only because of their species) have a place at the table? (The use of Nazi imagery to depict them is more than a little ridiculous, given the lions are obviously the ""Master Race"" in the world of the film.) And as for sexism, why do the lionesses need a male to come back and rescue them from an effete wimp like Scar at all? <br/><br/>So in the end, the design remains beautiful, and certainly not everyone will have the same problems with the irritating elements I've discussed. Plus, I suppose some points have to be given for ambitious intent in itself. And yet the film as a whole provides neither the challenge nor the satisfaction it might have, and that's a true disappointment. 5 out of 10."
"anguscastle","1","14","44","6 September 2016"," Okay...but massively overrated
","The Lion King is easily one of the most popular Disney movies out there and perhaps that's because it was very popular with kids at the time and those kids who have grown up now still consider it Disney's best. It is a visual treat which underlines themes of love and loss. <br/><br/>But people call this the ""adult"" story of Disney and honestly, I find it to be one of the more childish entries in the Canon. Yes, Mufasa's death is pretty hard for a kids film but after that, the movie just continues with a very childish tone. Take Timon and Puumba, for example, who are thrown into the plot to remedy the movie from being too heavy-handed.The scene where they're looking up at the stars and make fun of Simba is rather disconcerting - they literally just laughed at him for speaking of his late father's wisdom. Really? In general, the story is weak and really loses itself after Mufasa's death. <br/><br/>The characters also weren't as good as everyone says. Everyone claims Scar is the best Disney villain....but all he really did was kill his own brother, that's literally it. Why would he send his minions to kill Simba when he's knows how unreliable they are? And when he is in power, he's just lazy. How did Scar gain the title of best Disney villain? Timon and Puumba are also extraneous to the plot just to keep the kids demographic interested. But the worst is Simba and Nala. Not only are they both bland and boring but the romance between them is rather questionable considering they could be brother and sister (or at least cousins). <br/><br/>The music is fine but it doesn't quite live up to the works of Alan Menken and Howard Ashmen in previous Disney movies. The only two songs I loved were The Circle of Life and Be Prepared. Other than that, the soundtrack is somewhat weak. I just can't wait to be King is frivolous and random to the plot, Hakuna Matata has some very stupid lyrics and a whole verse dedicated to a warthog's flatulence, Can You feel the love tonight is a very syrupy song which just doesn't work with its very weak lyrics - ""Why won't he be the king I know he is. The king I see inside"". <br/><br/>The Lion King can't seem to keep up with its own maturity. The fart jokes, the bi-polar tone of being serious and silly, the questionable incest within the romance....it all just doesn't work for me. A highly overrated movie."
"ccthemovieman-1","3","17","57","13 October 2006"," Un\satisfying New Age Baloney
","Rarely have I watched a ""kids"" or ""family"" animated full-length movie and felt so unsatisfied, finishing the viewing with a frown on my face. This didn't happen the first time; just on the second and third looks. The film just got worse the more I watched it.<br/><br/>Maybe I got more culturally aware. I saw how much New Age baloney was thrown into this film, with Elton John singing about the ""circle of life,"" and a bunch of other more subtle Left wing propaganda that is typical of the Disney company.<br/><br/>The villain, and even the little hero, became more annoying in multiple viewings. Once again, the more I watched this, the more unappealing both the characters and the story became, not just the ""theology."" <br/><br/>Nothing in the story is boring, however. The characters are interesting, from the lions to the hyenas to the warthog and his buddy (who provide most of the comedy in here.) The graphics are top-notch with some of the animation - especially in the beginning - just gorgeous."
"tiyusufaly","5","10","30","23 April 2003"," Hands down the most overrated Disney film, and one of the top ten most overrated films ever
","Best film ever? Disney at its best? Animation's crowning achievement? Well, I'm sorry to bust 99% of the world's bubble, but this is an EXCEPTIONALLY overrated film that in the past I would have thought good, but now think of as easily the worst animated ""masterpiece"" ever made by Disney.<br/><br/>
It's plot is so weak, it can be summarized in at most one paragraph. Every moment is stretched as far as it can go, and more time is filled with irrevelant material, such as songs (which are some of the weakest ever created by Disney, but I'll get to that later) than with actual story. People claim this gives it an ""epic"" quality. The only way that this could possibly be true is through epic boredom.<br/><br/>The characters are shallow and unmemorable. Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa, and the Hyenas are comic relief that are sorely missing comicality (If you want a truly great example of Disney's comical relief, look at the Genie and Iago from Aladdin, or Kronk and Kuzco from The Emperor's New Groove). Simba is an unadmirable hero who I couldn't care less about, and his love with Nala is anything but inexistent. Scar is one of the weakest of the modern Disney villains, and does not make you hate him like Gaston or impress you with his evil so much that you like him like Jafar. The only characters I can pass off as even half-decent are Rafiki and Mufasa.<br/><br/>The music I will give merit to as being okay and somewhat enjoyable, but still, it isn't within a hundred miles of the attractive Arabian dances of Aladdin or the Broadway style melody of Beauty and the Beast or the fun Tropical tunes of The Little Mermaid. Only the Circle of Life (even I have to admit that the opening number is magnificent) is as good as any of the songs in the aforementioned films, and just barely. The rest are simply radio-friendly pop tunes.<br/><br/>However, one thing I will stop at no ends to give this film credit for is its animation. I will say right now that no other Disney film has backgrounds so richly detailed or characters so well designed. Indeed, the art quality is definitely the most astounding ever created Disney. But art quality alone cannot save this movie from all its other weaknesses, and besides, art quality is probably the least important of the four major aspects of an animated film (the other three being story, characters, and, in the case of Disney, music). <br/><br/>This movie does not deserve to be praised as if it is the best Disney can muster. The people who think this is true have probably never seen any truly great Disney films, or just can't realize one. Aladdin, for example, is in my opinion the greatest film, animated or otherwise, ever made (And I am a film buff, to those of you questioning my merits). Beauty and the Beast is in my top 10, and many others would probably crack my top 100. The Lion King, however, is depressingly mediocre, and deserves at most a 5. I give it a 2 only for the art quality."
"TheBlueHairedLawyer","3","4","9","15 December 2014"," How on earth did this get such high ratings? What has society come to?
","I'm sure I'll get many down votes on this review, seeing that so many people seem to think it's this amazing animated experience. Well, this is just my opinion, you can like it or leave it, to each their own and I only hope I never have to watch this thing ever again.<br/><br/>I only ever saw The Lion King twice, both times were involuntary. The first time, I was six years old, sitting in a movie theater with my parents and eating this nasty bright yellow popcorn. So, the movie began, and I nearly fell asleep sitting through the annoying intro music and strange ""lion birth ritual"" thing with this wizzled up monkey holding up a lion to the sun (by that point I was hoping the monkey would drop the lion off the cliff but sadly not all wishes come true). For the next little while there was some dopey singing that I'm surprised didn't give the whole audience brain damage, and this scene with these freaky drunk-looking hyenas (I was six, it freaked me the hell out back then). Next thing I know the father lion gets killed, which shocked all the kids in the audience, many parents carried their screaming and crying children out of the theater by that point, mine included. Thank you mom and dad, you saved my childhood.<br/><br/>Recently my friend dragged me along to see it again at her house (she's a huge Disney fan, I'm more of an X-Files and Cold Case person). She kept on saying, ""isn't this a masterpiece? It's so breathtaking!"" and all I could do was try to block my mind of the two annoying singing animals (a pig and a squirrel-thing) who were on-screen singing this bizarre new-agey song thing and they adopted the baby lion, god knows why. Well, I told her exactly what I thought of The Lion King, and it involved many swear words. Her comeback to me was: ""You only hate it because it's Disney, you just don't understand its amazing moments!"" Alright, true, I'm not a big fan of Disney, I think it's a load of commercialized, always happy garbage that stupefies children. That being said, there are a few Disney films I didn't mind: Alice In Wonderland (the 1950's cartoon version), Mulan, Lilo & Stitch, The Beauty and The Beast, Monster's Inc., Toy Story, The Aristocats and Oliver & Company are the few Disney films I've seen and thought were okay.<br/><br/>""You hate it because of the singing!"" was her next argument.<br/><br/>Well yeah, the songs in this movie were terrible, that goes without saying. But it would be dumb to hate a movie based primarily on its soundtrack.<br/><br/>""You hate it because it's popular!"" she said then.<br/><br/>Harry Potter, Goosebumps, The X-Files, Criminal Minds, Cold Case, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Romero's Living Dead films, those films/TV shows are extremely popular and I love them! The Lion King is just stupid, plain and simple.<br/><br/>""Okay, then you hate the actors,"" she concluded, looking unsure of herself at this point. (I just wanted to go home).<br/><br/>I have nothing against the voice actors, they weren't bad (my all-time favorite actor, William B. Davis, has never been in any Disney movies, thank god).<br/><br/>In my opinion, The Lion King was just a stupid movie and a waste of time, nobody has to agree with me. But I'd say it deserves 3/10 stars, definitely not the 8.5/10 stars it currently has."

","I'm not a Disney convert. I didn't like what I saw of Disney movies as a kid and by the time THE LION KING came out in 1994 I was 13 and couldn't be less interested in kid's films anymore anyway. Decades later, I've finally watched it for the first time and the experience has reaffirmed all of the negativity I associate with Disney animation.<br/><br/>This is over-simplistic, spoon-fed pulp for the masses. The story is copied from HAMLET and simplified to get rid of all the complexity. The characters are trite and one-dimensional without anything in the way of depth or motivation. Jeremy Irons' bad guy is that just because. The positive thing about this is that the character animation is very good indeed, although I found the backdrops simplistic in the extreme. The comedy relief is laboured and the songs trite. The whole experience washed over me without touching or involving me once, and don't get me started on the exaggerated voice acting."
"nzysman78","7","4","10","19 March 2014"," No bad, but it could be a lot better.
","The Lion King isn't a bad film. It just doesn't have anything unique and the songs are annoying as hell. The story also has a ton of stuff that isn't explained. Why doesn't Scar kill young Simba after killing Mufassa. Why does Nala travel all the way to where Simba was living with Timon and Puamba. Why is there a drought, famine, and bad weather when Scar rules. There are like all these animals, so why don't they overthrow Scar. When Simba returns to face his actions, no one supports him until he finds out he didn't kill his father. Why does the land turn back to normal after Simba returns. This is probably the most overrated Disney film, but not the worst."

The whole movie is simply telling kids to be brave and do what you're told.<br/><br/>The memories of having to watch this movie will simply give you nightmares.

Much of the talk is just Psychobabble 101, making the last fifteen or so minutes a chore to get through.

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","2","4","1 February 2008"," Another of the Disney greats
","I've just watched this with the original voices, for the first time. Why is that, you ask, when there has been a purchased VHS copy of the film in my possession since around the time it was first released? The simple fact is that here in Denmark, we dub... anything that's made for children, or is considered ""family entertainment""(which is really just a word used to mask that something is made for kids, enough so that the teenagers and possibly some of the adults won't make a run for it the moment the suggestion of viewing it is said out loud before the family members). I'm not really in favor of it, I prefer the originals(sub, don't dub... the voice is one of the tools that an actor has, the sound a major part of a film, and through that, the director's work, and the actors and crew, for that matter), but hey, at least we're not France or Germany(good luck watching *anything* on German television that isn't in German, regardless of whether they made it or not). For that reason, the voices were some of what I noticed the most, along with the original dialog and lyrics to songs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas isn't bad at all. Broderick does good, though were it not for the animated form of his character, I'm not sure he would come across as strong as he does when he needs to... seriously, who could ever be scared of him? Of course, it could be the roles he seems to play often. Marin, Goldberg and Cummings make good hyenas. Irons is great. Guillaume(try spelling *that* three times fast) is marvelous. I didn't personally care much for Atkinson, but hey, I've always preferred his Blackadder(in particular after the first season/show) to his Mr. Bean(a character I don't find funny), and this is clearly done after the latter, not the former. Fans of Bean may very well enjoy the character(much like how Robin Williams fans might enjoy at least his part in Aladdin), and he's not the only one(not only for this Disney film, either) who bears strong similarities to their character, to the point where in many cases, it would seem(and sometimes they even say so) that the animators and such based the look and mannerisms on the actual actor/performer. I saved what may very well be the best for last... James Earl Jones. What can I say? The man almost invariably(in anything he appears in) has an undeniably commanding presence, and that is arguably mainly due to his voice, so casting him was a smart choice, and it pays off. The plot is well-written. The animation is quite good, with a bright, varied, colorful palette, and lively movements both in the camera and in the players. I didn't find this as energetic or funny as Aladdin, but it was still enjoyable. The music is magnificent, Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a fantastic song, and it's not the only one in the feature(to which that adverb can be applied). The DVD has some marvelous material, including music videos, a few deleted bits, some games(one of which isn't half bad), a Virtual Safari and featurettes regarding... just about everything you could imagine, regarding the film, including the stage production based off it, the music in it, even the animals. I recommend this, and its DVD release, to fans of the Disney animated musicals, and/or of any or more of the actors. 8/10"

The Lion King is an amazing animated film with great music, great art, and an incredible plot with astounding voice-overs. I saw this moving pic. a hundred times and never got bored of it once. Of course most of the times I've seen it when I was much younger, but even now it does not fail to keep me listening and paying attention and being entertained.

But unfortunately one of the aspects that mold or serve as basis in an animated picture (and any movie for that matter, but animated films more than most given it's inexistent and it's literally brought to live stories) is the visual cues, character designs and overall aesthetic of the setting of the story.<br/><br/>Granted, the setting and the themes are toned up and further improved in the Disney adaptation but it's that small splinter of imagery copied from another animated feature found in character designs and some of the shots that haunts me to this day. I wished I had never known of it, I wish I lived in ignorance and oblivious to that fact, but my eyes have been opened. And so far the only small bothering aspect of Disney movies I've ever had since I was a kid was that finding out later on that all were adaptations of books, novels or fairy tales; brought me inspirationally down. Now they have taken a more original route and I'm glad they have. Moreover, I'm not saying adaptations are wrong, quite the contrary, the interpretations done by Disney were so original, outstandingly well-crafted, captured, sang and written that they inspired me to read the original materials. I commend Disney for succeeding on bring light to those stories of old, dusty and generally considered outdated. They might be overused, but every once in a while we need stories of knights, princesses, castles and dragons.<br/><br/>And the Lion King might be telling a well-known story, but it isn't formulaic in the slightest. It tells it with a fresh take and a different setting that brings those themes to life in striking animation and visceral storytelling. From the quite, meditating almost mystical moments with the wise Rafiki, to the joyful careless life-style of Timon and Pumba, Simba is a lion haunted by his past and we feel for him as we have at some point in our lives felt the same way. Disney movie speak to us through its characters, these animals feel like people not because they are animated like such but because what they feel and say are also human emotions. There was no need to tell this story through animals, but by doing so the themes reach the younger audience and adults are witnessing it through a refreshing new setting that has room to add interesting twists on the plot, funny comedy and engaging new characterisations.<br/><br/>IN CONCLUSION, there are tons of reviews out there that both nitpick and go through every single good aspect of it, I just wanted to tell my reasons to not give it a 10/10 but also clarify that I love 90s Disney movies, and the Lion King will be one of my favorites forever. I'll show my kids and hopefully they'll show theirs. I trully believe traditional animation won't ever be outdated as long as movies like these were made. Thank you, Disney."

The songs are so strong that they even have a sing along for this movie. I miss Alan manken and Howard ashman. They were good songwriters. The story is about a lion cub named simba played by Jonathan Taylor Thomas (young simba) and Matthew Broderick(grown up simba) who one day will rule his lands but in order to do he must respect, obey and be responsible to his father Mufasa. His uncle scar voiced by Jeremy irons is a wrongful and evilly valiant lion. Pumba and tamone are the perfect comic relief for a Disney film. There come up with two words Hakuna Matata which means no worries. Simba gets introduced to them when he runs away from home and his father dies after a wild animal stampede. Simbas love interest is nala. Nala is a young female lion. This movie has some intense scenes that are sometimes scary for the little ones.

","The decade from 1989 to 1999, known as Disney's ""Renaissance,"" not only saw the company come out of its box office slump, but also, more importantly, revived Disney's understanding that animated films were not just for children, but for adults as well. The lion king, released in 1994, was arguably Disney's most serious work. Stripped of its lighthearted comedy, and stripped of its musical flourishes, ""the lion king"" at its core is an old, serious storyline. Roger Ebert, a film critic, even called it ""too cruel for young children"".What makes a classic a classic is to a large extent that the story patterns of these classics are consistent with the development of human history as well as with human nature. In turn, these classics have shaped people's expectations through word of mouth: people are used to ending stories in which good triumphs over evil, the princess meets the prince, the prince regains the throne... History has become a classic in this countless retelling and adaptation, exaggeration and imagination. In fact, throughout the history of film, those most sought after by the audience, often have such a well-known classic story model as the basis."

","Simms is the little prince of the Lion Kingdom, and his father Mufasa is a majestic king.
However, Uncle Scar has long coveted Mufasa's throne.
To sit on the throne, the scar must remove the little prince, so the scar used various excuses to let Simba go out, and then waited for the opportunity to open the killing ring, but Mufasa was rescued immediately. After repeated calculations, Mufasa died tragically under the scar, and the scar ulteriorly persuaded Simba to leave. On the one hand, he was sent to kill him.
During Simba's escape, he met the witty Ding Man and the kind PengPeng . They raised Simba into a majestic lion and encouraged him to go back to the forest to restore his country. In the next battle to restore the county and save the people, Simba really grew up to be a strong man and understood the true meaning of responsibility.
From the beginning, Simba made a mistake and only talked to it with a long-term focus instead of really teaching him. It can be seen that it is really a treasure in the plan. Later, Simba didn't live up to his fathers expectations and developed the Glory Kingdom.
This story is a story about the reincarnation of life and the rise and fall of all things; it is a story about love, growth and self-redemption, and its connection is profound and powerful. In the vast and prosperous African savannah, all things endlessly, the birth of a life slowly opened the curtain of the drama, brush but soothing, rich and fresh. The fragrance of flowers and trees and the atmosphere of earth will bring the audience to this magical country.

","Certainly not one of Disney's better animations from a technical perspective - the artwork lacks the vibrancy and detail of many of their earlier stories; but the combined efforts of Sir Tim Rice, Elton John and Hans Zimmer make this an enjoyable fantasy adventure. It is told in two parts - the first sees a son ""Simba"" born to the king ""Mufasa""; a curious little fella who, alongside his friend ""Nala"" is inquisitive and mischievous - a real pain in the neck to the king's major-domo ""Zazu"". One fan the new cub really doesn't have, however, is the king's rather unimpressed brother ""Scar"" who hatches a plan to depose his brother and take over the kingdom. He manages to achieve exactly this and to get the youngster to blame himself and head off, alone, into exile. The second part is much more fun; he falls in with a warthog and is soon eating colourful grubs and living a peaceful, jolly life far from home. That idyllic existence is not to last long, however - ""Nala"" discovers he is still alive and races to alert him of the disaster that has befallen the kingdom under the rule of his uncle and his trusty band of hyenas. The musical numbers help it build to a gripping denouement, with clever, quite witty dialogue from some good - though not great - voice talents from the likes of James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg to keep the pot boiling. It is an enjoyable film to watch but I wasn't captivated by it."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","9","0","0","4 February 2020"," The Lion King review
","Well, I have to hand it to this movie's marketing team. Everything we got in trailers and promotions perfectly encapsulated Jon Favreau's ""reimagining"" of one of the most acclaimed and successful animated films of all time. None of the characters in the trailers showed any tinge of emotion on their faces, and all of the clips were from scenes directly lifted from the original. That's what we were shown, and that's what 2019's The Lion King is. So it's really on us for giving it money and sitting in that theater for two hours. We're giving Disney our energy, and they've caught on that they don't need to deliver much on the product when we do.<br/><br/>So, as exemplified by their latest ""reimagining,"" ""new take,"" ""reworking,"" whatever they want to call it to avoid the largely negative connotations that come with ""remake,"" they simply aren't trying.<br/><br/>The computer animation in Favreau's Lion King is impressive on a technical level, but it has no life or personality to it. Of course it's not really ""live-action"" like some have called it for simplicity's sake, but it's as close as they could get with a story like this. Here's the thing, though: the medium can't work for this story. True stylized animation was always the best fit for it, and it's a large part of what gave the original its sense of wonder and grandeur. So it doesn't translate into photorealistic imagery to begin with, but even the new form of animation is done to a subpar level. The designs, movement, and environments all look real, but that's not strictly what people want to see in a Disney film. The characters rarely, if ever, visibly react to even the most tragic events, and it makes it hard to care even if we've connected to this story through the 1994 film. Sarabi doesn't look sad at all when she learns her mate has died and her son is presumed dead, nor does she even have any visual distinction from the other lionesses. That includes Nala, whose role is slightly expanded in this version, but not in a way that actually feels bigger than her role in the animated film. BeyoncÃ© gives a good performance, as do most of the voice actors (Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen are laugh-out-loud hilarious at times, though not enough to make the movie feel like it has a personality), but the star power feels wasted on such dull designs. You can tell there's emotion behind the microphone, but none of it comes across visually, and unfortunately for this movie, it's a visual medium.<br/><br/>Sequences like ""Circle of Life,"" ""I Just Can't Wait to Be King,"" and Mufasa's famous appearance from beyond the grave, all of which were visually distinct and even stunning in the original, are devoid of their predecessors' energy, color, and creativity. The latter especially. I won't say specifically what they do with the scene, which is perhaps one of the most iconic in Disney history, but it might be one of the biggest disservices any of these Disney remakes have done to their source material, and it presents an astounding lack of effort. And this is in a huge production from one of the biggest behemoths in the industry. I don't know how they could screw it up so badly with such advanced technology and a budget of $260 million, but it's a gargantuan letdown.<br/><br/>The movie puts so little effort into basic setup and payoff that it feels condescending, like Jon Favreau and Jeff Nathanson are directly looking through the camera at the audience and saying, ""We know you're only seeing this because you love the original, so we're not going to bother making it worthwhile."" Major themes and emblems of the 1994 film are pulled out suddenly in the third act for the sake of resembling something beloved, without being properly built up at any other point in the movie. Nathanson's script adds a few lines of backstory for Scar and the hyenas, but it doesn't feel like it truly adds anything to the original story, nor does it make this one make any more sense. Plot points lifted from the 1994 script by Irene Mecchi, Linda Woolverton, and Jonathan Roberts are awkwardly executed or rushed simply so the crew behind the remake can say they kept them, including Simba's entire character arc and romance with Nala, and Scar's plot to kill Mufasa and take over the pride. Sometimes it feels jarring, other times it drudges along, and others it just gets confusing. Some lines of dialogue lifted from the original script are rearranged and worked around unnecessary pauses, making their respective scenes feel stilted. And once again, the utter lack of emotion on the characters in literally any given scene doesn't help.<br/><br/>The Lion King may not be quite as bad as Guy Ritchie's Aladdin or Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland, but pretty much everything good about it (the overall plot, the music, James Earl Jones) was taken from the original, so it can't even claim credit for any of it. It's awkwardly paced, blandly edited, visually dull in every aspect, and does nothing narratively to justify its existence. It may not technically be a shot-for-shot remake like some were speculating from the trailers, but there's nothing different in it that makes it worth the time. Make no mistake: it's the movie you love with all of its emotion and imagination stripped away. That's what the Disney remakes have been doing more and more in the past few years. Maybe they were hit and miss once, but now we're steadily seeing less and less effort put into them, and that's in large part because we continue to see them. And if they already have our money before these movies are released, why even bother to give us what we paid for?"

","""The Lion King"" is an incredible movie. I first saw ""The Lion King"" in the hazy days of 2003, and it left a lasting impression on me. I waited years to acquire my own copy of the film and revisit it, and it was well-worth the wait. So, why is ""The Lion King"" so awesome? Besides the near flawless 2-D and 3-D animation, and the spectacular soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, ""The Lion King"" feels well and truly unique, inventive and ambitious in the canon, being a cross between ""Hamlet"" and ""Bambi"" with lions in the Savannah. The Disney Renaissance formula is present in this movie, but it only ever adds to it and never makes the movie feel generic or predictable like it did with ""Aladdin"". When you think about it, ""The Lion King's"" story is actually pretty simple and basic: a prince is born to a good king, the jealous brother of the good king murders him to seize power and banishes the prince, the prince lives in shame for years until his friends find him in exile and convince him to come home, the prince fights his uncle for his birthright. And having a basic plot isn't always a good thing because it often equals a thin plot, but in ""The Lion King's"" case it works incredibly well in the movie's favor, because it gives the filmmakers all the time and space they need to give the movie everything in every department.<br/><br/>More than that though, a large part of the reason why ""The Lion King"" packs so much power is because there are actual, lasting consequences to everything that happens. ""The Lion King"" is one of a very small number of films in the Disney canon where good, supporting characters are actually allowed to die (others include ""Bambi"", ""Tarzan"", ""Brother Bear"", and ""Big Hero 6""), and unlike the death of Bambi's mother (which was quietly swept under the rug and ignored by the narrative for sixty odd years), Mufasa's death has weight. It represents the point in the movie where literally everything goes wrong. The villain, Scar, actually succeeds in getting what he wanted for longer than five minutes, and even after he's defeated in the end, it still doesn't bring Mufasa back or undo the years of suffering he dealt upon everyone in the Pridelands, Simba especially. The Pridelanders can only tend to their wounds and try to move on with their lives. The sense of spirituality running through ""The Lion King"", while a bit on the nose at times, is honestly so rich and works so well with the setting of the movie. After the injustice of Mufasa's murder and the cruelty of Scar's leadership, a terrible draught falls upon the Pridelands during his reign. When Simba and Scar fight for the title of king, they fight with the cleansing fires of hell itself surrounding them, and when the rightful balance is finally restored with the divine prince back in power, the weather relents and the rains return to the Pridelands. It's obvious symbolism, but still good symbolism.<br/><br/>The Lion King Simba and Nala<br/><br/>Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is a spunky, carefree young lion prince. When he's not romping around the Pridelands, playing with his best friend Nala, he really looks up to his dad, Mufasa, and his uncle, Scar, and eagerly awaits his time as king of Pridelands. Simba is quite frankly a little brat. He lies to his parents, mistreats his guardian, Zazu, puts himself and Nala in grave danger and really only wants to be king for shallow, narcissistic reasons. It's clear Mufasa has been too soft on him. It's hard to hold this against Simba though, because one, he's really only a small boy who doesn't know any better for the most part; two, Simba growing out of this childish notion of what being a king and an adult means is an important part of his character arc and is meant to contrast with his evil, manchild uncle, who never does the same; and three, anyone who's ever seen ""The Lion King"" knows real life is going to hit Simba hard soon and he's gotta enjoy that blissful innocence while he has it. Despite being a chronic troublemaker, the one thing Simba hates is disappointing his dad, because Mufasa isn't just his father, he's also the boy's hero. Perhaps I spoke too soon when I said the Beast and his servants have the most messed-up backstory in the Disney canon, because Simba's backstory is also extremely dark. Scar arranges for Mufasa to be brutally killed in a stampede and afterwards he blames it all on Simba, because he hates him with a passion. The guilt that would come from thinking you got your own beloved father trampled to death would warp and crush an adult man, think of what it would do to someone who looks to be the lion equivalent of eight. And Simba spends most of his life living with this shame (Matthew Broderick takes on the role of Simba for the second half of the film).<br/><br/>After meeting some drifters, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba takes their well-meaning but ultimately unhelpful advice of burying his guilt, his doubts and his trauma and turning his back on his past. But by doing so, he also turns his back on his people for years when they need him the most. What's more, Timon and Pumbaa's advice still doesn't fully work, he's still haunted by his memory of his father even into adulthood. With a coup against the tyrant Scar starting up, Simba is faced with the choice of remaining a troubled hippie without purpose forever, or going home and doing what's right for his friends and family, even if it ends badly for him - facing his own demons as well as the ones Scar crafted for him. After some stern talkings-to, Simba does the latter of course, and by doing so and fighting his uncle, he proves himself worthy of being a king - as well as finally getting some justice when he learns his uncle set him up. Having conquered his demons for the time being, put his mind mostly at ease and been accepted again by his family, Simba brings his friends with him to his new life and brings peace and virility back to the Pridelands. Later installments of ""The Lion King"" franchise reveal that Simba would still have some leftover PTSD and some major trust issues, which is to be expected. Trauma like Simba's doesn't heal overnight, but it doesn't have to consume your entire life either. It's not uncommon for Disney coming-of-age stories to end with the protagonist having kids and continuing that circle of life (""Bambi"" laid down the template), but I think Simba's case is the most satisfying. After everything he had to endure and everything he overcame, it's great to see Simba eventually emerge with a loving mate, great friends, and two wonderful cubs (dat adorable Kiara cameo at the end).<br/><br/>Prince Scar is a villain that you seriously love to hate. Scar, at first glance, seems pretty similar to Jafar from ""Aladdin"". Jeremy Irons chews plenty of scenery as Scar. His dry, sarcastic performance as the immature, compulsively lying royal feline - who spends his days lazing around the den, antagonizing his big brother and the help - calls to mind memories of the scheming vizier from the last film. But ""Be Prepared"" makes it clear Scar is an even more vicious, loathsome and dangerous character than Jafar was - driven by envy, hatred and an ungratefully privileged mindset. A subtle but fundamental difference between the two is that Jafar stole power and status because he wanted it, while Scar feels he's owed it, he's entitled to it, that it's his birthright, and the latter is a much more personal and vindictive feeling. Scar has spent years stewing in quiet, passive-aggressive jealousy and resentment towards his older brother, Mufasa, and his family, and now that he has nothing left to lose (he's never going to rule now that Mufasa has sired an heir) he's decided he's just going to try to get rid of them all. Like Frollo from ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"", Scar is one of the more disturbing Disney villains because he lacks a magical fantasy element, and he's the sort of evil that can actually exist in the real world. Sometimes people who are mentally unstable bottle up their feelings in an unhealthy fashion for years or even decades until they just snap, and that's one of many ways that you can get murderers. Underneath a seemingly calm, droll and apathetic exterior, Scar has a festering vindictive and sadistic streak, aimed at the people around him, that's first hinted at when we're introduced to him 'playing with his food'.<br/><br/>He doesn't just want Mufasa and Simba to die, he hates them so much he wants them to suffer before they do. He stabs Mufasa through the paws and lets him know full well he's betraying him before he throws his brother to his death. He pins Mufasa's murder on Simba and sends the cub away before sending the hyenas after him, because he wants him to die thinking he killed his father. He later attempts the same thing by 'secretly' telling Simba he killed Mufasa before he tries to do him in. Basically, Simba and Mufasa were extremely unlucky to have a psychopath in their family that they trusted. Like cub Simba though, Scar has a narrow and immature idea of what to do with power once he gets it. Since he only ever wanted to be a king for the title, he never bothered learning what it actually entails and the responsibilities that come with the position, causing the tribe as a whole to suffer, but his pride and spitefulness forbids him from correcting his course once it all goes wrong. He drags the Pridelands to ruin (which should give you an idea of how Ursula and Jafar's respective reigns would have gone, if they hadn't been immediately dealt with) and his already tenuous sanity takes a large hit as he's subsequently haunted by the memory of his brother. Lastly, I like how much of a complete and utter bad this lion is, with no redeeming qualities to him besides his trademark wit. He does everything he possibly can to make you hate him, and when his two biggest flaws (his vindictive streak and two-faced nature) finally catch up to him, he gets one of the most satisfying Disney villain deaths ever. He couldn'"

"akritascity","9","0","0","16 August 2019"," 'Remember who you are'
","After watching the remake of The Lion King (2019) from Disney it encouraged me to come back to the original version and leave my very first review. I am one of the many people who first saw this film as a child and then technically saw it numerous times as I grew older. Watching the film again after so long helped me see it from an adult point of view and I explain below why it is one of the best Disney films ever made.<br/><br/>Where should I start? One of Disney's original story not based from a fairy tale. The depiction of the amazing landscape of the African savanna and the diverse wildlife it contains. The use of African music in songs with meaningful and symbolic lyrics. Inspiring and captivating characters along with a story-line full of humor, suspense, emotions and educational messages. These messages are embedded in children's minds unconsciously. As an adult though, I can know go deeper and critically think what the film is trying to teach to all of us, both children and adults. Messages about friendship, love and family, but also, deeper concepts from a sociological and political perspective.<br/><br/>The Lion King teaches us first of all the value of mother nature and all the resources that it provides to us. As living beings on this planet we have rights and responsibilities towards this land by utilising with respect and sustainability these resources. In the film Mufasa explains this clearly as part of his lesson to his son and future King, Simba. Also, the film is a great example of illustrating 'good' leadership' in comparison to just being a King. Although monarchy is a conventional concept, Mufasa and his kingdom can be used as a metaphor of how any kind of leader should act and the principles and qualities they must carry. Being a leader involves responsibility and respect towards your people, the land and of course yourself. It is about maintaining balance in nature. A perfect way to educate young people about sustainability not only for the environment but also sustainability for societies. The biggest issues that our world is facing is because of greediness and the inability to equally distribute resources that a fare and justice for all. An example of this can be observed in the film when Scar takes over the kingdom and he has consumed most of the lands resources too fast resulting to having not enough food. Also, whatever food was available he was the only one to have access to it. No social justice in the distribution of the resources.<br/><br/>Lastly, I would like to also mention the beautiful son and father relationship the movie presents. The way Simba is learning from his father, the love he has towards him and of course the pain of his father's lost is something that most of us will relate to. Even the fact that he is not always physically present in Simba's life he still has a huge influence in the decisions Simba makes. 'Remember who you are' is my favourite line from the movie because it shows how easily we as humans forget who we are and what our rights and responsibilities are towards nature, society and of course, towards ourselves.<br/><br/>I hope you all enjoyed the film and saw the deeper messages the way I did. 'Hakuna Matata'."

","The Lion King the animated Disney classic. This film is one the best ever made an absolute classic from the mind of Disney.<br/><br/>The story is fantastic and really inspired by Hamlet great characters and great music just makes this film iconic and a classic.
Even though I enjoyed the new one you can't deny this is just a classic and is so much better.<br/><br/>The emotion in this film is handled wonderfully and still gets me to this day the songs are so iconic Be Prepared being my personal favourite.
Scar is such an iconic villain and is brilliant in this film from start to finish he is just awesome.<br/><br/>My favourite moment in the film is the remember who are scene Simba finally realising who he is and how important his destiny to be king it's a wonderful scene that is just instantly classic.
And its moment's like this and mufasas death that makes this better than the new one because they are handled so well in this one and feel the emotion and impact more.<br/><br/>The animation is fantastic and still to this day looks fantastic the voice acting is incredible and it's a film that still moves me to this day its so nostalgic and I film I will always remember.<br/><br/>Verdict 9.8/10 just an instant classic my Disney fantastic characters and the emotional handled way better than the new one iconic songs and fantastic animation just make for nostalgic film and one of my favourites I grew up with."

","This Disney animated favourite was a big box office hit, it spawned a successful worldwide stage musical, and got a photorealistic remake twenty-five years later, the original remains a crowd-pleasing cartoon. Basically, in the Pride Lands of Africa, at Pride Rock, the lions rule over the animal kingdom. There Simba, the new-born son of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Queen Sarabi (Madge Sinclair), is being presented to the large gathering of animals by Rafiki the mandrill (Robert Guillaume), the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows young Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) the Pride Lands, explaining his responsibilities as king, and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother Scar (Jeremy Irons) plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba to become king himself. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (Niketa Calame-Harris), who are betrothed, into exploring the forbidden land. In the elephant graveyard, the lion cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi (Whoopi Goldberg), Banzai (Cheech Marin), and Ed (Jim Cummings), who are in league with Scar. Mufasa rescues them after being alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu (Rowan Atkinson). Mufasa is upset with Simba, but forgives him, he tells him the great kings of the past are in the night sky, they will always be there to guide him, as he will be one day. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge, while a stampede of wildebeest is driven by the hyenas to trample him. He informs Mufasa, who saves Simba but hangs perilously trying to climb out of the gorge. Scar refuses to save him and causes him to fall onto the stampeding herd. Simba finds Mufasa dead, Scar convinces him that this tragedy is his fault, and tells him to run away and never return. The hyenas are ordered to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride about the deaths of Mufasa and Simba, appoints himself as king, and allows the hyenas to live in Pride Rock. Simba has collapsed in the desert, he is rescued by friends and outcasts Timon the meerkat (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa the warthog (Ernie Sabella). They take pity on him, telling him to put his past behind him, citing their motto ""Hakuna Matata"", meaning ""no worries"". Timon and Pumbaa allow him to live in their jungle paradise. Simba (Matthew Broderick) grows up as a carefree adult. Meanwhile the Pride Lands have been reduced to a wasteland under Scar's rule. Timon and Pumbaa are walking through the jungle singing ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", when a hungry adult lioness tries to attack them. Simba fights her, but realises it is Nala (Moira Kelly) grown up. She and Simba reunite and fall in love. She urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have been destroyed, feeling guilty for his father's death he refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who discovered he was still alive, he tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, following this he decides to return home. Aided by Timon and Pumbaa, Simba sneaks past the hyenas and confronts Scar. He taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, there he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to tell the truth to the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fight against the hyenas, Scar tries to escape, until he is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Simba spares his life but orders him to leave and never return. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, the rain starts to fall, the other animals watch as Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and roars to announce his kingship. Later, Pride Rock is restored to its usual state, animals are gathered as King Simba and Queen Nala look over their kingdom, and Rafiki presents their new-born cub. Also starring Zoe Leader as Sarafina, Frank Welker as Lion Roars, Tony Jay as Hyenas, and B.J. Ward as Lions. The voice cast are all terrific, especially Jones as the father and Irons as the villain, the colourful animation is wonderful, the story inspired by biblical stories and Shakespeare's Hamlet is good, it makes you laugh and cry, and the songs composed by Sir Elton John and written by Sir Tim Rice are memorable anthems, a most satisfactory animated musical drama. It won the Oscars for Best Music for Hans Zimmer, and Best Song for ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (also won the Golden Globe), and it was nominated for Best Song for ""Circle of Life"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), and Best Song for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical and Best Original Score - Motion Picture. It was number 14 on The 100 Greatest Musicals, it was number 99 on 100 Years, 100 Songs for ""Hakuna Matata"", it was number 94 on The Ultimate Film, it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Family Films, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons.

","""The Lion King"" is one of the best known and most respected Disney movies. On IMDb it's in top 50, Metascore 83, 93% on Rotten Tomatoes... I don't know... it seems a bit too much to me. The film is very good and I do not have any specific objections, but it did not delight me. To animated characters voices are lent by the pretty powerful cast, which includes Rowan Atkinson, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones, Cheech Marin, and others, and several songs from the movie were deservedly nominated for an Oscar, from which one won it. Still, from today's perspective, I would rate it seven, but when it came out, and I was a kid, I was thrilled, and for 1994, it has an enviable animation, so I will give it a compromise eight.<br/><br/>8/10"
"growingytartis","9","0","0","25 March 2019"," Growingytartist's review of THE LION KING
","Story (9/10):<br/><br/>The overall story was really good. Some moments, like Mufasa's death scene and the scene before Simba returns to Pride Rock, are amazing. However, I sort of wish that there was slightly less focus on trying to appeal to the children (with their childish jokes) but the great moments overall outshine this.<br/><br/>Characters (8/10):<br/><br/>I love most of the characters. Scar, once he gets Pride Rock, can get a little too over dramatic based on the premise of his characterization in the beginning of the film. Some of the other characters (Timon, Pumba, the hyenas) can sometimes go a LITTLE over the top, but to some extent it is reasoned out (for example, most antics of the hyenas is because they are not that intelligent) and maintain that energy throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Music: 10/10<br/><br/>Do I even NEED to go further?<br/><br/>Animation: 10/10<br/><br/>Honestly, The Lion King holds up today. You can tell the animators spent a lot of time on this project, and it shows. The colors, the style, the timing are all amazing.<br/><br/>Overall (9/10):<br/><br/>The overall movie is something that I would recommend everyone to see. It's animation and music are beautiful. If the side characters were toned down a little more, I would give it a 10/10. I understand that the movie is supposed to appeal to both children AND adults, but this is my personal opinion at this time. THank you so much for reading this!"

","Young, bubbly and naive, Simba bounces through his always happy world that has always been kind to him. He is in line to be King, faced with little challenges. Then everything changes, his family deals with great loss and he flees the kingdom, while his uncles true colors are revealed . He lives worry free in his new life away never wanting to return home to face his family until he has to. After watching this movie just once you will fall in love, this spectacular movie that can make you cry, laugh and sing and remind you what is like to be young and dumb just like simba. The Lion King Is a Phenomenal movie because of the relatable themes and the amazing soundtrack.<br/><br/>When the movie begins we see a baby simba held up by Rafiki to the whole kingdom, as his proud parents Mufasa and Sarabi look on proudly.This make his envious uncle Scar second in line for the throne. We then see this little lion cub grow through his experiences, good and bad, and learn life lessons from some of the people he looks up to most.<br/><br/>Throughout this movie we see simba, a spritely and spunky lion cub, go through life and the challenges that are thrown his way. We constantly see how he chooses to deal with them and we can use these decisions to help us. Throughout the movie simba gets a lot of good advice from people around him,for instance mufasa says, ""You have forgotten who you are and so have forgotten me. Look inside yourself, Simba. You are more than what you have become."" Simba is having to deal with great loss here and ,""1 in 5 children will experience the death of someone close to them by age 18."" so for kids who can relate to simba are given this advice and by seeing someone on screen go through something similar will help them work through their own personal challenges.Children LIke this also can appreciate the advice from Rafiki, a slightly crazy baboon who has been a trusted family friend ever since simba was born. As simba is in an open field of grass at night searching for himself he has a conversation with Rafiki about the past where rafiki says,"" Oh yes, the past can hurt. But, you can either run from it or, learn from it."" This quote instills in children from a young age the massage that life happens but is how you react to it that will affect you. One more thing that simba learns is a motto to live by,""hakuna matata,"" which is Swahili for no worries or no troubles.<br/><br/>This movie has not only amazing quotes and life lessons but it also has one of the best soundtrack. The movie starts with the intenceness of ""Circle of Life"" and instantly all Disney fans know that this isn't just going to be like any other Disney movie, this opening scene inst stereotypical where we have princesses singing a love song or a narrator with whimsical music in the background, it's different and it was the first time that this was seen on a major motion picture. This is not the only hit song we got out of this soundtrack either, we got ""Hakuna Matata"", ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"", and one of the most epic Disney Villian Song of all time, ""Be Prepared"". These songs are great songs not only for the time they came out in but can live on with this timeless movie.<br/><br/>This was a revolutionary Disney movie.This movie was published in a time called the Disney renaissance where Disney was failing and needed to make money or he was going to go bankrupt. So he produced some groundbreaking movies like Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast, one of these Movies being The Lion King. Even when comparing this movie to other Disney movies it will blow them away making a total of $968.5 million which at the time it was published was not seen. The reason this movie made so much money is because people fell in love with how good this movie was. The Lion King had everything you could want from a animated movie,you had great life lessons, great music a well thought out plot, and humor that all came together to form a great movie that will a lifetime."

","Perhaps it is nostalgia that makes me cherish The Lion King more than its worth, but this is the best animated movie =, at least for me. Based on Shakespeare's Hamlet and set in the African savannah The Lion King is a touching tale of redemption, love and destiny. The voice actors are spot on, especially the sinister Jeremy Irons who voices the ""bad guy"" Scar and the film is filled with emotional ups and downs sure to affect not just the younger audience but also their elders. The musical numbers are all fantastic. It is a testimony to the power of this movie that even to this day it is fondly remembered by everyone, even though other animated films such as Beauty and the Beast garnered more prestige and acclaim. Twenty-five years have passed since the release of The Lion King and yet the film is fully capable of transporting you back to the innocence of the mid-90s. A magical film- one of the shining examples of Disney's renaissance and one that should not be missed regardless of your interest in cartoons."

","When Disney released ""The Lion King"" during the busy summer of 1994, during which Forrest Gump would become the best picture winner and millions of people watched the OJ bronco chase on TV during an NBA Finals game between the Knicks and Rockets and ordering pizza in droves, it became a cultural milestone not only at the box office, but in merchandising. The storyline on the movie blends in MacBeth with African culture in 84 minutes of pure excitement. The movie tells the story of Simba, a young cub lion raised by Mufasa and his wife Sarabi, who travels the plains and meets up with Nala and their companion bird Zazu, along with the predictable monkey Rafiki. During a stampede, Simba watches in horror as his dad falls into the running crowd after losing grip of Scar's paws, causing him to perish into lion heaven. On his own, Simba meets up with Timon and Pumbaa, and they grow up to be like adults. In the end, Simba fights Scar to the death and helps Nala give birth to Kion, who will become the next lion king in the made for video sequel The Lion King II: Simba's Pride. As for Timon and Pumbaa, they will return in an animated tv series and a prequel between lion king 1 and 2 called lion king 1 and a half. A tv series called the lion guard would soon follow, and a live action remake will bring new audiences who didn't grow up watching the original will get a chance to relive it all over again!!! As for the movie itself, it's timeless and memorable. I first saw this movie when it was in theatres and it stunned me. I would relive it over again when i saw it on vhs and again on DVD in a special edition that adds in a happy song, ""Morning Report"", as well as the IMAX soundtrack from the reissue in addition to the original 5.1 theatrical soundtrack. A 3D conversion would soon goose up the profits until Frozen broke the record for highest grossing cartoon in modern dollars."

"jmmustchin","10","0","0","12 November 2018"," My favourite Disney animation
","This is my favourite of Disney's 2D animated movies (with 101 Dalmatians and Treasure Planet coming up a close second). It concerns a young lion prince Simba, whose father Mufasa is the King of Pride Rock. Mufasa's younger brother Scar - who had been the heir, before Simba's birth - is jealous of his nephew. Scar - who is in a secret alliance with the hyenas - arranges for Mufasa's death, which he fools Simba into thinking is his fault. Simba - on Scar's urging - runs away. He meets a meerkat named Timon and his wart hog buddy Pumba, who teach him to put his past behind him. But when he is confronted about the harsh life under Scar, can he face his past and claim his rightful throne?<br/><br/>The movie is brilliantly (and beautifully) scripted and beautifully drawn. I also quite like the songs (with Scar's song being my all-time favourite movie song). Scar is also one of the best villains to ever hit the screen - pure evil, pure hateable, and very entertaining to watch. The only part I didn't like was the slight religious element (although that played quite well into the movie at times - in fact, one or two moments with it are quite beautiful). It is a true masterpiece of a movie."

"alyssaj-31058","9","0","0","4 May 2018"," The Lion King (Spoiler)
","The movie I chose to watch was, ""The Lion King."" After watching this movie, I was able to analyze the world views and themes of this contemporary movie. In this movie, the main character or hero was a lion named Simba. Near the end of the movie, Simbas's main goal is to get rid of his uncle, Scar, who is controlling his land and take back what belongs to him as king. The main adversary he had was Scar because he was controlling his family and territory and Simba had to learn to be strong and fight for what belongs to him. Simba's character flaw at first would be that he is afraid to move on from his past and step up as a leader. Simba's apparent defeat would be when he feels hopeless and lost because he is scared and confused about what to do about becoming king. When Nala comes to seek him for help, he is at first afraid and doubts himself because he is afraid that he will not have the strength to defeat Scar. The final confrontation would be between Simba and Scar when they are fighting on a cliff. At first Simba tells him to leave and never come back but Scar instead tries to kill Simba which results in them fighting. In the end, Simba wins and the he realizes how even though he was afraid of not being as great of a leader as his father was, he was just as great or even better because he reclaimed and restored his rightful territory. The result of his change would be that he finally regained his family and place as rightful king. Overall, I think the main theme would be that although the past can hurt(like when Simba's dad died), and no matter what you have done, we cannot run away from our problems, but rather confront them and choose to persevere. 
One part of the movie that shows evidence for the movie's moral or message was when Rafiki hit Simba in the head with his staff and told him that ""sometimes the past can hurt."" Rafiki taught him that although the past can hurt we have to persevere and move on to become who we were meant to be. I agree with this theme because many of us are going through hard times but it does not mean that we should give up or run away from our responsibilities. I think the only thing I would have done differently was go back sooner to help my family because I would feel responsible for them and my territory. I think that this movie coincides with biblical truth because Simba's father comes back in the form of clouds(like God might), to tell Simba that he lives inside Simba(like the Holy Spirit). He tells Simba that he has forgotten him and who Simba really is, just like some of us forget to remember God, our father. The only part that I thought might stray away from biblical truth would be when his father tells him that Simba needs to look inside himself, which as Christians we should look to God not ours,even for strength. By saying this I think they are trying to portray the worldview of Individualism, and how we do not need anyone to help us but maybe a reminder. I think that this movie ultimately condemns evil because in then end Simba defeats his uncle, Scar and takes back what truly belonged to him. I think the main world views in the movie are Post-Modernism and Christianity. I think that they arr portraying the world view of Post-Modernism in it a little because they have the characters of Timon and Pumbaa telling Simba, that ""when the world turns its back on you, you turn your back on the world."" They also teach him the famous ""Hakuna Matata"" song which talks about having no worries in life and living how you want. I think that the movie also portrays some aspects of Christianity because when Simba is talking to his dad in the clouds, he tells Simba that he must take his place in the circle of life and remember who he is, because Simba is his son and ""the one true king."" In my opinion, this portrays the world view of Christianity because he is basically telling Simba that he needs to remember his purpose in life and remember that he is the one true king, which sounds like Jesus who is the one true king, which we are told about in the Bible. I think that a positive element would be that the movie portrays some positive themes like how we should persevere through all the hurts and roadblocks in our lives. I think a negative element would be that they include the part of Hakuna Matata, and saying how it is okay to live a life care free, and only worrying about oneself. I think that I would recommend this movie to most people and kids because it has a positive message and is rated PG which is appropriate for most ages."

","When I was a kid, I was never big into most Disney films. I watched them at a very young age. So young that I could not remember to care about them. And when I grew older. I didn't care about them, thought that they where just for little kids. The Lion King was no exception. But compared to most renaissance films. It is true art. While most dealt with Princesses and shallow themes with shallow lessons . This one has more weight. Being that is based on the Shakespeare play, Hamlet. When I became 12 I truly appreciated Lion King for many reasons and Mufasa's death. It is powerful and nostalgic. It fueled my love for Lions. and anthropomorphic animals. <br/><br/>-STORY-
Set somewhere in Africa, namely Pride Rock. Simba is prince, but the jealous Scar wants to take his thrown and now Uncle Scar kill's Simba's dad Mufasa by throwing him off a cliff. Simba is now blamed for this and must exile Pride Rock. He must now get revenge on his evil Uncle with the help of some new friends. <br/><br/>-CHARACTERS-
One thing that bothered me most about this animation is the characters. Simba starts out so confident but then when he grows up he is so full of pity that he is no longer a lion but a deer in head lights. He lacks confidence and looks like a total virgin beta male. It's annoying and pathetic. But he gets his pride back sooner or later when he succeeds. <br/><br/>The supporting characters Timon and Pumba are funny and wise as well as Rafiki. But Rafiki is more likable than Timon and Pumba honestly because I cant take them seriously. <br/><br/>Scar is an intimidating protagonist you'll be satisfied to see die because he is just plain evil. He has no good reason to do whatever he wants. He's just pure evil. He is not a deep character. But he is charming though honestly. His gang of Hyenas are expressive characters. You'll like them to. You'll like Shenzi and Ed. <br/><br/>-ART and ANIMATION- 
In my opinion, The Lion King has to be one of the most beautifully animated films ever devised. Not only is the animation fluid most of the time. (despite there being slow flickery arcs in the movement) It's incredible. The lions animate realistically with every muscle in motion. Every facial expression is just beautiful and the characters look cute and very handsome. The backgrounds have loving detail. The biggest gripe I have is the bad CG in Lion King. The stampede hasn't aged well. It's just annoying to see overly fluid 3D looking beasts run. It's weird. <br/><br/>-SOUND-
The Lion King has a robust memorable soundtrack. You will remember every song. From, ""I can't wait to be king"" and ""The circle of life"". The lions roar is beautiful. 
The VA's are good to. Jeremy Irons does a great Villian , Matthew Broderick and JTT does a great Simba. <br/><br/>Overall it is a beautiful film that will make grown men cry/feel sad and is dramatic.It's emotional and beautiful. Even though it may be overrated but what Disney movie isn't? You know?"

The story of coming back is filled with love, care and pride."

","I will not be the first to say I freaking LOVE this movie. It is such a masterpiece in the hall of Disney fame. It is so nice to see that even over 20 years later, still not much can beat The Lion King. The story is about Simba, a lion who's, and I know I don't give any spoilers when I say this, father, Mufasa, dies when Simba was young. He meets Timon and Pumba, and learns the saying Hakuna Matata, which means no worries. It is still so weird that this films story remains a masterpiece. Simba is a very likable character. Scar, in my opinion, is one of the most amazing villains in a Disney film EVER. And with villains like Ursula from Little Mermaid and Cruella De Vil from 101 Dalmatians, that's an accomplishment. Now I am going to say it, I don't like Timon and Pumba. You can hate me all you want, you can boo me. I personally don't find them funny. But for the rest of the movie- oh, you thought I forgot the songs? I LOVE these songs. Maybe if I had to choose my least favorite, it would be ""I just can't wait to be king"". I think it cheesy.

"jwiley-86292","8","0","0","2 June 2017"," Disney's Greatest Ever
","You might think, why bother analyzing this when it's already one of the most popular films of all time? I have a tendency to equate ""popular"" with ""shallow and worthless,"" but then I re-watched The Lion King recently. <br/><br/>I have often found kids' movies, especially Disney movies, artistically unsatisfying because of what aspects of existence they must omit since they have to be marketable to five-year-olds. Revisiting this movie defied that entire preconception. As of now, I would happily watch it again, which hasn't been true of me since childhood. This is not to say I find other Disney movies equally rewarding now--Belle of Beauty and the Beast, for example, sorely lacks human qualities. Lion King comes across as powerful to a degree I never expected from a kids' movie. The theme of everything having its right place really resonates with me as an adult. <br/><br/>The Lion King makes a good case for the dictum ""less is more."" It doesn't try to grab your attention with pop culture humor or zaniness, something many cartoon movies before and since do. (At least, mostly. How would Timon have any concept of dressing in drag if none of the animals wear clothes and there are no humans to be seen?) And the story isn't hijacked by an unenviable romance as many of the princess movies are. When it comes to animation, though, more is more. How did it take me twenty years to notice how exceptionally beautiful this movie looks compared to every other animated movie? By the way, am I the only one who thought the bugs from the Hakuna Matata scene look delicious? <br/><br/>The effort, honesty and maturity of this movie contrast with that of every other Disney movie in a big way. Now that I compare it to Moana, Moana's concern with subverting older tropes highlights a reluctance to simply tell a story. The Disney people ought to have stuck to what made Lion King specifically work. Oh, and Jeremy Irons is 90 percent of why I like it. Which reminds me: This is not ideal for its genre, per se. I think keeping in the Be Prepared reprise would have helped the movie; it's only 90 minutes, so it's not like that would make it too long. Still, I doubt Disney could ever top this."

","Ah The Lion King. The highest grossing hand drawn animated movie of all time and the former highest grossing animated movie ever. As a kid, I absolutely adored this movie to the point where it was my favorite movie ever. However, nowadays, my reaction has kind of waned. Now don't get me wrong, I still love this movie but I will admit that there are better Disney movies. My main problem with this movie is Timon and Pumbaa. The fart jokes are obnoxious and I just didn't like their personalities. They feel like they're the same annoying character in 2 bodies. Even if your do like them, they kind of break the mood. Think about it. They're introduced maybe 10 minutes after Mufasa's death with their stupid fart jokes and dumb song. That's another problem with this movie. Hakuna Matata, while I do like it as a catchphrase, is an annoying song. Timon and Pumbaa cannot sing, the song is all over place, it goes on for way too long and it just comes in too soon after Mufasa's death, which was a really big thing for kids back then. Speaking of that, yeah, his death was a big surprise when the movie came out and it messed up a lot of kids for life. Plus the fact that they show the dead body! The story itself is very dark and almost adult. For example, they really emphasize how harsh life in the Pridelands is under Scar's reign. Another great thing about this movie is obviously the animation. It's hand drawn Disney animation and it looks incredible. However, what sets the animation apart from other Disney animation is just how big the movie is in scale. The 3D release for this movie was absolutely phenomenal. Everything was so much bigger and things were literally flying off-screen by the audience. I still remember the moment where Zazu flew by the audience at the beginning of the film. I actually flinched to the side because of how close it was. The characters in this movie are all very likable, outside of Timon and Pumbaa. In fact, the other comedy reliefs, the hyenas and Zazu, are much funnier, much more likable and much more timeless. Overall, I do love this movie despite it's quirks."
"datautisticgamer-74853","8","0","0","3 May 2016"," Far from my favorite Disney movie and may, IMO, be very slightly overrated
","Do not get me wrong when I say that I enjoyed this adaptation of Hamlet, with a few songs that I could remember (more than Aladdin, which boosted points), an emotional scene that would become a cliché in plenty of movies to follow, such as The Good Dinosaur, and some pop-culture references that, despite being somewhat out of place in a Tanzanian savanna, work occasionally (there are a few to less child-friendly films, such as In the Heat of the Night), and there was apparently a strong enough story to warrant a true sequel, an alternate timeline, two spin-offs, and cameos in plenty of other Disney productions. Compared to other animated films of 1994 (such as A Troll in Central Park), it is a major step up. However, now that I see it as my critic self, I found little enjoyment with Pumbaa other than the fascinating voice given to him by Ernie Sabella. While The Lion King isn't the first Disney movie to have restroom humor (Beauty and The Beast and The Great Mouse Detective had belching scenes), I was miffed by constant allusions to Pumbaa's issue with wind. When he tries to be funny in other ways, he can occasionally work, but I prefer Timon. Because of that issue, this is just outside the you-must-see category in the feel-free-to-check-it-out category."

","Epic voice over, epic sound track, unforgettable songs, and yet plot is a little bit too simple. Very brilliant character, the voices of the villain and the old king are both dramatic and majestic. The plot is kind of simple and stupid, after all it's aimed to be a kid's movie. The way the old king got killed and the way villain died are ridiculous. Also, how the hero got away from danger again and again is simply not reasonable. Right from the start the movie shows how all the other animals must bow to the old king is also not very pleasing to watch-----why not let all the animals live equally ? Anyway, it's a good movie as a whole. And it deserves an 8 as a cartoon."

","The Lion King is probably one of Disney's best animated features. The story is about a young lion cub named, Simba, who wants to be king of the jungle. The voice cast was great, it has James Earl Jones, Nathan Lane, Matthew Broderick, Whoopie Goldberg, Jim Cummings, and other voice talents. The animation is wonderful, it looks like the movies animators got it all right! This movie has some of the best Disney songs. Circle of Life is just an amazing song and there's other great ones. I love the characters, Timon & Pumba are hilarious. There's a scene in the middle where Simba's father gets killed by Scar. Scar is the villain in this movie and he wants to be king, that's the main reason why Scar killed Mafasa, Simba's dad. The ending was happy and great. A Disney movie that's much better than The Brave Little Toaster! Check The Lion King out, you'll love it!"

","I find it hard to believe that kid's movies these days will ever be called classics in years to come (excluding Pixar movies). In my mind, this is the last classic hand drawn film, and it upsets me that I have to wait for another five years for it to come out on DVD. This film deals with great issues and involves a huge conflict for the main character, something that recent kid/family films lack. It is funny and lighthearted when it should be, and heartfelt and serious when it needs it.

","The Lion King is one of my favorite movies ever, especially Matthew Broderick who played Ferris Bueller in ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off"" voicing adult Simba.

My favorite part is when Pumbaa says: ""They call me Mr. Pig!"" ""Hakuna Matata"" is such a fun song to sing along to in the movie and ""it means no worries for the rest of the days."" This movie was probably one of my favorite Disney classics of all-time. James Earl Jones who previously played Mr. Mertle in the 1993 film ""The Sandlot"" voiced Mufasa, Simba's father and Scar's older brother.

"t-hf","8","0","0","9 January 2015"," A retrospective review
","When this movie was first released, it was less a movie and more of an event. It was the biggest thing that Disney had made up until that point and for many reasons - the voice cast was made up of a-listers (Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, James Earl Jones, the list goes on), the songs were being sung worldwide, the story was epic and most of all - it held and still holds a special place in all of our hearts and childhoods.<br/><br/>To me, this movie was perfect - it was cute, it was funny, it was unbearably heartbreaking (for anyone that has ever truly loved their dad), it had great morals and some great songs. Recently I ordered a copy of it to see if it holds up and for the most part, it does. I still find myself laughing and crying, the songs are still great and the animation is still b-e-a-utiful. However, that being said it does have it's flaws that now the hype has died down, I don't have to overlook. For anyone that hasn't seen it, the story is basically an adaptation of Shakespeare's Hamlet set in the African pride-lands, with animals as it's main characters. In short, lion cub Simba is the next heir to the throne, with his dad Mufasa the current king. Mufasa's brother Scar jealously feels that he should have been next in line and that is where we have our villain, and a good one at that. I can't give anything else away, but what follows is a fantastic adventure mixing good-vs-evil, great characters and a very Shakespearean story of revenge and coming- of-age.<br/><br/>Now for the flaws. Most of it is nitpicking, but as an adult I have grown to appreciate movies for their stories and I must say that the third act (the final conflict) is a little rushed and it threw my adult mind off a little bit, having just witnessed such a fantastic build up. But other than that, I was surprised to find that none of the characters or songs annoy me as they do many other adults that saw it as a kid. Another thing that is always brought to my attention is that the message of the film is a little mixed (which I won't spoil). I personally like the morals the film has to offer, as I feel they reflect real life misunderstandings and teach children that your parents can't teach you everything about the world. There are simply some things you must discover for yourself, which is all part of growing up. It is a coming-of-age story after all isn't it? <br/><br/>Any way, faults aside, I truly see this film as one of the greatest animated films of all time and one of Disney's best. It may not be a perfect film, but it is certainly one of the biggest in terms of scope that their has ever been."

","This is a movie that I believe everyone should see during their lifetime. It is filled with life lessons and great life advice, and is both a heart wrenching and fun and enjoyable movie. This is by far one of my favorite movies of all time. The graphics on this movie may not be the ""best"" for the year that we are in, but they are astounding for the year in which this movie was made. This movie is suitable for young children to watch as it is seemingly fun and cute. But at the same time, there are parts of this movie that make you rethink aspects of your life. As an adult I believe it is acceptable for me to say that this is also a movie that adults can enjoy even though it was originally made for a younger audience. The Lion King is a movie that I believe every movie lover should have within their collection. The movie itself and the ideals and ideas within the movie withstand time and will continue to do so in coming years. In all I believe The Lion King is a must-see and must-own movie that won't leave you disappointed, regardless of who you are or what your age may be."
"bigjackfilms","10","0","0","1 January 2015"," Over 20 Years Later, Still A Crowning Achievement!!!
","I have to say is probably my all-time favorite film Disney has ever made. Yeah, there's allot of stuff I really enjoy, but The Lion King was in many ways my childhood.<br/><br/>The characters are fantastic, my favorite being Adult Simba. Yes, I know he's voiced by Matthew Broderick, and I have seen his acting as kinda dull. But WOW! This is his best performance! He turned this character into a noble BADASS. And I'm really glad he still does the voice in several other pieces of work. I can't see anybody else voicing him. I love the characters design, Simba really started the idea of a young teenage/young adult warrior, leading his comrades and friends into adventures.<br/><br/>The villain, Amazing and Memorable! And you can totally see how Disney based there version of Loki later on. <br/><br/>How does the story hold up now? Well, when watching it several times growing up, I thought it was its own original thing, which made me love it even more. But it wasn't till I became a bit more curious in the making of the film that I bought the Special Edition DVD, and found out it was based on stories like Hamlet and Moses.<br/><br/>Of course we can't leave out the Elephant in the room. No not The Elephant Graveyard. I'm talking of course about when Simba's father Mufasa died. This scene still gets to me emotionally, even more than when I was a kid. You watch this scene and you might even think of your own Father. You wanna find him and hug him. I don't know why, but when a parent, or pet dies in a movie, its always an urge to me to find my own and hug them.<br/><br/>The animation? What can I say, its Disney at its finest hour. The designs, the backgrounds, the environment. It's absolutely beautiful to view from the eye. Its almost like Africa came right out of the painted lines. <br/><br/>However, one of the best pieces in the film is the music! This is some of the best music I ever heard in a motion picture. So many talented people made the soundtrack unforgettable. Hans Zimmer, this is when he really gave his scores different characters, you know, before he made everything and Inception BRWONG! This is defiantly one of his best pieces. <br/><br/>Then there's of course the songs by Tim Rice and Elton John. We all know these songs by heart and is part of our collective minds. Every song is ear loving. My favorite honestly, is not Be Prepared, not Hakuna Matata, not even The Circle Of Life, its Can You Feel The Love Tonight. Elton's and Disney's version are an example of Musical Beauty. This is Disney's crowing achievement in there Love Song category.<br/><br/>But honestly, the majority of the credit to the films music is Lebo M. Allot of people don't know much about him, and its kind of sad considering that he had such a troubled life. But he made this score work 1000%. He brought in the African part to the score and I honestly don't think the score would be nearly as amazing without his contribution. The quire, the drums, the chants. Its so entrancing. He's even gone on to do more work for Disney, including extended albums and musicals.<br/><br/>With the music and animation, this movie really sparked my interest in African culture. I can't tell you how much I want to go the Africa because of this film's art form.<br/><br/>The ending is also an amazing feat. The BIG EPIC BATTLE is of course amazing, as well as THE FINAL BATTLE with Simba and Scar, which is just so GOD DAMN AMAZING to watch. Seriously, buy the largest TV possible, turn off the lights, turn up the volume and enjoy the best cat fight you'll ever see. And to see the films happy ending is almost tear dropping to watch. Simba's climb to his throne still gives me the chills, and his roar. WOW! Blows me away.<br/><br/>Throughout my life, I've seen the film numerous times on several formats. The VHS is the one we all grew up with as kids and the Blu Ray is pretty good with its cleaned up prints. But if you want the perfect version of the film with enough bonus material to last a week, I'd say get the 2 Disc Special Edition DVD from 2004. <br/><br/>But by far the best version of the film I've seen was when it was re released in 3-D a few years ago. I did not expect it to be as amazing as I thought it would be. Not only did it make me reflect on my youth, but HOLY SH**! THE 3-D, PICTURE AND SOUND WAS INCREDIBLE!!! It was so crystal clear that I saw things in the background that I never noticed before. You could swear that they added stuff in, but no. It was there from the beginning. The Sound was loud and larger than life. Some of the best sound work I saw in a theater, and when the songs were on, everybody got up, danced and sang along. It was so much fun. And the 3- D? Some of the best 3-D I've seen, almost Avatar 3-D. When Scar jumps out of the fire, Jesus was that close. <br/><br/>So with all this amazing pieces of talent, art and its 20 year legacy, I still think the film holds up after 20 years. Its childhood, its culture, it has character connections, the music is incredible. Its defiantly one of my favorite films and to me, Disney's crowning achievement. It's defiantly going to go on to hold up for generations to come, even after we die and become connected to The Circle Of Life. 10/10"

","The Lion King is a film that teaches us about nature's circle of life, as a lion cub born in the Pride Lands of Africa, learns what responsibility means as he grows up. Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is the cub of King Mufasa (James Earl Jones) and Sarabi (Madge Sinclair) who is a typical curious youngster. His uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons), is not happy with being replaced as future king and develops a plot to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba. In the meantime, Mufasa is teaching Simba about the circle of life and how we are all intertwined in it. This theme is seen in the Disney movie Pocahontas during the song, Color of the Wind, where Pocahontas (Judy Kuhn) sings to John Smith (Mel Gibson) how everything in nature is connected together. <br/><br/>The Lion King's cinematography is very well done with the close-up shots of Simba showing his various emotions of curiosity, being scared, and sadness as his father, Mufasa, dies. The close-up shots, along with the superb visual effects, allow you to feel those same emotions. I found it very difficult not to cry when Mufasa dies. The special effects in the elephant graveyard with the fire, and perfect sound effects, allows you to feel how scared a young Simba and Nala (Niketa Calame) may feel. <br/><br/>After Mufasa's death, at the hands of Scar, Simba runs away from his life at Pride Rock and grows up in the jungle with two friends, Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella) and Timon (Nathan Lane). They live by their carefree motto Hakuna Matata, as Simba becomes a young adult (Matthew Broderick). Just like anyone else, Simba knows he cannot live that carefree life anymore and must return to Pride Rock after finding out that Scar has broken that circle of life and destroyed the lands. Once Simba, Pumbaa, Timon, and Nala (Moira Kelly) return to the Pride Lands and win the battle in the climax of the film, the rain comes in and washes away the past, allowing the circle of life to begin again. Simba takes his place on top of Pride Rock as the new king. <br/><br/>In the final scene we see the same as the beginning of the film, with the presentation of a cub lion, but this time that cub belongs to Simba and Nala. The circle of life has come full circle."

","Many 90's kids see this movie as one ultimate reminder of their childhood. It could contain the first sadness as well as the first laugh at a joke. Lion king has the ability to make toddlers understand real emotions as many others of the Disney movies. <br/><br/>But Lion king has something extra. Maybe its the perfect combination between seriousness and comedy. Maybe its the nostalgic Disney drawing, maybe its because of the lack of humans in the movie that allows us to instead of worrying about the human you lose yourself into something else. Something you can feel for not based by the looks of the character. Of course do every toddler in any age have a majestic understanding of the greatness of lions and that helps logically. But why is Lion king just as good now when we're adults?<br/><br/>My own theory of this matter is (without mention the nostalgic factor) is that the movie has a perfect balance of light and dark. Not only in the sadness/comedy area but also in the actual nature way. Sceneries are different as the journey goes on and something happens inside of us during that journey. We feel uncomfortable in the desert and in the dark, and happy and relaxed in the jungle with all the green. This mix of emotions bring a tone to Lion king thats hard to shake off. Lion king affects you after you've watched it and when you've seen it, doesn't matter how many times you've watched it, you tell someone you've seen it. And that person will agree and probably say ""yes, I've watched it like a thousand times, It so good"" and you'll reply yes I've seen it a thousand times before too"" just to make sure to the other person that he does not like it more than you. <br/><br/>I think its parental responsibility to pass this genius movie onto the coming generations. Lion king will always be one of the satisfaction marks, movie based."

","When I was a little kid, every time I was asked what I wanted to be when I grew up, my answer was not a teacher, an astronaut, an athlete, or a doctor, like most children. My answer was a lion. The Lion King was my favorite movie as a child and held a great impact on me. I watched it all the time and soon knew every word to the catchy songs. I think the movie is phenomenal and turned out to be a very entertaining movie. It is still one of my favorite movies today. This Disney animated movie is unique because unlike many other Disney favorites that were made around the same time, The Lion King is one of the few that was not based on a previous story (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""), and in my opinion is the best Disney movie of all time. This movie provides the audience with many upbeat songs and essential life lessons. First, the film shows that everyone should own up to his or her responsibilities as adults, or there may be consequences. This is seen when Simba, who should go back to the Pride Lands, his former home, and take his place as king, refuses to go back. Meanwhile back at the Pride Lands, Scar, the present king and Simba's uncle, has destroyed the kingdom and made life miserable for Simba's family and all the other lions. Another good lesson that is learned is shown when Rafiki, a wise monkey, hits Simba on the head with his walking stick. Simba, disgruntled, asks what he did to deserve that and Rafiki answers him by saying that whatever the reason, it does not matter anymore. Simba, confused, agrees but explains that it still hurts. Rafiki provides his advice by saying ""Oh yes, the past can hurt. But from the way I see it, you can either run from it or learn from it"" (""The Lion King Quotes""). This quote from Rafiki was one of the main reasons that Simba eventually went back to the Pride Lands, even when he vowed to never return because he did not want to face his past. Simba thought Scar told everyone in the Pride Lands that Simba had killed his father and Scar's brother, Mufasa, the former king, when in actuality Scar was the one that killed him. A popular saying that has been gained from The Lion King is ""Hakuna Matata"". This is a phrase that Simba learns from his new best friends he meets after he runs away from home, Timon and Pumbaa. Hakuna Matata becomes the three's motto, which they comprehend as meaning ""no worries"". This phrase is known widely in the world, meaning that people should not worry about the small things in life and worry as less as possible. The Lion King not only tells a good message, but also is very entertaining as confirmed by an online critic ""this stylish, ambitious and magical film provides a delightfully entertaining experience for moviegoers of all ages"" (Wilmes, ""The Lion King""). The words in this quote 'stylish', 'ambitious', 'magical' and 'delightful' all perfectly describe The Lion King as a whole. The movie is very optimistic, leaving the audience with a good feeling at the ending. It is also not only for children. The songs may be childish, however they are still very catchy and many adults and teenagers still sing along to them while watching the movie. The Lion King is an ideal movie to watch for a family movie night or a night alone. There have been questions concerning whether this film is appropriate or not for children. For example, ""Scar arranges Mufasa's disturbing on-screen death in a manner that both banishes Simba to the wilderness and raises questions about whether this film really warranted a G rating"" (Maslin, ""The Lion King (1994)""), was stated in a review posted in The New York Times. However, the concept of the circle of life is mentioned many times throughout the film. Mufasa explains to Simba that even though they eat other animals, when they die, their bodies become the grass, and the other animals eat the grass. This concept lightens death in a way that is acceptable for children to hear and understand. I can also say that when I was a kid I was never too frightened by Mufasa's death or other scenes in the movie to watch it and have never heard of a child being scared of The Lion King. Also, if a child that is too young to comprehend death watches the movie, they would most likely only pay attention to the songs anyways and not completely understand the plot."

","I saw this movie just a few days ago on an old VHS tape my parents have at home, and absolutely loved it!! It is a great story and a feel good movie that you'll likely feel really happy seeing. What is great about this movie, well I feel like most Disney movies try to leave you with a good message. This movie has a few powerful messages, like one Timon and Pumba's song Hakuna Matatata, a message about no worries which helps Simba forget about what he had just faced earlier. It's really nice to hear messages about not worrying as songs like that help us forget some of our own worries. The other message this film leaves us with is responsibility. Simba gets used to an easy life and no longer considers being king, like he was looking forward to earlier in the movie as his responsibility. Can Simba be persuaded to go back to Pride Rock, or should he just continue living his easy worry free life with Timon and Pumba? So, yeah it leaves us with a positive message and it is in all a beautiful film. A film with just animals, there are no people in it. We get to see very beautiful scenery, especially in the beginning of the movie and lots of animals. The songs are really nice songs you'd want to listen to, and there is a great story involved. It's also great how this movie isn't computer animated like almost all the animated movies that come out nowadays are. It's nice to just see really great drawings of Africa and wildlife. It's been a huge success as it's one of the highest grossing movies ever and it even has more home video copies sold than any other film. It's timeless, and I'm sure most of you reading this review have seen it. If you haven't seen it, then see it it's a must see. This is also a movie to show your kids, as I'm sure this movie will live on 100 years from now."

","To live life like a king, we must earn the throne.<br/><br/>Fight for the throne, achieve it and then you are the king. That's off course the climax of the movie but to get there, it takes a lot. I have a few personal memories of this film. Watching it in Sangeet theatre, feeling like Simba when back home. When I watch it today too, I got the kid out in me and was reveling in those memories. It's a simple story, made very well and oh yeah great photography and terrific music. In fact this is more a musical than an adventure.<br/><br/>Before PIXAR invaded the animation industry and when there was Walt Disney at the helm, this film was the best ever animated film and it still is in many ways. This has 2D animation and is drawn with lines unlike the PIXAR 3D animation and is completely based out of drawings and a typical storyboard where every small move has to be drawn. It took a lot of pain to detail for sure but the tougher job is to put them all together and make it what it stands today. Kudos to directors Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff and thanks Disney again for giving us a movie to vie for and woo for.<br/><br/>Technically, a great film and it's made greater by the cinematography, the quality of animation, the story that's about the making of the king, a commonplace story though but will work on an emotional level. Today, i found few silly things, but will give them away as they also seem to fall in place. One specific scene I liked is Simba walking with the king Mufasa to learn a few things, a father son thing that works.<br/><br/>It's 4/5 for a great animation feature with a universal story."

","One of the most popular Disney animated musicals, The Lion King presents the story of a lion cub's journey to adulthood and acceptance of his royal destiny. Simba (voiced first by Jonathan Taylor Thomas, then by Matthew Broderick) begins life as an honored prince, the son of the powerful King Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). The cub's happy childhood turns tragic when his evil uncle, Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons), murders Mufasa and drives Simba away from the kingdom. In exile, the young lion befriends the comically bumbling pair of Pumbaa the warthog (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and Timon the meerkat (voiced by Nathan Lane), he and lives a carefree jungle life. As he approaches adulthood, however, he is visited by the spirit of his father, who instructs him to defeat the nefarious Scar and reclaim his rightful throne. Borrowing elements from Hamlet, classical mythology, and African folk tales, The Lion King tells its mythic coming-of-age tale with a combination of spectacular visuals and lively music, featuring light, rhythmic songs by Elton John and Tim Rice, and a score by Hans Zimmer"

","Great movie! It teaches kids to stop being so gullible and that life is a learned lesson. I feel like it is suitable for all age groups to watch. The characters all represent different qualities and characteristics. These qualities are strength, will power, happiness, love, passion and more. The movies starts off with Simba as a baby. He is on a mission to be the king, however he has to be groomed. His father is showing him the ropes and making sure he is ready for the kingdom. Simba has to go through a lot of different experiences through out the movie to shape him into the man he needs to be. Along this journey is looses his father and he is manipulated by Mustafa into thinking the death of his father was his fault. He had to then realize that it wasn't, in which that made him grow as a person to be strong for others. This movie was great in so many different way.

","In my humble opinion, ""The Lion King"" (1994) is nothing less than the best Disney in the modern era.People of my generation have grown with this movie. I've seen it at least ten time. This pictorial representation of the African savanna and exotic animals still attracts us so much. It is obvious that this anime is full of inventiveness, virtuosity, humor and draws emotion.It's about the weight to assume his legacy, not to disappoint his parents. but we can also see it as the irresponsibility of the chain and animal alimentary.The cub Simba, forceps undergo an accelerated learning life after the death of his father Mufasa. he must confront his duplicitous uncle, Scar, a of the vilest villains that we could see.the animation reached very high levels, including this impressive sequence where a troupon wild wildebeest rushes canyon.the soundtrack is a festival of tubes.

","Casey Cox English 1030 February 21, 2014 Project Two: Synopsis A young lad, destined to be the king, runs away after he was tricked into believing that he killed his father. The Lion King, released in 1994, was directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff. The estimated budget for the film was around $45,000,000 (imdb.com). Starring the voices of Matthew Broderick as Simba the lion, Nathan Lane as Timon the meercat, and Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa the warthog. The film received many nominations for awards, and it won an Oscar for the song ""Can you feel the love tonight"". It won Golden Globes for best soundtrack score, best original song for ""Can you feel the love tonight"", and best motion picture in the Comedy/Musical category. The plot revolves around a young lion named Simba who is next in line to become the king of the Pride Lands. His best friend is a young lioness named Nala and they are to be married when they are old enough. His father, Mufasa, is the current king and is happily married to Sarabi, the head lioness. Mufasa has a hornbill for an adviser named Zazu, and a younger brother named Scar. Scar is friends with the hyenas, and together they make an evil team. Scar is jealous because now Simba will become the king instead of Scar. He wants his revenge, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of Mufasa and Simba for good. The movies starts out with the wise baboon Rafiki showing off Simba to all of the animals in the Pride Lands. One day, Simba and Nala go to an elephant graveyard, despite being forbidden to go there. They are attacked by three of the hyenas; Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. They are about to kill the lion cubs when Mufasa, being warned by Zazu, shows up and saves them both. Simba is then reprimanded and he promises his father that he will become more obedient. A short while later Scar decides to get his revenge. He leads Simba down to the gorge and tells him to work on his wimpy roar. The three hyenas are at the top of the gorge and they cause a stampede of wildebeests into the gorge, putting Simba's life in danger. Zazu then warns Mufasa of Simba's whereabouts and Mufasa rushes to save him. Mufasa saves Simba, but is injured by the stampeding herd. When he tries to climb up the gorge, Scar digs his claws into Mufasa's paws and throws him back down killing him. Scar then blames Simba for Mufasa's death and tells the cub to ""run away, and never return"" (The Lion King, 1994). Simba runs away and is quickly found by Timon and Pumbaa, two good natured friends who want to help Simba with his problems. The three live together for many years and base their lives on the slogan ""Hakuna Matata"" which means ""No Worries"" (The Lion King, 1994). One day as the friends are out and about, a female lioness spots Pumbaa and tries to hunt and kill him. Simba, now a grown lion, attacks the lioness and the two struggle. Simba then recognizes her as Nala, his childhood friend. The two catch up and Nala tells him that Scar has ruined the Pride Lands, allowing the hyenas to rule with him and that Simba needs to come back and claim his place as king. However, Simba is still overcome with the guilt of believing that he killed his father and he refuses to go back. He is then reminded by Rafiki that his father lives within him and wants him to go back to his home and take his rightful place as king. Simba returns to his home to find it in ruins. It is dark and grey, there are hyenas everywhere and everyone seems sad and broken down. When Scar sees Simba, Scar's first thought is that Mufasa had risen from the dead since Simba looked so much like his father. Scar tries to humiliate Simba by telling all of the lions that Simba killed his father. Scar and Simba then start fighting and lightning strikes starting a fire. Scar almost overpowers Simba and he holds Simba off a cliff in the same manner that he held Mufasa off the cliff. Scar then leans over and whispers to Simba that it was actually he who killed Mufasa and it was not Simba's fault at all. Simba is filled with anger and he gains the strength to attack Scar. He throws his uncle over a small cliff, where the hyenas attack and kill Scar. It promptly starts raining putting out the fire, and Simba takes his place as king of the Pride Lands. A while later the Pride Lands have been restored to their previous natural beauty. Simba married Nala and the two have had a son. Rafiki then comes and shows off their son to the animals in the kingdom, just as he had done before with Simba."

","When discussing this epic movie, there is always some guy saying:''Well, I didn't cry when Mufasa died. Why should I? Scar was the ultimate character of the movie with all these lines, being ironic and after all he was deeply misunderstood''. Let's take this straight...Scar, neglected by his parents...always left out...watching Mufasa being raised as the favorite son, turned bad...There is some truth to this, but what about personal choice? Scar chose to kill his own brother and sent Simba away racked with guilt in order to rule the kingdom...Clap clap... Instead, he could be cool uncle Scar: ignoring power, loved by his nephew and all the others for being just that!(OK nobody would watch that:-P) What I really want to say is, we can't just blame our predecessors for what we've become...It's all about choicesÂ…Where are WE in this circle of life?"

","The Lion King is by far one of the best movies ever released. I remember watching it on VHS as a little girl, and loving every minute of it. Hakuna Matata is the perfect song to sing when you're in a bad mood. So many good memories tied in with this one. Timon and Pumbaa are my favorite characters, simply because they are drop dead hilarious and have made so many lives so much happier just because of a simple joke. The hyenas freak me out a little, but they're very interesting characters. Simba is the typical child, impulsive, wild and ready to do what they want because they want to see for themselves instead of taking their parents word for it."

","I found myself on a bus ride home today with thinking about my daily issues and worries and then like a sudden rush of nostalgia, remembered the phrase ""Hakuna Matata"" (It means no worries). Before I knew it, I was watching a recap of the film I first laid my innocent child eyes on as a 6 year old boy.<br/><br/>More than a decade later and I'm still pleasantly stuck with the lyrics of that song. This film is amazing for all ages. Watching it today I re-learned many core values that applies to my life in my current state and I'm sure when I re-watch it in the next decade I will continue to learn things unforeseen now.<br/><br/>The film is rich in content, featuring concepts of friendships, leadership, integrity, betrayal, love and also how everyone should adopt a positive mindset whenever it feels like things aren't going your way. The script for the film is beautifully written and still has an amazing impact 25 years later. I'm proud to have grown up with Timone, Pumba and Symba whom have showed me how important friendships in life is.<br/><br/>There are many pivotal scenes in which viewers will remember for years after the show and that's what is amazing about it; the beauty that lies in the film. The deep meanings that comes across as more impactful to adults than kids is equally surprising. As a child I had my curiosities but could never fully comprehend. However as an adult I fully see the hidden messages in scenes between Mufasa and Symba as he stares in the river. <br/><br/>Not to give anything away, but for those who haven't seen this film I urge you to watch it right away. The theme is timeless and what's still impressive are how catchy the soundtracks remains today!<br/><br/>To me: this is truly a masterpiece, a reason to smile at the credits because you walked away knowing you weren't the same before seeing the film. In the end, we are a reflection of who we want to be and this film really brought that out. I say if you're reading this now and going through some issues in life, watch this film again and give yourself that chance to feel happier."

","It's been long since I have read the comic version of Lion King, but I never got a chance to see the animated version. Today, I watched the movie without much anticipation, since I was aware of much of the movie. But, I was amazed by it, the way it is presented, which suits both children and adults. The tale of Mahabharata is identical to the plot. The king who lost his kingdom by the betrayal of his cousin, his wandering days through forest along with his brothers and wife, his comeback and the great war. We Indians values our epics, and they say every story is rooted on Mahabharata. As for Lion King, the depiction of our saga was a brilliant one. Classic Disney treatment helped it to capture the essence of pride. <br/><br/>The movie is not a computer animated one, which is now a sensation, but Lion King is compatible to any movie that releases today. It has sentiments, a strong message, and with little humor as possible. There are many Japanese animation movies, notably from Hayao Miyasaki. They are timeless classics, yet are not computer animated. We can place Lion King, of course with many other Disney movies, with them. I am pretty sure that I can watch it again and again with out annoyance, because thats why it is called a classic..."
"jean-baptiste-wertz","Null","0","0","22 October 2013"," The story of the Lion King
","The Lion King is one of the most acclaimed animation movies by the Disney Studios. It tells the story of a young lion cub, Simba, whose father is the king of the Savannah and gets murdered by his greedy, megalomaniac uncle Scar in order to become the king himself. Simba then flees into the jungle to escape from his murderous uncle, where he meets the sympathetic duo composed by warthog Pumba and mongoose Timon. They then proceed to introduce him to their hedonistic and careless way of life. Once Simba learns that he must face his responsibilities and that escaping is maybe the easiest, but not the best way... This movie, without any doubt one of Disney's masterpieces, grabs you by the balls and doesn't let you go until Simba becomes the King. Alternating grippingly emotional moments that will bring you on the verge of crying like a girl, and funny scenes that will leave you breathless of laughing, the film also includes some very catchy songs by Phil Collins that are still sung by the generation that grew up with the movie."

"tapdancer96","10","0","0","4 July 2013"," Long Live the King
","** There are pieces of summary that could be portrayed as spoilers depending on the reader **<br/><br/>As a kid I always enjoyed watching Disney films in the morning after waking up, in the evening before going to sleep, or anytime I had nothing to do. Most Disney movies had to do with princesses and princes falling in love, but at age six boys still had ""cooties"". I could never understand why a girl would want to be with a prince and live ""happily ever after"". The Lion King was my go to movie; it had romance but the story wasn't all about falling in love. While the future king, Simba, is just a young cub he has to face many hardships. Simba always looked up to his dad, Mufasa, trying to do what he did, so that one day he would be a great king. While still in his childhood, Simba has to battle his uncle, Scar, who is trying to takeover Pride Rock. The movie is filled with great pictures, story lines, music, and action of course. <br/><br/>The Lion King isn't only a great source of action but the symbolism and morals behind the story are amazing for kids to watch. Some great symbols are shown through the color, brightness, and the weather. Simba tends to be in danger in the less colorful scenes while when Simba is happy and not in danger the use of colors are bright and vibrant. At night Simba seems to learn more about himself as a king and who he has become or should have become. The weather changes many times whether it is rain, sunshine or desert hot. During the rain there is normally a sad or grieving feel. When the sun is shining no one could be happier for what is taking place around them, it is a loving care-free environment. In the desert sun is usually where Simba is lost and ends up taking a positive step forward. Without these symbols the movie would not be the same.<br/><br/>The songs also have great catchy tunes to stick in one's mind, so when you think about the songs you will think about the lyrics. When you think about the lyrics you are learning important parts of the movie. The best moralistic song in the movie would have to be ""Hakuna Matata"". Having the definition of ""no worries"" helps overcome what Simba has gone through and to not worry and put his past behind him. This builds a strong friendship for Simba and he grows up not having to worry about anything such as being a king.<br/><br/>There are many examples of action in this movie that have the audience on edge while watching. The rumbling of the ground and pounding rocks set up a great source of suspense while the action is taking place. There are three specific scenes where Simba continues to put his life in danger, whether he is battling hyenas, a stampede of wildebeests, or lions. He must find a way to protect himself and sometimes others around him. <br/><br/>Disney has made many movies but The Lion King is a classic and cannot be beat. Although this movie was made in 1994 it is still watched today by many children and even some adults. The Lion King will live on as one of Disney's greatest films of the twentieth century and can be enjoyed by all family members. The Lion King is king of all movies so in the famous words of Scar, ""Long live the King."""

When I saw the film for the first time it was an incredible, beautiful journey, and even now the film still holds incredible power. It is, to me, Disney at the height of their powers, the very peak of their work.<br/><br/>The story is effectively Hamlet but it's executed so well, with such passion and love and beauty.

","The Lion King is probably still my favourite Disney movie, though I love most of them that I've seen. But The Lion King has real sentimental value for me. I saw it in high school and quickly became obsessed. The irony is that a lot of the time my friends and I were more obsessed with this little movie they showed before the feature (It was about a little sheepish lion called Lambert. We sang the Lambert song more than any actual Lion King song).<br/><br/>Anyway, what do I love about The Lion King? Well, the music for a start. Combining that with the beautiful, sweeping visuals and you have a fair few eye-prickling moments (you know, prickling with unshed tears?). The story is sad but has its happy moments. The soundtrack is amazing - recently I saw Elton John live and he played ""Circle of Life"", which gave my friend and I both major goosebumps, but Hans Zimmer is the main genius here - and the animation is fabulous.<br/><br/>This film is timeless."
"OrionSiriusSagan","8","0","0","26 March 2013"," My take on The Lion King
","I remember when this movie first came out in 1994 and I first saw it in theaters and I enjoyed it. This movie makes sense to me every time I have watched it. It has great character and story development. This movie was a facet of my childhood along with Fern Gully and Toy Story. I felt for Timon and Pumbaa ever since I first watched this movie in theaters in 1994. The hyenas were mean to Timon and I used to hate the hyenas for it. This movie is about taking responsibility and that is the moral of the film. I also learned not to worry too much from Hakuna Matata and I have a tendency to worry about things that I like a lot. This movie is not my #1 childhood favorite, but I liked it."
"illbebackreviews","10","0","0","22 March 2013"," The Lion King is literally the greatest animation film along with Toy Story!
","I have often seen 'The Lion King' as a child at school but have never, since then, had the privilege to see this masterpiece. Today, I decided: ""What the hey! I need to see this!"" and so, I DID! And boy...its the best choice I made all year! Everyone knows the plot to Lion King but for any who don't, here it is: Simba as a cub grows up with Mufasa and is told one day that he will be the next king. When word reaches Simba's uncle, Scar, he isn't very pleased as you would expect to and plots the deaths of Simba and Musafa so that he may rule 'Pride Rock' Escaping Musafa and death, Simba then grows up to be a pretty much nobody until his old friend, Nala comes back and tells him that he must be ready to be king. The story simply evolves around Simba's life.<br/><br/>This film is just an animation masterpiece. Not only a genre masterpiece, but a masterpiece in general. The voice acting for this movie was superb. Jeremy Irons as Scar was amazing, Mathew Brodrick as old Simba was fantastic both delivering the performances of their lives. The animations, to this day, look amazing, the music is breath taking,the songs are so amazing and iconic that it is impossible to possibly ignore any of these aspects. The film is superbly directed and the dialogue is great.<br/><br/>The characters were done so amazingly in this movie. All the characters were interesting. Until Disney classics, like, say 'Beauty and the Beast' there wasn't a character that I didn't truly care for.<br/><br/>Overall, 'The Lion King' is quite possibly the greatest animation film and one of the greatest films ever made that gets everything right. Truly an entertaining, an unforgettable classic!"

","This movie was and is my favorite Disney movie. A timeless classic.<br/><br/>The best part about this movie, I feel, was the musical score. Circle of Life, Hakuna, and Can You Feel, are great songs - so melodic and memorable that I remember the tunes and lyrics to this date.<br/><br/>Overall, I felt this was a story about what we all often do: Running away from problems. But in the end, also as we should do, Simba turns around to face them. This inspires me still, and most definitely inspired me when I was a child.<br/><br/>The reunification scene with the baboon was one of the most hilarious scenes I've seen in a children's movie while at the same time being deep and about facing your problems and not running away from the past.<br/><br/>Finally, I believe the themes of facing your problems and the unification of all life are universal deep themes that are told perfectly well in this movie."
"zurnd","10","0","0","1 March 2013"," Perhaps The First Movie I Ever Laid Eyes on
","Growing up in the mid 90s, my mind is pretty vague when it comes to the first movie I ever saw. I could say The Wizard of Oz or The Nightmare Before Christmas, but then I remember The Lion King, a movie I saw when I was very, very, very young and I immediately consider it the first film I ever laid eyes on, although I'm still uncertain whether that's the case. I will say that The Lion King was my first venture into the world Walt Disney started and still to this day, almost 19 years after the film's release, it's still as mesmerizing now as it was then. It's my favorite Disney film (although Mary Poppins comes pretty darn close), and as I watched it throughout the years, I was not only astonished by the film's unforgettable plot and characters, but by it's morals, outlooks and philosophical meanings. There's more to The Lion King then I originally thought, and as I grew older, I came to realize what the film was really about. <br/><br/>The first thing I must point out is that this is one of the defining movies of my childhood. I had all the Lion King figurines as a toddler and even put my hands on a Super Nintendo controller while The Lion King video game was in the system. But that's not the main reason why I love this film to pieces. The animation in this flick is some of Disney's finest and really demonstrates the capabilities of the CAPS (Computer Animation Production System). The film also demonstrates techniques that are almost as old as Disney films themselves. While making the film, the Disney animators observed real African wildlife, much like how Disney and his crew observed real deer and woodland creatures while making Bambi in the 1940s. And you can really see this in the creatures in The Lion King, for they have such a lifelike quality and display realistic movements. It's almost like you are watching real life animals rather than animated ones. It's really something spectacular. Another thing I love about this film is the surroundings. All the African scenery and environments are beautiful to observe and witness and they really fit the tone of their respective scenes. For example, the elephant graveyard really fits the scene involving Scar and the hyenas. The canyon with the stampede really fits the scene where Mufasa meets his doom and Simba runs away. The jungle with all it's waterfalls and slimy critters really fit the scenes with Simba, Timon and Pumbaa. It all ties together nicely and really makes the film feel more wholesome. It's as beautiful as a newly painted landscape. <br/><br/>The voice acting in the film is some of Disney's best and some of the veterans from this film would go onto voice characters in other Disney films. James Earl Jones is triumphant as the voice of Mufasa and is his best voice work in my opinion (next to Darth Vader of course). I just love the might he brings to Mufasa, making him into the most dignified and most serious character out of the entire film. Jeremy Irons is also magnificent as the voice of the villainous Scar, really making the character into a sadistic, slimy, yet satisfying adversary who really turns the hyenas into dim witted stormtroopers. Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella are the perfect pair when it comes to voicing the film's main comic relief, Timon and Pumbaa and come off as clumsy, yet potent creatures who just want to make their way into the world and eventually, they do when they help Simba and his crew take out the hyenas. But my all time favorite voice acting in this film comes from David Guillaume, who voices the wise, yet rambunctious Rafiki, a feisty baboon/mandrill hybrid. I just love how Guillaume plays Rafiki as a prominent mentor to Simba, prominent, yet still playful and exotic. One minute he can be bouncing off the trees, the next minute he can be meditating. He's like a cross between Yoda and Tim Curry's It. I just love how Guillaume portrays Rafiki as a down to Earth, yet off the wall teacher and not just another clichéd ""no nonsense"" mentor.<br/><br/>The music in this film is in my eyes, the best Disney music ever. Now everyone has their favorites and really, it's all a matter of opinion, but if I was to be asked what Disney movie has the best music, I would come right out and say The Lion King. I must admit though, I'm not the biggest fan of Elton John, but the music he wrote for this film along with Tim Rice really fits the overall tone for a film about a lion on the verge of becoming a powerful king of all lions. You got the opening theme which sets the mood (Circle of Life), the song about the main character's point of view (I Just Can't Wait To Be King), the over the top villain song (Be Prepared), the comic relief's number about not giving a hoot (Hakuna Matata), and the inspirational love song (Can You Feel The Love Tonight). It all falls into place nicely, and with Han Zimmer's excellent score echoing along with the songs, you can't go wrong. It's something he would pull off again when doing the score for a certain trilogy of films about a guy who dresses up as a bat. <br/><br/>The Lion King is an all around perfect film and the film which spawned my everlasting love for anything with Walt Disney's name attached to it. It's a film which digs into the heart and soul and we can relate to it's creatures, even if we are human and they are obviously not. It's a film for everybody, helping them to realize that they too have their place in the Circle of Life."
"nintendogs03","10","0","0","24 September 2012"," one of the best movies in the 90's
","The Lion King was one of the first movies I've seen as a child other than Cinderella. I think it's a perfect film for all ages. Here's why... 1)It teaches you life lessons- when mufasa teaches young simba about the circle of life, it's probably one of the most important scenes out of any movie I saw. it plays a role that sets up how Mufasa rules his kingdom (respect for all) and Scar (well let's kill our dinner and destroy the circle of life). Hakuna Matata is wayy better than YOLO & if something's bad happens, I use this motto to cheer me up. You don't see good life lessons in modern animated movies (well not up and PotF) 2)The score is FANTASTIC! it's just as good as hunchback and way better than aladdin (I love that movie). The songs are amazing and they stay true to the themes and the culture of Africa 3)Mufasa- he's the Atticus Finch of Disney. They respect everyone no matter if they are different from them. they could probably be best friends! 4)Scar- GREATEST Disney VILLAIN EVER!! Like who would actually succeed for a long time besides Frollo from HOND?? Nearly no one. And scar actually kills someone! 5)People say this is a violent movie. umm not really except when simba & scar fight 6)The animation is flawless. It's not messy or overdone; has great contrast and tone & the characters are well drawn I could ramble on about this, but I shouldn't. this IS the definition of a 90's movie. I can see why it's so successful & that most of us adore this movie. This movie never disappoints! Just sit down, use the VHS player, and enjoy this classic!"

And hyenas are also my favourite animals, btw. Ever since this movie. Great plot, fantastic characters(the hyenas, Timon and Pumbaa). Great, great, great, great. Also, one thing: Simba's just an ordinary lion cub so... HOW COME HE IS THE BEST SINGER I'VE EVER HEARD??!??!?!?<br/><br/>Scar's song was of course genius. The Hyena March was great to watch.

"friendbest128","10","0","0","20 September 2012"," A Timeless Classic
","The Lion King; another timeless classic by Disney. The heartwarming story of Simba will never escape our hearts. The Lion King is the story of Simba, a young cub whose trying to find his place in the world after the death of his father, Mustafa. This story is full of hidden meanings, emotions, metaphors and analogies that each person could take away something different from each viewing. It's hard to find flaws in such a work of art but the way that Disney rehashes scenes from other Disney movies is definitely one of them. They don't take away from the experience of the movie but it's something that a movie veteran could definitely notice."

One that can be seen at any time, over and again.<br/><br/>Essential family viewing. Perfect.

","PLOT: A young lion named Simba is the next in line to become king of Pride Rock. However, his father and current king Mufasa gets killed by his uncle Scar who then steals the throne for himself. Simba runs away from his past and leaves Pride Rock only to learn that you must face your past as well as learn from it.<br/><br/>MY THOUGHTS: The Lion King, in my opinion, will forever be Disney's greatest masterpiece. It teaches many powerful, serious, and mature life lessons to both the young and old. It does this through songs as well as dialogue between characters that talk about them in round about ways. An example is when Rafiki hits Simba with his stick and Simba says that even though it was in the past, ""it still hurts."" Rafiki then tells him that ""the past can hurt"" and that you have to choose to ""either run from it, or...learn from it.""<br/><br/>The songs in the movie are also very powerful. They also teach many lessons. The ones that stand out are ""Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", ""Be Prepared"", and ""Hakuna Matata."" <br/><br/>PROS / CONS: This film is very powerful and emotional. You learn so much from it and it is truly one of the best films ever made. The songs are outstanding and the voice talent is breathtaking. There are no cons in this movie because it truly is one of the best movies ever made-animated or otherwise.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10 *MUST SEE*"

"lasttimeisaw","8","0","0","28 May 2012"," The Lion King
","Who would believe this is my first time watch this classic Disney jewel in the crown and the location was ruefully in the plane. After last year's mega-successful re-entering into 3D multiplexes, clearly it becomes more urgent for me to cancel it from my unfinished masterpiece list (there are more horrifying ones on my list which I wish I could show it here). <br/><br/>THE LION KING is a timeless artwork, it's technical index could not remain its cutting-edge 2D advances in 1994, the story nevertheless is in perfect pitch for audience from every degree of ages, the HAMLET-inspired plot could feasibly find more evocation with adult groups while the colorful appealing is irresistible for youngsters. It's an archetypal win-win Disney Animation. The narrative is tightly intriguing, the O.S.T. is top-notch although I can hardly admit Elton John's voice is agelessly stunning but the tune of CIRCLE OF LIFE nostalgically strikes a chord to me (which serves as my initial introduction to the western pop music region). <br/><br/>Another great merit originates from Jeremy Irons' hypnotically appealing British accent, which has transferred so much vigor to his villainous character. Apart from the theatrical outline, the bona fide comedic parts are also generous, the highlight without question belongs to ""hakuna matata"", which has been elevated as a motto of life. <br/><br/>By far I could only give the film an 8 out 10, in the future maybe I can procure a second chance with at least a HD version (3D should be spared notwithstanding), THE LION KING is Disney's apex of its 2D journey, and its longevity will testify that animation is an inseparable part of the family tree of film history, and it will always stun us commercially, technically and artistically."
"kdnor2011","8","0","0","17 April 2012"," Pretty Good, but it has a few flaws.
","The Lion King seems to be the Disney animated movie that everyone absolutely loves. It is a movie that is absolutely perfect and can't be touched, there is simply nothing wrong with it. Now I actually didn't grow up with this film, I remember watching it once when I was little, and then the next time I remember seeing it was when I was seventeen. So do I like this film? Yes, I think it's a pretty damn good film, but it isn't my favorite animated movie of all time.<br/><br/>First, the animation is absolutely beautiful. This has to be some of the best 2D animation in the history of animation. The colors are bright and vibrant, and every aspect has detail. On a technical level this film is a masterpiece. But there is more to this film that works than just animation. The characters are likable too. The relationship between Mufasa and Simba feels like a real father-son relationship, and you feel sad when Mufasa dies. The villain is great in the first half, he's so great at being bad, and he's funny too. The romance feels genuine, and some of the songs are fantastic, my personal favorite being ""I just can't Wait to be King."" Now for some downsides, despite a lot of time given to the development of Simba's father, I can't even remember his mom's name. And while Scar was great in the first half, in the last half, he sort of became just a spoiled brat, which is pretty much what Simba was in the first half, Scar just became kind of bland. And Timon and Pumbaa are half and half with me personally, sometimes their funny, sometimes their just annoying.<br/><br/>There are a few other small nitpicks, but overall, this is a really good movie. It has great animation, great songs, a good message, and interesting characters, for the most part. And it does make me laugh at times. It may not be my favorite Disney movie, but it's still a really good film."

","This movie represents Disney; it is, in my opinion and in the opinion of many others, the best animated film ever made. Basically put, 'The Lion King' follows the adventures of Simba, a young lion who struggles to find his place in nature's 'circle of life'. His evil and greedy uncle, Scar, tricks Simba into thinking he killed his father and the young cub is forced to flee from his home and live a carefree life, away from all responsibility. But as he matures into a young adult, destiny calls him and Simba must confront his past in order to save his home and become the Lion King of the Pride Lands. What makes this movie so great is the timeless story, stunning animation and music that cannot be put into simple words. It is full of humor, warmth, and teaches many vital life lessons, which makes it great for kids. Seriously, if you are among the very few who haven't seen The Lion King, I suggest you see it and buy a copy of it while it is out of the Disney Vault.

"TheNorwegianRocker","9","0","0","9 October 2010"," The Lion King - A Majestic Masterpiece
","Animation movies have easy, but yet so hard premises to follow - it's got to be an easy story which children are supposed to manage to follow without problems, and it's got to be a positive message from it, too. Most animated movies have problems to follow those codes and at the same time recreate that guidelines into an interesting product. But ""The Lion King"" isn't one of those - it is an interesting story which will engage the whole family.<br/><br/>The young lion cub Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is prince of the kingdom of Pride Rock, but is naturally a little too naive and curious for his own good. The clever, power sick and evil Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons), who naturally wants the throne, is of course fast to recognize that. He works out a plan which succeeds - a plan which leads to king Mufasa's (voiced by James Earl Jones) death, and forces the scared Simba to flee the kingdom into exile, leaving his destiny as the king in the great Circle of Life. Scar becomes king and destroys Pride Rock by letting the lions and hyenas live together in so called ""harmony"". Simba is found by two highly eccentric creatures - minx Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane) and boar Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella).<br/><br/>Several years later, the older Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is still located in the jungle with his two friends, and is now a wild lion who lives of eating creeps living underneath rocks and has completely dislodged his past. But one day, Simba's best friend from Pride Rock, Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly), accidentally finds the three of them in her chase for hope. After reuniting with Nala, Simba realizes that it was a mistake to flee from his kingdom, and decides to return and thereby face his past. But it is too late to rebuild the destroyed Pride Rock to the idyllic kingdom it once was?<br/><br/>Yes, the plot is simple (and somehow borrowed from the classic Hamlet story) - a prince who is dethroned, flees, and thereafter returns to take it back and thereby save the kingdom. Yes, it is a cliché inspired message - to run from the past doesn't change anything and all that stuff. But then there's the most important thing - to create a main character which we as an attendance care for, and there's where The Lion King scores the most. Because, who doesn't care for Simba, a naive prince who was forced to flee from his own land, tried to forget his past, but still has the scars from it, never managing to entirely forget? You just HAVE to care for such a character, whether you want to or not, because most of us can somehow relate to his feelings.<br/><br/>You know how the story is going to end already before you even watch it. But still, we catch ourselves to get engaged in Simba's battle against time to find courage to once and for all meet his past. We get touched by the traditional love story between two childhood friends who casually meet again several years later. We cheer for the hero in his obligatory battle against his arch enemy. The story is really simple, but yet so genius.<br/><br/>I also have to praise the technical achievements in the movie. The animation is excellent (ah, the times where they actually DREW the animation pictures!), and I felt like I was in the story through the whole movie. The music is perfect for the story, it really gets us in the right mood.<br/><br/>The voice acting are also outstanding - especially the sophisticated bad guy (Irons), the indoctrinating father (Jones), the loyal, old school servant (Atkinson) and the funny annoying hyenas (Goldberg, Marin, and Cummings) are perfectly cast. But also the optimistic Sabella, the charming presumptuous Lane, and the believably depressed Broderick gives delightful impressions, even though the acting performances of course is second in line in such a movie. But point is, with so many enjoyable characters, a movie has to succeed. The key lies in story and characters, the rest of it comes almost automatically.<br/><br/>All in all, The Lion King isn't just among the best animated stories of all time, in my opinion. It's also among the best movies overall. Two thumbs up, and a well deserved 9/10 for this classic. The movie lives up to its name - it really IS majestic!"

Disney was at its high peak when the lion king came out and you can tell by the animation. The African style backgrounds to the colorful scenery makes this definitely Disney best film.<br/><br/>The characters and their voices were also breath taking. Who would have ever thought that James Earl Jones(Muffasa), Jeremey Irons(Scar), Nathan Lane(Timon), and Mathew Brodrick(Simba) plus many more could give a Disney character so much life. Also Scar is the the best Disney villain behind Maleficent Now the music is the best thing about the lion king. I love the soundtrack, its the best soundtrack of any Disney film, period. The score by Hans Zimmer is fantastic but the songs in the lion king by Tim rice and Elton john is fantastic as well. Personally I'm a big fan of Elton's 70 stuff and though i would hate the lion king songs but i loved it. My favorite songs in The Lion King were Be prepared, i just cant wait to be king and can you feel the love tonight (his version). Disney should really considered working with those 3 again instead of Jonas Brothers and Hannah Montana.<br/><br/>The Lion king is definitely Disney best film ever.

","Loosely shaped around the plot structure of William Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', Disney's 'The Lion King' follows Simba, a royal lion cub, in his life following the death of his father. Touching on friendship, identity and responsibility, 'The Lion King' is timeless, standing firm as one of the most popular Walt Disney Classics of its era.<br/><br/>More than fifteen years since its release the film requires no introduction, for so much of its content contributes to the now iconic imagery of the title. Its place in popular culture is certified, from the international adoption of the 'Hakuna Matata' philosophy (hopefully lacking the movie's connotations of life without ambitions) to its uplifting soundtrack, featuring classics composed by Sir Elton John such as the Academy Award-winning 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight?' (Best Original Song, 1994). There are undoubtedly many loyal fans of 'The Lion King' worldwide that can recite numerous pieces of the well-constructed dialogue, including the wise teachings of the shamanistic monkey Rafiki as well as the wisecracks of Timon and Pumbaa, the meerkat and warthog duo that introduce Simba to a life with 'no worries' following his exile. <br/><br/>As seen in the work of the studio prior to 'The Lion King', anthropomorphic animals are crafted with an endearing sense of the human condition that relates them to viewers in a more intimate manner, amplified here to a heavier degree by introducing the concept of family burdens. Emotions such as grief and loss add a poignancy to many scenes that goes unrivalled by live action productions, upholding the belief of many that animation is not at all a format, but simply one manner of telling a story. <br/><br/>'The Lion King' is inspirational on so many levels and in such varying contexts that it proves memorable to the diverse range of viewers that it already has, more than a decade since its initial release. Long live the King indeed. <br/><br/>10/10"

","From the amazing sunrise for Simba's birth to the incredible and breathtaking climax, Disney's The Lion King is not just an amazing animated film, it is one of the greatest movies ever made! It is the story of a young lion cub named Simba (voiced by Jonathan Taylor Thomas from ""Home Improvement"") who is destined and ""Just Can't Wait to be King"" of the jungle. After his father and king at the time Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones from ""Star Wars"", ""Field of Dreams""), is thrown into a wild stampede of wildebeests and killed by his evil uncle Scar (voiced by Jeremy Irons from ""The Time Machine""), Simba is thrown into exile by him and believed to have been killed by the hyenas. Then, he meets two hilarious characters that provide the comic relief to this dark film; a zany meerkat named Timon (voiced by Nathan Lane from ""Mouse Hunt"") and his kind warthog companion named Pumbaa (voiced by Ernie Sabella) and he adopts the ""Hakuna Matata"" lifestyle, while forgetting his true destiny; go back to Pride Rock, defeat Scar and restore the Circle of Life. Along the way, he reunites with childhood friend Nala (voiced by Moira Kelly) and meets a wise old baboon named Rafiki (voiced by Robert Guillame) that remind him of his true destiny and leads to one of the greatest climaxes you will see in any film. The Lion King has everything an animated feature should have: great story, nice songs, dynamic music score, amazing animation, memorable characters (my favorite is Pumbaa), an edge of your seat ending, and a life lesson that anyone can apply to their life. This movie also has in my opinion the best voice cast for any animated film. Lion King is a film that everyone should see and own for you and your family to enjoy (I still have my VHS Copy of the film). Not my favorite animated film (the honor goes to ""A Goofy Movie"") but definitely in the top 5! Rating: A roaring 10/10!"

","I think this movie was the first film I ever saw at the cinema. That was 15 years ago, and I was five years old. I was so excited about the whole film and I loved it. Today, I watched the film again. It still held the same magic, made me laugh and sad at the same time and I still love the soundtrack. Many films lose with time whatever it is that make them special to us, but this movie definitely isn't one of them. I heard people say that the story is to cheesy, but this is a Disney production, so what do you expect? Either you love those films, or you hate them. Other's say the storyline is badly developed. I just don't know what they're talking about. Sure: one knows how this film will end, but that doesn't make the story bad, considering the genre. The characters are well drawn, and the film holds a maturity that might be considered misplaced in a movie made for kids. But it isn't: there is a simple lesson you understand as a child, and a conflict in Simbas soul you will appreciate as an adult. I just can say that I still love this movie as much as I always did. Some of the reasons for this may be different now, but some of them are still the same, and I am very grateful that I can still enjoy some things I loved as a child just as much as an adult. If you haven't seen this film yet, you should give it a try. It wont disappoint you. If you've got children, they will have a great time watching this movie."

This was my favorite movie when I was like 8, and now I watch it over and over again but it never gets old. It had wonderful songs of the respected singer/ composer Elton Johnthat many of us may still know. There are also some moral values in it like respect, faith and acceptance of responsibility. It also shows the importance of family, friendship and love. This is a family movie that anyone would love and appreciate since it is funny and at the same time it made me cry at a lot of moments in which I'm not gonna spoil to you.<br/><br/>It's just the magic of the circle of life ruled by our one and only ""Simba!"""

","For so many years, this movie has held a very very special spot in my heart. It wasn't until I had found the movie on Youtube after nearly 8 or 9 years that I finally felt a massive force of good memories come rushing back into me.<br/><br/>To make a long story short, I love this movie, and I'm always glad to see how well recognized it is in the film world. As a child, like with a lot of Disney films, I didn't ever notice some of the deeper details in the storytelling, specifically, the connections to Shakespeare's Hamlet.<br/><br/>This movie had a wonderful story, a multitude of memorable characters, amazing songs (although what else could one expect from Elton John?) and an overall theme that can entertain both children and adults.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert once commented that ""Villains are some of the most memorable characters in a Disney film"". This is very true, especially when you see Scar, voiced very ingeniously by the brilliant Jeremy Irons. Scar is everything a villain should be: cool, calm, collected, devious, and conniving. In short, a villain needs to use his or her words to their advantage, not mindless violence like a slasher film villain.<br/><br/>Another notable aspect that makes this film stand out, is that it contains one of the most heart-wrenching scenes in film history. Even at the age of 17, nothing has changed. The scene where the lion cub Simba finds his father dead on the ground, and tries to wake him up (fitted with a very sad score by the amazing Hans Zimmer) made me cry when I was a small child, and it still does even at this bitter age. Nothing hurts worse than a child to lose a loved one, without ever having grasped the concept of death.<br/><br/>And of course, this movie would probably have been a little too dark, if it didn't have one of Disney's most beloved comedy relief duos ever: the wisecracking meerkat, Timon (voiced by the hilarious Nathan Lane) and his dimwitted warthog com padre, Pumbaa (also done very well by Ernie Sabella.) Clearly, they have been immortalized in the hearts of young children everywhere when the film was new, just as the film itself has.<br/><br/>All in all, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in modern film history, and for those that want to visit a better time through this movie, and for those that ave miraculously never seen it, I seriously recommend it to all."

","Simba learns about life through the wisdom of his father Mufasa whose brother is determined to be King of Pride Rock.<br/><br/>The most touching of Disney pictures? With its hard approach to the circle of life, rivalry amongst family and responsibility there is no doubt that this is one of the toughest for family viewing. This is far from a bad thing. Too many movie are made to entertain, to make you laugh for £6 a cinema ticket or £14 for a DVD. But every so often you see a film worthy of any price tag that really makes your head throb and your heart ache, and it is even better to see in a family movie.<br/><br/>Arguably, The Lion King has the best music score in Disney history with its Oscar winning score and memorable song ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" Opening the film we are entranced with the song ""Circle of Life"" which gets our blood pumping as we see animals arriving at Pride Rock to see the arrival of Simba, the future King.<br/><br/>Then the adventure starts. Simba's encouraging personality to be the best inevitably gets him into trouble and the hard drama starts with the encoding of evil Uncle Scar and a trio of horrible hyenas. After a heart stopping twist (the bravest and sentimental moment to ever emerge in a Disney picture) do we see ideologies of life, responsibility and revenge encoded, all there right in front of us, to be interpreted in numerous ways and is so convincing you would be forgiven for being quiet for the rest of the day.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by the heavy reflection of mature concepts as there is good humour, numerous entertaining protagonists and an action packed story. The use of these real life concepts is simply a splendid device to preach to the younger audience, to show them the point of life and its difficult issues, and what better way than a collection of likable characters and easy to understand story.<br/><br/>The plot is always consistent with frequent realism in context and the characters make for riveting viewing. Older audiences will appreciate Jeremy Iron's Scar whereas the younger viewers will take to the great comedy duo of Timon and Pumba.<br/><br/>The Lion King has been made a classic through its action packed narrative, its exciting characters and importantly its flinching depiction of real life"

I love ""Hakuna Matata"" and ""I just can't wait to be king"" the most. The other songs are also awesome. The song ""morning report"" is on the special edition and I think it added so much to the movie. ""The circle of life"" brings the African theme into the movie with all the chanting. ""Can you feel the love tonight"" brought romance and it a sense of tranquility. Things at Pride Rock were all going down hill but this song made me forget the bad things that are occurring and got me to focus on Simba and Nala. Last but certainly not least, ""Be prepared"" is the best villains song I've ever heard.<br/><br/>Johnathan Taylor Thomas did a great job as young Simba. That was my favorite character. I know every line to this movie i watch it all the time. (my relatives are getting sick of it because i watch it so much) But I don't care.<br/><br/>This movie is very original and a classic that will go on for generations.

","The lion king has always been one of my favorite animated films and after watching it again after more than a decade, I believe it always will be. A wonderful story about a young lion cub racked with guilt over his father's death, who runs away to escape the torment but ultimately overcomes it and resumes his place in the Great Circle Of Life. It is the struggles of Simba that make this a great movie, such as the love he has for his father, the sadness he feels from his death and the need to escape painful memories, the ultimate realization that you can't hide away forever, that life moves on and you must move with it and do what you know is right. Deep moral lessons are something lacking in today's films, especially those intended for children, and that is why TLK has had a lasting impression on movie viewers. This coupled with an amazing soundtrack and beautiful visual design makes The Lion King a timeless classic, and one I'd recommend to anyone, including adults. Definitely worth watching."

When Simba is still just a cub his father is killed in a stampede. His uncle Scar makes Simba believe that it was his fault. Then Scar tells Simba that he needs to run away and never come back. So simba runs away, and Scar sends some hyenas after Simba to kill him. Simba gets away from them, of course. Simba meets Timone and Puumba who take care of him. Simba grows up and meets an old baboon named Rafiki. Rafiki tells Simba that he knows his father. Simba doesn't believe him because his father is dead. There is a scene where the clouds take the shape of Simba's father and it says to him ""In forgetting me you have forgotten who you are."" Or something along those lines. After that Simba meets Nala, one of his old friends. She asks him to come back to Pride Rock with her. He says no. This movie is appropriate for all age groups. I really enjoy watching this movie.

The animation is stunning, and I thought the voice actors were all cast perfectly - especially Matthew Broderick as adult Simba, as well as Jeremy Irons as Scar. I know the quintessential tearjerking part is when Mufasa dies, but the part that always gets to me is at the end when Simba finally ascends Pride Rock and looks up into the clouds and hears his father say ""Remember...""

I was born in 1994 and i saw this film in November and it has been a stepping stone for my watching of Disney films.<br/><br/>This film had a burden on its shoulders. Of the 4 animated films released before 1994, 3/4 were huge, and three had Alan Menken, probably the best composer of our time. The 3 of 4 include Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin. Rescuers Down Under had flopped and lacked the feeling of a Broadway musical. Elton John and Tim Rice's songs were incredible! Circle of life and Hakuna Matata are my own favorites and both deserved the Academy award for Best song. This film was the last of the HUUUUUUGGGGGEEEE Disney films. Hercules, Pocahontas, and Hunchback of Notre Dame were good but did not par with this.<br/><br/>It opened June 24th to stunning critical acclaim and box office success, beating out Forrest gump. this film deserved the academy award for best picture like Beauty and the Beast did."

"Electrified_Voltage","9","0","0","12 October 2007"," Another excellent effort from Disney in the '90s!
","By the time this movie came into theatres, Disney had had at least two big hits with animated features in the early 1990s, which were ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"". Without a doubt, they then scored themselves another hit with ""The Lion King""! I was nearly eight years old when this film came into theatres, and I went to see it, which I think was the earliest theatrical movie experience I can recall, and it was a memorable experience, leading me to watch it more than once shortly after it came out on video! Rediscovering Disney recently, as with most of the others, I am still impressed with this one! <br/><br/>A lion named Simba is born in the Pride Lands in Africa. He is the son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi, so he is destined to become the next king of the land. However, his uncle, Scar, is jealous, and develops an evil plot to kill Mufasa and Simba, so he will become King! He manages to kill his brother, and convince his nephew that it's his fault, telling him to ""run away and never return!"" As Simba leaves, Scar sends the hyenas to kill him, but the young lion manages to get away. With Mufasa dead and Simba gone (with the others convinced he is dead), Scar is the new king, and the future of the Pride Lands is bleak! Meanwhile, Simba meets a meerkat named Timon and a warthog named Pumbaa, and grows up with them. Could he ever be persuaded to return and save the Pride Lands?!<br/><br/>The movie begins with a song called ""Circle of Life"", which makes for a great intro! Several other memorable songs (sung by the characters) follow, including ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", ""Hakuna Matata"", and ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" (a song which you hear Elton John's version of during the closing credits). Like in many other Disney films, there is a lot of humour, with several characters to provide it. In this movie's case, there's Zazu (voiced by legendary comedian Rowan Atkinson), as well as Timon and Pumbaa. Scar and the hyenas may not be quite as funny, but they provide some laughs as well. Some of the characters might be annoying at times (such as young Simba), but this isn't usually a problem. As usual, we also have excellent animation, and the story is well-written and often touching (this is not an adaptation of a story that came before it, unlike most animated Disney flicks). Clearly, Disney did it again with ""The Lion King"" in the '90s!"

","My Take: An instant animated classic with dazzling animation and unforgettable storytelling. <br/><br/>Success has not been new to the likes of Disney. But, as far as considering their latest works, ""The Lion King"" would be their biggest success. The 1990's are full of Disney's great works. Take ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Mulan"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Aladdin"" and others. But, as far as animated movies goes, the 1990's is the last year they'd be doing classics like this. Their future animated films mostly range from bad to average, no classics. But if they didn't make animated movies after the 1990's, ""The Lion King"" would chronicle their very success. This movie is done in exquisite sort of taste that makes it flawless as a classic. The animation is a breakthrough of Disney's first works, a well-animated scenery of the African wilderness that looks superbly astonishing, that it's almost looks like the Disney creators shot it there. The film also has human relevance. You know that the characters are animals, but they're made with so much appeal and effect, that they're almost human.<br/><br/>This will always be a favorite of mine, a story that's full of majesty and colorful that lacked in most of Disney's future animated movies lacked. Purely, it was a bit difficult for Disney to earn the viewers trust back with that appeal nowadays. Ironically, they're the only once who had the most of this appeal back when this was released.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","In the early 1990s Disney hit a revival in animation starting with The Little Mermaid, followed by the only animated best picture nominee, Beauty and the Beast, and reaching its peak in 1994. The Lion King was a marvelous achievement in animation and a worldwide phenomenon that remains to this day the greatest Disney animated film of all time.<br/><br/>The story is about a young lion cub, Simba, the only son of Mufasa, the king. His uncle, Scar, is jealous and greedy, and wants the throne for himself. In a Hamlet-like turn of events Scar kills Mufasa and takes over the kingdom as Simba is forced to live in exile. Simba must find his place in the world and let go of the past in order to regain the Pridelands from his evil uncle.<br/><br/>One of the highlights of any Disney movie is the music, and the Lion King is no different. Hans Zimmer won an Oscar for the background score, which is lively and exciting, obviously with some African influence. Tim Rice and Elton John wrote the songs. ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight"" also won the movie an Oscar, while two other songs were nominated. The voice work is fantastic. James Earl Jones provides authority and command for the king, Mufasa. Jeremy Irons plays the perfect villain, and also gets to show off his singing chops.<br/><br/>The animation comes to life in a way that is not just entertainment for the kids as so many animated movies are, but a real piece of art that anyone can enjoy.

","No matter what I try and say here it will all end the same way. ""The Lion King"" is the most beautiful and epic film Disney have ever made. Looking past the fact this was aimed at children (as Disney does) the story is one that could have been easily aimed at an older audience.<br/><br/>The plot focus' around Simba. A young lion cub destined to become king of the Pride Lands. He is happy and adventurous and can't wait to fulfil his role in the future. But things are never so rosy, especially when the clichéd evil Uncle (aka Scar) murders Simba's father, Mufasa and convinces Simba that its his fault and should run away (although Scar wants him dead just to make sure). What unfolds from this is a tale of adventure, friendship, torment, humour, love, responsibility and a full scale war to determine who will be king once and for all. Replace the lions with people and this could easily have been a 12. It's a tale that anyone can enjoy. I've loved it since i saw it in 1994 when I was 7.<br/><br/>The actors who star in ""The Lion King"" sure know how to do their job. They bring the characters to life in a way that seems special as well as real. Personally I don't think the acting has been anywhere near as perfect as this has in an animated movie. Matthew Broderick as an adult Simba especially. The way he conveys the feelings of anguish and guilt out of his character really hit home.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is probably one of the biggest reasons I love this film. Hans Zimmer's score fits every scene magnificently. It is what gave that feeling of an epic more than anything else. During the tragedy of Mufasa's death the score actually had tears in my eyes. OK I may have been 7 but even today i have to make an effort not to drop a tear. And the final piece where Simba heads to the peak of Pride Rock to take his place as King just had me with my jaw on the floor.<br/><br/>So overall. An epic masterpiece suitable for all. I'm off out now to buy the DVD and watch it again :D"

And it is understandable why many people still rave about it today. A storey that's so hard hitting you'll be struggling to hold back at least one tear, songs for your children to giggle to, and also not forgetting the characters and there humorous moments.

","Without doubt my favorite movie ever. Beautifully made, voice actors are just perfect (in the Finnish version) and the most important thing: the story is good. It's about facing your past and taking your place in life. And this little thing that still is important: the music. Hans Zimmer is definitely my favorite composer, and in The Lion King I always remember why. The mere music makes me cry, and add the movie itself: I'm crying my eyes off. I'm stunned that average rating for this movie in IMDb is only 7,8 out of 10. This movie is worth so much more. I have liked this movie ever since I saw it when I was a kid, but the older I become, the more I love it. I don't know a single person who haven't loved this movie once they've seen it. And that doesn't surprise me at all, Lion King is too touching to be ignored."

","The Lion King is a great film and I absolutely love it. Along with a a superb plot, terrific animation, a star cast of voices, there are the lessons that are learned from this film (despite being a slightly rough for the younger children). Like responsibility and honour and most importantly friendship.<br/><br/>I rank this animated film among the great films I have ever seen, even including such films as the jungle book and Pinocchio. Which are a part of the great Disney pantheon. But they really got back their magic with this film though, although they have now reverted to go going back to clichéd films again.<br/><br/>It was part of my childhood and it is a film experience I will always remember and show to my children."

Or that's what our young Simba thinks, but his uncle have others plans, and one day the only thing that never should had happened, happens and Simba is forced to leave everything, but can he escape his past?<br/><br/>The Lion King is, and will be the best animated 2D Disney movie of all time. You immediately love all the characters, and couldn't see the movie without one of them. They are funny, evil, good, interesting and more. Then we have the good music to fill your ears. Who hasn't song one of those song to them self? Cirkel of life makes you feel good, I Just Can't Wait to be King makes you a child again, Be Prepared brings your evil laugh forward just a few seconds, Hakuna Matata makes you want to relax even more, and just enjoy life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight makes you a little romantic for a while. And lets not forget the background music, which also is perfect for this movie. And then we have the fantastic animation, that just positively surprise you all the time. <br/><br/>So just see the movie, if you really haven't. Lion King the best Disney movie of all time."

","This is probably the best animated film of all time. The characters are endearing and the music is first class. The film is the ultimate in children's entertainment. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters of Simba, Timon and Puumba and Rafiki. You will find your self willing the characters on and being totally engrossed by the narrative as it takes you on a beautiful journey through the African savanna. Jeremy Irons is perfect as the villain Scar and the showdown between Scar and Simba is one of the best finales to a Disney film ever. This film is definitely one of the classics and is a must for all film lovers."

","I just watched the Lion King for the 30-something time. It's been a few years, and I have gotten way more into film since the last viewing. Therefore, I noticed how amazing this movie is.<br/><br/>The Lion King is the basic story of MacBeth (with a few differences, but same basic plot line)... A greedy man kills the king to take power. The deceased King's son seeks revenge after years of living on the lam.<br/><br/>The cinematic aspects of the film amaze me. The intro is among the greatest in any movie, animated or live action. The death scene nearly made me cry, and I knew what was going to happen, and I am an 18 year old male. And the ending, with the rain and all the animals and the song... I will not even try to recreate the experience with words... you have to see it.<br/><br/>In my opinion, no one should dislike this movie... it is a classic. It has probably the best music of any Disney move, save Fantasia.

Sometimes it'll jerk a few tears, other times you will be filled with glee and excitement.

","A young lion cub named Simba is told by his father Mufasa that he will be king after Mufasa dies. Mufasa's evil brother Scar wants to be king himself, so, with the help of his three hyena henchmen, causes a wildebeest stampede to kill him. Scar then tells Simba that he was responsible for Mufasa's death, and that he must run away and never come back to the kingdom. Simba runs away and meets meerkat Timon and warthog Pumbaa. He decides to stay with them for a long lazy life. When a childhood friend, Nala, tells him that Scar is ruining the Pride Lands, Simba returns to battle Scar and gain his place as king.<br/><br/>THE LION KING is considered to be one of Disney's best. It became one of Disney's money-making films. KING contains wonderful voice talent, with Matthew Broderick as Simba, James Earl Jones as Scar, Jeremy Irons as Scar, Rowan Atkinson as Zazu, Simba's friend, and Whoopi Goldberg as one of the hyenas. It has wonderful songs (including ""The Circle of Life"", ""I Just Can't Wait to be King"", and ""Hakuna Matata""). The animation is incredible, with computer animation at its best in the wildebeest stampede. Those are just some of the things that make THE LION KING a wonderfully entertaining film. KING was followed by two direct-to-video sequels, and was later turned into an excellent Broadway musical. KING was later re-released into IMAX theaters, digitally remastered with a brand new song, ""The Morning Report"". Recommended. 10/10."

","Not a lot to say because, simply, it can't be put into words. I was only three or four when this film came out, and never saw it at the cinema, but I remember watching it over and over again when I was younger - and loving it. For kids it's a perfect film, and on re-watching it a few days ago for the first time in years (and crying like an idiot at the age of fifteen) I can say that this, alongside The Shawshank Redemption, is my favourite movie of all time.<br/><br/>To people who watched it when they were younger, it's even better when you look back at it. Disney has an amazing subtlety in this film that makes the in-jokes of ""Shrek"" and other more recent offerings look outdated. It's beautifully drawn, beautifully executed, and makes you long for the good old days before 3D animation. Add to this a gorgeous score (the opening shot of 'Circle of Life', with the sunrise and the singing - which I think is Swahili - brings tears to your eyes) and an incredible storyline, and you get Disney's best film to date. On that note - it's been twelve years, and it's not aged at all. It's just got better."

","The Lion King, to me, is like no other movie. It's a movie that gets better every time you watch it, and one you never get sick of. A movie you can't stop watching, and one that you wish would not end, it is that good. It's a movie that both adults and kids can enjoy. The kids will enjoy young Simba's adventures and Timone and Pumbaa's jokes. The adults will enjoy those as well, but they will also enjoy the great dramatic Hamlet-like story, the music, and the great voice cast. The Lion King is a phenomenal movie and has something to offer for everyone.<br/><br/>The Lion King succeeds on every level. From it's award winning music to it's superb voice cast. Hans Zimmer does an excellent job with the score, causing me to have goosebumps at certain points in the movie. Elton John's talent for writing songs really shows in this movie with songs like, ""Can't Wait To Be King"", and Hakuna Ma Tatta."" After you see this movie you'll know why the music was award-winning.<br/><br/>Not only is the music good but the voice acting is superb. With James Earl Jones providing a commanding voice for King Mufassa, to Jonathan Taylor Thomas providing a high-pitched eccentric voice for young Simba. Matthew Broderick is excellent as well as adult Simba, and Jeremy Irons provides his devilish voice to the villain Scar fantastically. Rowan Atkinson is great also as the charmed Zazu, and Nathan Lane is hilarious as Timone.<br/><br/>The music and voice casting, as I mentioned earlier, aren't the only great parts movie, the plot shines just as bright, maybe even brighter. As I also mentioned before, The Lion King has a Hamlet-like story with a king who has a son that will one day will take over as king and rule the Pride Lands. The king though, has a jealous, mischievous brother who schemes against him in order to obtain the throne by killing the king, and his would-be king son. The son after surviving his uncle's plot to kill him, and after running away from the Pride Lands because he thought his father's death was his fault, must return to the Pride Lands and reclaim his rightful place as King.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of drama, to if not make you spout some tears, at least feel saddened by some elements of the movie. The movie also makes you laugh, and makes you happy. The Lion King even has romance in it, with Simba and his life-long friend Nala. The Lion King is the complete package that gives you everything. It is movie that you will not walk away disappointed from. To me, it's wonder why this isn't in IMDb's top 250, and it's also wonder why this movie didn't win Best Picture."

One could argue that Pocohantas or Mulan were at least reasonably well-made offerings,or that Tarzan,Hunchback of Notre Dame or Hercules were commercially successful(if perhaps uninspired treatments of much darker material),but still it wouldn't be able to blunt the fact that after THe Lion KIng,Disney animation was bound to disappoint,with films being cranked out more frequently,the onset of PIXAR and passable animation from 20th Century-Fox and Dreamworks. helped basically push Disney out of the top spot as full-length animation King.<br/><br/>The story is fairly well-known by now I thi9nk,but in case you weren't aware of this gem before,here goes: playful lion cub Simba(voiced by Jonathan Taylor THomas),whose is destined to be the next king of the jungle,lets his curiosity and gullibility get the best of him--due in no small part to the vile scheming of his evil Uncle Scar(voiced fantastically by Jeremy Irons)--and becomes unwittingly involved in Scar's plot to do away with his brother,the King Mufasa(Voice of none-better,JAmes EArl Jones). When he runs away away from the wild-lands due to guilt,he is adopted by a carefree odd-couple named Timon,a meerkat(voice of Nathan Lane,who can do more with voice expression alone than some actors can do with their whole bodies) and Pumba,a warthog(voiced by under-appreciated character actor Ernie Sabella). He grows up under their care(and gains the voice of Matthew Broderick) and plans to stay worry-free and happy until fate crosses him with his childhood friend NAla(voice of Moira Kelly).<br/><br/>Bouncy musical numbers from Elton John and Tim Rice,a nice, gentle,humored script by Irene Mecchi and Jonathan Roberts and directed by Roger Allers and Rob Minkoff make this animated film more than a kid-friendly treatment of Hamlet. (If memory serves,I believe Mr.Minkoff went on to direct and/or produce the Broadway production as well) The musical numbers may be approaching saccharine sweet and the plot and characters may seem all too familiar now,but it's still quality entertainment,pure and simple.

","While Lion King was shamelessly ripped off from Osamu Tezuka's ""Kimba the White Lion"", it is in my opinion the best animated film that Disney has ever released. It was well-paced, had excellent character development with a good mix of characters, a great plot, a believable and charming villain, and an absolutely stunning original score.<br/><br/>Unlike many of Disney's later animated films such as Atlantis, the Lion King's plot progress did not feel rushed (nor is it slow), and does not suffer from the bizarre and difficult to describe ""caricature personality"" that appears to be growing in popularity with many recent animated films and children's cartoon series.<br/><br/>The extended version mostly includes material which Disney was wise to omit from the original release. These new additions, for example, ""Morning Report"", were largely uninspired and I feel they actually detract from the movie. I would recommend that new viewers first see the original, ""unextended"" edition first, and draw their own conclusions.<br/><br/>While some disliked the movie for its use of all non-human characters, or for the use of ""inter-family felicide"", I would rate this a 10/10 and call it one of the 3 or 4 Disney films which truly deserve their over-used moniker of ""masterpiece."""

Some lines in the movie are very deep and have a lot of meaning. The story ends with a great moral and it is also enjoyable for children.<br/><br/>The story starts as Mufasa, the king, is celebrating his sons birth. All the animals come to see Simba honored. As simba grows up he learns about the good and bad of everything. He is warned not to go to the dark places aka elephant graveyard. but like any young child he goes. he almost gets killed but is saved. we learn that his uncle Scar is trying to have Simba and Mufasa killed do he can be king. Later Simba is caught in a stampede and Mufasa is killed while saving him. Scar convinces simba its all simbas fault and he should run away and never return. Simba does so leaving Scar the king. Soon there home is taken over by Scars followers the hyenas and things get bad. but Simba has found a new life living care free with his new friends Timon and Pumba. He doesn't think twice about his former home until his old friend Nala tuns into him while searching for food. Nala trys to convince him to come back and be king but Simba refuses.

About forgetting the past, it may hurt but you learn from it. Anyways Simba goes back and conquerers Scar and tells everyone the truth about what happened to Mufasa. Simba takes over and soon things go back to the way they were. the last seen is Simba and Nala celebrating the birth of there first child the same way simba was celebrated. Thus the Circle Of Life.<br/><br/>the movie is a true classic. The songs will be remember and the characters will live in our hearts forever."

","I remember seeing this movie for the first time when I was about maybe 6 or 7. I loved it from then on. The funny thing is that I never got it on VHS. I never really understood it's main message before because I was too young. But now I'm 15 and the pieces come together. If you look at it carefully and study the movie, it is basically telling how we live today. How we tend to lose ourselves and forget who we are. How we forget what we are meant to live for and why we are here in the first place. How we are all equal in this circle of life under one God. This movie has one main message, ""Finding your true self, and discovering where your meant to be"". It's truly an inspiring movie and the soundtrack to it is amazing. The Lion King, in my opinion is one of the best of all time. My birthday is in about a week and I was thinking of getting it on DVD. It's amazing how a simple animated Disney movie can have that deep meaning to it and can have that much of an impact and inspiration on someone."

","The Lion King is a great movie. Its great storyline, catchy songs, and beautiful artwork are what define it. This seems not to be fully appreciated by everybody. It is obviously directed towards younger audiences with the songs and the characters, which seems to tear out all the interest from people as they are watching this, while they ask themselves ""What am I watching?"" Let me assure you, if you can see past the ""child-ness,"" you may truly get a chance to appreciate this film. And let me tell you, you will like it.<br/><br/>The story for The Lion King is incredibly complex for a Disney story.<br/><br/>Mufasa is the ruler of Pride Rock, and after he passes away, Simba will be king. Mufasa does pass away after a stampede caused by his uncle, Scar, and Scar convinces Simba it was all his doing. Simba flees the kingdom in search of a new life, until he is called back by his friend, Nala.<br/><br/>The Lion King is not the first movie to deal with romance, but one of the first movies to deal with guilt and jealousy. The Lion King is sort of a ""child's first drama"" as I like to think of it. Dramatic as it is, The Lion King is easy to pay attention to, unlike most dramas. Perhaps many other dramas could have taken after that.<br/><br/>I do believe that it was based on Hamlet, but even if it did copy Hamlet, it did a very impressive job.<br/><br/>This will entertain for generations.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>Good: Dramatic, well-drawn, good songs and funny<br/><br/>Bad: Well, some people might think that they're ""too cool"" to watch it.

","Personally I think The Lion King is one of the best Disney films ever. Its a shame Disney is not that popular today in the 0's (with Shrek and CGI animation taking over the screen- i'm not criticising Shrek its great!) TLK can be seen as a modern day version of Shakespeares' Hamlet. A brother (Scar) kills his king brother (Mufusa), Simba the future king (Hamlet) listens to the advice of his father's spirit. I first saw TLK when I was in primary school at the age of six and it made me cry! I watch it now with my younger sisters and still think its a masterpiece. TLK is a great movie because of the songs and the animation(its more clear bright compared to the older Dinsey classics.) It also has memorable characters with a great cast, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, Matthew Broderick. I do not think its sequels can beat it but they are still good. Timon and Pumbaa light up the screen and its the first Dinsey film to contain more action. (Fight scenes). TLK is my favourite Disney animation as it was of the first films I saw in the cinema, its more personal as I can relate it to my childhood memories. 10/10 for children 9/10 for adults 9/10 for me.

","The Lion King is one of my favorite Disney movies(up there is The Fox and the Hound and Bambi, of course).<br/><br/>The story of a young lion cub named Simba who was banished when he was told from his uncle that he had killed his own father. The story goes along with him meeting some fun characters named Timon and Pumba. I'm sure many of you have seen it, but I won't give away the ending anyway.<br/><br/>It's filled with beautiful artwork and great characters.<br/><br/>Of course, I do have my dislikes about this film as well. Though they never admitted it, Disney has copied off of a show called Jungle Taitei(The Jungle Emperor) and renamed Kimba the White Lion in the United States. It is a 1960s show from the mind of Osamu Tezuka. Many things from the show and from The Lion King are quite similar. Go look for yourself! But, of course, I love The Lion King as I saw it before I had ever heard about Kimba. I love them both very much, and though I am saddened at the thought of Disney stealing (even though they never really admitted to stealing it) it is a great movie everyone should see!"

","If Walt Disney himself had ever attempted an animated Hamlet, he wouldn't have gotten any better than The Lion King.   Disney Feature Animation richly crafts a morality tale that doesn't seem preachy, yet tells us of how we are all connected in a greater ""Circle of Life.""  A tour-de-force vocal cast includes the amazing voice of James Earl Jones, the ever so human voice of Matthew Broderick, the vicious, sarcastic and calculated voice of Jeremy Irons, and the humourous antics of Nathan Lane.  A fantastic collaboration of superstar songwriter Elton John and veteran lyricist Tim Rice produces some great Disney tunes.  With very likable heroes and villians, attention to mood and detail, and alive without missing a tribal beat of native Africa, The Lion King stands proudly and roars, loudly. <br/><br/>

My love of ""The Lion King"" probably also relates to my passion for literature and enjoyment of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet, Prince of Denmark"" on which Lion King was loosely based. A prince alone, commanded by the ghost of his betrayed father, must reclaim his kingdom and set his corrupt uncle straight: perhaps one of the most fascinating of Shakespeare's concepts.<br/><br/>Though I am somewhat annoyed by the ""new age"" views presented in ""The Lion King,"" I have always found this film amusing, the music good, and the animation colorful.

","The Lion King is considered by most people to be Disney's greatest achievement. Personally, I feel its 2nd behind Beauty and the Beast.<br/><br/>What makes lion King so successful is the plot. It is a incredible story that shows the life of Simba evolving from a young mischievious cub into a powerful lion that becomes King. ""Scar"" Jermy Irons voice is one of the greatest villains in any movie, and is probably Disney's greatest villain. Pumba and Timon are very sweet characters that help drive both comedy and light heartedness that is definitely needed after Simba runs away once he feels he was the one responsible for his father Mufasas death. The father son relationship is wonderful and tender at the beginning of this film. If you really look at this movie, you see you're dealing with very adult themes; Greed, envy, murder and birth. The success of the Lion King is strongly connected to the score written by Elton John. Disney has tried to recreate this genius in other films with Phil Collins and others but it doesn't quite work. This is one of disneys masterpieces and every child an adult need to revisit this story time and again.<br/><br/> My Grade- A<br/><br/> I give it 10 out of 10 for a childrens movie<br/><br/> I give it a 9 out of ten for an adult movie"

"danjakubik","Null","0","0","10 February 2004"," Bambi set in Africa
","""The Lion King"" (1994) is the third better than average Disney film of the 1990's. This is Disney's first film to use an original story instead of the usual classic fairy tale. However the story follows much the same path as all other Disney stories: the hero or heroine is without one parent. ""The Lion King"" is best described as ""Bambi"" set in Africa. The opening sequence of the film is very impressive: the music, African vocals and animation! Though the rest of the film is not quite up to it's great beginning, it's certainly a very good film overall. ""The Lion King"" also marks the first time an on screen death is shown in an animated Disney film. Excluding the opening, this makes for the other most impressive sequence in the film.<br/><br/>As with ""Aladdin"" (1992), Disney again uses contemporary dialogue to make the film more appealing to their target child and pre-adolescent audiences. Though this weakens the film a little, I believe it was one of the factors that made ""The Lion King"" a huge success. The other factor was that it contained only animals, no humans, which certainly appeals to children. ""The Lion King"" was written by three screenwriters. Instead of having a completed screenplay, prior to beginning animation, the story was created as the film was being made.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" features excellent animation and an excellent music score by Hans Zimmer. The character voices are very good (as usual for Disney). The companion characters to Simba (Pumba and Timone) are entertaining.<br/><br/>
""The Lion King"" suffers from one major flaw: it's a little preachy and moralizing (more than other Disney films based on fairy tales). Without the preachy, moralizing tone and less contemporary dialogue, ""The Lion King"" would have been an excellent film."

","I have a friend, whose opinion I value, who reacted to my enjoyment of The Lion King by saying, ""You mean the animated movie? I don't watch animated movies. I'm an adult.""<br/><br/>I don't understand that idea. And the more I see The Lion King, the more I just feel like that friend is being left behind in the cold. King is a beautifully animated work of art, so much so that you could randomly freeze almost any second of the film and have a cell worthy of framing.<br/><br/>King also features some of Disney's best vocal performances. Not just one over-the-top Robin-Williams-esque showcase, but hilarious turns by Whoopi Goldberg and Cheech Marin, a wicked performance from Jeremy Irons, a wise and understated performance by Robert Guillame. James Earl Jones' voice is spot-on perfection. Let's face it, how good must the OTHER performances be when the excellent Matthew Broderick goes practically unnoticed? <br/><br/>So the animation is a feast for the eyes, the performances are first rate... that leaves the story. Some simplify the plot by calling it ""Hamlet,"" which is mostly accurate, but as with all great animated Disney films there is a theme to the movie which pervades its most powerful scenes and provides an added weight for the adult audience. It's not for me to say what the theme of King is, but it's there for the viewer to pick up. In my opinion to accomplish a mix of child-pleasing spectacle, clever humor, brisk pacing and a most grown-up thematic in 90 minutes is a far greater accomplishment than most films achieve. Most films don't achieve their stated goal, i.e., to be a thriller or a mystery, much less introduce deeper levels of storytelling.<br/><br/>Does being an adult mean we should pay to watch Adam Sandler mug his way through another brainless, sophomoric comedy? For my money The Lion King is ten times more adult, more sophisticated, more entertaining and more satisfying. When time allows The Lion King to be compared on its own merits and without the cultural trappings of feeling contemporary, I think it will be said to be a far greater accomplishment than most of the Disney films currently considered their best.

"0britton","Null","0","0","25 June 2003"," Great movie, but purists should avoid the special edition...
","Rather than add to the multitude of great reviews already on this site, I thought I might give my opinion about something a little different... ...I just recently watched the Special Edition version of The Lion King, and nearly had to turn it off while watching their latest ""addition"".<br/><br/>Before I go any further, I should say that I've never been a huge fan of the musical numbers in Disney movies. Especially in their more recent films, they've always seemed kind of forced. It's as if they were put in simply because there's a Disney formula the filmmakers are expected to adhere to, not because anybody felt they would better the film. Despite these feelings, I've never had too many problems with the songs in The Lion King. I tolerate them, and even find myself humming them from time to time. But what they've added has got to go, it's entirely unnecessary!<br/><br/>!Spoiler Alert!<br/><br/>Touted as their ""added scene, with new music!"", this little addition has really made me angry! Entitled ""Morning Report"", this number replaces probably one of my more favorite scenes in the early parts of the film - the pouncing lesson. Rather than hearing Zazu's muffled voice from off screen while Mufasa teaches Simba to hunt, we're treated to a fully fledged musical number. In a monotone singing style that reminds me of something out of My Fair Lady (""Why can't the english...""), Zazu describes completely inconsequential incidents happening on the savana. Simba even manages to get a few verses in before the number ends. Afterwards, the movie hastily picks up where it left off, the rythym and gravity of Mufasas words about the circle of life completely eliminated.<br/><br/>The result: those who are familiar with the film will spend the first 30 seconds confused as hell - ""What the?...I totally don't remember this"", followed by another two minutes of disgust - ""Now we know why this didn't make it into the original cut"". What's worse, newcomers to the film will get so caught up in the new song that they'll completely lose sight of the previous scene, arguably one of the more important parts of the film. Mufasa's monologue about the Circle of Life is essentially the thesis for the film, and as such should be emphasised, not undermined.<br/><br/>
Sorry for the ramble folks. I genuinely love this movie, it's easily amongst my top ten. The art and animation is fantastic, the storyline & characters are great (despite complaints about it being ripped off from Shakespeare or Kimba the White Lion. Though, parallels between TLK and Hamlet elude me) Hans Zimmer's oscar winning score is one of my favorites, and the casting of the voices is perfect (Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones fit their roles like a latex glove). It's for all these things and more that I love this film, so thus it's because of all these things that I hate to see it modified. Call me a purist, but I believe that once somebody is done making a film, especially one as successful and widely appreciated as The Lion King, they should leave well enough alone. Naturally, the choice to disagree with me is entirely yours, this is only my opinion afterall... ...Don't even get me started on what they added to Beauty & The Beast. What's next, Genie singing about what he'd do if Aladdin were to free him? Ugh..."

Also the appearance of Jeremy Irons (Simon in Die Hard 3), James Earl Jones (Darth Vader in Star wars III, IV, V and VI) and Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) as Scar, Mufasa and Zazu is clearly one of the best casting ever, not to mension Whoopi Goldberg as Shenzi. Also there are great songs (like ""I just can't wait to be kings"" (my favourite because of Niketa Calame's beautiful singing voice)) and touching moments (Mufasa's death and his spirit in the skies etc). Two thumbs up!"

","The Lion King is a film to grabs you from the very first breathtaking scene, not just because of the amazing animation or music but because it is just a beautiful movie. Movies based around animal characters can often leave you dissapointed, as the stories while often sad fail to create any sense of raw emotion or realness. However, with the Lion King there is something about the characters which makes you fall in love with them or hate them which is created through more than cute appearances and evil tricks or strained attempts at arousing sympathy.<br/><br/>The movie doesnt try to completely mask all the not so cuddly things about the animals which can be really annoying in other films. Yes lions hunt and eat other animals ..... I think we are all smart enough to acknowledge that, and it only adds to the overall effect of realness to the movie.<br/><br/>I am no expert on films, but what I can say is that someone did something right because I have to admit that I cried more in this movie than any movie I've ever seen. I know making you cry doesnt make a movie good, but if you think talking animal movies are a crock of **** I strongly suggest you watch The Lion King, because even if it isn't quite the Godfather it is a very moving and enjoyable movie"

The whole landscape is right in your face in an IMAX theatre, you can almost feel a part of the jungle. <br/><br/>I still don't think I will be queueing up to see Disney's next multi-million dollar kids flick (and no doubt a multi-million dollar tie-in with a burger chain) but more than anything I do think it is a massive achievment on my part, having managed to avoid The Lion King for 9 years, and in a sad soppy kind of way, I almost regret that!

","The Lion King is a truly amazing product of animated film-making. The characters and the surroundings are as beautifully drawn as ever, the voices have been well chosen and the music is good, but apart from all that, there is something special about this film. You are probably wondering what I am talking about, well I'm talking about the story and the way in which it was brought to the screen. The story, although being some sort of the typical good versus evil story is great. There is some real character depth and emotion in the story and it is brought to the screen in such a wonderful way, that I (21 years of age) actually shed a tear or two. Since I do not shed tears easily watching a film, I found it even more astonishing, that this animated feature succeeded in making me do so. The Lion King is not the kind of animated film that will make you burst out in laughter a lot, but rather an enchanting and moving story of love, loss and betrayal. If you want to laugh your heart out, you really ought to search for another film, but if you want to see a film that will touch and move you, go and see The Lion King. You'll enjoy it and even if you don't, I know I did.<br/><br/>

"smashattack","10","0","0","25 October 2002"," Still remains a favorite.
","My previous comments on The Lion King were inadequate.  Therefore, I am writing a newer, better review.<br/><br/>The Lion King has always been a favorite of mine.  Sadly, I missed it in theaters, but once it came out on video I watched it like a maniac.  My young eyes could not be torn from the screen and I would watch it nonstop. It was like an obsession.<br/><br/>But now I'm a little older and can think about it a little better.  The Lion King has some great things, but some flaws as well.<br/><br/>Spoilers.<br/><br/>The animation is really good, especially for its time.  It used some CGI (although probably not as much as I'd liked) to add some good effects, but mostly relied on hand-drawn animation.  Everything moves rather smoothly, and one cannot complain about its vivid color.<br/><br/>I really like the plot.  The young cub is tricked into believing he killed his own father and is sent into exile.  He must then return to face his uncle Scar, who has taken the throne.  It's a great plot, with several sub-plots that build up rather well, such as Timon and Pumbaa's friendship.<br/><br/>The cast is well-chosen.  James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas, Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, and even Moira Kelly. What more could one ask for?  Each actor/actress does excellently, taking on their characters with a near perfection that still dazzles me to this day.<br/><br/>The music is excellent.  Then again, I love just about anything done by Hans Zimmer.  He is such a great composer.  The Lion King has several great themes that add to the mood of the movie.  I don't care much for the songs, but some of them aren't bad.<br/><br/>All in all, The Lion King is another animated flick not just for children. It has the qualities of an adult movie.  Death, pain, suffering, friendship, and conflict.  There is no reason an older person would feel uncomfortable watching it (with the exception of the songs... ugh).<br/><br/>I really recommend The Lion King to any avid movie-goer.  It's something you shouldn't miss."

"cjmax21","10","0","0","18 July 2002"," Is this Disney at its best? Absolutely!!
","Oh my goodness! The Lion King is in my opinion the best Disney animated film ever. Although films such as Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin come close, The Lion King outdoes them all and in one word can be described as ""incredible"". Sometimes, I wonder why Disney can't make more movies like this one because there have been many good movies made in recent years, but none of them have all the elements like animation, music, etc. like The Lion King does. Every bit of this film from the grand beginning to the last was outstanding! First, the voices to match the characters were right on. Matthew Broderick, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, and Rowan Atkinson delivered and really brought life to the characters. Unlike most Disney films, The Lion King also brought humor to a new level with Timon and Pumbaa. Watching these two characters make me want to watch this movie over and over again and soak in every line to the point I can memorize it. The plot also was superb. There was never a dull moment in the film and during the film, I found myself in awe because I could relate to some of the characters so well. That is another reason why I found The Lion King thrilling is because it portrays a major theme of knowing who we are and living out our lives the way we feel that can benefit others. That is why I find this film so moving. Lastly, the score composed by Hans Zimmer left me in awe. All the songs really were great and helped the story flow so smoothly. So overall, I strongly recommend you either purchase The Lion King is you haven't already or just rent it because I almost guarantee there will be moments where you think, ""wow, this is Disney at its best"

Madge Sinclair was also great as Mufasa's queen,Sarabi,who's probably the most interesting character in the film; she endures even after her world is ripped apart and we love her for it. Sinclair's death robbed us of a great actress. The one thing I would've changed: Sarabi should have killed Scar,not the hyenas.

","To begin with a little side note, it didn't dawn on me until recently that Matthew Broderick and Nathan Lane both did voices in this film. Perhaps it was a foreshadowing of their later success on Broadway in ""The Producers"". But that's off the topic. Even though ""Producers"" is a great musical, I'm here to talk about ""The Lion King"", a great animated musical. To get this video was my most fervent wish for my birthday on the year it came on video. I had missed it in the theater, and I absolutely had to have the video as a result. I wasn't disappointed! Although it's not as great as, say, ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""Aladdin"", it's still a movie that I enjoy watching now as much as I enjoyed watching it then. Timon and Pumbaa have to be my favorite characters; it's kind of sad now thinking that they were the last ""comic"" sidekicks in a Disney movie who were truly funny. It was probably due to the fact that Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella just made such a good team. Scar and Mufasa made the perfect ""Claudius and Old Hamlet"". Jeremy Irons and James Earl Jones did a wonderful job with these two. As always, Disney's high artistic standards were upheld, giving the African jungle all its different facets, from majestic Pride Rock to the eerie Elephant Graveyard. And with Elton John composing the music, how could they go wrong? (As long as he wasn't rehashing any of his old songs...) Overall, ""The Lion King"" is a great Disney film, wonderful to watch when one is losing faith in the Disney of today as a reminder that yes, they are capable of good moviemaking."

I'm sad to have to say that Disney's efforts the last six to seven years have failed to live up to the lofty standards that their predecessors set.  The Little Mermaid, Beauty And Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King raised the bar so high that Disney may never reach that height of greatness ever again.<br/><br/>The Lion King is a tremendous movie with a great story, incredible animation and a wonderful voice cast including James Earl Jones, Whoopi Goldberg and and my personal favorite Cheech Marin, who I thought Disney would never allow in one of their movies, but then again many people probably thought the same way about Eddie Murphy and then he's featured in Mulan so go figure!

","Ah, '94.  One year I'll always remember.  I made one of my best friends, who I would get together with and promote the Street Fighter series and cut on Mortal Kombat.  Beavis and Butt-head had a huge following.  Any movie Jim Carrey starred in would get my money.  Nintendo dropped their 'squeaky-clean' policy with the release of MK2.  Oh yeah, and Disney made one of their best movies, ""The Lion King"".  <br/><br/>An animalistic 'Hamlet', this movie (if you don't know by now) is about a lion cub named Simba, who 'just can't wait to be king.'  His uncle Scar has other plans, killing good king Mufasa and blaming it on his nephew.  After some time in exile, Simba, along his childhood friend/betrothed lover Nala, exile friends Timon and Pumbaa, and wise old Rafiki, sets out to right the wrongs.  <br/><br/>The music, while not as memorable as, say, ""Aladdin"", is great.  (Howard Ashman died before this movie was made, may he rest in peace.)  It kept me going for a long time.  As a result, I like Elton John's music.   <br/><br/>
Timon and Pumbaa kept the laughs coming.  (Don't bother with that Saturday Morning cartoon they had, it doesn't do this movie any justice.  A lot of its humor felt very contrived.)  Like the Genie in Aladdin, who doesn't appear until two-thirds of the film, Timon and Pumbaa also work.<br/><br/>One of the better, more memorable Disney animated movies.

","Disney movies are known to be brilliant, and although I haven't seen a lot of them, I know enough to know, that 'The Lion King' is a true Disney masterpiece!<br/><br/>The movie is all about the animals that live in the African plains and the Circle of Life. We meet adventurous cub Simba (Jonathan Taylor Thomas/Matthew Broderick) who 'just can't wait to be king'.<br/><br/>Unfortuantely, this isn't going to be easy as Simba's Uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) has his heart set on becoming the new king, and little does Simba know, it was Scar that really killed his dad, Mufasa (James Earl Jones).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast featured are Rowan Atkinson ('Mr. Bean') as Zazu and Whoopi Goldberg ('Sister Act') as one of Scar's hench-hyenas.<br/><br/>A beautiful movie with amazing graphics, a wonderful soundtrack (thanks to Tim Rice and Andrew Lloyd Webber) and an excellent storyline. 8/10 (Followed by The Lion King II: Simba's Pride, and the spin off series 'Timon & Pumbaa'.)"

","The Lion King has proved to be Disney's most successful film at the box offices and what many think, their best film yet. I loved the whole era between The Little Mermaid and Pocahontas (which also included Aladdin and Beauty and the Beast), I really think Disney were at their best then. After Pocahontas the movies started to lose a bit of that special Disney charm that all Disney movies should have (not that I didn't enjoy them).<br/><br/>
The Lion King is Disney's first original story and they must get an extra applause for that, this was their first story that wasn't based on anything else and look how wonderful it turned out! And of course with the splendid voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson (or as many know him- Mr. Bean), Whoopi Goldberg, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, Jonathan Taylor Thomas and of course Ernie Sabella and Nathan Lane as the wonderful Pumbaa and Timon who can go wrong?<br/><br/>The Lion King is definitely a memorable movie that you or your children will not forget for a long long time. The animation is superb, the backgrounds and views (before Scar took over) just make you wish you could be on a safari in Africa. The songs (which include Oscar winning- Can You Feel The Love Tonight?) add so much to this brilliant and unforgettable  motion picture."

","As I'm listening to the new bootleg Billy Corgan I am reminded of the greatness of The Lion King.  That movie sparked something deep and emotional in me.  This may sound corny, (and believe me it is,) but within the first 10 minutes of that movie I had tears.  It was very emotional and dramatic because all the wildlife was there and they were there to witness the newborn baby. Somehow I had tears at this display of Disney beauty.  This movie remains my favorite of all time Disney flicks because there is deep meaning. The deep meaning lies within the plot of Simba searching for meaning to his own life. This incredible soul-searching journey that Simba embarks on reflects our own journeys within our lifetimes.  We all have times in our lives where we must figure things out and Disney really sends a message for future generations that problems can be solved through determination and heart. Not to mention his sidekicks, Timon and Pumba, who are straight up hilarious.  Also who could forget Whoopie Goldberg.  A movie isn't a movie without Whoopie, (pun intended.) However, the movie is one of my favorites, it even surpassed The Little Mermaid.  The flick is great for children with laughs and pop music, performed by Elton John.  The Lion King is also great for adults who seek a little humor to get away from the daily grind.  Anyway you dig it the movie is fun and fabulous. Great movie, great friends, great fun."

","This movie is so popular that many people are calling it Disney's best. It is a great and energizing movie, but it is hardly the best. Overall, the movie does its job right, and it does it well. It's dramatic. It makes you laugh, and it makes you cry. But take a look at the story. It's thin, short, and rather shallow. And the main character does hardly anything to further the plot of his own story. A lot of time is filled with the usual bad humor and big songs. I'm not saying The Lion King is a bad movie. Pocahontas was a bad movie. For the most part, The Lion King makes up for this flaw by having a certain scope and grandeur and an incredible ambience and score. But an average story hardly makes The Lion King one of Disney's greats. How do I know? The Lion King, too, used to be my favorite. Then as it got older and I saw more and more Disney movies, The Lion King's charm faded. In fact, two quiet little classics, The Fox and the Hound and Bambi, were the first animated movies to bump The Lion King off my favorites list. Those have much stronger stories and are what I believe to be great Disney. For The Lion King, I give it an 8."

","First off, I wanted to write about something other than what I thought about <The Lion King>. However, since I liked the movie so much, maybe I should just spend a few sentences *first* on the film overall. It was a great kid's flick, because of the songs that seemed to ring ""hit song"" all around(!). The animation , while being at the time more innovative than ever at capturing realism in Disney animatations, was still lively and colorful enough(more lively than the latter <Pocahontas>, which I still love for other reasons) for the kiddies.<br/><br/>   Now, to my point. About housewives. Actually, about certain housewives that have NOTHING better to do than to criticize. You've probably already heard that a bunch of ""at-home mothers""(maybe this is the PC term nowadays) wouldn't let their kids watch <Lion King> when it came out, because it contained explicit sexual content.<br/><br/>    If you don't already know, it's the part when Pumba, Timone, and Simba are discussing what stars are, and Simba tells them they're kings who are looking down on us, or something, and the other two laugh. Then Simba walks over to a cliff, looks up, then throws himself down, upheaving some dust. As it rises, it spells the word ""SEX"", for a split second.<br/><br/>   OK, now I'm not saying this is normal, nor do I know (or want to know) what they drew this for, but come on! Saying this is bad for kids?! Believe me, these women must've been really looking, 'cause it's virtually impossible to catch.

","When this first came out, I was so impressed I saw it several times.  It still remains one of my favorite movies and nearly everyone I've ever met who has seen it regards it highly.  That said, it is somewhat surprising to me that more people do not recognize that The Lion King owes about as much to Hamlet as it does Orwell's Animal Farm.  Here's why. (SPOILERS)<br/><br/><br/><br/>The herd of wildebeasts utilized by Scar appear to represent mindless masses of general populace.  By themselves they are essentially harmless, but properly (or improperly) rallied, they can even succeed in overthrowing an entire government.  The hyenas who are conned into scaring them seem to stand for basic undesirable elements plaguing society today (the alluring culture of the street, corrupt law enforcement officials, possibly irresponsible journalistic practices).  The movie also makes a strong point that when these individuals are allowed to roam freely in society, inevitably the same vices plaguing their territory (elephant graveyard - perhaps alluding to the inner cities of many major cities... at least in the U.S.) will befall everyone else as well.  Note the strong resemblance of the rock formation at the end of ""Be Prepared"" to skyscrapers found downtown in any large city.  For these and other reasons, it's not too much of a surprise that The Lion King was criticized for racist overtones.  Still, if you can put this aside, and haven't seen it by now, The Lion King remains the most stunning and complex films in animation history"

It's the typical revenge-and-vendetta-plot: A son makes the killer of his father pay for the dead. But a closer look shows that there is more. Simba doesn't want to avenge his father at first. He ran away since he was sure his dad's death was his fault. But out in the jungle he learns his lesson: He - as the prince - has responsibility for his people, and that's what I think is the hidden message in this movie: You can't run away from your responsibility, you must face it with all the consequences and you must do what this responsibility demands from you. For me, that's what the opening song wants to express with the words ""the circle of life."" The whole life is predetermined, and you cannot evade your fate. Simba follows the ""circle"" and comes back to where it all began.<br/><br/>Since I mentioned the opening song, I would like to add some words about the music. ""Lion King"" has the best songs and themes I have ever heard in a Walt Disney movie, and justly Hans Zimmer and his crew received two Oscars for it. Many people I talked to are unhappy with the ""kind of musical"" but for me, since ""Snow White""'s dwarfs singing their ""Hey ho!"", songs are an important part of Walt Disney movies.<br/><br/>""Hakuna Matata!"" That's what I learnt from this movie and it has become some kind of motto for me."

","All credit where it's due, on a technical level, THE LION KING is a very well put-together movie. The colors are vivid, the character's movements are fluid, and it's just a very pretty movie to look at. I give this movie a bad rap all the time, but even I have to admit this. <br/><br/>My problem is that it's been unbelievably overblown for twenty years. Disney marketing got it into their heads that this is some sort of high prestige experience; bigger than all their other animated fluff, and warranting of blind praise from everyone. It's impenetrable for me because I haven't been able to listen to the soundtrack for two decades (and the movie's big on its music). 1994 radio was saturated with both the Elton John songs and the Simba numbers, and I haven't been able to hear any of it again since. For a musical, that's kind of a deal- breaker.<br/><br/>Story-wise, it definitely works better when you're a kid. The characters aren't obnoxious and Simba's reckoning isn't shallow. But it's just such nauseating material. The whole thing's built on pomp and spectacle, but there's nothing underneath. <br/><br/>3/10"

","I have a confession to make. This is the first fully animated Disney production that I have ever seen! Perhaps some would say that I have begun at the wrong end (beside the fact that I have been living in a closet all my life), however ""The Lion King"" (Disney's 32nd full length animated feature) has given me an inkling of what I may have been missing.<br/><br/>Disney continue their recent trend of popular animated features by bringing us this tale about the circle of life. Young lion cub ""Simba"", heir to his father ""King Mufasa's"" throne, thinks there'll be nothing to assuming his rightful place at the top of the food chain. Things look terribly gloomy though when Simba's evil Uncle Scar kills Mufasa, takes his brother's place as king and drives poor Simba far from his home. The dramatic adventure story that unfolds from here is good, and will keep the kids involved, yet the movie's real strength is its sharp wit and very funny dialogue. Several moments will have you in stitches, while movie buffs will delight in ""performances"" from many recognisable voices. James Earl Jones is an appropriate choice for Mufasa, Jeremy Irons' Scar is wonderfully sardonic, while comedienne Whoopi Goldberg is a real treat as a nasty Hyena. Listen too for the voices of Matthew Broderick, Rowan Atkinson, Cheech Marin, Robert Guillaume, Ernie Sabella, Nathan Lane and Moira Kelly.<br/><br/>""The Lion King"" is a joy musically too, with Hans Zimmer providing a vibrant African score and both Elton John and Tim Rice some catchy show numbers, including Elton's beautiful love theme ""Can You Feel the Love Tonight?"" Disney's high production values are clearly evident in a fine animated film which the whole family is sure to thoroughly enjoy.<br/><br/>Saturday, October 29, 1994 - Knox District Centre"

","How overrated can a rubbish film like this get?! It's a mess, it's depressing, it's got dumb comedy - there's only one three good points about this movie and that is the animation, the appealing drama of the stampede scene and a few of the songs; ""Can you feel the love tonight?"", ""I just can't wait to be King!"" and ""Be Prepared"" the rest is simply repelling. I'm a spoilsport - I know! Because everyone else looks at ""The Lion King"" with awe but I DO think you need to realise the many poor points to this Carlton-film:<br/><br/>1. Terrible voice talents 2. Timon and Pumbaa are extremely annoying, offensive to the ears and just plain stupid 3. Simba would rather spend time with Timon and Pumbaa than go to his home at the Pride-Lands where he is desperately needed 4. Scar is also madly irritating rather than a frightening villain 5. Comedy that is stupid rather than funny 6. Adult Simba, it seems to me, so sugary and sentimental 7. Scenes of death 8. Immense depression as Mufasa is killed 9. The hyenas - those annoying, moronic hyena, especially the thorn pit scene! 10. Everyone is intimidated by Scar who, like I say, isn't even slightly scary 11. IT CAME SIXTH IN CHANNEL 4's 100 GREATEST FAMILY FILMS!!!<br/><br/>I know I don't have the power to tell people what to like and what to hate, but I hope the list that is further up (of 11 items) might have given you something to ponder on before you watch this trash of a film on either video or DVD. I am a movie-lover and people think I am an expert on this kind of thing. What's more, Christmas 2004 was absolute chaos and thoroughly aggravating because in Hereford (England) there's a horrid, obnoxious, mindless, careless and stupid school called Barrs Court School and its loud-mouthed, unfunny-when-he-tries-to-be-funny, headmaster Richard Aird had organized his own version of the ""The Lion King"" and it was a complete travesty, utterly poor, pathetically acted by the silly pupils of the school (I didn't bother) and just a heap of cow muck! Hugely undeserving of all the people of this town giving up their time to see it. They're nutty as a fruitcake, if you ask ME! Even though, unlike Richard Aird hopeless, brainless, pointless, pitiful pantomime, Disney's ""Lion King"" has a professional production, reasonable animation, good drama, and admirable songs, it simply can't stand comparison with Disney's recent animated hits like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""Aladdin"" - it's too obnoxious and depressing!"

","The Lion King (1994): Dir: Roger Allers, Rob Minkoff / Voices: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, Moira Kelly, Nathan Lane, Ernie Sabella: Here is one of the most ambitious of Disney animations. Set in South Africa and regarding the respect and measuring authority. It opens with a celebration as lion cub Simba is born and he desires to be just like his brave father Mufasa but his deceitful and jealous uncle Scar seeks to prevent Simba as one day becoming King. Central plot regards an incident staged by Scar that results in Mufasa's death and Simba's leaving the pride in belief that it was his fault. Glorious African animated scenery with a variety assortment of wildlife appearances. Matthew Broderick voices adult Simba who will grow to different standards after being rescued by a warthog named Pumbaa and a meerkat named Timon. He will have to adapt to his destiny and challenge Scar for his rightful place as King. Scar is voiced by Jeremy Irons who forms an alliance with hyenas and successfully reduces the pride land to ruins until Simba dethrones him. Moira Kelly voices Simba's childhood friend lioness Nala whose adult form is a great introductory and her fate bares brilliant repeat to the opening. Pumbaa and Timon become the ultimate rags to riches duo. They are voiced effectively by Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella. This is Disney animation at its very best. Score: 10 / 10"

I suggest this childhood movie to any child, even teenagers or adults. I believe that people need to enjoy and know what a good movie is all about. Also the fact that the movie wasn't only a single but instead a series kept the audience attention to keep wanting more. The book is so sad that it can bring tears to anybody's eyes.

","Pretty much the king of the '90s Disney resurgence, and a great example of the studio's strengths. It's a very familiar story - basically Hamlet with singing animals - but they really make it their own through charm, whimsey and simple, effective characterization. The animation is excellent, too, silky smooth and grounded in reality but also expressive, colorful and often downright stunning. Musicals aren't usually my thing, though, and once or twice it felt like the tunes were being crammed into a scene when they really weren't necessary. Still, it's a vibrant, attention-demanding classic that held my kids' hearts from start to finish and authentically embraces an under-appreciated culture.

","The highest grossing 2D animated film of all time, one of the most critically acclaimed movies ever, a smash hit. And it deserves every bit of praise. The Lion King not only stands the test of time but it actually gets better as time goes on. <br/><br/>One of the film's (many) strong points is its characters. Simba is very likable, as a cub he's wide eyed, curious, can be cocky but it all comes from a good place. As an adult he is fun loving but conflicted by the pain of his past. Scar is one of the greatest film villains of all time. He's cunning & manipulative but is also cowardly and somewhat petulant (as shown when he takes over). He is also one of the few Disney villains to kill off one of the main characters. The side characters are also great, I know everyone talks about Timon & Pumba but I think the hyenas are the funniest part of the film. James Earl Jones is great as Mufasa, who in my opinion is one of the greatest movie dads of all time. <br/><br/>The songs, who hasn't heard them? They're all great, catchy & memorable. If I had to not pick it would be elements such as, why does the rain come back when Simba wins, but that's just Disney logic. <br/><br/>The Lion King is the greatest animated film of all time and only gets better with age."

","Being of a certain age, and without children, this is one of the classic Disney films I have never seen, but the opportunity arose to finally getting around to watching it when my mother, who is into her 80's and disabled, said she would love to see it. With the help of a very good friend, a veteran of the industry, we went to one of Bristol's (England) out-of-town multi-plexes and, for the grand total of £0.00 (or, if you like, $0.00!!!), sat back and waited for the fun to begin! The film is big, brash, colourful, and total predicable of course. Rightful pretender to the throne is framed by nasty old Scar, leaves, meets good friends, is persuaded to return, fights nasty old Scar, and Simba takes up his rightful place as King of the Pride. All very Disney, very good triumphing over evil, good guys getting their rightful dues, baddies getting their due comeuppance etc. What raises this above the level of most other animated films of this kind is the quality of the animation - quite superb - some great characters (the farting Warthog is fantastic, Scar suitably nasty, Simba proud and upright, etc), and some excellent songs - Circle of Life has, of course, become a children's classic song! The version I took my mother to see was the newly released 3D one, and I have to say that I was very impressed with how Disney had turned a 2D film into a film with great depth and scope. It did not always work as well as it could have, some scenes still looked a little flat, but certainly when the birds were flying overhead, or the camera was swooping down onto different characters, then the effects were excellent, and really added to the enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>If you have yet to catch up with this film then I would highly recommend you go and watch the 3D version - it is very well done, and worth the admission price - unless you are like myself and know the right people to gain free admission!!!"

","'Hakuna Matata'. The motto of Timon and Pumbaa- the comedic duo of this wonderful film. These two words has to sum up what the film is about. When something goes wrong, don't worry about it. Everything will be alright. Disney's ability to convey deep, thematic scenarios does justice to it's story line and makes the audience feel every emotion you can think of. <br/><br/>Simba (Matthew Broderick), a headstrong, young cub and son of Mufasa (James Earl Jones) is tricked into thinking that he is the cause of his father's death, thanks to his evil uncle, Scar (Jeremy Irons). He therefore gets exiled and looses his identity as the future king. However, things turn around, when after a while, he realises the effect that it has on everyone within the kingdom. With Scar as the new 'king', will Simba be able to take his rightful place and king and stay true to who he really is, with the help of his friends; Nala (Moira Kelly), Rakifi (Robert Guillaume), Timon (Nathan Lane) and Pumbaa (Ernie Sabella)?<br/><br/>Disney's modern adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Hamlet' in a unique and entertaining way, makes the audience see the deeper meaning of the film, along with making the film fun for the younger audience. Making the characters into animals, in my opinion, is the best thing that Disney could think of and I can see that they have done their research into the African lands and the characteristics of the animals living within. Even though the film deals with such major themes such as revenge, death and identity, the colourful characters like Zazu, Timon and Pumbaa makes the audience remember that this film is fiction. Scar, the antagonist in the film isn't a likable character, and it seems that his inspiration is from past Disney villains, like Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Captain Hook (Peter Pan) and Lady Tremaine (Cinderella). <br/><br/>Everyone HAS to go and watch this film at least once. And after that... you will not be able to forget this epic story in your life(Which is a good thing!)"

","Disneys best movie! This film is amazing, it will never get topped, it'as already 2011 and the new release proves it holds up against everything that has been released from Disney, not just holds up to them, but actually still beats them, in my opinion Disney has not made anything better than this film yet. They still make awesome movies, but they will never top this.<br/><br/>Yes I love the toy story series, but nothing is as powerful and as beautiful as the lion king, it can't be touched, its brilliant, animated film at its finest. Everything is perfect about this film, the opening grabs you right away, gives chills. The score is amazing, the songs, the acting, the story, its amazing all around.<br/><br/>I feel sorry to those Disney employees who decided to work on Pocahontas, because they thought lion king wasn't going to be good, lol.<br/><br/>THANK YOU TO THE WHOLE CAST AND CREW WHO MADE THIS MASTERPIECE!!! 10 STARS!"
"darthtuhmader","10","1","2","23 September 2011"," One of the greatest animated movies ever!
","Some movies just aren't as good as you remembered them when you were a kid. Others actually get better with age. The Lion King falls in the latter category.<br/><br/>Based on the play Hamlet, The Lion King is the classic story of a young cub Simba, who is the son of the proud Mufasa. Simba eagerly wants to follow his father's footsteps and become a great king of the pride-lands like him - until tragedy strikes, which Simba blames himself for, and runs away from the pride-lands, where he befriends Timon and Pumba and follows their carefree ""Hakuna Matata"" way of life. However, he's about to learn that while you can't change the past, you can't run away run away from it either.<br/><br/>If there is any animated film that could be considered epic, The Lion King would be a top contender. From start to finish, The Lion King is practically one great scene after another. The epic beginning, the trip to the elephant graveyard, Simba and his dad bonding, Scar's plan, the stampede, the tragedy, Nala finding Simba the romance between them, Simba confronting his father, his return to pride rock, his battle to reclaim the throne, and the ending; All of these could have been highlights of a lesser movie. Here, if I had to pick my favorite scene, I would just pick the whole movie.<br/><br/>Not only that, but almost every aspect of the film is great. The story, as I said before, is classical with a great theme to it (face your responsibilities, don't run away from them) while the characters are just as good. I'm sure many kids can relate to the cub Simba, from him wanting to be just like his dad to him being so hyper active, waking up his parents before the sun even rises (something I used to recall doing when I was little) Even as an adult, Simba remains appealing (I'm sure deep down, a lot of us would just love to live a care and responsibility free life) Also, like the best of Disney's movies, we have a rich variety of supporting characters, from the prim and proper Zazu to the wise and kind of weird Rafiki the hilarious Timon and Pumba (normally, adding a warthog with a bad smell for humor would hurt such a dramatic story, and yet the filmmakers manage to get enough laughs out of Pumba without being too crude or hurting the story)<br/><br/>The characters are helped by a great cast. Rather than simply going after big names, the filmmakers brought a talented cast that fit the characters perfectly.Matthew Broderick is extremely likable as Simba, while James Earl Jones gives off all the power, authority, fierceness, and occasional warmth as Mufasa, who is arguably one of the greatest dads in cinema. Too often, when making a tough fatherly figure, the filmmakers will give him a total lack of care or emotion, yet here, despite all his fierceness, Mufasa can still manage to feel like a big teddy bear when he plays with Simba. Jeremey Irons, meanwhile, is one seriously underrated actor, and here he shines as the cunning and conniving Scar. Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Martin, Jim Cummings, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, and Robert Guillaume round off the rest of the incredible cast.<br/><br/>The film is also incredibly heartfelt, with some truly touching scenes. Chief among them (those who don't want spoilers should skip to the next paragraph) is the tragic scene of the death of Mufasa. I've seen reviews that have compared that scene negatively to the death of the mother in Bambi, calling it secondhand compared to that scene. Personally, as a kid the death of Mufasa was much more upsetting to me than the death scene in Bambi. Nowawdays, I think both are powerful, but in two different ways. With Bambi, the tears comes from Bambi running through the forest calling for his mother, not even knowing she's dead. With The Lion King, the tears come from Simba seeing his dad lying there lifeless, and refusing to accept it. Him running around asking for someone to come help still brings tears to my eyes to this day.<br/><br/>The score, meanwhile, is done by Hans Zimmer, who is one of my favorite composers, and the score for The Lion King is one of, if not his absolute best. The songs are also incredible. The Circle of Life is an epic and powerful opening song for the film, I Just Can't Wait to Be King is both fun and practically bursting with high energy, Be Prepared is a great villain song, Hakuna Matata light and humorous (it's arguably the weakest of the songs, and it's still a classic), while Can You Feel The Love Tonight is a perfectly touching romance song and completely deserved its Oscar.<br/><br/>Like most of Disney's animated films, the animation here is top notch. Some of the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, while a few of them are almost scary (the elephant graveyard and the canyon where the stampede occurs are two prime examples)<br/><br/>I'm writing this review less than a week after the 3-d re-release of The Lion King scored a big 30.2 mil opening weekend. This shows just how popular The Lion King has remained after all these years, and it's not hard to see why. It's a success on practically every level, with a classical story, memorable characters, epic scenes, beautiful animation, great songs, occasional humor and some truly tear-jerking moments. It's not just one of my favorite animated films but one of my favorite films period."
"Aaron1375","7","1","2","13 October 2010"," From a person who generally does not enjoy a Disney musical this one was pretty good.
","I know my score does not seem all that high, but trust me from me a seven is good for a motion picture of this type. This one, unlike many other Disney musical cartoons is a film I say was pretty good. The songs were okay and fit the story well and the animation was rather good and the story not all that bad either. The humor was funny, and though it got semi serious at times the flow of the film was good and never really bogged down even when it did tend to be a bit more on the sentimental side. The story of a young lion cub, who is the son of the lion that rules the valley is nice. You watch him progress through this life and you meet the villain Scar who hatches a plan to not only rid the valley of this cub, but the father as well who happens to be Scar's brother. He does this with help from the hyenas and after seemingly succeeding with getting rid of those two, he takes over the valley and lets the hyenas do as they wish. Well unbeknown to Scar, the son, Simba, has survived and he becomes friends with a couple of funny characters Timon and Pumbaa. They add a lot of comedy to the film and I really laughed at the scene where they sing their song as a distraction using Pumbaa as basically bait. So a nice movie that ends really quickly and is good even to a guy who usually dislikes this type of movie this one is a nice treat."
"lewiskendell","10","1","2","23 August 2010"," The zenith of traditional American animation.
","""A king's time as ruler rises and falls like the sun. One day, Simba, the sun will set on my time here and will rise with you as the new king.""<br/><br/>The Lion King was a masterpiece when I was a kid, and it's still a masterpiece, now. It's easily in my personal top ten. It's a movie that every breathing person should see. Other than those things, there are really only three other details you need to know about it. <br/><br/>1. A lot of the better animated movies are known for being enjoyable for both kids and adults, but The Lion King may be the very best example of that description. Children will love the antics of the hyena trio and Timon and Pumbaa, while adults will find the Hamlet-inspired drama to be top-notch.<br/><br/>2. The animation is outstanding; from the bright, vivid colors of the characters and scenery of The Pride Lands, to the nightmarish macabre darkness of The Elephant Graveyard. I still don't think that there has been superior traditional animation from the U.S., Japan, or anywhere else. It's dazzling in standard definition, I'm almost drooling at the prospect of the eventual high-def release.  <br/><br/>3. If you like the musical aspect of animated movies, you're in luck. While most Disney films have one or two great songs and several good ones, The Lion King is packed with great songs from beginning to end. Nostalgia may be partially to blame, but I can't hear The Circle of Life or Can You Feel the Love Tonight without getting goosebumps."
"bad_beth666","10","1","2","9 August 2010"," A milestone in animation!
","The Lion King was one of the biggest box office hits of 1994, and still today holds the World Record for the most tapes sold for a cartoon.<br/><br/>But what touched everyone, particularly myself, with this movie? Was it the score's of Elton John, was it the humor of Timon and Pumba? or the moment of grief we all shared as a child as we watched young simba lie weeping next to his dead father, surrounded with guilt? The Lion King focuses on life. Life that began in the pride lands, when the first score ""the circle of life"" lit up the screen in magnificent color and sound, with the new infant Simba being welcomed into the kingdom with the mark on his forehead (which could possibly be a mirrored mimic to baptism) and being raised over the ruling domain of pride rock for the animals to welcome their new prince.<br/><br/>The movie is just teeming with color and emotion, and the songs and scores hold many memories in our hearts, such as the chills that ran up our spines in the dramatic scene where Simba runs for his life as wildebeest chase him through a gorge, to the award winning song ""Can you feel the love tonight?"" By Elton John. The cast is stunning, and there is an element to this film that everyone can enjoy.<br/><br/>I cant even say how much this film means to me. The Lion King WILL and ALWAYS will be one of the greatest films in history and of all time. It shows life in all its grief and joy, and manages to fit it all into a around a hour and a half time frame. I love it."

","I love this film. All the songs are great, scratch that fantastic, scratch that masterful, scratch that no words can describe how good the songs are.

The characters are likable. The jokes can be funny. The sadness level is through the roof. I cried, and this film is so good I'm willing to admit it.

"lisalan58","10","1","2","29 May 2010"," One of, if not THE best animated film ever!
","I have seen a lot of animated films and cartoons in my day, and I can sincerely, without a doubt say that this is one of, if not THE best ever. Where do I even start? <br/><br/>For one thing, the characters. Not only do they have good depth, but what makes them really stand out to me is the way that they all grow as the story goes on. For example, when the movie starts, Simba is arrogant and adventurous, and seems to think being a king is the best thing on earth. By the end, he realizes the responsibility and pain in being a king, which symbolizes growing up in general. <br/><br/>The music was another high point. All the songs are catchy and lovable. I especially fell in love with the 'Circle of Life', which is so classic and honest, and 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight', which is romantic without being cheesy or inappropriate.The character voices are good too; as they all fit the characters well I have no complaints here.<br/><br/>The plot, although it is the classic good vs. evil struggle, does not seem old or clichéd in this movie. And although it is a excellent, extremely family-friendly movie, there are deep morals to be observed for all ages. The fact that this movie touches up on adult-orientated themes, while making it appealing for children, makes it all the more amazing."

","I am a Disney fan, i loved the little mermaid, beauty and the beast, mulan, aladdin. However the one movie that stood out the most for me as a child, and still i don't have (cant wait for it to come on blu-ray in 2011!) is Lion King. Though I have only seen it once, i remember the story perfectly scene for scene song for song story. Lion king came out in 1994, i was 8 years old, it has been 16 years and i still remember, thats how you know a movie is great or not.<br/><br/>It is sad that Disney movies have failed Lion King was the last of its kind, though the new Disney movie the princess and frog (i think thats what is called) is good, and brings back the old traditional Disney style, it still can not compare to Lion King, no animated film could either. For those who have never seen it (especially the younger generations) you need to buy it the first thing it comes out, and experience the greatest animated film of all time.<br/><br/>I am proud to have been born in the 80's i was fortunate to experience the best most movies of my time, the experience then could never match the experience of now. Children will never experience lion king in the theater where it was absolutely stunning,just like future generations will never experience Avatar in 3d and other amazing movies.<br/><br/>Enough of my ranting, and my reminiscence of the past.<br/><br/>10/10!"

"liviu1606","10","1","2","20 August 2007"," the best
","This is the best animated film I have ever seen. Simba, the son of king Muphasa is a lion cub that knows that one day will be his turn to become a king. But he is too fidgety and always gets into trouble and his father has to save him every time. The other problem is his uncle Scar that does not quite agree with the situation with the kingdom and develops a plan to kill his brother and become a king. This forces Simba to run away from the pride lands. He finds new friends that teach him never to look back and live his life. But the memories and some old friends remind him that he has a responsibility for his lands. Then he comes back to settle the things between him and his uncle. This movie is a good example of true friendship, faith and love. Great story, great characters, great animation, soundtrack and a lot of smart jokes. Let's not forget the voice acting(Jeremy Irons - Scar, James Earl Jones - Muphasa)that couldn't be better. I recommend it to all of you children, parents, grandparents... I saw it first when i was six and now I'm twenty and I'm still watching it. If you didn't have the chance to see it, I recommend it, and if you did see it, I recommend watching it again!:)"

","THE LION KING, in my opinion, is a very touching Disney classic about survival and self-discovery for all ages that will warm your heart. I really loved the music. If I could have, I would have helped young Simba (voice of Jonathan Taylor Thomas) get to safety myself. The only problem is how I would get them to safety, since I don't drive. All in all, the music was good, the animation was perfect, everyone was cast perfectly, and the direction was flawless. In conclusion, I highly recommend this very touching movie about survival and self-discovery for all ages to anyone who hasn't seen it.

I can not speak more highly of the movie, even seeing it as an adult. However they should not have done it as a musical. I loved it hugely. I was amazed from beginning to end.

One thing that really gets me mad is the whole ""too intense for young children"" thing thats been said about this movie for the past 13 years. Little kids can deal with death, they probably don't even understand it. This movie i think really has mostly cheerful moments mixed in with a ""real"" story. not just some love story with problems like the little mermaid and beauty and the beast. this story actually seems like something that wasn't just made to occupy kids under the age of 5 and bore the mess out of adults. its a movie that will keep people of all ages coming for a long time."

There are a lot of scenes which really are times to relax and enjoy, relieved by the more serious scenes such as the one mentioned above.<br/><br/>The Lion King is a movie that offers a bit of everything.

Though the bits that upsetted me the most at this age, was Simba's dad, who died after tumbling down the cliff, after Scar plunged him down there. To be honest I am not surprised why this film was such a big hit. The characters were all likable in their own ways and you could really tell that it was a film, that was never going to be forgotten.

It's something so powerful. Did you know that originally people thought that this movie wasn't going to do good. They thought Pocohauntas was going to be better. But they changed a lot of it just by the power of Mufasa and Simba. They made it so powerful. I just love the part when grownup Simba sees his dad in the sky and just is so confused.

Simba lives with them for awhile, until Rafiki comes in and helps Simba regain the true identity of who he really is. The story is well developed, and it's enjoyable for the whole family.

Probably the only place you can get it now is on E-bay or a Used Book/Music/Movie store.<br/><br/>My friend just got me the DVD for my B-day and it rocks. The special features as Scar might say ""Are to die for."" The virtual safari with Timon and Pumbaa is entertaining.

After he is tricked by his uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) that he killed his father in a freak stampede, Simba runs off to a far off oasis where Timon and Pumba (Nathan Lane and Ernie Sabella) live. After many years of living with his foster fathers, adult Simba (Mathhew Broderick) realizes what has happened and how Scar has come to the thrown of the animal kingdom as an evil king.<br/><br/>Simba must return to battle Scar and return the animal kingdom to order with the help of his friend. The story is fun, its interesting, and it's smart. It's truly Disney at its best. The voices: Matthew Broderick, Jeremy Irons, James Earl Jones, and Whoopi Goldberg is stellar. The animation is at its best and the design of actual African animals is amazing. If only Disney could make more of these kind of movies.<br/><br/>Anyone from kids to adults would like this film.

"malkane316","8","1","2","21 March 2005"," Quick reviews!!
","Not only is it one of Disney's most loved films, it is one of the most successful movies of all time. A deceptively simple story, loosely built around Hamelet, with a rich cast of characters, a terrific list of voice actors, some extraordinary visuals and animation, and a few good songs make Lion King a favourite for many people, young and old.<br/><br/>The Lion King tells the story of Simba, a young cub and heir to the throne. His father Mufassa tells him from Pride Rock that someday all that simba sees will be his, as he will be the 'King of the Jungle', at the top of the food chain. More than this though, adding the human element, Simba will be the leader of all the other animals and they will look to him for guidance. However Scar, Simba's uncle believes the throne should be his, that it would have been his had Simba not been born. Scar, as he is not the alpha male must live in inferior surroundings, and against the typical rules of society he befriends the Hyenas. He plots to usurp the throne. One normal day he takes Simba across the land and into a canyon, knowing that a stampede approaches. When he leaves, Mufassa rushes to help his son and is crushed. Simba survives however, but Scar tells him to leave as everyone will blame him for his father's death. Simba goes, Scar takes over, telling everyone Simba is dead. Soon Simba meets Timon and Pumba, mere-cat and Warthog, and they become friends, following the Hakuna Matata way of life. However, when an old friend Nala appears, Simba realises he must take back his throne and stop Scar, leading to a fiery confrontation.<br/><br/>Each character here has depth and their own individuality. The voice acting for each is perfect, from the sneering intellectualism and jealousy of Jeremy Irons as Scar, to the wisdom and strength of Mufassa, played by James Earl Jones. The animation mixes computer styles with traditional, and the result is spectacular. From the sumptuous swirling views of the land, to the grimness of Scar's habitat, much akin to Shere-Khan's in The Jungle Book, everything is highly detailed. The songs range from the typical catchy dance numbers to ballads, and they are effective. The incidental music is often more powerful. The jokes are good for the most part, with many aimed at a more knowing, older audience, and while some scenes may be too harsh for younger viewers, it is still a perfect film for kids. There is love, friendship, respect and all the other traits of Disney, as well as the darker side too, which the kids will not recognise. A break from the fairy tale style of Disney films, and not a human in sight, but a major triumph for the studio, and a great, emotional, fun film.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10"

"crankyank27","Null","1","2","5 September 2004"," The last GREAT hand-drawn animation movie EVER
","this movie is probably the best Disney movie ever. the plot is intriguing, never slowing down, and it keeps you interested throughout the entire thing.<br/><br/>they don't waste a second with ""fluff"" in this movie, every minute is important to the plot. scar is probably the most evil Disney bad guy ever, and the story goes beyond the love/exploring the world clichÃ© that other Disney movies are. this movie is unparalleled by anything Disney ever made.<br/><br/>this movie probably marked the end of the era of hand-drawn animation. toy story came out the year following the lion king, and it ushered in a whole new wave of computer animation that will brush hand-drawn animation aside. after this movie, hand-drawn animated movies just went downhill in quality in general (okay, mulan wasn't that bad, but still doesn't even compare to the lion king.) think about it. all the good animated movies that are coming out now (finding nemo, shrek 1 and 2) are done by computer. it's a shame that there most likely won't be any attention paid to the art of hand-drawn animated movies anymore."

","This film in my opinion is the best disney flm ever made. Either more people go to the cinema now or Finding Nemo is the best ever.I'l give you a clue it's not the second answer.Before Finding Nemo The Lion King broke all box office records and the reason for that was this film had everything. Great story,Good voices, Good effects and most importantly fantastic music from Elton John and Tim Rice which will live in many a persons mind.If you have not seen this film yet go out buy it on the new special edition DVD and have a once in a lifetime disney experience."

","With a Touch of Hamlet and a sprinkle of King Lear, The Lion Kings is a real achievement in every aspect.  A tale about coming of age and the right of destiny that has a real timeless effect on all age groups.  Not only is this movie such a monumental film in animation but is an achievement in motion picture scoring as well. Elton John and Tim Rice not only bring a great soundtrack to this epic but accompanies it with a sense of style that has not be duplicated ever since its release.<br/><br/>A real Disney classic in every sense of the word, and a real keeper for generations to come."

","Animation's crowning achievement? I don't think so! Sure it looks great, sounds great (except for that annoying ""Can you feel the love tonight""), made tons of money, but it certainly pales compared to something like Beauty and the Beast. If anything deserves to be called ""Animation's Crowning Achievement"", it's Beauty and the Beast (And I usually don't go around giving praise to Disney's non-Pixar films!). In that, you have a connection to the characters that is noticeably lacking in this film (And the music and story are better too.).<br/><br/>The Lion King is ok, not great, but ten times better than its sequel. I'd still rather curl up with Toy Story or Monsters Inc. than this though."

It deserves to be the best. It is totally awssome. Out of the world. The story about a young  lion cub, Simba, the heir to the throne of the jungle-Pride Rock and his journey upto there is beautiful.

","The Lion King is Disney`s finest moment.  The story is excellent, the music is top-class and the voice-overs are perfect.<br/><br/>Simba is the cub of the King Of ""Pride Rock"", Mufasa, and nephew of the evil Scar.<br/><br/>Scar wants to get rid of Simba and Mufasa, because he wants to be king himself.  Scar kills Mufasa and he gets the hyenas to chase Simba.  Simba escapes the hyenas and he is now alone. He teams up with outsiders Timon and Pumba, and the movie tells about these characters and how they live together.<br/><br/>It is a classic tale of the battle between good and evil, it is backed up by fast-paced actionmusic composed by Hans Zimmer(The Rock, Crimson Tide, The Peacemaker), the other music is splendid too.

"Weasel84","10","1","2","24 July 1999"," The Most Wonderful Story Ever
","My feelings for The Lion King are like the feelings one would have for the book of their religion --  my main source of knowledge and my hope and my confidence comes from the characters and music of this work of art.  I would be a much unhappier person if this story --which in my opinion is the greatest ever sent straight from whatever higher power there is to the minds of the writers-- had not been made.  From it I have learned how to be happy with myself, how to have hope even during the worst times of my life, and it has lead me to a best friend and a loving girlfriend.<br/><br/>No matter what your past life experience, if you watch this movie with an open mind, you can find yourself in one of the characters.  Surely all of us can find ourselves in Simba at least.  A young, naive cub who, due to events beyond his control or knowledge, is forced away from his beloved home of happiness and far away, to a place where he forgets his problems and himself -- for a time.  Then it is realized that you must remember who you are, and learn from your past instead of running from it.  So then a return to the kingdom is made, where you are happy once again -- because, if you always remember who you are, that sadness, that evil, can never keep you away from your happiness.  You fight for it until it is yours again.  That is a very simple summary of Simba's lesson.  Looking at different parts of his life, interaction with other characters, and other characters themselves, countless more lessons can be learned, depending on what you have and what you are going through in your life.  But whatever that happens to be, there are things in this movie that can help you.<br/><br/>I haven't even spoken of the animation or music yet.<br/><br/>The animation is perfect -- there's been no over-use of computers--, and everything --from the whiskers on Simba's nose to the grasses swaying in the savanna-- is detailed perfectly. The instrumental music always brings out powerful emotions in me, and is at the top of my list along with 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Scarface(1983)', and 'La Vita E Bella (Life is Beautiful)'.  The songs, when looked at with the way the story is going along with what you are learning, tell you much.  For example, 'I Just Can't Wait to be King' reveals the ignorance of Simba to any of life's problems--he's completely innocent to such things, unsuspecting, unprepared, and so is caught off-guard by the life-altering events that take place soon afterwards.<br/><br/>This movie has changed my life.  I hope that you too, watching it while keeping in mind what can be learned, find out more about yourself, and the answers to the questions you may be faced with during difficult points in your life.<br/><br/>""The past can hurt...  But the way I see it, you can either run from it, or... learn from it."""

","Hyenas are now hated for this stupid movie. And lions are not the kings of the beasts. It just sucks! It is my least favorite movie of all time. If I was to chose between watching the lion king and Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, I would chose Attack of the Killer Tomatoes. I have no idea what people see in this movie. I would give it a negative number if I could. HYENAS KILL LIONS! I just hate it. TIGERS ARE THE KINGS OF THE BEASTS! NOT LIONS! I have to say, I was very disappointed, the only good thing was the music. Honestly, I wish those lions starved to death and I am glad that simbas father died. I hate Disney for making people hate hyenas. I LOVE THOSE GUYS! They are AMAZING! In fact, I like them better than humans! I just can't wait to be king. To bad you will have to wait forever. By the way, wildebeest can not trample and ADULT MALE LION! Way to go on the details there. Disney has to make a movie about hyenas being good because honestly, hyenas are not more evil than humans.

"Vapaja","4","8","48","16 October 2002"," Disney at it's worst
","I'm not going to apologize to any of the idiots who may get offended by this comment. The Lion King is a really really really dumb movie. It is crap. The plot is extremely superficial and the characters are all so quickly spun and consistently shallow that by the end of the film I couldn't care less who won the day. To be honest I was rooting for Scar (at least he had the cool creepy voice).<br/><br/>Raves about the celebrity voices? I'd rather have people I don't know speaking the lines. It gets distracting when you know that the hero is Matthew Broderick, or the villain is Jeremy Irons or Whoopi Goldberg, or whoever. And since when are all African lions American or British?<br/><br/>Raves about the songs?! THEY ALL SUCKED. I only remember three of the songs (were there more?) The circle of life (even I have to admit that the first 5 five minutes of the movie were impressive), I Can't Wait to be King (possibly - no certainly - the most annoying song ever to be created by Disney, topped by the most out-of-place and contrived dance scene, and it was also reminiscent of the Beauty and the Beast classic Be Our Guest...extremely tacky, all in all), and Hakkuna Matata, which almost ties for most annoying song, because for years it was being shoved down the public's throat through toy and soundtrack promotions.<br/><br/>I am a huge Disney fan, but this movie made me doubt my allegiance. To all duped consumers out there: If you want to see good Disney; if you want a movie that will entertain children and adults; if you want to hear good songs; if you want developed lead and secondary characters; if you want to see a plot with more dimensions than a sheet of paper; then see Beauty and the Beast, or The Little Mermaid, or Aladdin.

","Cheesy and predictable movie, but has its moments. <br/><br/>Pretty standard plot, which, but for a few minor detours, can be foreseen from start to finish. Some of the detours are quite interesting though.<br/><br/>The humour is mostly quite child-orientated and lame, but there are a few good lines.<br/><br/>While most stuff is dumbed-down for kids, there are some decent edgier scenes. Most of Scar's scenes were worth watching. Basically the story was so syrupy-sweet, you got to support the bad guy (even the plot is so predictable you know it won't end well for him).<br/><br/>Making it a semi-musical didn't help either. I dislike musicals intensely (though there are a few exceptions): all the music serves is to pad out the movie.<br/><br/>Star-studded cast for the voices: Matthew Broderick, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin. Pick of the bunch was Jeremy Irons as Scar - suitably evil voice, with gravitas.<br/><br/>A kid's movie, and nothing more."
"joebrian55","6","2","7","22 December 2012"," Not Disney's best movie, I ought to tell you
","So I didn't give this movie 10 stars, are you fans all mad at me? Anyway, this movie is often a fan favourite of many of my friends. Ever since one of my classmates in English class began singing Hakuna Matata, often to annoy me, I have been analyzing this movie and trying hard not to make any fan of this movie mad at me.<br/><br/>But I'm getting sidetracked. While the animation (and artwork in general) is astounding and clearly had a lot of effort put in, I find that the story seems to have not as much effort put in.<br/><br/>Based on the Shakespeare play Hamlet (and Kimba the White Lion, but I'll get to that later), this film revolves around a lion who, after losing his father to his envious uncle Scar, is convinced to remember his past and that HE should rightfully claim the throne. I like the message that the past can hurt and you can run from it or learn from it, but I feel a lot doesn't work for me.<br/><br/>For example, the plot (as I mentioned before) is derived from two great works of fiction. It wouldn't bother me as much if the end credits said ""Based on Hamlet by William Shakespeare and Kimba the White Lion by Osamu Tezuka"" or if Disney didn't tout it as an original story.<br/><br/>Then there's one of my biggest issues with this movie, this movie doesn't know if it wants to be for younger children (3-6) or older children (7-12). While it does deal with mature subjects such as the death of a loved one, responsibility, handling guilt etc, there's too much other stuff in this movie that's immature.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that when a protagonist experiences a tragic turn of events, the first thing we want is something that will cheer us up afterwards... for many, Hakuna Matata comes to mind, but... for me, I think there could have been a better way of accomplishing that.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I find only three of the songs from this movie worth listening to, Circle of Life (kudos to Hans Zimmer), Be Prepared (who doesn't admire a song as awesome as this?) and the end credits version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight? (Gotta listen to more Elton John, though). As you might have guessed, Hakuna Matata, while it may have appealed to me some 6-7 years earlier, is now the song I hate the most from this movie. It just blows my mind that a movie like this goes from a lion cub witnessing the murder of his father by a jealous uncle to one of the most annoying and whimsical songs I have ever heard as well as belching and flatulence jokes... see what I mean when I say it's not very clear on the audience it wants to appeal to? I am in disbelief that the guy who wrote songs for Princess Diana's funeral actually wrote a song as annoying as that.<br/><br/>Also, there are scenes in this movie that are too intense for younger children, such as the death of Mufasa, the hyena chasing Simba and Nala, Simba and Nala (grown up, and before they recognize each other) fighting and the climax. I would strongly recommend waiting until your kids are 6 or 7 years old, or if they understand how hard it is to handle the death of a loved one.<br/><br/>But what I really like about this movie is the father-and-son connection between Simba and Mufasa, which is one of the reasons why you're supposed to find it sad when Mufasa dies, just like why we're supposed to sympathize with Bambi when his mother dies. Whenever you watch Mufasa and Simba conversing happily, you just know there's a connection between the two.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is not bad, but not everything is flawless, and this is no exception. For any fan seething with anger at this review, I see some good stuff in this movie!"
"MartinHafer","8","3","13","13 October 2012"," A lovely but completely unoriginal film.
","Aside from the folks at Disney, anyone else my age who saw both the Japanese series ""Kimba"" and ""The Lion King"" could easily see that the Disney film was based almost completely on the earlier Japanese cartoon. Now I am no lover of ""Kimba""--its American version was rather insipid. But the plot was clearly 'borrowed' by Disney to make ""The Lion King"". And, there are so many similarities that I cannot rate this wonderful film any higher than an 8--as it lacks originality. Sure, I loved Ed and felt my heart tugged by the film and loved the music--but it was a ripoff, ur....I mean 'very similar'. Not a bad film at all, but I recommend you try seeing the Japanese show if you can find a copy. Even the main character's names are practically the same!"

Movies like avatar are WAY underrated for their fantastic storyline and effects. Be sure to like this review, so people can get their ratings right to today's times, and not let NOSTALGIA get in the way of honest ratings. If you haven't watched this movie as a child, you definitely won't enjoy it watching it now. This is not the only one, as series like avatar: the last airbender also confuse people into thinking that the movie Avatar is in any way linked to that series, which is not true at all.

"tiyusufaly","5","4","22","20 December 2002"," Good film but overrated
","I don't want to sound really negative, so let me begin by saying that this is a very good Disney film, undeniably. Probably the best thing about this film is that it has possibly the best animation of any Pre-Pixar Disney film to date. I would also place its score by Hans Zimmer and songs by Elton John/Tim Rice in the top 5 of Disney films. <br/><br/>However, this is OVERRATED (The only Disney animated one to be moreso than Beauty and the Beast, which is also a great film nevertheless). People call it the best Disney animated feature, but they should really look at some other of Disney's films. I would undoubtedly place this in the Top Ten, but don't immediately call it the best, because you'd be surprised what watching some other items from the Mouse Factory would do to your opinion. My biggest complaint is the story and how it is told. Does anyone besides myself realize that this is a Hamlet ripoff? First original Disney film indeed, Aladdin put much more story creativity into its adaptation of Arabian Nights. And this film can be a little slow at times. Aladdin is 90 minutes long, TLK 88, but sometimes I feel like TLK is 2 hours long, while Aladdin is maybe a 1/2 hour. <br/><br/>Don't let this misguide you, I love the film, and it rightfully earns a 10/10. But I do not think it deserves as much acclaim as it has received."

But there are many, many ways to tell the story without senseless violence. I played the film for some small children a few months back and they cried because of the death that happens during the Stampede.<br/><br/>To be honest, I can't put my finger on it, but there's just something about this film that makes it unlike the other Disney cartoons and very, very depressing.<br/><br/>By the way, the word SEX appears twice in this film.

","This is going to be an unpopular opinion, but I might as way say it - I enjoyed the remake of The Lion King (which I'll call LK2) more than the original (hereby called OG). Its possibly attributed to the fact that I saw the LK2 first, but even while watching the animated version, I felt it was really... choppy.<br/><br/>Without the nostalgia goggles, as an objective viewing, its not that different from the remake. In fact, LK2 is more drawn out, with the story really taking its time to explore themes and characters. Compare this with the OG, which just bounces from scene-to-scene-to-scene without holding on long enough for anything to marinate. I suppose you could say that about most animated films, but once you have a live-action that actually explores more, its hard to go back.<br/><br/>Here are a few things I did enjoy in LK2, which were missing in the OG:
The humor is better written, especially for Timon and Pumba. Most other lead characters have the same dialogue anyhow, so why bother comparing. The hyena antagonists are given more stronger plot threads as opposed to the OG,where they were just maniacally laughing. LK2 is also really beautifully shot; the photo-realism is a huge push in its favor.<br/><br/>I will say, however, that the original music is way better. Songs like ""I just can't wait to be king"" and ""Be Prepared"" are bright and colorful,with such a unique charm, I found myself just pulled into the world. If the remake didn't reuse the original soundtrack, and focused on a more updated version, I feel it would have been a better film.<br/><br/>I'll probably never see either of these films until I have kids, but I'm a little more inclined to choose the live-action story. Though the OG would have been amazing in its time, its definitely a kids movie going forward, as opposed to a more general-audience film."

","""I know what I have to do. But going back means I'll have to face my past. I've been running from it for so long.""<br/><br/>Ever since I first saw The Lion King in 1994 it has remained my favorite animated film of all time. I don't think I've revisited another movie as much as I have this one. I loved each one of the characters (Timon being one of my all time favorites), the story, the songs, and the emotional roller-coaster ride it took me through. It's a perfect film in my opinion and I ignore the comments saying that it's emotionally manipulative. It's also one of the most quotable animated movies and the animation of the African savannah is simply breathtaking. <br/><br/>The Lion King plays out as a Shakespearean tragedy as it is loosely based on Hamlet, and I have to admit that this film probably influenced my love for Shakespeare. I'm not going to lie, I didn't even know anything about Shakespeare when I first saw this movie, and after reading Hamlet I never even made the connection between these two. My love for The Lion King must have subconsciously influenced my appreciation for Shakespeare because now I'm a huge fan of his work and have read many of his plays.<br/><br/>The story is incredibly gripping and there are several scenes that have stuck with me all these years. The very opening sequence is simply impressive as we are introduced to the kingdom and all the animals have gathered around to see the new born prince. Who can forget the first time Scar shows up on screen and Mufasa is there to confront him for not showing up at his son's birth. Scar is a very different villain and one who wouldn't dare face his brother face to face, but he is manipulative and smart. Then there is the frightening scene where Simba and Nala visit the Elephant Cemetery and are chased by the hyenas. And I could continue naming more scenes because the entire story is simply gripping. My favorite moment however is when Simba befriends the unlikely duo of Timon and Pumba, but who can forget the scene where Simba laments his father's death. James Earl Jones was the perfect choice for Mufasa's voice. Everything about this film works, it's a masterpiece. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","The story's theme being about life and the changes that can happen in it, makes this easily relate-able and very deep already in itself. The moral of the story being how you should not run away from your problems/past but take your responsibilities, is important and well showed and handled.<br/><br/>This is very enjoyable for people of all ages, as this has catchy songs, written and composed by the legendary duo Tim Rice & Elton John, also fine humor and easy-to-love characters. Many of the major characters are extremely well written, too. <br/><br/>All in all, Disney seems to have had their heart in the business. Which can not be said from some of their classic cartoons, especially of late.<br/><br/>Simba is my favorite character not only because he's cute and such a typical, spirited boy child, and is an entertaining mixture of an arrogant, macho rich kid and a kid with a brave and warm heart - but also because he's not your typical Disney hero, who appears perfect from the very beginning. He actually DEVELOPS into the hero he is expected to be. As a child, he has the villain's tendencies in ways of thinking. That's completely fascinating. But knowing he respects his father's values, we don't need to fear that he'd become a villain himself.<br/><br/>However, this seems to be more targeted at adults, as the basic story, (based on 'Hamlet'), is very dark and heavy. I don't recall any other Disney classic that gets even close. Because, this film also portrays that story openly and with brutal frankness, and they didn't even ruin the villain by making him a total clown. No, Scar is one of the most outstanding and best Disney villains ever. He's very cruel, dark and clever, and obsessed. I daresay that without Timon and Pumbaa and their crazy lifestyle brining in the light, children would not enjoy this much.<br/><br/>But as it is, this film has everything a film and a story needs to entertain people of all ages, over and over again and from generation to another. The Lion King is timeless, and a true classic."

"johnnyboyz","7","1","3","16 January 2008"," Strong and engaging animation film that has its issues and its messages but delivers on an entertaining level above all else.
","I suppose it's fun to re-visit a Disney film every now and again; The Lion King holding a rather special place in my psyche as well as my heart for it was the first film I ever saw at a cinema. Needless to say; watching it now for perhaps the first time proper since that cinema viewing hasn't made me like it or love it any more than I perhaps did then but it hasn't made me dislike it any more, either.<br/><br/>The Lion King was made at a time when Disney was booming. The 1980s wasn't exactly a great decade for Disney but what with The Little Mermaid, Aladdin and the best picture Oscar nominated Beauty and the Beast; Disney were thriving. So there was an expectancy behind The Lion King and watching it now, it does deliver on an entertaining and well told and well animated level. I laughed at some of the jokes, couldn't remember certain scenes and generally enjoyed it. But the film does feel like it is orientated at children more than adults. The general synopsis for the film does not rely on a love story like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast did but rather uses a theme of self discovery with a rather meek love plot entwined between Simba and Nala; the two lead lions of the narrative. This would suggest more of an infant target audience as the film would like to think it is educating young ones on how to face your fears and beat your demons etc.<br/><br/>But this isn't a criticism, merely an observation. Aladdin was as routine love story as you could ever get but it included the genie as a post-modern stroke of genius that made the adults laugh. Similarly; the complicated love story in Beauty and the Beast, full of emotions and situations kids won't have experienced yet had the items of furniture that amused and entertained on another level. In The Lion King, there is no get out clause; there is no escape hatch that the film can rely on to get across to two demographics. I suppose if Simba's journey of enlightenment is supposed to be aimed at adults then the buddy combination of Timon and Pumbaa are supposed to be kid orientated but I didn't see it entirely this way  yes Timon and Pumbaa seem adult enough but they remain too lacking in everything else what with the emphasis of toilet humour cropping up every now and again.<br/><br/>Like most Disney films, The Lion King suffers from its issues with race, religion, class and/or gender. People will deny it but that's only because they cannot see it. The lions in The Lion King are golden brown, beautiful and voiced by Americans; all apart from Scar who is brown with a black mane. It's no surprise that he is the 'evil' one and is consequently English, voiced by Jeremy Irons. There is also the shameful representation through the hyenas: one is Mexican, one is a mute retard and the other may well be voiced by an American (Goldberg) but in truth; the character is a big, black, loud, 'man-eater' of an animal. Watch Aladdin when the title character steals a loaf of bread and the representation of the fat black woman who hugs him whilst saying the line: ""Still I think he's ravishing!"" There is also the character of Timon who is the victim of Disney's most cruel representation. Timon's gender is confused; it is neither male nor female and his name is too ambiguous to be classed as one or the other. Timon is extremely effeminate and embodies very 'touchy-feely' traits around Pumbaa; frequently stroking his rear-end and stroking his nose and general facial area. Timon's voice actor Nathan Lane is also homosexual and I read that the line towards the end where the distraction tactic of 'dressing in drag and doing the hula' was improvised, further embodying homosexual traits on this character. Now; whilst my specific class/race/sexuality/etc. wasn't targeted to extremities (Scar was English, like I am but I'll look past that); I still feel these sorts of things are highly unnecessary in a film I've already established is child orientated.<br/><br/>The characters are also obsessed with food. There is frequent reference to food and hunger. The lionesses report no food which angers Scar, Pumbaa belches before announcing that he is 'starved' and the Hyenas live in a constant state of looking where the next meal will come from. There is also heavy emphasis on how Timon and Pumbaa get by on nourishment by eating bugs. Perhaps this is reference to Africa's state of affairs regarding health and food with the Ethiopian humanitarian crisis of the 1980s fresh in memory. The Lion King also suffers in its obvious plotting: the hero has a wrong belief but needs a mentor to come out of the blue to aid him in his correct quest which I found a little forced and unoriginal for a film made in 1994. But the message about the 'circle of life' and the ideas that you confront your demons when required is good with Mufasa himself saying ""I'm only brave when I need to be; I don't go looking for trouble."" The film clearly saying that picking fights is not a good idea.<br/><br/>The Lion King also has time to throw in a domestic relationship featuring Simba and Nala. They meet up; reminisce; Simba shows her around and to 'Can You Feel the Love Tonight', they make love before breaking up the morning afterwards. Incidentally, the sex is witnessed by Timon who displays disappointment and disgust. The Lion King is a somewhat strange film but has fun with its plot and its characters and is an enjoyable animation film on the whole with one or two tragic scenes particularly standing out in memory for me; both then in the cinema and now."

","being born in 1991 i was about 3 when I first watched The Lion King. I have not watched it since about 1997 so why do I believe myself to be in a position to comment on a film I barely remember watching? I remember the way it made me feel as I sat in the cinema. I freely admit that I cried when Mufassa died and cannot recall a second in the film that did not either amuse or move me. I am severely irritated by those who complain that the film is too scary and overrated. The film is not for you!!! It is so easy to inspire emotion in a little child and Lion King did so much of that. People who watched the film when they were 26 and complain about the 'lack of intricacies in the subplot' or the 'lack of consistent character development' should check themselves into a mental asylum. I guess I haven't watched Lion King for so long because i want to maintain the effect it had on me as a child.

"QueenMakeda84","Null","1","3","23 February 2004"," Another stereotype
","I first saw this movie when I was 10 and cried when Mustafa died. I loved it. However, I watch it as an adult and see some sad stuff. Disney has sought to create movies about various cultures. That's admirable, however, in this particular film about Africa, everyone is an animal. This links to the stereotype of Black beastiality. Also, the voices have only 2 black actors behind them and there's an English voice for Scar. Are they saying that Blacks can't even play themselves? This movie could have worked just as well with humans in Africa. Why wasn't that an option? Whites have all their numerous films, Native Americans got Pochahontas, People of Mideastern descent got Aladdin, Asians got Mulan, blacks get The Lion King. I see something quite wrong with that. I know that it's a beloved movie, but also think about what it's saying to little kids about Africa."
"zetes","5","3","22","22 February 2001"," a bit mundane
","The Lion King, while being consistently entertaining, ends up being kind of disappointing by the end. The reasons for this are many and varied.<br/><br/>First off, the film is very short. Only 88 minutes. I do not know why, but I thought that this film was supposed to be about 2 hours long. I think it is because I have always heard how much of an epic quality the film had. This is simply untrue. The film has very little in the way of script. Not much really happens in the film. You could probably sum up in only a couple of sentences.<br/><br/>The characters and situations of the film are somewhat trite. It is unfair to dismiss this category of criticism because this a children's cartoon. The heroes and villains of other Disney films are much less formulaic, as well as the challenges they encounter (e.g., The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, Beauty and the Beast).  Simba's challenge was a bit interesting, but, as I complained above, it is brought up and resolved in a half-hour's time. The only characters I found really interesting were the villains, and not Scar, but the Heyenas.<br/><br/>It is this third complaint which actually pushed me into the realm of disliking this film: the music. I've always felt that the music of Disney's animated fare was bad. There are three exceptions I can think of offhand: The Little Mermaid, Pinnochio, and the Jungle Book. All other Disney animated films have a collection of some of the worst music that has ever been produced. I think The Lion King takes the cake for general rottenness in the music department. There was not one song that did not make me cringe.<br/><br/>All in all, surely the Lion King is okay for kids, but there are so many better films, even from Disney's canon, that one should expose their children to. My suggestions are any of those Disney films I've listed as good above. As for non-Disney films, I think My Neighbor Totoro (age range 2-10, I would say) and Kiki's Delivery Service (age range 6-18; the best lessons ever of responsibility and self-reliance are found in this film), both from Japan but also both easily available in any video store dubbed into English, are the two best films for children ever made. Also, The Prince of Egypt is pretty good for slightly older children (I would put The Lion King in the 3-8 age range and The Prince of Egypt from 9-13). I give The Lion King 5/10 = good for children, pretty uninteresting to adults."
"cdood","7","1","4","8 January 2014"," Fairly Overrated (Especially compared to other movies)
","This is a wonderful movie, I must say, overall, the best children's movie I can think of! But it's overrated, especially in comparison to other movies: shortly below The Lion King, is To Kill a Mockingbird, an American classic, while the movie is certainly not as good as the book, I can promise you, it is far more thoughtful, intelligent, and overall deep than The Lion King, that is just considering the story, but I don't think the animators broke any new ground. Contrary to popular belief this is most certainly not the greatest Disney movie, American Disney, kids Disney, yes... However, over in Japan, lies Studio Ghibli, I suppose comparable to Pixar, in its association w/ Disney. And they have made Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke,and be cautioned they are not children's films. And if you look online you'll find several people who can point out that several Disney movies are essentially just kid's versions of many classic and original Shakespeare plays."

","My comments may contain some SPOILERS. I believe everyone knows the story already, but please take note, you may not want to read further if you have not seen ""The Lion King.""<br/><br/>The Lion King follows a formula similar to other Disney animated movies, like Tarzan and Dinosaur. An orphaned baby is raised by a strange species, the baby eventually grows up to figure out what his real role is, then fights and beats an erstwhile 'leader' to claim the 'leader of the pack.' In this movie, Simba (voiced by Matthew Broderick) is next in line for king, after his father Mufasa (voiced by James Earl Jones). But evil uncle Scar (Jeremy Irons) wants to be king, cooperates with hyenas, causes a stampede forcing Mufasa to rescue young cub Simba, Mufasa dies at the paws of his brother Scar, who then tells Simba to run, assuming the hyenas will eat him. The cub eludes the hyenas through a brier patch, but almost dies in the desert, buzzards surround him, when a weasel and his warthog come along, the warthog butts the birds out of the way, yelling ""bowling for buzzards!""<br/><br/>So, the unlikely pair befriend young Simba, and he grows up into a magnificent young lion, spitting image of his dad. (The young Dinosaur had been raised by lemurs, the young Tarzan by apes, similar themes.) Meanwhile Scar as king causes all the animals but hyenas to leave, their home becomes a desolate wasteland. Simba is lured back by his ""duty"" after seeing an image of dad in the clouds, challenges Scar, mates with his cub hood girlfriend, and a new cub is presented. ""The circle of life.""

"Spleen","10","1","4","29 September 1999"," Simple, effective African panorama
","When this first came out I thought it was a disappointing follow-up to `Aladdin'.  Shows how much *I* know.<br/><br/>Perhaps I simply found it hard to classify - it's not a fairytale, it's not (whatever they tell you) a cousin to `Hamlet' - in a way it's not a human story of any kind.  It's moving only in the way in which a nature documentary is moving (although it's certainly not a nature documentary). Our attachment to Simba is the kind of attachment we'd have to any young animal followed around by the camera - we wouldn't be nearly so attached if he were a human rather than a lion.<br/><br/>But what the film lacks in humanity it makes up in grandeur, so that's okay. The artwork is spectacular.  I've never seen an animated film so convincingly sunlit: without giving us photo-realistic lighting, it makes us feel the bright African sun on our skin.  Character animation is as good as you'd expect and needs no praise from me.  (The lions are actually among the least smoothly moving creatures on display, but that's what you'd expect from members of the ruling class.)  And note the clever way the film's realistic style is cross-bred with a child's colouring book style in the `Can't Wait to Be King' sequence - it's just so very well done that we couldn't care less if the sequence is a touch contrived.  If the Disney studio has done anything recently to capture the verve of the Pink Elephants sequence in `Dumbo', this is it.<br/><br/>I'm not those who think this is Disney's best animated film (it's in the top ten, for whatever that may be worth), and I STILL find it hard to classify, but it's a perfect example of whatever it is."

","Simply put, ""The Lion King"" sucks. I am so sick of people praiseing this movie like its the best thing since color TV. After watching several Disney films from the 60's, 80's, and 90's, I STILL fail to see way this movie is like some people's bible. I don't think this film is any where near the best Disney film. It had great art quality and an excellent proformance by James Earl Jones, and Matthew Broderick. Thats it. Everything else about it sucked. The story was so weak, I was bored before I new it. The more the public praises this movie, the more I hate this movie. If you want the best Disney movies, try TARZAN, ALADDIN, or THE LITTLE MERMAID. Any one who thinks this is the best disney movie is basicly an idiot/moron. I think people should watch at LEAST 25 Disney classics before they start picking out ""BEST DISNEY MOVIES"". I have seen several and Lion King is fare from the best. For example, if Jurassic Park was the only Dinosaur movie you had ever seen, It world be idiotic to say that it is the ""BEST DINOSAUR MOVIE"" ever. To say such a thing, you would have to see several other Dinosaur movies first."

"Atreyu_II","7","1","5","17 January 2010"," The end of an era...
","The 32nd animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known films. It is considered by many 'the best' of Disney. I don't agree with that, there are better films. But still, it is the last of a kind.<br/><br/>I first saw it in the cinema in December 1994, with my parents, sister, godfather and his wife and kids. I was 10 at the time. It was in a cinema I used to go many times back then and which I first saw other Disney films, like 'Aladdin' and 'Beauty and the Beast', for example.<br/><br/>The original 1994 version is the true version for me. The version with that dumb 'Morning Report' scene has no reason to exist and is completely unnecessary. Seriously, did they think that people were really gonna accept that? Aside that it's the same movie but why changing a movie, even if it's only for 1 minute?<br/><br/>The beauty of the artwork is one of the film's best attributes. It shows us beautiful landscapes of Africa and includes, among other things, the gorgeous sunrises and sunsets characteristic of Africa. We know this takes place somewhere in Africa but we don't know where exactly. They call it ""Pride Lands"" in the film...<br/><br/>The lions and lionesses are extremely well drawn and handsome and their roars are very realistic, so much that I wonder if they used real lions in stage or if it was very talented people roaring like that.<br/><br/>Simba is very pretty and cute as a lion cub and grows looking similar to his father. Mufasa always fascinated me and even now he still fascinates me: he is a gorgeous lion, powerful, with an imposing and majestic figure, a strong voice, a brutal strength and an amazing physique. Mufasa really is a 'Sir Lion'.<br/><br/>Scar is one of the great Disney villains and he really has that cold and harsh look on his face and eyes.<br/><br/>Timon and Pumba are two goofy but funny characters. They are clearly stupid, but more of a comic relief than anything else. I don't particularly like the hyenas, but Ed is a funny one, perhaps for being a mute character like Dopey ('Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs') and Gideon ('Pinocchio'). It's hilarious when Ed laughs hysterically because of the way Mufasa scared them away.<br/><br/>However, Mufasa's death is one of the most severe things for a child to watch and the sequence itself is depressing, easy to make some tears come to our eyes.<br/><br/>As for the voice cast, talents vary, but some do an excellent job, like James Earl Jones as Mufasa, Jonathan Taylor Thomas as infant Simba, Jeremy Irons as Scar and Rowan Atkinson as Zazu.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is great. It has two versions of 'Circle of Life' and 'Can you feel the love tonight'. In the case of 'Circle of Life', I like both versions. In the case of 'Can you feel the love tonight', I prefer Elton John's version.<br/><br/>I also enjoy the songs 'Hakuna Matata', 'The Lion Sleeps Tonight', 'Be Prepared' and the silly song 'Asante sana squash banana', but I adore 'I Just Can't Wait To Be King' and those instrumental-vocal songs which resemble African sounds and at the same time they have this dark feeling in them. The movie's environment is a mix of paradise and darkness."

","This was one of the first modern animated movies I had seen and I did enjoy it. I went into watching this thinking I wouldn't like it at all and did so that's a plus.<br/><br/>I liked this movie in many ways. Obviouysly it was very sweet and touching and the complete aura of realism was there for an animated picture. There were moments I cried, the story was just so touching and I can see why this movie was..is.. so big.<br/><br/>However, as much as I liked it, I don't think it was as good as Shrek(just my opinion-I KNOW many will disagree with me on this one!)Shrek probably makes my 50 top films ever. Lion King however was a major influence for me because had I not liked it, I may not have given other similar films a chance.<br/><br/>One thing about Lion King. It was heavier then I thought it would be. There's some tough to watch scenes and I was a little surprised they'd be there in a movie that so many children would be seeing. I was expecting a much lighter movie but it was a beautiful film.<br/><br/>However, although I wouldn't put this in the same category as Shrek(meaning, for me, I wouldn't necessarily want to watch it over and over as with Shrek) I'd still give it a well above average rating. Lion King was an extremely well done, moving picture."

","I'm probably alone on this, but the music was just corny. Too broadway for my taste. Just not sure why this gets so much praise. It totally lacks the magic old Disney films had.<br/><br/>Just when something decent started they jumped into a dance and a song. Not much of a fan of musicals, so this didn't help.<br/><br/>Why does one lion speak with an American accent but his brother (scar) with an English one? Did they not spend two seconds thinking about these things? All the voices were done so woodenly. Did they just read off a paper without any natural delivery. Because of the bad acting and it just didn't connect on a real BELIEVABLE emotional level. Whenever you see (hear in this case) bad acting it almost becomes a joke.<br/><br/>There was just a lack of story and character development. It. It went too quick into the conflict between the two lion brothers and then it seemed non-stop trying to kill Simba and the King. The story was just the wrong one, OR, it was just poorly structured and executed. They should have started it with Simba and his friendship and follow him as he learns the ways of the jungle. Instead we got 40 minutes of them trying to kill him before we even get some remotely interesting.<br/><br/>Just because it's animation doesn't mean you need to throw out basic story telling. This was just too simple and not in a good way, but in a hollow way.<br/><br/>The amount of praise this has gotten is a reflection of how little it takes to impress people."

The most dreadful thing about the film, though, is the music. Horrible ""modern"" pop does not work for me and Elton John /Tim Rice combo was a bad choice for writers. I am watching it now as I type and like it even less than I thought I did. I guess an old curmudgeon like me was never the target audience for this as I am aware of it's huge success with most of the cinema-going public. I hanker for the days of Pinocchio, Snow White and Bambi - they never seemed to be as cynical as this movie. They were made with love and commitment rather than an exercise in multimedia marketing."

","Animated feature films...nobody does 'em better than Disney.  The Lion King is not at the top of the pack, though.  The story is a little on the dark side, and fails to get a grip on the morality it intends to impart.  Somehow the food chain does not lend itself to chirpy song-and-dance.  Especially if you're pretty far down it.<br/><br/>Also the characterizations (with the exception of Irons' Scar) are not up to the high standards of the Disney organization.

","Well, once more I'm revisiting an old Disney movie that I haven't seen in a while but had memorized years ago.  And, again, I do not know what to say about our old buddy, Simba.<br/><br/>First the good news.  This is still a great looking movie.  The opening sequence is still one of the most breathtaking pieces of animation ever made.  The score is also phenominal.<br/><br/>However, of all the Disney movies of the early 90's, this is the one that has aged the least well.  The story really isn't all that original (can anyone say _Hamlet_?), and the characters are too derivative from other characters who were popular at the time (Timon and Pumbaa are essentially the nuetered Ren and Stimpy).  Furthermore, the much hyped celeberaty voice-overs are very distracting.  Who the hell casts Rowan ""Mr. Bean"" Atkinson for his *voice*?<br/><br/>When all is said and done, ""Lion King"" makes for good eye-candy, but not much else."
"phueytoo","3","1","12","23 November 2012"," Too dark for kids
","I know that this movie is absolutely atmospheric and the image detail and score are wonderful (hence the 3 stars) but as a Disney animation for the family, it is NOT appropriate for kids 6 years and under. I have an almost-6-year-old daughter and a 4-and-a-half year old and they aren't wimps, but The Lion King had far too much tension, dark moments, chase/fire scenes for them. My daughters couldn't even finish the movie, I had to turn it off before half way. <br/><br/>However, for +10 year olds it is fine. I remember watching it when I was 16 and really enjoyed it (but I wasn't bothered with watching it again: another reason it gets less than five stars, I only give more than 5 stars to movies I want to and have watched more than once)."

","The adulation this flick receives completely mystifies me.

Commercial alchemy on this level is rare indeed, and try as it might the Mouse-House hasn't been able to top ""The Lion King"" yet.  <br/><br/>(As for the animation itself, it's impressive but far too grounded in realism.  Give me the lines and angles of ""101 Dalmatians"" any day.)<br/><br/>Spun so neatly, ""The Lion King"" is a cinematic confection- tasty as cotton candy and with just about as much texture."

Although I still give it a five, I think that it is unquestionably the worst Disney epic ever.  I find the music to be extremely forgettable, if not downright irritating at some points, and the plotline erratic.  And don't get me started about the nonexistent love story which we are supposed to buy.  This movie also breaks several Disney rules which I have come to expect, like the mysterious singing from the heavens (almost all Disney epics have all the music sung by actual characters).

","The whole process of the film is easy, the whole process is like a comedy, but the character of Simba, but let me see an adult world-compete for power and profit. At that time, I was thinking in my heart, what kind of person would I be if I leave my parents and my hometown after that? Am I going to be that little lion?<br/><br/>Now when I grow up, I understand that everyone has their own emotions in their lives. It's just that we will be aware of ourselves consciously, and better use our emotions to develop our advantages. When Simba saw Mufasa leaving, he was desperate, and he roared loudly, ""No"". Such scenes made me cry, and I really felt that my mother was so great. Later, I realized that between children and parents is responsible for each other 's lives. Raising children is a responsibility and life experience, not deliberate. If you want your child to repay yourself, you should not impose your unfulfilled life aspirations on the child. More should be to let go, and let go more and more every day until you can only see his back.<br/><br/>Looking at ""The Lion King"" again, what I saw is no longer the same. When I saw Xiao Simba, I always thought that I had killed my father. When facing this pain, he chose to use the method that everyone would use-escape . I don't want to start in front of others. I have to suffer every time I have to go through it. This may be the way most of us deal with problems in reality. When faced with a problem, I want to avoid it, instead of thinking about the result I want, and what can I do to solve the problem.<br/><br/>Choosing to escape will only become an unfinished experience. Pain will live in your body forever. When you touch it, it will hurt. We can only truly face our unfinished experience, discover it, and experience it. Will really take away such pain.<br/><br/>No matter when, what we need to do is to face all the problems bravely, accept everything happening, live a good life every day, look forward, no matter whether your past is good or bad, the achievements are today 's you, that You want to be you in the future.<br/><br/>To borrow the most classic passage from ""The Lion King"": Some people live to the age of 75 but never stop at the age of 25; some people play countless ways of life, some people copy the same day countless times. Therefore, growth and suffering should bring ""results"", not ""consequences""."

I really like the way Scar looks in this movie - his design is so likeable. There are dozens of other Disney villains, but I don't think anyone of them comes close to Scar. Just look at the things he has done in this movie. He's willing to take down his own family just so he can rule. Which other Disney villain comes close? That's how great The Lion King actually is. Scar is what makes this movie succeed. I don't know about you, but I actually wanted Scar to win, and be the new king. Maybe because Scar was fit enough to lead and rule, but that just proves how dark and menacing Scar actually was. Scar is the one that likes to be in power that's for sure.

The songs, too, are often out-of-place and serve to tell instead of show, or do a combination of the two, and they tend to point out the flaws in the narrative more than gloss over them, though most are enjoyable to listen to in-the-moment and all are well-produced. It really is the lack of a real connection, however, perpetuated by a poor through-line and pace, that makes this one fall short of the pedestal upon which it has been placed. It didn't connect with me and I found a large portion of the piece quite dull, making for a passive affair that didn't live up to the hype or even keep me wholly engaged for its duration. 5/10"

Two of the songs were big hits in the 90's.<br/><br/>So before I get on TLK's faults I will start with the good. The Lion King has great animation. It was Disney's best animation to date and most 2D movies never came close to surpassing TLK style animation. <br/><br/>Now for the characters. I love Timon and Pumbaa. These two were great comedy relief for this film. I loved Mufasa and I hate that he had to die, but I realize that it was an important part of the film, involving the theme of Shakespeare's Hamlet. Rafiki is also quite funny. And those loathsome but lovable hyenas. The only characters I don't like are the main ones. Simba is annoying as a cub and even more as an adult. He's so stubborn as an adult that he has to have sense knocked into him about his past, instead of just finding out his destiny for himself. And the villain Scar, comes off as too weak.<br/><br/>I guess my biggest problem with TLK is that, it is simply overrated. All the merchandise that was pumped out for this movie and its sequels was massive. I don't think Frozen could come close to the explosion of Lion King toys.<br/><br/>On a whole TLK is not a horrible movie, I just don't think it is Disney's best. Most people do and that's fine. I think Beauty and The Beast is better than TLK. But don't take my word for it if you feel differently."

The animation is great, the songs are fun, and it has an interesting plot line. I was intrigued throughout the entire movie and I quite enjoyed the ending.

","I have the Diamond Edition of this movie on Blu-Ray and even to this day, The Lion King is one of the greatest movies that Disney has ever made. This is the movie gave Disney Renaissance a big name, a story based on Shakespeare's 'Hamlet', with great actors like James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Nathan Lane. Many memorable songs written by Elton John and Tim Rice, like 'Hakuna Matata' and 'Can You Feel The Love Tonight' that to this day, even the younger viewers of classic Disney films love to listen too. This movie has to be one greatest animated movies of all time and its certainly one of my favourite films ever. Their are a few dark scenes that children from around 1-5 would get scared of, so this movie is good for kids around 8 - 12, but its a movie for everyone, if you're a fan of classic Disney movies then I suggest to see this movie, buy it on DVD or Blu-Ray its still in stores."
"myungjahigh","7","0","1","29 February 2012"," to be, or not to be, that is the question?
","When i watched The Lion King for the first time, it was about 15 years ago. I was very young, and the death of Mufasa made me cry. And this year, I went to the cinema to watch The Lion King 3D. I had thought I would not cry this time, but i was wrong. I cried again in the same scene. It is still an awesome animation. <br/><br/>through watching it, i felt this movie is actually based on Hamlet, which is kind of orthodox now. The basic story lines of the two are pretty much similar. Simba and Hamlet went through their fathers' death whose responsibility is on their uncles, and they try to fight against the evil uncles. Dead fathers' shapes make them feel guilty by keeping saying ""remember."" Still, the two works are different at the same time. Simba overcame all the problems and revenged his father. The Lion King ended happily ever after, unlike Hamlet. The differences are from the existence of Timon and Pumbaa, no doubt. The tragic question ""To be, or not to be"" gets replaced with ""Hakuna Matata,"" and the fact makes the wholly different endings. The two amazing and priceless friends are truly huge parts of the movie.<br/><br/>This time when i watched it, I felt sorry for Scar a little bit. When i was young, Scar was an absolute villain to me, but i think Scar could be a pathetic thing which desperately desired to be a king. (anyway he definitely did wrong things) maybe I grew too much. Just as Spring comes after Winter, as Simba has his son, i hope the pure days come to me again."

This movie has everything. Extremely detailed and breath-taking visuals. A complex and twisting plot. Wonderful and catchy music. Characters you'll fall in love with. And morals that make you realize so many things about our world. I also love how this movie has so many relations to Shakepeare's Hamlet and even a scene that reminds you of Hitler. I cry every time I see Simba tying to wake his murdered father, Mufasa. Hate boils up inside of me every time I see Scar using his deceptions. I laugh every time I see Pumba and Timon or Ed the hyena's face (Seriously, just looking at Ed makes me burst out laughing). Simba and Nala's cubhood adventures and friendship-turned-into-romance were great. The Circle of Life is probably the best lesson I've learned in my life.

","After The Aristocats in 1970, Disney studios went into a long period of indifferent features, particularly their animated films (though the live-action productions - like Popeye - weren't so hot either!) However, their fortunes turned with a series of four major winners in a row. The trend was set by The Little Mermaid in 1989, and rapidly followed-up with Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King. The Lion King may well be the best Disney film since the early masterpieces like Dumbo and Pinnochio.<br/><br/> Story deals with young lion cub Simba, the heir to a great, thriving animal community in Africa. Consumed by jealousy, Simba's sinister Uncle Scar murders the current king Mufasa, cleverly making the death look accidental, and encourages Simba to run away. Years go by, during which Simba befriends a couple of free-spirited animals (Timon and Pumbaa), while Scar's newly inherited kingdom falls apart under his tyrannical and inept leadership. Eventually, Simba figures out his rightful place and returns to challenge his treacherous uncle.<br/><br/> The animation is quite breathtaking at times, but The Lion King is much more than 80 minutes of pretty pictures. It has a simple but totally engrossing story, which builds to several powerful and emotional climaxes. It also has terrific voice acting, with James Earl Jones lending true gravity to Mufasa, and Jeremy Irons doing a splendidly slimy job as the despicable Scar. On a comedy level, Timon and Pumbaa are wonderful and actually provide some good adult humour to keep the grown-up viewers tittering (a tactic which was used even more successfully in the 2003 hit Finding Nemo). The Lion King is an exhilarating animated film - fabulous characters, fabulous story, fabulous songs.... fabulous entertainment!"

The humor was great and well-done. Everytime I see Pumbaa talk, I always laugh. He had great jokes and same with Rafiki's jokes.

"Jeremy Bristol","7","0","2","1 January 2004"," Just some thoughts on Scar (possible spoilers)
","This is probably why J.R.R. Tolkien was so against the use of allusions: has anybody noticed paradox of making Scar--through a song and dance routine, no less!--a Hitler-figure?  If he were really akin to Hitler, wouldn't he be creating a scapegoat race--or in this case, a scapegoat species--and run around killing all of them (or more likely having them killed) for the sake of the purity of the species?  Instead, he makes an agreement with the hyenas--who are hated by everybody in the pure Prideland--and actually honors his promise to them until the tide finally turns so far against him that he has no other way to survive than to finally make them the scapegoat. Also, Hitler was a great propagandist (I mean that in the most derogatory way possible), and I'm sure he built up the hatred against the Jews/gays/blacks/gypsies/etc. for a number of years before the genocides actually started.  As a propogandist, Scar makes a lousy Hitler (again, spoken sarcastically): he brings in the SS hyenas immediately, as if he expected them to suspect his murder of Mufasa and retaliate against him; instead (though in the script they don't) everyone should have suspected him, as his little speech and the sudden appearance of the hyenas could only have been planned well ahead of Mufasa's death (*smack*smack*smack* quick round of knocking the lions' heads together for their stupidity).  Someone as slick as Scar is supposed to have been should have known better than that; it is only the sheer dumbness of the lions and their supposed fear of the pitiful little hyenas that allows his assassination/coup to come off without a hitch. <br/><br/>Going along with that, Scar is portrayed as being far too obviously evil, so much so that it's hard to believe nobody but Mufasa and Simba though that he was power-hungry and back-stabbing before he murdered Mufasa (though if Mufasa didn't realize it during the confrontation scene after Simba's ceremony, then somebody needs to have smacked him upside the head and yelled, ""Duh!"").  I suppose you could call that a gaping plot hole (or at least a major lack of good judgment of character) that Mufasa would expect for his brother to help him.  Obviously, Scar is meant to be a Shakespearean-type villain, like Ursula and Jafaar before him, but he is really too lacking.  NEWS FLASH TO DISNEY: Yes, Shakespeare's villains are obvious to the audience, but that's because there were scenes where their deceptions are revealed only to the audience, not to the characters being deceived!<br/><br/>At least Ursula made her snide comments under her breath in asides.<br/><br/>Besides Scar, a great movie.  Look for his amusing cameo in Hercules--a fate worthy of Hitler."

","This is my second favorite Disney film (next to Dumbo, only because that was my childhood favorite).  I watched the new DVD recently, and it's just amazing as always.  From the wonderful opening sequence to the inspiring finale, this movie is perfect from beginning to end.<br/><br/>While computer animation seems to be getting all the attention lately, The Lion King is just as beautiful and amazing as the latest Pixar films.  The soundtrack is just absolutely amazing.  Every song is catchy and very memorable.  Hans Zimmer's score puts you right back in the movie.  Thank goodness I have my Lion King soundtrack!<br/><br/>The characters are great too.  Who doesn't remember the classic scene where Mufasa appears to Simba?!  On the other side, Scar makes for a very treacherous and diabolical villain.

"MercurioKnight","Null","0","1","15 October 2003"," Likeable, but clearly overrated...
","Let me start by saying I did not watch it back when it was in theaters. I'd seen pieces here and there, but I don't think I have ever seen the whole thing before. With that said, let me also state that I am not a fan of Disney's work in the past 10-15 years, with a few noted exceptions.<br/><br/>
So, I said hey, it's there. I'll give it a shot (roommate had bought it, no skin off my back). I watched the film. I got certain impressions. Many areas felt like other animated works that I enjoyed much more, namely the original Land Before Time (not the crappy sequels) and Aladdin. While these impressions might make a film more favourable in some cases, or maybe in the long run, here I just couldn't shake them long enough to sit down and watch the film with my full attention.<br/><br/>Impressions aside, going back after the special features and watching it with the audio commentary (which isn't even listed on the box like most films that have one do -a nice surprise, actually), it gave me the feeling that the score and music had much to blame for taking me out of the film.<br/><br/>
The first small stretch is nicely woven together, setting up the characters and themes. I love the African choir at the beginning and almost wish they'd have just gone with that rather than mixing it with the 'Circle of Life' song. Still, I can deal with that. No problem... but then, since I ended up watching the Special Edition version of the film on first viewing (which, if I ever watch the film again I will avoid), that mediocre blah 'Morning Report' song came on. I was immediately thrown out of the film's world. The same thing happened sitting through that 'Can't wait to be king' (which went out of its way to 'show' the view of Simba throughout, further distancing me from the film), and Scar's baddie villian song that, while nicely animated, was simply a forgettable experience. I didn't even remember the animation during Scar's song until I watched the commentary track with the song itself thankfully turned down far enough to avoid distraction.<br/><br/>
I know, I'm being harsh. The film does have a few memorable musical elements such as Hakuna Matata, Can You Feel The Love Tonight, the Afican voice choir, and even, to a smaller extent, the Circle of Life song. Plus the brief reference songs were nice. It's not that the other songs are 'bad', by no means, but they just sound like the same recycled mediocrocy found in too many other disney films of the past 20 years. I've just gotten tired of it; so for me, it majorly detracts from the film.<br/><br/>There are quite a few other animated works that have distinct songs that are great all around. Even seeing the preview for the special edition of Marry Poppins instantly brought me back to that film. All the songs in it were great and memorable. Sure, Lion King, 3 out of 5-6 aint bad, right? Not when you have to sit through the other 2-3 songs to watch the movie, and I'm not one that likes fastforwarding.<br/><br/>Finally, on the music side, in the special features it played other pieces of music by the composer of the African choir moments of the film which sounded much more appropriate and had a more unique feel to them than the mediocre songs of the film. Why not integrate more of that kind of music? It did so well to pull you into the world in the opening sequence, and yet, songs like 'Can't wait to be king' and Scar's villiany song made it in when the other inspired music couldn't have found a place?<br/><br/>Another minor gripe; while I can go with and even love many of the voice talents, I just can't get past Whoopie Goldberg's voice. I enjoy her performances in the live action arena. It's not only such a distinctive voice, but for some reason I can't get past that voice being connected with any other face. Everyone else is fine, from James Earl Jones, which has been Darth Vader's voice ever since I can remember, to Cheech, who just seems to have, as a person, many faces (like in From Dusk Till Dawn and other Rodrigous pictures). Every line Whoopie spoke just took me out of it.<br/><br/>
Artistry wise - There's so many nice pieces of work done in the film... certain scenes that I just was kind of too distracted before to take a full appreciation of until I went through the special features. The special features detailing some of these processes was both interesting and did well in pulling me further into what made the film come together.<br/><br/>
Going through the special features has given me a deep respect for the material and the talents behind it. Infact, I enjoy the the elements that went into making the film probably more than the film itself. I wish I could just edit the film myself or they could have done a Special Limited Edition that would take out those detracting songs and have another voice talent to replace Whoopie.<br/><br/>Musicals, especially animated ones, have to always be careful in their song direction, and I think The Lion King would have worked better as not being a musical. You could still have the 3 songs that would have been nominated, since the only characters that sung in those were Timon and Pumba (who wrapped up Simba in their sing-a-long), two off the wall characters that could get away with singing even in a nonmusical.<br/><br/>Aladdin SE DVD is coming out next year and I honestly can't wait. With such a great treatment for Lion King Platinum DVD set, it looks like finally the time to pick up Aladdin and any other favourable disney films coming up."

"Angry_Arguer","Null","0","1","3 September 2003"," I liked this movie...for the first minute
","The Lion King starts with the best work by Disney.  Not since Bambi have I seen an attention to detail in the lifelike attitude of nature.  Hans Zimmer's music in the opening is very traditional and lends a strong edge, until the English lyrics for ""Circle of Life"" kick in and I grabbed my ears in disgust.  From then on, it's all downhill.  What starts as a beautiful documentary winds up another typical Disney movie in the fashion of The Little Mermaid.  O, how I miss the inventive days of Dragonslayer.<br/><br/>If the ""music video"" aspects of this (made, no doubt, to suit the tykes brought in by their weekend parents) had been chopped, as had most of the cornball dialog, this would have been a very powerful version of Hamlet. Instead we get a load of Disney cartoon colors splashed about like a Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse short and some really terrible songs.  The artistry level of the opening only returns once more during the stampede, but even then it is ruined by the mood.<br/><br/>Notice the subtext of female subordination that Disney includes here.  This is certainly not in the same league as Ridley Scott or James Cameron, but is shocking enough since this isn't quite the same as Aladdin.  I should add that this has to be the best animated Disney feature since The Rescuers Down Under, not like that means anything.<br/><br/>Overall, I was disappointed by this rendition.  Ever since this movie, Disney has turned to Pixar for the animating skill.  Thankfully, that means no more godawful songs we the audience have to sit through.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","...but not this one.  The Lion King is Disney at its family-oriented BEST! This is one of its few films in recent decades that belongs with its classics!  The animation is great, the voice-acting superb, and the characters...well, quite animated!  Don't just rent this one, it's a keeper."

","dp10:<br/><br/>I think when you made the comment about the TLK-Hamlet similarity, you were referring to my previous comment. I think you should know that I was not objecting to the fact that TLK adapted Hamlet, I was objecting to the fact that Disney did not properly recognize Shakespeare for giving them an adaptation (the same goes for Kimba the White Lion). They could adapt all they want, but cite it, or else its plagiarism...sucks doesn't it? If you plagiarize in college, you get expelled and earn a scar on your permanent record, but Disney did it with this and got nothing but praise...so anyways, that was my real complaint."

","I think that it is one of the greatest Disney's movies af all time. BEAUTY AND THE BEAST is the best of all, I think.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the music, all the songs and most of the characters, specially Timon and the hyenas.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't like in this movie is the spiritism it carries in some scenes (like Simba talking to his dead father )<br/><br/>But in spite of all, it's a great movie."
"Lho3323370","Null","0","1","14 July 2001"," Hilarious!
","My teacher and his preschooler watched this film everyday for four weeks. Well Simba is born and it makes Scar upset. Well Scar and his 3 pet hyenas Shenzi, Banzai, And Ed kill Mufassa. If Simba is to defeat all 4 of them he must take his place in the circle of life. Zazu Scar's companion does whatever Scar orders him to do. Well Nala comes to warn him that Scar let the hyenas take over the kingdom."
"jigoku","Null","0","1","25 June 2001"," Yet another American film with a 'borrowed' story.
","Boring film, based on a classic Japanese manga/animation series from the 60s: Osamu Tezuka's 'Kimba, the White Lion' which was broadcasted in the USA in the 60s and 70s. Of course the Disney guys tried to deny the totally obvious similarities, but you just have to take a look at the original... Ignore this crap and watch the original."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","0","2","4 April 2001"," ""Slimy, yet satisfying.""
","Okay that's a bit of an unfair quote, as The Lion King is that rarest of beasts: a really good Disney movie. Packed with all the formula highs of past successes (including, Bambi-style, the bizarre kiddie favourite of a murdered parent. What does that say about infant psychology?), yet its sentiment tempered with an Eastern outlook, this is a worthwhile picture.<br/><br/>Cute, but never so that it's twee and self-conscious like most of the studio's output, the animation is more sophisticated than the now-creaky ""classics"", yet it steers clear of the more angular, abstract pieces of late. This is a traditional cartoon, and all the better for it. If there's a complaint then it's perhaps the too-brief running time, stretching to little over eighty minutes. This is particularly evident when Simba grows from cub to lion within ten seconds, though the film does contain the requisite three acts.<br/><br/>Some great vocal characterisation (Whoopi Goldberg's hyena even strangely looks like her), but I'm not sure about Scar though. So named because he's facially disfigured, he's also darker than the other lions, complete with black mane and has an English accent. Three Hollywood villain stereotypes for the price of one. Though as the voice in question belongs to the superb Jeremy Irons this isn't too much of an issue, and he does meld the film with a darker element. In particular the (delightful, mind) SS symbolism of Scar's army during the best song, ""Be Prepared"". The reference would be lost on the child audience, so it's pitched to the adults. I wonder how many holocaust survivors would find this in good taste?<br/><br/>There are some decent jokes, many puns on the nature of lions  ""As far as brains go, I got the lion's share""; ""I'm gonna be the mane event""; ""my words are a matter of pride""  and ""What's eating you?"" ""Nuthin', he's at the top of the food chain."" The rite of passage plot is as generic as the majority of the songs, yet both are loveable in context. I don't know if Buddhists would approve of their philosophies being transformed into Mickey Mouse morals and tracks by Elton John, but it still works in a naive way. Odd too how the lions accept the nature of karma and respect for all animals. Whenever I watch a Richard Attenborough show they're always tearing out zebras' hearts with their bare teeth. Still, I suppose they had to keep it a U certificate somehow...<br/><br/>Some movie referencing combined with violence towards the end are dubious occurrences. Yet that and a couple of fart gags not withstanding, this is an innocuous affair that epitomises family entertainment. 7/10."
"cshaun","10","0","1","19 October 1999"," An all time Disney classic
","Disney's The Lion King is one of those movies that is just perfect. The film's story is absolutely amazing.<br/><br/>But the story was amazing then the soundtrack, music and voice acting are outstanding!! With an all star cast, consisting of some of Hollywood's best such as Whoopi Goldberg, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons and Rowan Atkinson, Disney has definitely hired the best.<br/><br/>However it is the soundtrack and music that takes the cake. Produced by Tim Rice and Elton John, the soundtrack is the best I've heard in a Disney film.<br/><br/>For those of you who have missed the opportunity to see on the big screen, get it on video NOW!! because The Lion King is truly Disney's best and that says a lot."
"Abi C","10","0","1","4 September 1999"," Good Comments
","The Lion King is a very good film for adults or children. It features an excellent storyline and a brilliant musical soundtrack. The characters are well thought out and the animation is amazing. Well worth buying. Definately ten out of ten!"
"simba-18","10","0","1","20 July 1999"," Greatest Disney film ever. They should have quit after this one.
","Anyone who doesn't love this movie has no heart and must be dead inside. Maybe they didn't get to see this one on the big screen and only saw the video version.  ""Lion King"" had me mesmerized from the opening, with the sun coming up over the savanna.  I saw this the day it opened and in the theater, at the end, people stood up and cheered!!  This movie deserves theatrical re-release.  Disney,  ARE YOU LISTENING???  Do yourselves a favor and put this back where it belongs, on the big screen."
"Peter T. Movie","Null","0","2","27 June 1999"," Why is this the most popular Disney movie?
","It seems like the public is saying that this is the best Disney can do or has ever done. Why? Because this movie is more appealing to adults than it is to kids. In my opinion The Lion King really isn't all that great. Why? hears why. The story stinks, a lot of the dailogue is stupid (especially with Timon and Pumbaa), and its just not fun to watch. To be totally honest, I think that Aladdin should be the most popular Disney movie. Aladdin is the only Disney movie in which I can't find anything to grip about. The Lion King does, however, have SOME things going for it, like great art quality, good characters and okay music, But this movie really doesn't deserve to be the most popular Disney movie. I give this movie a 7 out of 10."
"GluStick","10","0","2","28 March 1999"," Great movie. Sort of.
","Ok, I need to get something off my chest. This was a really good movie. However, it isn't THE best Disney movie. That award goes to Toy Story. All in all, it's worth buying but if you want the best movie out there, you might want to buy another movie. The animation is really great though. Watch the willdebeest running while Simba runs as fast as he can. If you have surround sound, it will sound like you have animals running through your living room. I guess what I find to be weak parts to this movie is the fact that it couldn't have a better script than Toy Story or Hercules. Where's the comedy??? All the voices are done pretty good and Jeremy Irons was really good as the menacing villian. It's good if you have nothing better to do on a sunny or rainy afternoon."
