"dirty_chords","8","453","611","6 October 2018"," A lot more than just a standard biopic
","This is my interepretation of a film I wasn't ready to love. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Based on the book ""First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong"" by James R. Hansen, director Damien Chazelle and writer Josh Singer took the chronicle of an American triumph and emphasised on the personal story behind it. Through Armstrong's stance, the film makes a clear point: Determination, struggle, sacrifice and most of all failure are key ingredients to someone's eventual success. But in order to achieve success you've got to risk everything, albeit success is never guaranteed.<br/><br/>In one scene, Janet Armstrong (excellently played by Claire Foy) claims that she only wanted to lead an ordinary life with her husband. On the contrary, Neil has made a clear choice: He will try to accomplish his great mission, knowing that it is quite possible his kids will never see their father again.<br/><br/>Whenever signs of arrogance, conceit and complacency are shown, they are an omen of failure. On the other hand, Armstrong's attitude is the epitome of how success is to be achieved. He is quite commited to his mission and never behaves immaturely when it comes to it. He is focused on his goal. Family and social life, well that's another story (we often see that Armstrong is incapable of communicating or expressing his feelings to his dearest ones).<br/><br/>Portraying such an introvert character, Gosling has a sole major moment to shine, in a very important scene which proves to be pivotal in terms of what the movie tries to communicate: USA went to the moon to win the Cold War, while Armstrong, after being marked by tragedy, went to the moon in order to find peace (and by the time his daughter's old memento reappears, we assume he has found some). The film is about him; it doesn't care that much about the US agenda. In fact, I thought that it only showed subtle contempt towards the nationalistic celebrations and the passionate political speeches aimed at boosting the spirit of the American people.<br/><br/>Moreover, First Man is one of those biopics where you know what is about to happen, but can't help but get caught up in the rising suspense of its great scenes. At their most exciting, these scenes reach a very satisfying climax, rewarding the audience's patience. Directing and cinematography deserve every accolade they have gotten so far."
"daniel-dippel","9","440","610","20 October 2018"," Thru the eyes of the first man
","I now laugh when I reread some of the negative reviews - to summarize: it made me have motion sickness so I left, didn't develop the orher characters enough, too somber and brooding, didn't cover all of the events of Niel Armstrongs career, etc. Well, most of these individuals missed the point of the movie or don't understand this genre of storytelling. It is a first person account basically told through the eyes of the first person to walk on the moon. I found this refreshing and not your typical Hollywood approach of trying to fit too much, too thinly for such an epic sweeping story that covers decades and dozen of key figures. It could have been 3-3.5 hours long. Yes, it could have been a TV mini-series or two (or more) movies. I love that it was told through the eyes of one central figure. Told through the eyes of the man that all of the accumulated effort of thousands of people and billions of dollars spent to accomplish one goal before the Soviets and for humankind - having a human step foot on the moon for the first time. I cannot remember a cinematic experience that got me as close to experiencing what it was truly like to be there first hand, in the drivers seat if you will, or better put, insabely strapped into a coffin fixed atop a massive liquid fuel explosion. How any person would be brave enough to face this, be able to perform well while in the thick of it and want to do it again and again is beyond words (or sanity). With death and fear all around no wonder there was a dark cloud hanging over everyone. I am sure all of us have marvelled at what has been accomplished by the NASA space missions especially Apollo. The movie Apollo 13 was a very good story that I thought put me as close to being an Astronaut as i could get. I was wrong. So, go and see First Man. Go and let yourself become THE astronaut. THE first human that was there at the very top of a giant pyramid of people because many before had made the ultimate sacrifice to make possible one giant leap for mankind. i will never look at another manned space vehicle, past or present, or astronaut again the same way,"

So it was just about the angle they approached it at. Unfortunately they picked the boring angle. <br/><br/>The struggle with grieving was irritating. The lack of substance in the characters was disappointing. The frame was non existent. The length too long. The outcome underwhelming.

"brianjsmith-86408","6","648","986","13 October 2018"," One of the most momentous events in history, turned into a depressing drag.
","If you are thinking this is going to be a fun, great movie like Apollo 13, well, just rent Apollo 13 and watch that one again.<br/><br/>I've been a 'space-nut' and an aficionado of NASA and the space program since I was a kid in the 70's. I'm not sure how they could have made a movie about Neil Armstrong and the first moon landing more sobby-eyed or depressing. It managed to capture none of the majesty, grandeur, or scope of the undertaking- it was just a wet-blanket of constant angst.<br/><br/>The close ups were so close-up that they made you want to back right out of the theater, and were shot in a way to make them resemble shaky-handed home-video footage shot on a hand-held. The camera just refused to hold still for anything in this movie, and it was infuriating. <br/><br/>I'm sure, at least at a few points in his life, Neil Armstrong cracked a smile. You wouldn't think so from watching this. I know he shunned public attention, but I find it impossible to believe Neil Armstrong could possibly have been as lifeless and wooden as he was portrayed in this film. Foy's portrayal of his wife came across even colder and less joyful than her depiction of Queen Elizabeth. <br/><br/>Sorely disappointing. 6/10, and I feel that's being fairly generous."

","I saw this movie at a sneak preview, and I had high expectations given the hype, but sadly, this was no ""The Right Stuff."" The problem may lie in the main character on which the movie is based, Neil Armstrong. He is portrayed as a colorless technocrat, who is somewhat cold to his family. The movie focuses mainly on his family relationships, and the landing on the moon is somewhat secondary, therefore the movie lacks a lot of drama. This is unfortunate since Armstrong led a very charmed life as a fighter pilot, test pilot, and astronaut. The movie covers three of his serious incidents while flying, and he had at least three more, that could have been covered in a miniseries. A miniseries would have allowed for more in-depth probing of how Armstrong became the man he was. The main characters all suffer from superficial once overs. The astronauts were all household names but you wouldn't know it from this movie. The movie also had a hard time capturing just how terrifying some of the events were. Apollo 13 did a far better job of recounting the terror of that flight. Claire Foy as the wife was ok but she also had a degree of coldness about her. The movie also glosses over the misplaced disdain military pilots had for their civilian counterparts. The complaint was that civilian pilots by virtue of their engineering training were too mechanical and not true flyers. This was not true of Armstrong who got his pilots license at the age of 17. The movie should have started there. He was considered a brilliant engineer by his peers, and he was rightfully selected to be the commander of Apollo 11. That brilliance is not captured on screen. By the end of his career he had flown over 200 different aircraft. He was a giant. I think the movie should have brought that out."
"gibbo-77205","5","297","453","14 October 2018"," It's a good thing I'm not a director
","Having read ""First Man"", the Armstrong biography, I was looking forward to the movie immensely. I personally found it bizarre that it started with Karen already gravely ill. There was no emotional attachment at all. There was no mention of Armstrong's fascination with flight, no mention of joining the navy in order to attend Purdue, leading to his near-fatal Korean war flight experience with the missing wingtip. 
If I was directing I would have started with his childhood fascination with flight, his scrimping and saving to pay for flying lessons, the fact that he obtained his pilot's licence before his car licence and then I would have built an emotional attachment with Janet and Karen.
During the lunar descent, when the very dramatic 1202 and 1201 programme alarms occurred, I would have built the dramatic tension instead of drowning out all the drama with loud music. I would have built the drama with the 30 seconds of fuel remaining and showed the relief at Mission Control when the Eagle touched down safely.
I would have showed the discussions concerning crew positions in the lunar module, resulting in Commander Armstrong exiting prior to Buzz and thereby becoming the first to put his boots on the lunar surface. I would have showed the aftermath of reaching his childhood dream, where he was required (along with Buzz and Mike) to tour the world ceaselessly, spotlighted in the limelight and hating every minute of it.
It's a good thing I'm not a director because that's probably what everyone expected, whereas this film is a very different treatment. Some great visual effects and good acting and I liked the way Apollo 1 was handled - it was very respectful. However, I felt the film missed a lot of what made Neil tick - it was hard to engage."
"Jared_Andrews","8","129","197","16 October 2018"," Excellent Understated Biopic
","The opening scene will take your breath away. I don't think a single cell in my body flinched for a solid five minutes as I watched Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) fight to keep his craft from floating away into space. The scene is spectacular visually and in every sense of filmmaking execution. It's also a bit misleading. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie, aside from the moon landing, is remarkably tame. It's quiet. There are virtually no loud outbursts or emotional speeches. This story is about people doing their jobs, completing their missions. Gosling understands this and plays to Armstrong's stoicism perfectly. He is often an understated actor, choosing to let his subtle facial movements and glints of the eyes do as much talking as what actually comes out of his mouth. Neil is much the same except even less outwardly expressive. He clearly comes from a generation that did not display emotion. They suffered in silence, which no doubt frustrated many family members, especially spouses. <br/><br/>Armstrong's wife Janet (Claire Foy) is a classic case of a spouse desperate to glimpse beyond his emotional shield. She restrains for the most part, but her building frustration is apparent throughout. When she finally does unleash her emotions, it's startling. Her outbursts stand out in such stark contrast to the silence that we see from the other characters. Foy is smart and measured with every choice she makes, and she never comes across as unhinged or overly supportive to a point of unbelievability. She's strong as a quiet devoted partner and strong when she senses the need to speak up. Look for her to add another award nomination to her resume come that time of year.<br/><br/>For as great as Gosling and Foy are, Damien Chazelle is the star of this movie, just like he has been the star of every one of his movies. I don't mean this as a bad thing. They guy is simply so skilled at what he does that his impact stands out among all the other standouts in his movies. He doesn't take the conventional approach to a space movie, which is to hammer viewers with showy visuals and action sequences. He's careful not to overdo it those areas, instead focusing on Armstrong's psyche and life outside the space shuttle. Chazelle crafts a personal, intimate film and shoots it in a creative way that uses a variety of framing choices so the closeups never feel stale.<br/><br/>This is a giant story told on a deliberately small scale. The choice to focus on Armstrong's objectively less captivating homelife rather than the moon mission is risky. Only the most talented of filmmakers, which Chazelle is, could pull it off. ""First Man"" is another showcase of Chazelle's mastery. He's one of the best directors currently working. The fact that this film may eventually be considered Chazelle's 6th or 7th best and is still this excellent, is a tribute to his talent."
"ozjosh03","4","314","505","16 October 2018"," Over-long, over-hyped, over-rated
","The only real distinction of First Man may be that it's the first over-hyped and over-rated film of next year's Oscar crop. It's a film that is dismally defeated by its own subject matter at every turn. First it wants to be an illuminating, insightful study of Neil Armstrong. But on the evidence of everything it offers, Armstrong was simply not that interesting. If the most startling discovery about your hero is that he was sad about his infant daughter's death, then you're already in deep trouble. Nor is it hugely surprising that a guy who is dedicated to preparing for a mission to the moon isn't exactly a well-rounded, socially adept human being. But many a fascinating film has been built around a cerebral, emotionally-distant, socially awkward character, right? True enough, but it takes an actor with a much greater skill set than Ryan Gosling to make such a character interesting. First Man is essentially two hours of Gosling mooching around trying to find some way of making Armstrong's interior life compelling. That he fails isn't entirely due to his own shortcomings as an actor, but to a screenplay that does little more than rely on his good looks and the ""glamour"" of the space race to make Armstrong interesting. But the second big fail of First Man is that it doesn't offer us anything particularly new or interesting about the moon mission. Chazelle's strategy is to eschew the cliches of space movies - the focus on technology and the astronaut's eye view - and stay close on his heroes through interminable sequences in juddering space capsules. There's nothing new about this, other than it being the main, sometimes sole focus. Unfortunately, it becomes tedious long before we get to Apollo 11's trek to the moon. Even the ultimate moon sequence offers little that we don't already know from the grainy footage of the real event that everyone has seen hundreds of times. In short, the term ""epic fail"" could have been invented to describe First Man."

","""First Man,"" the highly anticipated (partial) bio-pic about Neil Armstrong, the commander of NASA's Apollo 11 mission and the first man (thus the title) to walk on the moon, is a muddled mess.<br/><br/>Director Damien Chazelle's film-making choices, from shaky, way-too-close cinema verite close-ups and long, long silences (OK, OK, we know Neil Armstrong was a Silent Sam type) to banging, shaking, roaring and rattling blackout shots where the viewer can't understand what's going on, to lack of exposition (about precisely that -- what's going on), to Armstrong's constantly angry wife, are not only disorienting, but unpleasantly distracting. <br/><br/>This film can't hold a candle to superior films like ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Apollo 13,"" or the excellent made-for-cable HBO series ""From the Earth to the Moon."" <br/><br/>Neil Armstrong deserved much better than this."

","First Man, directed by Damien Chazelle cold opens with that I could only describe as an absolutely terrifying look at what it was like to be a test pilot in the 60's, you hear every little nut and bolt warping and you feel every massive unnerving vibration for what felt like an eternity. This set the tone for the rest of the film and signalled that we were in for one hell of a ride.<br/><br/>And yet First Man is not just a bunch of planes and rockets flying around, in fact the entire Film is mostly more focused on Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) and how all of these event leading up to the Moon Landing affected him, specifically his mental state. This is where the film absolutely excels, by chronicling his journey from test pilot all the way to Apollo, losing friends along the way. <br/><br/>Gosling and Claire Foy push out really stellar performances here, the relationship between the two seems very very plausible and there is a lot of very emotionally charged scenes between them throughout. The supporting cast is packed to the brim with recognisable faces too, a standout for me was Jason Clarke's performance as Ed White, the first American to EVA in space who at first I thought I really wasn't going to like the character but by the mid-point of the film I was sold. <br/><br/>One of the qualities of First Man that I noticed almost instantly was the very unique Cinematography which most of the time uses handheld medium to long telephoto shots creating a very intimate and raw look to the images on screen. The other main quality visually is the fact that most of the film was shot with 2-perf Techniscope film which gives a very organic vintage look, usually i'd take issue with a lower resolution stock for a film like this but here it really fits in with the overall aesthetics.<br/><br/>In First Man we do get some really ridiculously stellar space sequences, the way these are edited and shot create almost pure dread, in fact the only time I have felt this on edge was when I saw Gravity for the first time, it is that bloody good. Production design is fantastic and of course when we get to the Apollo sequence the images on the screen are graceful and an utterly mesmerising experience.<br/><br/>From impeccably shot terrifying spaceflight to absolute gut wrenching heartbreak, First Man is something to be seen on the biggest screen possible with the loudest sound. I highly recommend this film and the moment this comes out in UltraHD you can be sure I'll be there Day 1.<br/><br/>Thanks to Universal Pictures Australia for the invite to the Premiere."
"marconjx","4","278","485","15 October 2018"," First Man (to leave the theater)
","In my opinion First Man fails on multiple levels. From a historical perspective, there is nearly no conveyance to the audience about the political motivation that was behind the entire program to get an American on the Moon before the Soviets. The Soviets' lead in the ""space race"" prior to the Apollo program had been considered an existential threat in the struggle for the hearts and minds of humanity and the American government considered it essential to win the race to the Moon. While the American flag is seen at a distance next to the lunar module, the actual planting of the flag on the moon was, in a certain sense, the entire raison d'Ãªtre for the Apollo program and yet this moment was completely ignored by director Chazelle, making such a blatant omission seem an intentional anti-American political statement.
From a cinematic perspective, Chazelle seems obsessive in his constant use of closeups for even mundane moments and downright abusive in his use of ""shaky shots"" during moments of physical trauma. I always feel ""cheated"" when a director wimps out by an excessive use of shaky-shots as a cheap way to avoid the expense and creative effort otherwise required to depict what is actually happening to cause trauma.
From an acting and character development perspective, none of the characters gain our sympathy or empathy in this film. Its as if they are all reading their lines from a script rather than investing themselves with the spirit of the people they are supposed to be portraying. Armstrong, in particular, is portrayed by Gosling as extremely unemotional and cool, even when saying goodbye, 
perhaps forever, to his wife and children. And while Armstrong may or may not have been that way, it seems overdone in this film. Strangest of all was Claire Foy's depiction of Janet Armstrong who is portrayed as constantly annoyed with her husband and resentful of the sacrifices he had to make as the first human selected to set foot on the moon. I find it hard to believe that Armstrong's wife could have been this way in reality and if she was not then Chazelle and Foy have done her a great disservice.
Finally, from a story-arc perspective, the movie's pace is plodding with Chazelle spending way too much time on the familial interactions of the Armstrong clan. While this may stem from the fact the movie was based on a biography of Armstrong rather than upon a depiction of the Apollo mission itself, the fact that this was, as far as I know, the first major cinematic portrayal of mankind's first voyage to the moon really deserved a much more expansive treatment than it receives in this film.
I am confident that this film will not be, nor should it be, the definitive telling of America's triumphant landing of man on the moon, a story that is epic and will require a director with an epic vision to tell the tale. It is with regret that I say that this movie and this director were not up to that task."
"Bertaut","6","58","92","27 October 2018"," Aesthetically laudable, emotionally vapid
","More an intimate character drama than a grandiose examination of man's place in the cosmos, First Man is far more concerned with domesticity than the actual journey to the moon, attempting to demonstrate that behind the great moments of history exist personal demons and private motivations. Nothing wrong with that of course - contextualising small character beats against a larger historical canvas can produce excellent cinema. <a href=""/name/nm0000517/"">Terrence Malick</a>'s <a href=""/title/tt0120863/"">The Thin Red Line (1998)</a>, for example, uses the Battle of Guadalcanal as the background against which to engage all manner of personalised existential Heideggerian philosophical conundrums, whilst <a href=""/name/nm0000520/"">Michael Mann</a>'s <a href=""/title/tt0248667/"">Ali (2001)</a> is more interested in Ali's private struggles outside the ring than his public bouts within it. However, for this kind of storytelling to work, one thing is essential - emotional connection. The audience must, in some way, care about the people on screen, otherwise their introspective problems are more than likely to feel like they are just getting in the way of the larger story. And that is exactly what happens in First Man - there is a lifelessness at the film's core, an emotional vapidity that can't be filled by exceptional technical achievements and laudable craft. The film attempts to celebrate Project Gemini and the Apollo Program, whilst also working as a character study of a man known for his emotional taciturnity. And whilst it achieves the former, the film's Neil Armstrong (<a href=""/name/nm0331516/"">Ryan Gosling</a>) is so stoic and closed-off as to be virtually disconnected from the rest of humanity.<br/><br/>Based on <a href=""/name/nm2973253/"">James R. Hansen</a>'s 2005 biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, the film begins in 1961, and hits all the beats you would expect in the lead up to the Apollo 11 mission in 1969; the death of his daughter, Karen (<a href=""/name/nm10544539/"">Lucy Stafford</a>) from a brain tumour; his acceptance into Project Gemini; NASA's shock at the Soviet's successes in the Space Race; his selection as commander of Gemini 8; the death of Ed White (<a href=""/name/nm0164809/"">Jason Clarke</a>), Gus Grissom (<a href=""/name/nm0924154/"">Shea Whigham</a>), and Roger Chaffee (<a href=""/name/nm5754425/"">Cory Michael Smith</a>) during a plugs-out test of Apollo 1; Armstrong's selection as commander of Apollo 11; his marriage problems with his first wife, Janet (<a href=""/name/nm2946516/"">Claire Foy</a>); the lunar landing alongside Buzz Aldrin (<a href=""/name/nm1015684/"">Corey Stoll</a>); and his private sojourn to the Lunar East crater.<br/><br/>With this framework, the film remains tied almost exclusively to Armstrong's perspective, with the occasional shift to Janet. This sets up something of a problem, as the real-life Armstrong was very much a reluctant celebrity/national hero, and despite his extraordinary accomplishments, he was not the most interesting, relatable, or easy-to-empathise-with-individual. With this in mind, the film sets itself the task of attempting to penetrate this most private of men, explaining why he was so singularly driven, even to the detriment of his family, to the point where not only did he plan not to tell his children he may not return from the Apollo 11 mission, he intended to leave without saying goodbye at all, until Janet changed his mind. And herein lies perhaps the film's most egregious failing. It's almost as if director <a href=""/name/nm3227090/"">Damien Chazelle</a> and screenwriter <a href=""/name/nm1802857/"">Josh Singer</a> think the Apollo 11 mission isn't interesting enough by itself - there needs to be some kind of deeper ""why"" behind the whole enterprise.<br/><br/>In any case, the attempts to tease out the inner workings of Armstrong's mind don't really work, as he remains very much in his own world, impenetrable to both the other characters and the audience - no matter what Gosling, Chazelle, and Singer do to dress him up, Armstrong comes across as aloof and interiorised. Partly at fault here is Gosling's performance, with its fulcrum of emotionless stoic masculinity. This is a performance we've seen him give several times before - in <a href=""/title/tt0247199/"">The Believer (2001)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt0780504/"">Drive (2011)</a>, and, especially, <a href=""/title/tt1856101/"">Blade Runner 2049 (2017)</a> - and this familiarity doesn't help matters. Instead of giving the character hidden depth, the few discernible traits he possesses make him something of a cardboard cut-out, a 21st-century screenwriter's idea of what an American man who grew up in the 40s and 50s should be (complete with retconned political correctness).<br/><br/>Another issue is that the filmmakers choose to locate Armstrong's primary motivation in the death of his daughter, which is presented with a mawkish sentimentality that, at best, fails to convince, and, at worst, actively distracts. With the lunar mission presented as much about advancing mankind as it is dealing with personal trauma, Chazelle goes to great lengths to link Karen's death with Armstrong's determination - as she is dying, he holds her and looks wistfully into the sky; after her funeral, he slips her bracelet into a drawer; later, he has an hallucinatory vision of her playing with other children; and on the moon's surface, he drops a bracelet belonging to her into the Lunar East crater and cries a few tears. At one point, Janet reveals that he never mentioned Karen after the funeral, and that's a believable, and deeply emotional, detail. The problem lies in the overkill surrounding it, detracting from whatever genuine emotion such details should evoke. Every time we see Gosling stare yearningly into the sky, the potency of the film is diluted just a little bit more.<br/><br/>Did he really drop the bracelet into the crater? The answer is, we don't know. During his interviews with Armstrong and Janet for the biography, Hansen formulated the theory that maybe Neil left something for Karen on the surface. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong if he could see the manifest for the mission, Armstrong told him he had lost it, something which would have been highly out of character for such a fastidious record-keeper. In fact, he hadn't lost it, he had donated it to the Purdue University Archives, but it is under seal until 2020. However, when Hansen asked Armstrong's sister June if it was possible he had left something of Karen's, she said that it was. So, the fact is we don't know what Armstrong did when he wandered over to the crater (his sojourn there was literally the only part of the landing that wasn't by-the-book). However, for me, the whole thing comes across as far too syrupy, an amateur psychological profiling of a man who was intensely private. Personally, I would have much preferred the Lunar East trip to remain a mystery - by showing us what they think might have happened, Hansen, Singer, and Chazelle cheapen the intensely personal nature of the moment, which Armstrong obviously chose to keep secret for a reason.<br/><br/>Aesthetically, Chazelle wastes absolutely no time in letting us know that this is Armstrong's film, with the excellent opening sequence taking place primarily from his POV. However, the scene also introduces the first example of Chazelle's pungent romanticism. As the shaking of Armstrong's X-15 momentarily stops, and the noise dies away, a majestic sense of calm descends. However, rather than trust the audience to extract their own interpretation of the moment, Chazelle can't resist a BCU of Gosling's eyes, with the curvature of the earth reflecting on his visor. On the other hand, a well-handled aspect of this technique is that because the film adheres so rigidly to Armstrong's perspective, very little of what he himself can't see is shown. So, for example, instead of depicting the vast infinite expanses of space, Chazelle keeps the audience tucked tightly inside the Eagle landing module up to the point of the descent to Tranquility Base.<br/><br/>Indeed, make no mistake, the lunar landing itself is beyond spectacular, with <a href=""/name/nm3225654/"">Justin Hurwitz</a>'s incredible music and <a href=""/name/nm0761874/"">Linus Sandgren</a>'s superb cinematography coming into their own. The sequence was shot in 70mm IMAX, and it makes extraordinary use of the larger frame, with the first panorama of the lunar surface almost as awe-inspiring as anything in <a href=""/title/tt0062622/"">2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</a> or <a href=""/title/tt0478304/"">The Tree of Life (2011)</a>. An especially well-directed part of the lunar descent is that rather than lay down a busy foley track, Chazelle pulls out the sound altogether, creating an eerie, otherworldly moment that literally gave me goosebumps.<br/><br/>However, despite the magisterial last 30 minutes, and some sporadically well-handled moments, First Man is underwhelming, and, for long portions, interminably dull. As good as that final sequence is, it's no compensation for the plodding and lifeless two hours that precede it. And overall, the film isn't a patch on <a href=""/title/tt0086197/"">The Right Stuff (1983)</a>."

","Wow.
I've seen a few movies about the space race before, and generally they have a mixed spectrum of quality but are mostly enjoyable. This one for me, was almost completely devoid of any enjoyability.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong, and I expressed concerns about this to my friends before. My concerns were not unfounded. He seems to me to be simply unable to convey any emotion at all. I get that as an astronaut and test-pilot, he needed a cool head, but there's a big difference between keeping a cool head, and simply looking bored and disinterested all the time.<br/><br/>Also, I get the tragedy of the death of Armstrong's young daughter, and the stresses this and the very nature of his career put on his wife and family life; but they've taken a 9 year segment of the most daring technological, and human achievement in human history, and made it slow, ponderous and boring.<br/><br/>The massive over-use of handheld cameras to make it feel like you're actually there was really irritating to me. I want the story to tell itself without me actually being in the room with all the characters all the time. Especially when Armstrong's wife is trying to listen to the NASA broadcast of spaceflight comms, and her son steals the radio and won't give it back. It just made me feel awkward in my cinema seat; by all means play the scene, but I don't want to feel like I'm in the room with them.<br/><br/>There were a few good bits, like his test-flight at the beginning of the movie, but my overall experience was that they somehow managed to make a story about landing the first man in history on the moon, a very boring experience.<br/><br/>The Right Stuff, this is not."

Stylistically the use of hand held camera added nothing to the narrative as also the too many close ups. The musical choices seemed odd and out of place from the banal to the bombastic final piece.

"MrDHWong","9","217","385","11 October 2018"," A beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history
","First Man is a historical biographical drama film based on the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong, directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land). Starring Ryan Gosling in the lead role, it paints a beautifully told and respectable portrait of the famous astronaut's life and the significance of his contribution to human history.<br/><br/>In the 1960s, the space race between the USA and the USSR is at its peak, with the latter having a clear lead over the former. In attempt to outdo the Soviets, the United States plans a manned mission to the moon, with astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) being the first to set foot on the lunar surface. Despite the deep personal losses he has endured throughout his training and in his home life, Armstrong agrees to the mission, knowing full well that he may not come back alive.<br/><br/>Superbly directed and acted, the film is less a story about the space race itself and more about the struggles and perseverance of titular first man. Ryan Gosling gives what could very well be the performance of his career. His nuanced depiction of Neil Armstrong shows the audience how much the astronaut has to lose if he does not survive such a monumental journey. Claire Foy is also worth noting as Armstrong's first wife Janet. Her concern and worry for her husband's safe return from the moon were brilliantly represented during the film's more emotional scenes. Director Damien Chazelle demonstrates his talent for creative cinematography, showing the vastness of space and how small and insignificant Earth is in comparison. Films like this truly emphasise how much mankind has accomplished in the short amount of time we have existed and further highlight how much more is needed to be done.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9/10"

","Close-up, after close-up, after close-up. The director of photography should be dragged outside and tarred and feathered. As if the capsule scenes weren't claustrophobic enough, did every scene with the actors have to be so tightly cropped? Gosling is not a serious actor - his portrayal of a true American hero was exhausting. Also, why do directors these days cast actors in roles of real historical people that do not even closely resemble them (Buzz Aldrin excluded)? It makes it hard to follow who is who, especially since a lot of the characters are not well developed at all. Skip it at the cineplex and watch it on video."

My major problem with the film was the ""action"" camera work. While I understand that hand held shots lead to a greater sense of immediacy, having the camera 10 cm away from the subject and shaking it violently did not draw me in, rather it repulsed me. I literally closed my eyes for any sequence where this effect was used, as it was hurting me to watch it. As far as the story goes, it felt incredibly slow and distanced. In the interpretation of Armstrong as a person, it seemed to drive me away from relating to him or the situation, and I had no sense of the grandeur or the excitement that should have accompanied such a story.

Almost anything else.<br/><br/>Yes, it told the story from the human side, from the side of a father and husband.

There again they couldn't even film Janet Armstrong walking down her drive without shaking the camera a bit.

","Director/Writer Damien Chapelle successfully wore both hats in his 2016 ""La La Land"" and 2014 ""Whiplash"" endeavores. However, in ""First Man,"" where he carries only the director title, his presentation is hindered and overburdened by continuous and unnecessary shaky camera work and countless close-ups. While the tumble and shaking within the capsule provides a first-hand up-close and personal space travel experience, the moving camera rarely stops, and its proximity to the actors/action makes watching the film difficult and/or hard to understand what is being presented on screen. Ryan Gosling (""La La Land"") is young engineer/test pilot/astronaut Neil Armstrong (1961-1969), determined to do what it takes to be the best. At home, his wife Janet (Claire Foy ""The Crown"" TV) is holding their lives together, especially following a family tragedy. As we progress toward the first walk on the moon, Armstrong must weather several fellow astronaut deaths, distancing himself from himself and those around him. Claire Foy does a nice job with the little she is given, proving the women behind the astronaut is as much a part of the space travel experience as their husbands. The film has a terrific ensemble cast (Jason Clarke ""Zero Dart Thirty,"" Kyle Chandler ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Shea Whigham ""Waco,"" Corey Stoll ""House of Cards"", Lukas Haas ""Witness,"" to name a few). Yet, the on screen personas of Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) that writers Josh Singer and James R. Hansen (whose book ""First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong"" the film is based upon) present are very contradictory to the personas many may know, and ultimately hurt the production. The space race between the US and USSR is given its due here, and the first space docking and the various space tragedies experienced are well represented. I really enjoyed the footage of the Moon's surface, if in fact that was actual real footage. Now, if only proven Executive Producer Steven Spielberg would have taken a strong role in the films overall presentation, ""First Man"" could have been a more successful production."

","Pretty much gets a 'meh' from me. The story has been told well in From the Earth to the Moon and the film Moonshot. The visuals are stunning, and I do like the (mostly) first person point of view which adds immediacy. Gemini missions never looked so dangerous and claustrophic, which is good. But the film-makers had a choice between covering new ground, and retreading the same ground the other films did, and didn't seem to come down firmly on either side. All the drama of the Apollo 11 landing was pretty much sucked out - yes, it's a foregone conclusion how it will end - but they really dumbed it down, to the film's detriment. Aldrin is reduced to a minor character - and not very sympathetically portrayed, though I'm okay with the latter. No doubt people found him abrasive. But we see none of the clashes that are famously portrayed in the other films (who gets out first, what should be said). Maybe that's the point of the film, we're not *supposed* to know anyone because Armstrong himself was so private and unengaged with those around him.<br/><br/>The one thing I thought this movie did better than the others was the actual first step on the moon. I thought From the Earth to the Moon did a slightly comical job, inadvertently, by panning the camera to Armstrong's midsection just as the music swelled. First Man gets this moment right, with a much different musical approach. The scenery looks absolutely real, and the crater that Armstrong flies over in order to land looks as terrifying as it is supposed to, something the other film's could only hint at through dialogue.<br/><br/>For those who have the transcript of the landing memorized, though, it's a bit too bad not to hear ""413 is in"" and much of the other famous dialogue - ""drifting to the right a little"", ""picking up some dust.""<br/><br/>Worth seeing for the visuals and the Gemini 8 portrayal but all in all seemed, to me, to be a bit shallow. We all know Armstrong bit his tongue bailing out of the LLTV, but this is one of the many details left out in order to streamline the film.<br/><br/>Oh, and the idiotic ""where is the flag"" controversy is completely unjustified. If you just have to see the Stars and Stripes, there's a very nice shot of Armstrong's kids hoisting the flag on their front lawn during a launch."

One of us was even sick and I only didn't walk out because of the subject material and the hope that it would improve, which thankfully it did for the short moon sequence.<br/><br/>I honestly don't understand the attraction to this type of cinematography. We humans simply do not see the world in this way and so this only reminds us that we are watching a movie, thus taking us out of the moment and putting us back in the seat in the cinema, especially so as we often preferred to look at objects in the cinema than at the screen much of the time!

","I want to meet the guy who invented the ""camera shake"" thing. The human head, in reality, is able to (and does) maintain stability, otherwise we would be seeing a shaken movie every time we walked. Photographers/Videographers sometimes use loupes in order to use their head as a strong stabilization point, because the head maintains stability remarkably better than the rest of the body.
Now, on the content: to clear the air, I say that I'm European. The pursuit to land on the moon was, in reality, not a random adventure, but a strictly political move by the US government, in its space competition with the USSR. It was NOT an international discovery adventure - it was a purely political move by only one country. (The following phrase is not a spoiler, because everyone knows this already:) Thus, to purposefully omit the flag from the moon site, for ""politically correct reasons"", classifies this omission as pure propaganda, by definition!
This would not be the case if the moon landing happened today as an international project - however, when it happened, it was not. It was a 100% political move by only 1 country.
The slow and washed out scenario makes things even worse. We all know that politically correct art is boring and only noises and special effects save it from being a sleeping pill. Therefore, I cannot recommend this film to anyone, especially to adults."

I expected a movie that captured the awe of such a monumental accomplishment. It totally failed to deliver. 
The worst part of the movie (and it continued through 80% of the movie) was the horrible videography! For whatever effect they were going for, what I saw was the effect of having a 5-year-old holding the camera - scenes moving up and down, side to side continuously - almost enough to make you nauseous. Also, a preoccupation with closeups of faces, eyes, etc. Way over done! And during the rocket scenes the attempts to show vibration and power were horrible and ridiculous! If anything shook that much they would pour you out into a shake when it was over. On the opposite side, the awe of the Saturn V blasting off was totally lost!!! I was in an IMAX theater and the power of this event seemed like any other scene such as driving a car. No rumbling at all! The bright side of the movie was the VERY LIMITED scenes of the moon's surface and the actual event of him stepping onto the moon. Also looking at the Earth from the moon's surface. 
The movie also poorly explained how Neil Armstrong got picked. The movie portrayed him as somewhat of a screwup and not impressive AT ALL as an aerospace engineer! The portrayal of the family/personal life was totally BORING with a capital B!!!! When Neil was told that he was picked for the mission to go to the moon, his reply, ""Ok..."". WTF?? Was there no passion in this man?? The personal life side was devoid of any positive emotion! It was all downtrodden and negative. 
To continue - what the heck was up with Neil Armstrong's character? Did he have a lobotomy? The end scene was horrible - him in isolation after WALKING ON THE MOON and his wife walking in to see him - there were no words spoken! WTF? Didn't he just come back from the moon!!! How about (at the very least), ""you did it!!"" or ""I'm so glad you're home"" from the wife or, ""it's so good to see you"" from Neil. Not even a smile between them. There was nothing but silence! 
To end: where was the coverage of the family as the news was showing their husband and father stepping onto the moon's surface??!!! Nothing was shown on this. The family dropped out of the picture during the most awe-inspiring parts of what was happening. Terribly done movie in my opinion."

It's sad to think that this film has been nominated for several Oscars - an will probably win. There is so much wrong with this film but the most egregious thing about it, (If I had to pick just one) is Ryan Gosling's wooden, detached, so-called ""performance"". Yes, Neil Armstrong was a reserved, quiet man that often seemed shy to a fault, but anyone like myself that's seen lots of footage of him could plainly see that he was a man that was not without a sense of humor and a genuine boyish smile. Even with the tragedy of losing his daughter, he believed in what he was doing and took enormous joy from doing a job well done. He was a true American hero - quit and confident, unflappable, but totally absorbed in getting it right.
I have read about his troubled home life but I truly thought the ""warts and all"" approach to biopics vanished with the 1990's. If you want to see a soap opera that just happens to have a few scenes about the space program and going to the moon, then you may enjoy this movie. Otherwise, strap yourself in for one long, boring ride with lots of faces, faces, faces and more faces while your eyes strain to focus on constantly slightly moving images. The parts of the film that dealt with the actual NASA stuff were relatively well done, but all of it has been done before and to much greater effect. If you think you're going to see something in the vein of Apollo 13 or HBO's From the Earth to the Moon, prepare yourself for a mountain of disappointment.
I am one of those that love anything about the space program, particularly the Apollo portion of it, but this film delivers none of the sense of awe and grandeur that should go along with mankind's greatest technological achievement. Hard to believe that a director could take something so monumental and boil it down to such a boring, depressing tale chock full of uninteresting, dull people.

But it returns again to cast a rainy day on this film. Gosling comes off as mysteriously brooding, sullen, if not clinically depressed. Maybe spacy? But not in a good sense.<br/><br/>I grew up in the glorious Apollo years and saw the real Neil Armstrong on TV plenty of times. The character Gosling crafted has little resemblance. I doubt he even studied archival interviews with the first man on the moon. Armstrong was terribly shy, soft spoken, but had a wry sense of wit about him. In fairness, Armstrong's children do say his cold family interactions are correctly portrayed.<br/><br/>That said, the film has a good pace and dramatically captures the mind-numbing dangers and claustrophobia of early manned spaceflight. So, it's worth watching just the get an insight into the barnstorming years of NASA's space race with the Soviets.<br/><br/>However, the Apollo 11 moon landing at the end is terribly anti-climactic. We just see Gosling wandering around. The only flash of creativity is to have him do a 360-degree pan of the desolate Tranquility base landing site.<br/><br/>The controversial omission of erecting the American flag, according to director Damien Chazelle, was to focus on ""loss and sacrifice and failure."" Guess what Mr. Chazelle, American is built on bold pioneering efforts that always involved loss, sacrifice and failure. Nothing worth doing is ever easy.

Do not watch this film expecting triumphant or patriotic look at scientific discovery. It isn't that kind of film. It appears designed to elicit depression from the audience and it succeeds. One watches anxiously waiting for the climax, the moon landing, which feels anti-climactic and leaves viewers empty. Both the writer and director are out of their depth with this ambitious film. The strong elements of the film are the visual effects and production design, convincing and state of the art. If not for these elements the film would get a 2."

"mightybadguy","1","87","165","14 October 2018"," Silly Camera work from the school of JJ Camera Shake
","Well, I saw this film for free because of having friends in the editing industry so that was a plus! However as films go this missed the mark. A bit slow paced, overly melodramatic mid section, poor acting and that dreadfully overused camera-shake that just did not work. Sorry but I really would of felt ripped off had a paid for this film. 
Now this film has apparently garnered some controversy because due to leaving out many important references to the nationalist aspect of the mission. We all know why it was left out and that is to wash away any sense of American nationalistic feeling. One of the big differences in films today vs 30+ years ago is the lack of nationalism in films. Nationalism is something the Hollywood elite seems to despise and as such this film is no exception. To leave out the placement of the US flag on the moon was absolutely ridiculous. Why...because anyone growing up in that time can tell you the sense of pride as a people and a nation we had. These guys were national and world heros in every sense of the word. Everything back then had the US flag on it! Every moon landing LEGO set ( I still have mine) has a US flag to set. Having grown up where the Grumman plants were many of our parents worked there. My uncle and a number of my friends fathers worked on the Lem project. I used to get stickers and models given to me these people and they all had US flags on it! This was a very American project and a competition with the Soviets to see who would be the leader in space technology, the USA won that and we were very proud!! To leave that aspect of the film is historically and emotionally inaccurate of the project and of the time. Clearly this was THOUGHTFULLY left out to espouse more globalism over nationalism but unfortunately the film was poor regardless. I wonder of the producer/director of this film knows that much of the technology and management of the Apollo missions, Russian space missions and general rocket propulsion came from Germany and that the Apollo project was in part headed by Wernher Von Braun. ""Apollo program director Sam Phillips was quoted as saying that he did not think that the United States would have reached the Moon as quickly as it did without von Braun's help. Later, after discussing it with colleagues, he amended this to say that he did not believe the United States would have reached the Moon at all"" 
Hey Hollywood, many of us are really tired of the reboots, the poor casting, acting, silly CG, sequels and remakes. Modern films depict a dearth of creativity, perhaps due to lack of corporate risk taking or maybe constrained group thinking on the part of like minded politically correct drones.?? Whatever the reason please try to find your way back to making truly great and engrossing films on every level. This certainly was not it!"

","As a big fan of movies about space travel, and real life astronauts, I had eagerly looked forward to this movie. It was a disappointment for 90 minutes out of the total 130 minutes of the movie. The last 40 minutes, when the Moon trip finally begins, and the spectacular shots of the moon surface, were worth seeing. Rest of the movie- not at all. It moves at a snail's pace. The interesting parts are about the astronauts, but they are frequently interrupted by- for example- Janet Armstrong yelling at her son or her husband, etc. Not much chemistry between the two actors. The frequent closeups are rather irritating.<br/><br/>The editing and the screenplay are terrible. They could have shaved off 30 minutes of this movie and made it much more effective. The characters display various emotions but they don't touch the audience. Granted this is Armstrong's story but did they really have to ignore someone like Buzz Aldrin, who is one of the most famous astronauts? The third astronaut Michael Collins, on the Apollo 11 mission was totally ignored. Those two sat there like plastic dolls. As if Armstrong single handedly made it all work!<br/><br/>No flag on the moon, but Armstrong throws his late daughter's bracelet on the moon. Ridiculous! Also the great historical significance of this event was completely ignored. Instead it was all about Neil and his wife. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy are good, but Oscars? She may get the supporting actress nod though. Ryan Gosling is a good actor but he is not as effective as I have seen him in other roles. This movie deserves some technical nominations though.<br/><br/> The moon scenes are spectacular. It is like I am right there! It made up (partially) for 90 minutes of boredom. That is why I gave it a 6/10. Otherwise it would have been 3 or 4.<br/><br/> This movie could have been so much better! Damien Chazelle is a gifted director. I wonder what happened to him? How could he go along with something like this? If this movie gets the Best Picture nomination, it could be solely due to name recognition (Chazelle, Gosling)."

I don't understand why this movie gets people raving about it. The shots is space are generally shaky, and not awe inspiring in any way. Gravity really is the torch bearer, and this movie won't touch it with a 1000 foot long barge pole. 
Then the acting. Claire Foy is the better actor here and 'oh he looks so good' Gosling is essentially just got as poker face on the entire movie. 
If Damien Chazelle wants us to believe that Neil Armstrong was a sad man, who cared only for his daughter, his two sons be damned, this movie succeeds.

"ironhorse_iv","7","8","11","8 September 2019"," 'First Man' didn't quite had the right stuff. Regardless, this movie was still somewhat a stoic out of this world experience.
","When retelling the story how astronaut Neil Armstrong became the first man to step foot on the moon. Filmmaker Damielle Chazelle took a different approach to the subject. He aim for the celestial dark side. Without spoiling the film too much, the movie subject is less about the exploring the epic yet deadly adventurous dream-like wonders of space and more about learning to cope with death around you. Because of that, the journey toward the Moon Landings by Apollo 11 undeniably got really cold and distanced. Causing some audience members to complain about its melancholia tone. They wanted a more positive & awe inspirational dream-like feel good space exploration approach with some adventurous struggle, similar in the way, they felt when watching 1995 'Apollo 13' or 2007 'In the Shadow of the Moon'. For me, I have to somewhat agree. The magic in this movie was never not quite there. It didn't felt like grand escapism. It felt like we never left the ground. For most of the movie, the audience couldn't really feel starstruck with much of the visuals or the music, because how much the filmmakers wanted to concentration on the astronaut's plain near silence depressing home life. The final version of the film didn't even focus on even some of the exciting moments that happen there like the house fire in 1964. It could had made the whole Apollo 1 scene even stronger in contrast, even if the real life pilots weren't killed in seconds by getting burn followed by a large explosion, but instead from smoke inhalation & asphyxiation. Regardless some of the household conflicts seem a little forced. One such example is the fight between Armstrong's wife Janet (Claire Foy) and Neil (Ryan Gosling) about the dangers of the Apollo 11 mission. While Foy gives a pretty good emotional delivery about what Neil's kids should know. In reality, by this time, everybody in the family knew the dangers & risk, especially after them having to deal with Neil's near brushes with death before during previous missions like X-15, Gemini 8 and Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. It wasn't anything new. Apollo 11 was just another mission at the Armstrong household. Another thing, I hate that throughout the movie, the filmmakers made it look like Janet & Neil's marriage is always on the rock because of the death of their daughter. Even the closing moments of the film with the separate glass make it look like they were doom. In truth, the couple stay together for nearly 38 years before they finally got divorce in 1994. For the most part, they were a happily married. As for dealing with his associates. Yes, he was indeed an introverted person of a few words. However, he wasn't always robotic and depress reticent outwardly boring person that the film and Gosling recycling plainly portrayal him out to be. In truth, the man whose one small step changed history forever had more than a very close relationship with his friends besides Ed White (Jason Clarke), often making small talk, smiling or joking with them. He even hang out with Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) at times whom in the film made it seem like they didn't get along much. In truth, Armstrong truly never uttered a negative word about the man with whom he walked on the Moon. Along with that, it just sucks that we don't really get to know much about anybody else like Elliott See (Patrick Fugit), Jim Lovell (Pablo Schreiber) and their families. It's a shame because it could had made the scenes involving certain tragedies so much stronger than it turn out to. As for scientific accuracies. It's pretty shape. As a result, the movie frequently contains detailed explanations of engineering and physics. These scenes made for somewhat an arduous sitting. I frequently found myself rewatching scenes in an attempt to understand the information being conveyed. It doesn't help that the film overuse vintage color palette shaky cam and endless close up. It make the action somewhat harder to see.
Regardless, it wasn't until the moon landing that the film got bombastic and loud. It was there that it really lift our spirits & imagination. I like those moon scenes, very much. The way, they intermixed actual NASA archival footage, some that has never been released before, with the computer animation backdrop with the actors was amazing! However the lunar footprint in the famous photo doesn't really belong to Armstrong. It's honestly Aldrin. As for the Litter West Crater scene. It's possible that something was indeed drop there in real life. After all, it's not that uncommon for many astronauts to placed mementos or tokens of loved ones on the moon, so it's not unreasonable to suspect such an event occurred. However, I never really got the context, in how his daughter's death relate to his quest to get in the moon missions. It's not really established. As for the criticisms for the film omitting the astronauts planting the flag on the moon's surface. The Stars & Stripes still does appear onscreen in the background. However I do get what Chazelle was going for. It's an achievement for the whole of mankind rather than one single country. After all, a lot of NASA spaceflight capability were built upon, years upon years from innovations from scientists from both Western and Eastern Countries. While, the US is the first to make it to the Moon. It's the whole world that push the limits of explorations. Nevertheless, the movie was still somewhat holding back the adventure. I would love to see more action involving the rocket planes or his time in the Korean War. Things like that, could had made the movie so much more exciting. Overall: While not quite a blast to watch. It didn't alienation me too much. It's still worth checking out even if parts of it are over the moon."

Instead of bothering with special effects just jiggle the camera around inside what purports to be a tiny manned capsule, keep jiggling it and add some roaring noises and flashing lights, then keep jiggling it uncontrollably, then yes, that's rights, do it all over again ... and again. Whatever you do, don't look out the window or show any external shots. The side benefit is that jiggling a camera is a great way to save money.<br/><br/>3.

","I don't normally write movie reviews, but being a huge fan of the Space Program and having watched nearly every documentary and movie there is about it, I felt an urge to say my piece.<br/><br/>First Man is what is says it is, the time and moments leading to what is supposed to be, one of the most historic and triumphant accomplishments of NASA and humanity, however this movie falls very short in conveying that.<br/><br/>The movie focuses around the Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), while he was an experimental test pilot on an X-15 outer atmosphere rocket plane and his selection for the Gemini and later Apollo program, and the personal loss he had dealt with in the loss of his young daughter and fellow colleagues throughout.<br/><br/>And that is what is mainly was, a focus more on the personal trials of Neil Armstrong, the test pilot, the friend and the family man. Ryan Gosling's performance was great as the unassuming Neil, who was never really your typical image of a NASA astronaut, confident, loud, the centre of attention maybe. Neil was quite the opposite and always stayed away from the limelight when possible.<br/><br/>I hate to draw on comparisons, but where this movie lacks, Apollo 13 shines and Apollo 13 it is not. Apollo 13 hit the mark in showing the challenges that NASA and the crew faced and how they overcame them as a team, with a victoriously triumphant ending that left you rooting for them and excited at the same time.<br/><br/>First Man's take was more form a subdued perspective, although seeing the landing through the lens of Neil himself, everything leading up to that moment and afterwards were just lacklustre and stale, boring if you will.<br/><br/>In summary, this movie is more of a personal drama related to Neil and not NASA or the first moon landing. Those aspects came second in this movie."

"databus","5","6","8","1 February 2019"," Even IMAX Eye Candy can entice me to purchase First Man to view it again
","Let me begin by saying that I suffer from the challenge of comparing the actions and emotions of a historical film with my recollections of the actual events as they happened. For many years I have used two movies, Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff and Ron Howard's Apollo 13, in conjunction to my memory of actual historical events as a yardstick to gauge the merits of a new release such as First Man. Though I have not seen First Man in 4K, I did view the IMAX biographical movie based on the Neil Armstrong biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, written by James R. Hansen. First Man tells the story of Neil Armstrong's career relating to his Apollo 11 flight, leading up to the astronaut representing humanity by being the first to step on the surface of the moon.
While many of the Saturn V launch sequences look spectacular in the large screen format, I find the drama of the storyline falls short due to more to the emotional limitations of the screenplay, rather than the actual acting acumen of the movie's cast.
<<< Warning spoiler alert, if you continue reading... >>> Where First Man fails, is its apparent attempt to recreate similar tensions portrayed in the movie The Right Stuff, by the original seven Mercury astronauts and test pilot Chuck Yeager (For example: between astronauts vs test pilots, physicians vs astronaut candidates, scientists vs politicians, press vs astronaut families, and even Russia vs USA) in a film that portrays a single space launch/event, like Apollo 13. Unfortunately, Apollo 13 is more a homage to the spirit of cooperation and innovation of engineers and astronauts the overcome the deadly specter of a multiple systems failure following an explosion of a major component of the Lunar Spacecraft's service module. Apollo 13 does create its own set of tension that successfully propels the storyline (integrating dissimilar, incompatible systems between the Command and Lunar modules to provide life support to the crew, the stresses experienced by the astronauts family in dealing with the press, neighbors, politicians, NASA policies, as well as the need for finding transparency to the truth by Armstrong's Wife vs shield his elderly mother from the life-threatening circumstances).
The Right Stuff also successfully incorporates elements of superstition and mysticism (Yeager's need for a stick of Beemans Gum before a flight and John Glen's glowing space gadgets seemingly in sync with the flying embers of an Australian bushman's bonfire). The film version of The Right Stuff uses the right combination of Hollywood embellishment and elements taken from Tom Wolfe's book to create an interesting perspective of key events in the US Space Program).
By contrast, we find only Tom Hanks can give us a balanced combination of acting and narration of the book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13, authored by astronaut Jim Lovell and journalist Jeffrey Kluger.
Both Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff, succeed with great, memorable soundtracks that not only blend in with storyline but manage to elevate their respective film, a major element that seems sorely missing from First Man. Many critics consider the soundtrack of First Man to be great, but unlike Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, no song from First Man lingers in the memory as do the tracks from the other two.
Let me throw two more exceptional biographical movies about a historical flight that, in my opinion, pass muster. First, there is Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Charles Lindberg's solo transatlantic flight in Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St. Louis, which happens to also have a memorable soundtrack. More recently, Klim Shipenko's Salyut-7 which shows us that America does not have a monopoly on giving us a sense of the challenges of pushing humanity and technology beyond the limits, as to create a crisis which is rescued from disaster by a combination of piloting skill, engineering prowess, trust, and luck. As the crew of Salyut - 7, the movie succeeds visually and dramatically in spite of relying on English subtitles to tell the dialog. And the film's great soundtrack needs no translation.
Of the five flight movies described in this review, only First Man is only on that I have no inclination to purchase or interest view more than once, hence the average three-star rating (Amazon does not offer a 2.5-star rating)."

","This is a depressing, slog of a film about what many thought was a great achievement. I'm not sure what the point of this film was supposed to be. So the First Man wasn't very nice, wasn't a good family man, was consumed by his mission... then what's the real need to see his story and for a long time covering it? You don't learn very much about the other characters and family members either and you can dispose of them after the credits roll and forget about them and this film.<br/><br/>The ending felt very rushed. Too much time was spent chasing the Oscar winning family interchange with long emotional stares to capture 'a special moment of contemplation.' Imagine creating a Michael Jordan biography and it taking an hour of middling exposition about someone not very interesting to finally get to the part where the basketball begins to be the primary focus of the story. And then when it comes times to watch the games, it's done on shaky cam to make the experience 'feel real.'<br/><br/>The super close up camerawork felt obnoxious and unsettling. I'm at a loss to understand why this was done and so often. I'm also sure Buzz Aldrin wasn't too thrilled about he was portrayed.<br/><br/>The cinematography is fine and there were redeeming moments.

I can un-equivocally say that, they left out vast amounts of dramatic historical material in favor of this love hate relationship with Pat, which ultimately ends in divorce, then they just cut it off. Neil Armstrong lead a long and colored life and deserved to be more then just his moon landing. So the movie attempts to talk about his life, without covering more then a tiny bit of it. So it fails on drama, and it also fails on the technical side. I happen to know, but wouldn't you want to know what a 1201 and 1202 alarms are? While suiting up, they broke a circuit breaker off and had to use a ball point pen to launch, never mentioned. Then they show Neil avoiding a crater, while talking about rocks vaguely. Well folks it is the sea of tranquility and yes, rocks but NO crater the size of a city. The lander trainer accident, geese talk about suddenly spring it on us, then crash it, there is a story to that also. There is a story about the words he spoke, there was a tiny squabble between who should actually go down the ladder first, where was all that? Who cast this thing by the way?

The camera pans from one view to another in the manner of a poorly shot home movie, more likely to produce dizziness than artistic appreciation. The shots are poorly framed, often shot to close.<br/><br/>The audio was horrendous, although this could be the fault of the theater in which I, sadly wasted my money to see this film.

","This could have been done better, if James Cameron had been asked to just make a 'go to the moon movie'. The history of this event was removed and having watching it intently when it was happening live, I was disappointed beyond words that the pride I felt when seeing the American flag in 1969, was purposely omitted. Of course Ryan Gosling was chic and stylish enough to admit his Canadian birth gives him a ""cognitive bias"", what ever the heck that means, except possibly, it is his way of saying this wasn't an American accomplishment but more of a 'We Are The World' Moment. He explained for the producers that, ""I think this was widely regarded in the end as a human achievement and that's how we chose to view it,' the actor told The Telegraph. ""I also think Neil was extremely humble, as were many of these astronauts, and time and time again he deferred the focus from himself to the 400,000 people who made the mission possible."" Well. no Ryan, you have that butt backwards and upside down. yes, Neil Armstrong as well as all the crews of Apollo missions were humble men but they were first and foremost Americans. The history of this included the often overlooked time of a heightened Cold War, when getting into space and to the Moon was as much an effort to keep the former Soviet Union from possibly weaponizing both as it was for exploration. Of course, Neil Armstrong and those of the Apollo missions are gone and could not be consulted as advisors or for their opinions regarding the political non-statements. I gave this movie one star because it could have been done FAR better and it could have actually followed the true history instead of what the current political climate of anti-Americanism. In historical films, either show the true history. or don't make it at all.

He should get a razzie award for that performance cause it was slower than sling blade eating taters. Next The sound in the movie was nothing short ridiculous. One second you were plugging your ears then the next you were like ""what did he just say? I couldn't hear him"" Their lips were moving but you couldn't understand any of it. the sound guy should never work in film again.

","Initially I resisted seeing this movie because of all of the hype surrounding the omission of the planting of the American flag but on a 10 hour flight to Europe with little else to do I caved and finally decided to watch this movie. Sadly, it left me with little to appreciate.
Let me just say that the missing flag scene is hardly the biggest problem with this movie. In fact, it would not really have fit the movie if they had included it. This movie celebrates nothing about Armstrong and the Apollo program so a triumphant scene with him planting the flag would have been severely out of place. Other reviewers who "" ..found this refreshing and not your typical Hollywood approach"" really miss the larger picture here. The movie's portrayal of Armstrong as dull and lifeless is not only bizarre, it's just plain inaccurate. Armstrong may have been a quiet simple man but he was not the lifeless energy vampire that Gosling makes him out to be. The real Armstrong was still a positive soul despite his passive nature but the movie's version is sad and draining to put it lightly. It also made it too hard to believe that NASA would trust such a morose and disturbed character with such an important technical role.
Look, I can see the artistic value in taking a certain stylized approach to any historical event (see For All Mankind) but First Man is just bizarre. It paints us an empty and soulless picture of the Apollo missions and of those involved. More to the point, I believe it's portrayal of Armstrong is just plain wrong. By the time the movie was over I was left scratching my head wondering why they even made this film at all. What a waste."
"Skotsuyama","4","12","20","5 February 2019"," Painfully boring movie for such a monumental moment in history
","First off, the shaky cam for the entire movie... It looked like they strapped a go pro to a comfort dog. It felt like nothing was in focus, and my eyes were constantly adjusting and trying to find what I was supposed to be looking at. Like a child stole the camera out his parents hands with no notion of how to operate it.<br/><br/>And the parts of Neil Armstrong's life that they chose to show... I felt like they must have chosen the most mundane and boring parts. Like showing how hard it was for his wife to raise their children while he was working. That should be a touching and thought provoking idea. But it came off as annoying, and a padding for the film so it'd be 2 hours. But the film ends up feeling like a 4 hour film with only 20 - 30 minutes worth of content.<br/><br/>I'm not a film maker, so I know I shouldn't judge, but surely, any other film maker would have made this movie it in a way to at least hold your interest. Any after school special would have at least hit me with some key points to hold my attention. Which brings me to terribly slow pace of the editing. I felt like they cut all the emotional parts out, and left in the silent moments after the emotion had passed. And it's horribly boring to watch. I kept having in inject my own imagination into the movie, to help it along. Like why is Neil acting like that now? Why is he with holding his emotions with his wife? Is he stressed? Nervous? Terrified? I'm missing those moments and only showed the moments where he walks into his house, pours a glass of lemon tea, and then lies and said he forgot something at the office. And what office? We never saw him in an office... I don't understand why 70% of the scenes were left in the movie.<br/><br/>The training aspects were great. Why he was selected would have been interesting to watch. But we only get a slight glimpse. I never really got to see what made Neil Armstrong a better candidate than say, Joe Normal Guy. What drove him to try and fly a plane into outer space in the first shot? This movie didn't explore his motivation at all.<br/><br/>A few of his buddies having drinks in the backyard, also we're good to show the camaraderie. Jason Clarke was great. All the acting was great I'd say. Great casting too I think. They felt like a team. That's why I'm guessing the slow paced and failure to intrigue me is due to the team behind the camera. Director, editing, writing.<br/><br/>Maybe this is the director's first film.. I just skimmed his imdb page. And I read he's a great writer. But he didn't write this. That just seems like a terrible fit for this movie. All directors have to start somewhere I guess. But if you ask me would I think the writer of Lalaland would be a good fit to not write First Man, but only to direct it, I'd say of course not! Why would he even pop into your mind? I'm not in the movie business, so I can't connect these dots. But I'm guessing the dots are more about connections he has in the industry rather than being the right guy for the job. I've seen a lot of bad movies and bad directors before. And after watching First Man, this director is definitely one that I'm going to avoiding in the future. Maybe if he writes and directs his own movie it'd be watchable.. I really hope he can prove me wrong.."

I feel that Ryan Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong was a bit weak and very stoic; I'm not sure he smile more than twice. The script (or lack of it) was very bad; there is very little dialog, and a lot of staring into space. The visual effects are very good; however, many of the views feel incomplete (for instance: you hardly ever get a good look at the Saturn V Rocket). The score wasn't bad, it wasn't over the top either. I believe if there would have been more dialog, and less feelings and emotions this film would have been much better.

","Underneath the catastrophic camerawork and lazy choices, there is (if you look hard enough) a rubbish movie. Cheezel opts to use shaky-cam almost permanently, even when filming inanimate objects like a side of ham. That shot of ham is also totally irrelevant, but hey it made the final cut, so... yeah, the film seems to have been assembled with sticky tape and edited through the wrong end of a telescope judging by its constant use of extreme close-ups. Ryan Goosegg's big old wonky face takes up most of the screen most of the time and it quickly becomes very annoying (and I'm someone who usually likes him). Couple this with a camera that twitches around like a dying moth and the result is a thoroughly unpleasant watch. There is even a couple of crash-zooms to people sitting at a desk, bored. The whole effect is genuinely nauseating. Thankfully, any nausea you may feel will be quickly replaced by irritation as the director lurches towards something else that doesn't matter.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is so innocuous it might as well not be there, except of course for the times when it is suddenly blaringly loud and drowning the dialogue. On the other hand, the sound editing is also garbage (are those jet engines I hear? Hmmm). Any set design, costume or production value is swamped by a drab and lifeless colour palette. It goes out of focus a lot too. Oh god.<br/><br/>The acting is sub-par throughout and smacks of a bunch of actors who don't know where the camera is (they likely didn't, apart from the times it was touching their nose).

In addition the ""Whitee on the moon"" song suggesting space travel was done with black peoples lunch money, and then were the final scenes of Armstrong on the moon blankly glaring into never land with flashbacks of home, where if there were a caption would have read something like "" WTF are we doing here?"" as if the purpose of space travel was to populate some glorious new world that we were all told existed.

"bastille-852-731547","6","41","84","12 October 2018"," Well-Intentioned but Generic Recreation of a Great Event in History
","Being a fan of Damien Chazelle's other films as well as of Ryan Gosling's acting, I was excited to see their interpretation of Neil Armstrong's famous moon landing, an event which has served as an inspiring symbol of the greatness that mankind can aspire to be. In a time when franchise movies and blockbusters dominate the marquee at mainstream multiplexes, it's refreshing to see good old-fashioned adult dramas in wide release like this and ""A Star Is Born"" (even though, of course, I do enjoy some blockbusters.) While the film has some good cinematography and a commendable lead performance by Gosling, the film feels dry and rather generic.<br/><br/>I understand and respect what Chazelle was trying to do here, and I acknowledge that the moon landing has been depicted enough times in popular art that it can be difficult to depict it one more time and still feel uniquely authentic, but the film unfortunately does have some serious flaws. The film's pacing is rather strange, as much of the middle section of the film feels melodramatic in a way that is directly at odds with its rousing opening scene and climax. Gosling's performance is poignant and thoughtful in its inner simplicity, but unfortunately Claire Foy is not given too much to do here as Janet Armstrong. (Too bad, because she certainly has acting talent.) Additionally, the film's juxtaposition of scenes is rather unusual. Before the moon landing finale, the film jumps from moment to moment dealing with Armstrong's life, yet not all of it adds up. These depictions generally miss the mark in terms of making you further care about Armstrong moreso than what you see in the space scenes. I liked that Chazelle shot some of the space scenes in the cockpit to allow the viewer to engage in the intensity of the experience, but the cinematography sometimes felt off during these moments. Perhaps it could have been even more effective and immersive to film some of the space scenes in first-person from Armstrong's perspective. With their old-fashioned aesthetic and simple dialogue, many of these scenes feel like Chazelle is playing it far too ""safe"" here. It's commendable that he wanted to show respect to Armstrong and his family, but he's a seasoned auteur who could definitely have created a thoroughly respectful portrait of Neil Armstrong while taking a bit more artistic risk.<br/><br/>All in all, I didn't dislike ""First Man"" by any means, but I wasn't too enthused about it either. 6/10<br/><br/>Note: I saw this movie in IMAX. The opening scene and moon landing scene were both very good in IMAX, but the rest of the movie (which adds up to a little under two hours) barely uses the format at all to enhance the viewing experience, even slightly."
"jeremy_kramer","6","32","64","12 October 2018"," Incoherence marries Interstellar (seen in IMAX)
","There's a huge difference between something that was ugly from the start and something beautiful that was marred. This film is the latter. Gorgeous shots, creative composition and movement and cinematic energy are juxtaposed (intentionally, but not necessarily well) with shots that I can only conlude were taken by putting the camera at the end of a giant spring doorstop and *thwang*ing it, and somehow doing the same with the audio. <br/><br/>Disorientation, lack of visuals, and auditory confusion are all key to portraying period's equipment and technology. However, there is a rhythm of confusion and order in space faring filmmaking. It's being upside down and sideways, struggling to regain control of the craft, audible and visual chaos, etc. that movies like 2001 A Space Odyssey and Interstellar perfect, but ""First Man"" gets so so wrong. <br/><br/>The second issue with the film is it's extraordinarily poor character relatability. After losing their daughter in the first scenes of the film, Neil and Janet Armstrong are emotionless and heartless characters, but not in a manner that's useful for storytelling. Their rare displays of feeling are in Janet's case put off onto an apparent smoking addiction and in Neil's case shielded by his reflective headpiece (with the exception of a spoilery moment that didn't ring true because of lack of substantive foreshadowing). <br/><br/>We've all seen gorgeous imagery of landscapes in space. I wanted to feel the moment of man's first steps and the look on Neil's face, and all I got was a half-recreation, half-historical footage emotionless piece any youtuber could have made. <br/><br/>Then there's Buzz Aldrin, whom Damien Chazelle really seems to have it in for, making him out to be a royal a-hole at every turn and earning the disgust of Armstrong. But it all backfires on Chazelle, because he gave zero screen time to any relationship building between the two men, who are described by historians as having a great working relationship despite being very different men. But no, according to this film, Buzz was an a-hole, and we don't know much else. Do you think NASA would have allowed two men to depend their lives upon one another if they had that poor of a bond? <br/><br/>There has been much attention given to the film for things like it's attention to the flight maneuvers and descent onto the lunar surface, but zero attention is given to the things that people want to know: who decided who would step out first? How did Collins feel seeing the moon from so close but yet having to stay in the command module? What was it like to plant the american flag? Show us the reactions of houston, his family, and the planet as a whole!<br/><br/>But no, just panorama shots of the surface and flashbacks to a picnic. <br/><br/>5 stars in generous for this extreme disappointment."

"DJKwa","6","13","23","13 October 2018"," Not exactly a biopic, nor a comprehensive account of the moon landing; First Man feels conflicted
","For a largely uncharted territory, space has proven to be well-trodden ground in film. From Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity, which offered a uniquely visceral perspective into the sheer force of will necessary to survive above Earth, to Hidden Figures, which provided valuable insight into the overlooked behind the scenes work of female minorities at NASA, there have been no shortages of quality space films over the past few years. <br/><br/>For his fourth feature film, acclaimed director Damien Chazelle, provides his own addition to the space race by charting the life of Neil Armstrong in the years leading up to him becoming the first man on the Moon. While ostensibly a film about Armstrong, it would be remiss to call First Man a biopic. The film splits its focus between Armstrong's family life and the intense weight his mission bore down on his loved ones, while simultaneously trying to glorify the magnitude of his achievement as a sort of hagiography. By trying to have it both ways, First Man feels conflicted and struggles to provide a fresh perspective on well-documented history.<br/><br/>Part of the problem lies in Armstrong's inherent nature. As an introverted individual, Ryan Gosling's performance comes off as accordingly cold and distant. He embodies Armstrong as a quiet, contemplative man who mostly keeps to himself and is singularly focused on the success of the mission. The blandness of Gosling's performance may be misconstrued as shallow characterisation but he successfully communicates Armstrong's stoic determination that was necessary for the lunar mission to succeed. The issue, however, is that the film never successfully matches his low-key nature with enough dramatic heft (particularly as the outcome of the lunar landing is well-known history), leaving long stretches of the story feeling dry and uninvolving.<br/><br/>In fact, most of Armstrong's personality traits can be gleamed from his relationship with his wife, Janet Shearon, played with powerful force by Claire Foy. Without a doubt, the most effective dramatic scenes are the ones shared between Gosling and Foy. A dutiful housewife and loving mother, Foy's Shearon is no pushover and she stands her ground against the boys club that is NASA. When Armstrong attempts to leave for the Apollo mission without saying goodbye to their sons, she confronts him emphatically and forces a family sit down. Her assertive nature clashes sharply with Armstrong's nonchalance, and she offers a stark psychoanalytical counterpoint to him. <br/><br/>However, the film defers digging too deep into Armstrong's psychological state by keeping the lunar mission in the forefront of the narrative and his family life as ancillary, in case it would lessen the reverence surrounding his achievement. You only get glimpses of his home life and the resulting fractured sense of characterisation is likely to leave you feeling more conflicted about who Neil Armstrong was by the film's end.<br/><br/>The other part of the problem is that, as a retelling of the trials and tribulations of the lunar lading, the film is hardly an exhaustive account. Covering the time period from 1961, when Armstrong was an X-15 pilot, to the eventual Apollo 11 mission in 1969, the constant jumps in time leave little room for detailed recreations of both the physical and mental preparations that went into putting the first man onto the moon. <br/><br/>Moreover, certain contextual details of the time period are touched upon but quickly go by the wayside, such as one scene depicting African American musicians singing the lyrics of Gil Scott-Heron's ""Whitey on the Moon"" which hints at a fascinating social-political subtext to the story that never arrives. Thus, those seeking a fact-based take are better off seeking one of the countless documentaries on the moon landing.<br/><br/>Instead, First Man exists in a middling space (pun unintended) where it's easy to see the passion behind the film but hard to see its exact raison d'etre. It's respectfully made, but perhaps too much so, seemingly content on re-treading past achievements by fairly conventional means. <br/><br/>Where First Man excels is in its more personal touches, in particular in its handling of grief and trauma, stemming from Armstrong's personal loss of one of his children, as both fuel and a drawback to his professional pursuit. It's a through line that is poignantly tied off in one of the film's closing scenes and it's this sort of nuance that feels like it offers something fresh to the story, despite its historical trappings.<br/><br/>Ultimately, while it's easy to admire the craft behind the film and the respectful means by which it treats its main subject, First Man's resistance to probe too deep into Armstrong's psychology or to provide a fresh, modern perspective on well-documented history leaves it, too often, feeling lost in space."

","Overall I am disappointed by this movie, which tries to be docudrama. While visually spectacular, it often fails to depict the environment of space realistically.<br/><br/>Some of those scenes are beautiful and great (lunar module Eagle gliding serenely in lunar orbit) - but other key scenes fail miserably, if you know what the reality is like. Many of the scenes set in the vacuum of space (not inside the ship) have explosive and whooshing sounds. The director is trying to make it more ""exciting"", but it's not exciting to me if I know it's not real. A few movies have gotten around the ""space is silent"" quandary in imaginative ways - ""Gravity"" used extremely effective music to go along with soundless explosions, ""2001"" used the sound of breathing as the astronaut drifted through the void.<br/><br/>The lunar landscape is depicted as ridiculously craggy and extremely steep, especially at Apollo 11's landing site. At one point Armstrong walks up to a crater, which looks like a deep black well. Silly and phony-looking. The craters and slopes on the real Moon are almost always very gentle and lunar terrain has been softened and sandblasted by micrometeoroids for billions of years,<br/><br/>The Earth is depicted as a crescent during the Apollo 11 EVA, when actually it was gibbous on July 20, 1969. You might say that's a very minor nitpick, but the movie presents itself as a docudrama - displaying technical sloppiness with no regard for realism."

","'First Man' is the story of Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and how he became the first human to walk on the moon. It's amazing that after almost 50 years, this film's never been made before - but we've had 'Space Cowboys'! While largely focused on Armstrong, the film does a good job of showing how essential all the other NASA engineers and astronauts were during the 1960s to making the Apollo 11 mission a success.<br/><br/>The film spends almost as much time exploring Neil's relationships with his family - wife Janet (Foy) & sons Eric (Winters) and Mark (Blodgett). They certainly go through their share of tragedies and funerals, making the film quite melodramatic. It almost gets bogged down in politics in the middle too. While Gosling's OK, he comes across a quite bland and boring - possibly intentionally. I think he was going for humble, but ended up as mild.<br/><br/>The film's at it's best when it's focusing on space - rather than watching the rocket launch from distance, like on TV, we're stuck in the cockpit with the astronauts as they're shut in, and it's quite claustrophobic. But instead of cutting away, we experience lift-off from their point of view - all the noise, shaking and velocity. It's annoying there's often a black screen for seconds at a time, but it's realistic for space. The score's OK and you do get to spend some time on the moon.

","""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."".<br/><br/>Neil Armstrong did the impossible in 1969. As the U.S. and the Russians ran a cut-throat competition to see who could reach new imperial heights in outer space, it was Armstrong, Aldrin and all the good folks at NASA that took it upon themselves to wage an all-out, all costs battle to touch our lunar friend in the sky, plant our flag and mark it ours. They all did just that on July 20th, 1969 as millions of Americans sat in front of their TV sets and watched the first ever glimpses of the surface of our moon. Ever since, space travel has expanded and advanced to heights beyond our wildest dreams and to think there's an eternity left to be discovered. But the story of the moon landing has just as much to do with the man that Armstrong was as it does with the nation that let him pursue his remarkable journey. First Man is perhaps the most fitting cinematic memorial of one of the most incredible men that ever lived.<br/><br/>Walking out of the screening, I kept thinking how impossible it was to imagine anyone having brought this film to life other than Damien Chazelle. If Whiplash was an excruciating assault of the senses detailing the teeth-nashing art of drumming, First Man is a sensory body blow that needs to be experienced on the largest screen possible and the loudest sound system you can find. Chazelle found a way to place us right there in the spacecraft. The shaking, the pounding, the soaring and the crashing into earth. I hear simulators on Earth can gives us near perfect space travel experiences, but the entire masterful opening sequence will suffice for me. I was clawing the back of my seat. It's a moment in film you'll never forget. Even more so is the final sequence on the moon. Armstrong exits the ship, and the soundtrack cuts out immediately. You take it all in. The miles of sediment leading to a black abyss. You look up, and there's Earth staring back at you. The only thing we see of Armstrong is the reflection on his helmet of what's in front of him. Apollo 13, eat your heart out for breakfast, lunch and dinner.<br/><br/>In between the breathless, action-packed space travel sequences is an unexpected emotional journey into Armstrong's family life. The loss of his youngest daughter, and his wife, Janet, who begs him never to travel to the moon, out of certainty that he'd be gone soon after. Claire Foy is a powerhouse and steals the show as she corners the boys at NASA for a stern talking to. Never get in the way of the strong woman behind every great man. These scenes don't carry the effectual gravitas of the scenes in outer space, rather, they come across as home movies, complete with a shaky 16mm camera. Authenticity is what is being strived for here, and it sure accomplishes that. What is also not lost in First Man is Chazelle's ear for good music and how to utilize it powerfully. First Man is no musical, that's for certain, but throughout the film, little cues from scratchy records of the 1950's captures the tenderness of Neil and Janet, and the underlying love story that thematically bookends our experience.<br/><br/>This is a story not just about accomplishment, but self pride and selfless love of those that are nearest to you. It's what keeps us all going, and it's comforting to know that it's what got Mr. Armstrong to the moon. This has been a long winded explanation in telling you all that First Man shouldn't be missed this season."

It leaves me wondering how this film came about; was there a long list of events and details that had to be ticked off? No drama, just get it in there and get on with it?
Was this based on a autobiography that was concocted as a quick fix by a ghost writer with no empathy?
Is it proof that some types of books is not the right source for movie scripts?
Was Neil Armstrong so dysfunctional in his private life and just a stick jockey with no feelings and emotions?
Could this have been his attempt to explain why he had to make sacrifices to cope with the dangerous and difficult task at hand?
The presentation was not the normal ""out of this world"" glitz and glamour that is normal for Hollywood productions, but it was also devoid of anything meaningful and something except a timeline accurate to a T.

Also, although the exploration of Armstrong's relationship with his wife was fairly interesting, the depiction of the same with his fellow astronauts and Aldrin in particular was a major lost opportunity. After the movie, I felt no wiser at all than I did before in this respect.
But the major failing of this movie is the awful vertigo inducing camerawork. Pivotal action sequences and events are told through blurred out of focus shots of extreme close ups. The shaky handheld camerawork just left me feeling ill.

Not once or twice, but several times throughout the movie. Armstrong doesn't have much of a personality, he's more of an introvert, and even the interactions with his wife and kids are pretty hum-drum. My friend, who is a big NASA fan, wanted to see this movie, so I agreed to go with him. Was pleasantly surprised with ""Hidden Figures"" which was a great movie about NASA. But this one, unfortunately made me want to walk out and not come back. I had to close my eyes and pacify the pounding in my chest for half of it."

","Enough has been written about the choices of photography, acting, etc. I won't repeat all that. My low rating comes from the fact that significant parts of the movie script NEVER happened - think twirling, bracelet on the moon, incidents with wife/kids, etc.
So what is this movie about if it's not historically accurate info about Neil Armstrong? It's fiction (or ""fact-ion""), being sold by implying it's about a famous name and event. Personally I don't like to get suckered into watching an emotional roller coaster that never happened by being told its about Armstrong. That's a cheesy trick at best.
Would this movie have done well without the Neil Armstrong name? I doubt it."

"marco-m-morana","1","9","15","13 January 2019"," Missed Opportunity
","It is biographical movie about the life of Neil Armstrong based on Hansen's book ""First Man The Life of Neil Armstrong"". Jeffrey Kulger in the Life magazine commemorative edition of Neil Armstrong's life 1930-2012, the Armstrong I was, on what Neil said when asked about Hansen's book: ""I do not have the book ! and snapped"". I wonder if Neil was asked about this movie in 2018, hypothetically speaking since he died in 2012, he would have snapped as well. In my opinion, this movie fails to focus on one of the main reasons of why Neil was humble about his achievement to be the first man on the moon. Jeff asked this exact question to Neil's first wife Jane: ""he feels guilty that he got all the acclaim for an effort of tens of thousand people"". This movie fails to focus on this important aspect of Neil's career that should be celebrated along with the people that worked for and with NASA in those years. The producers of this movie should have asked themselves what was the point to do such a movie. The movie focuses on the grief for the loss of his daughter that is certainly important but neglects important aspects of his life and career. The movie could have focus on how he dealt with the celebrity status after he left NASA and his pursuit of teaching engineering at University of Cincinnati and how he remain humble about his achievements for all the years after the moon landing. The movie could have focus on how inspiring his life has been for many young people that choose careers in science and engineering following his foot steps. This movie is really a missed opportunity to emphasise what made Neil Armstrong one of the greatest American heroes of all time!"

"kenstallings-65346","2","9","15","3 November 2018"," Bad movie about a great event
","The jury of the public is the final say. The critics can try to carry a film over the finish line, but it never works. The truth of a film's quality is how the paying public reacts to it.<br/><br/>First Man is a film about the greatest achievement of the 20th century. When one chooses to make a film about real people and real events, it is important to not only get the most critical details of those actions correct, without omitting the most poignant, but also to determine how to translate those events into an entertaining narrative.<br/><br/>The most prevalent theme of the paying public is that this film suffers from terrible cinematography, and it does. The second most prevalent theme is that it renders the subject matter boring, and it does.<br/><br/>What the producers of this film failed miserably to understand is that people who operate complex systems like aircraft and space craft have to compartment their life issues and focus on the job, or else they get distracted and risk killing themselves and others. They don't do this because they are uncaring or unable to connect to others, but out of a realization that if they fail to do it, they cause mishaps that get people killed and cause many others heartache.<br/><br/>Neil Armstrong was a Navy pilot who faced significant risks. Military jet aircraft of that era were notoriously unreliable, and the mishap rates were twenty times worse than they are today.<br/><br/>The producers decided that Armstrong's ability to compartment his life and do his job meant he was wooden. That was a terribly unfair treatment of the actual man. Armstrong was not the first man who had trouble figuring out how to tell his children that daddy may not come home! That didn't make him unfeeling. Worse, they tried to build a two and a half hour film around a central character who was presented as boring and one-dimensional.<br/><br/>Good historians take their picks to open up the pad locks guarding the truth, to find the elements that are often hidden away from the public. Neil Armstrong was a quiet and unassuming man, but inwardly was a human being of the same emotions and values as most people. He just knew how to put on his ""public face"" and perform the job without distractions when the time called for it. Vice work to find that inner man and present him, the producers instead decided to portray someone as unable to connect with his own family and outside world.<br/><br/>Those who worked most closely with Armstrong, who are still alive, such as his co-pilot Buzz Aldrin, plus Chuck Yeager, have said that this movie presented a Neil Armstrong that did not match the man they knew! The compelling nuggets of Armstrong as a feeling human being were out there, but these producers didn't seek out the people who knew about them!<br/><br/>Many reviewers who saw the film in restricted premiers tried to convey these negatives, but those reviews were silenced all too often. Presented to the public instead were a series of very positive reviews, and the bad ones were hidden away.<br/><br/>The public reacted by bestowing $16 million on this film in its opening week. In the two weeks after, the film grossed just $23.8 million. The fourth week is projected to go further downhill.<br/><br/>What happened is that word of mouth started to overwhelm the positive critics' reviews. The public, especially those who would have normally flocked to support this movie, turned away from it. Due to this, the film is not projected to even meet its $60 million budget mark. That is the definition of a box office flop, and no amount of orchestrated plaudits from the film industry can alter that truth.<br/><br/>It wasn't merely the highly questionable cinematography or the overarching one-dimensional character presentations. This movie also struck a false chord with potential viewers long before it's worldwide premier.<br/><br/>The third most frequent lament is that the producers omitted the flag planting scene on the moon's surface, and instead just showed the flag there as a background shot. That was a needless self-inflicted wound.<br/><br/>Hollywood needs to take a hard look at itself and ask itself some tough questions. There are millions of potential customers out there who have slowly taken themselves out of the movie market. There are many reasons for this, but the most central reason is a series of bad movies, many trying to send political messages.<br/><br/>Samuel Goldwyn, who led the Golden Age of Hollywood, famously said, ""Pictures are for entertainment, messages should be delivered by Western Union.""<br/><br/>In the same vein of The Right Stuff and Apollo 13, this movie First Man could have been, and should have been, a box office winner. I hope Hollywood learns again to put entertainment first, and get the messaging out of the effort. It has already driven away too many customers, and this film has done that result even more harm."

Suffice to say it was very boring and very inaccurate and certainly not worth waiting for.<br/><br/>The highlight of this film was the Gemini 8 malfunction. However, even this was wrecked by constant cutaways to the family. What could have been really gripping was totalled by bad direction and editing.<br/><br/>Other points of note:<br/><br/><ul><li>what is it with EYES.

I sometimes wondered if it was a foreign language film.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>why was it necessary to keep ramming the ""Armstrong is a family man"" down our throats all the time?

Then there was almost total silence on the landing/walk when it could have done with music.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the astronauts were far too busy to be crying on the Moon or hanging their heads in the spacecraft as shown here. Those attempts to make them look human just fell flat.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>inaccuracies abound.

"bob-the-movie-man","10","18","35","27 October 2018"," He captured a feeling. Sky with no ceiling.
","I am a child of the 60's, born in 1961. The ""Space Race"" for me was not some historical concept but a pervasive backdrop to my childhood. I still recall, at the age of 8, being marched into my junior school's assembly hall. We all peered at the grainy black-and-white pictures of Neil Armstrong as he spoke his famously fluffed line before stepping onto the lunar surface. The event happened at 3:54am UK time, so clearly my recollection of ""seeing it live"" is bogus. (I read that the BBC stayed on air until 10:30 in the morning, so it was probably a 'final review' of the night's events I saw). It is probably lodged in my memory less for the historical event and more due to the fact that there was TELEVISION ON IN THE MORNING! (Kids, ask your grandparents!)<br/><br/>But back to Damien Chazelle's film. We start early in the 60's with America getting well and truly kicked up the proberbial by the Russians in the space race: they fail to get the first man in space; they fail to carry out the first spacewalk. So the Americans, following the famous JFK speech, set their sights on the moon. It's the equivalent of making a mess of cutting your toenails but then deciding to have a go at brain surgery. NASA develop the Gemini programme to practice the essential docking manoevers required as a precursor for the seemingly impossible ('two blackboard') mission that is Apollo. But the price paid for such ambition is high.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong as a dedicated, prickly, professional; altogether not a terribly likeable individual. Claire Foy plays his long-suffering wife Janet, putting her support for her husband's dangerous profession ahead of her natural fears of becoming a single mother.<br/><br/>There is obviously little tension to be mined from a film that has such a well-known historical context. Those with even a subliminal knowledge of the subject will be aware of the key triumphs and tragedies along the way. The script (by Josh Singer, ""The Post""; ""Spotlight"") is very well done in developing a creeping dread of knowing what is shortly to come.<br/><br/>Even with these inherent spoilers, Chazelle still manages to evoke armrest-squeezing tension into the space flight sequences. A lot of this is achieved through disorientating camera movements and flashing images that may irritate some but I found to be highly effective. (Did anyone else flash back to that excellent ""Mission Space"" ride at Epcot during the launch sequences?) This hand-held cinematography by Linus Sandgren (Chazelle's ""La La Land"" collaborator) is matched by some utterly drop-dead gorgeous shots - beautifully framed; beautifully lit - that would be worthy of a Kaminski/Spielberg collaboration.<br/><br/>Those expecting a rollercoaster thrill-ride of the likes of ""Apollo 13"" will be disappointed. The film has more of the slow-and-long-burn feeling of ""The Right Stuff"" in mood and, at 141 minutes, some might even find it quite boring. There is significant time, for example, spent within the family home. These scenes include turbulent events of which I wasn't previously aware: events that form the cornerstone of the film's drama. For me, the balance of the personal and the historical background was perfectly done. I found it curious though that with such a family-oriented drama Chazelle chose to ditch completely any cuts away to the earthbound onlookers during the tense lunar landing sequence. (Compare and contrast with Ron Howard's masterly inter-cutting in the re-entry scene of ""Apollo 13""). With the outcome foretold, perhaps such tension building was considered unnecessary? I'm not suggesting it was wrong to 'stay in the moment' with the astronauts, but it's a bold directorial move.<br/><br/>Overall, the foolhardiness of NASA trying to do what they did with the 60's technology at their disposal is well-portrayed. If you've been lucky enough, as I have, to view the Apollo 11 capsule in the National Air and Space museum in Washington you can't help but be impressed by the bravery of Armstong, Aldrin and Collins in getting in that bucket of bolts and putting their lives on the line. True American heroes.<br/><br/>On that topic, the ""flag issue"" has generated much self-righteous heat within the US media; that is regarding Chazelle not showing the American flag being planted. This seems fatuous to me. Not only is the flag shown on the moon, but the film ably demonstrates the American know-how and bravery behind the mission. If Clint Eastwood had been directing he would have probably gone there: but for me it certainly didn't need any further patriotism rubbed in the viewer's face.<br/><br/>Are Oscar nominations on the cards for Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy? For me, it would be staggering if they are not: this film has ""Oscar nomination"" written all over it. I'd also certainly not bet against Foy winning for Best Actress: her portrayal of a wife on the edge is nothing short of brilliant. And perhaps, just perhaps, this might be Gosling's year too.<br/><br/>Elsewhere there are strong supporting performances from Kyle Chandler (as Deke Slayton), Corey Stoll (as the 'tell it how it is' Buzz Aldrin) and Jason Clarke (as Ed White). It's also great to see Belfast-born Ciarán Hinds in another mainstream Hollywood release.<br/><br/>For me, another dead cert Oscar nomination will be Justin Hurwitz for the score which is breathtakingly brilliant, not just in its compelling themes but also in its orchestration: the use of the eerie theremin and melodic harp are just brilliant together. I haven't heard a score this year that's more fitting to the visuals: although it's early in the Oscar season to be calling it, I'd be very surprised if this didn't walk away with the statuette.<br/><br/>In Summary: loved this. Damien Chazelle - with ""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"" and now ""First Man"" - has hit all of three out of the park in my book. It's not really a film for thrill-seekers, who might get bored, but anyone, like me, with an interest in the history of space exploration will I think lap it up: for this was surely the most memorable decade in space history... so far.<br/><br/>On leaving the cinema I looked up at the rising moon and marvelled once more at the audacity of man. My eyes then drifted across to the red dot that was Mars. How long I wonder? And how many dramatic film biographies still to come?"

","Let me start by saying I am a fan of Damien Chazelle and was deeply impressed by his creativity with La La Land. He's a talent, to be sure. But his attempt to direct a film about Neil Armstrong's life leading up to the moon landing was really poorly done.
First, it was difficult to visually relate to the film because so many scenes were intentionally underlit. Contrast that with better illuminated sets of Apollo 13 and the Right Stuff and you'll see what I mean. Secondly, Chazelle loves extreme closeups (spaghetti western style) in this movie, which at least for me was uncomfortable viewing. It just sucks the oxygen our of the scene. Third, he chose to emphasize the personal trials and tribulations of the lead character, rather than on the profoundness of the event and its impact on all of humanity. In other words, what Armstrong achieved by studying, training and landing on the moon transcended the personal issues he struggled with. Every great hero has deeply personal challenges. I felt 65% of the film dealt with his pent-up emotions and aloofness, while 35% was devoted to the men and women behind the exciting achievement of man's first moon landing. I would have reversed the ratio. The whole world (and thus greater box office revenues) would have been more interested in how this extraordinary feat was accomplished.
But my biggest criticism is his obsessive use of loud orchestral music throughout much of the film. It was maddening. Virtually every scene had a score --- and I swear some of the music sounded an awful lot like the themes in La La Land.
Simply put -- First Man should not have been directed by Chazelle, and the studio who approved that arrangement really screwed up. Again, he's a tremendous talent with musically- oriented motion pictures, but he was totally out of his element with this film. I can only imagine how Chris Nolan or Ron Howard would have approached this subject. And perhaps we will one day see the definitive motion picture on how mankind was able to pull off this history-shattering feat. First Man was just a first (and disappointing) attempt."

There is merely a wide shot that shows both the lunar lander and the flag from a distance. The film doesn't rewrite history or try to be anti-American. The movie still goes out of its way to point out the event as an American achievement. Heck, it even had a French woman say something like ""I knew America could do it, I had faith"". If you choose to boycott this movie because of that one shot that wasn't in the movie...then that is honestly sad. And you if see it and then hate it for that reason, you completely missed the point of the film: Armstrong dealing with a personal family tragedy. In place of the flag planting, the film choose to focus on something more personal that many are lead to believe really happened. Honestly, I hope it did because it was beautiful.

"TheLittleSongbird","7","12","22","23 October 2018"," To experience the impossible journey
","'First Man' intrigued me from the get go. It was based on one of the most important and fascinating true stories and achievements there's ever been, and a very interesting man. It had talented actors such as Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy, both of whom have done a lot of fine work. And it was directed by Damien Chazelle, responsible for 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land' which for me were both among the best of their respective years.<br/><br/>Seeing 'First Man', there is a lot to admire and it was not a problem for me that it took a different approach and an unconventional way of executing a biopic. Can see why 'First Man' hasn't connected with others though, it is a polarising film where one can see both sides of like and dislike and part of me was a little disappointed. With so much going for it, one expects a great film but 'First Man' for me was only good and not as good as 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land'. Ranking it amongst other 2018 films seen, it's nowhere near among the worst it also falls short of being one of the best.<br/><br/>Starting with the not so good things, 'First Man' runs a little too long, something that would have been solved by trimming a few of the scenes that went on longer than they needed to. Which would have tightened some of the pacing, some of the film drags.<br/><br/>At times structurally it's disjointed, with some of the back and forth not always clear while aspects could have been delved into further. Do have to agree too sadly that the shakiness of the camera work was excessive at times, did feel queasiness on occasions. The ending felt anti-climactic.<br/><br/>However, on the most part 'First Man' is visually stunning. It's immaculately designed and there is a lot of atmosphere and elegance in the way it's shot, an effective claustrophobia in the more tense scenes being evoked. Not everybody has liked the music, personally found it very haunting and like with 'Whiplash' and 'La La Land' Chazelle's utilisation of it is masterly. Chazelle's unique directing style is all over the film.<br/><br/>The script is intelligent and thought-provoking and while the storytelling was not perfect mostly it did engross me and boasts some thrillingly tense moments (like one of my favourite opening scenes of the year), a subtle intimacy and emotional power. The human drama is affecting and the training and flight sequences tight and have a suitable tension and grandeur. The characters are not what one calls likeable but there is a realism to them and 'First Man' is very strongly acted. Ryan Gosling shows a remarkable ability of conveying a lot without having to say a lot in scenes while Claire Foy provides the film's emotional heft magnificently. There is a detachment in their chemistry but that worked considering the situation, coping with grief and loss does drive a wedge and push people away. The rest of the cast do well, with Corey Stoll surprisingly providing one of the more colourful performances.<br/><br/>Summing up, good but could have been better. Not a giant leap in film-making, not a small step either. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"me-hoseini09","6","49","113","4 October 2018"," Stunning direction... poor characterization... mediocre production
","I attended the premiere of the movie in Salt Lake City with my friends, whom I brought to the cinema with a promise of a great movie, staring Ryan Gosling, and they were not disappointed. Most of them liked the movie but it was not what is expected from an admired movie about Apollo mission to the Moon.
The pace of the film is reasonable. It starts at the right place, where it shows how Neil Armstrong joins NASA and it does not jump forward. Everything is on the track. It TRIES to keep a balance between showing Neil's domestic relations with his family and his achievements and struggles at work until he makes it to the moon. That is good directing and somehow good script.<br/><br/>The problem with the characters is that after the movie you cannot tell what kind of person each on of them are. Neil himself does not talk much and he's always down and blue, apparently because her daughter dies of cancer many years ago. What we see is that he is a silent person who does not care much about his family and is too much into his work. There is a strong presence of apathy in his reactions which is rooted in directing, screen writing and the acting altogether. It kinda ruins your notion of a successful person and not like non-perfectionist realism, but more like why that guy acts this way. Other characters are not developed any better. Neil's interaction with his wife, children or even his colleagues are always vague and ambiguous at best.<br/><br/>And just because it is an admired movie, don't expect a production quality like Gravity or Interstellar. There are too much camera zoom and too much camera shaking. A large portion of the movie shows thrilling moments of launching rockets or when rockets are in trouble, and all you can see is the camera shaking like crazy for too long while it is zoomed on faces or spaceship walls. That along with the loud sound of cinemas you get a small dizziness by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>For most of the part I focused on drawbacks, but it is still a relatively good movie that shows the chronicles and history of the most important (claimed!) space travel, with good production design.
It is worthy to watch. Go and see it. But lower your exceptions!"
"xiomatic","9","2","2","11 June 2020"," Stark, claustrophobic and real
","Bemused at the reviews of ""boring"" or ""too long"". This is not Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, and is not meant to be. It is a character study based on a book James R Hansen which is a biography of Neil Armstrong, rather than a story of the moon landing per se. Of course the movie is going to show the moon landing, and the events which lead up to it, but these are just part of what the movie is about.<br/><br/>We see how hard it is to be a test pilot then astronaut. The launches and flights are seen from Neil's perspective, his visceral experience of being on top of a missile smashing into space. These scenes are not spectacular, in the Apollo 13 sense, but dark, claustrophobic, noisy and confusing, like it really was. A lot of people who perhaps were brought up on super-hero Hollywood movies cannot seem to relate to the portrayal an actual human being matter of factly doing things which are so far beyond normal. So we have the usual morons complaining about the fact that Armstrong doesn't smile enough or have anything witty to say while he is fighting for his life, you know, like they do in the movies. This level of immature stupidity is beyond my ken, so I'll just say just don't watch it. Keep to Star trek or Iron Man or whatever.<br/><br/>If you do appreciate what real people do in real life, warts and all, you will hopefully appreciate this starkly dry portrayal of a man who has all the flaws of you and me, but who also just happens to repeatedly face life threatening situations and find solutions to them on the fly. Armstrong is shown as an introverted man of few words and not particular friendly. But he has extraordinary coolness under extreme pressure. That's why he was chosen as the first man.<br/><br/>On a philosophical side note, it is not unusual for a truly great man of history to be reviled by the ankle biters of his day. There are whole industries of historians who specialize in trying to bring down the great to their own wormlike size, and I have no doubt this is or will happen to Armstrong. But unlike pretty much everyone living today, his name will be known a thousand years from now.<br/><br/>The movie portrays a real marriage, so unlike what is normal in Hollywood that it seems to be a shock to a lot of people. Maybe they don't have wives, I don't know. I certainly could relate to one or two exchanges between Neil and his wife Janet. Clare Foy portrays her as a sweet but strong woman. What it would have been like for her to hear her husband on the intercom say ""We're in trouble"" I don't know.<br/><br/>This movie is almost fly on the wall documentary when it comes to the rocket scenes, and kitchen sink stage drama when it comes to the personal stuff. I'm not a fan of Ryan Gosling, but he is convincing here. He really does a great portrayal of Neil Armstrong."

"steve-56840","3","2","2","15 August 2019"," Technical Issues Interfered with the Production
","I just couldn't keep some of the technical issues explained below from interfering with my enjoyment of this film.<br/><br/>When a cinematic feature is used sparingly, it can add immensely. In this film, sparingly wasn't part of the vocabulary.<br/><br/>The subjective camera is fine but when used with a long lens, the motion is exaggerated. It would have been sufficient to use a camera stabilizer when filming an actor close up. There would still have been a subjective camera but more like we would see if we were actually in the camera's position.<br/><br/>Why the extreme close ups? It was overused. What was the point? Imagine what that looks like on a 35 foot high theatre screen--totally out of proportion.<br/><br/>When the rockets were firing into orbit, the vibration introduced by the camera/motion rig was excessive. If the vibration really were that severe, the rocket would have torn itself apart.<br/><br/>The rocket engine noise (actually a jet engine) was dramatically enhanced to raise our excitement. I understand that. But inside the space suits, the sound was quite small due to the isolation of the space suit.<br/><br/>Lastly, as the moon lander gets very close to the landing site, the scene shifts to a panorama shot of the the moon taken from a position of a camera on the surface. That made no sense at all. I suppose that was an editing error where that scene should have been inserted after the astronauts were on the surface."

","When I read (I assume) HBO's description stating ""...in this masterful film about the enigmatic astronaut..."" I thought, did we watch the same movie? It's a great film....to put you to sleep. I watched the moon landing, and I'd rather view that multiple times than see this movie ever again. I loved ""The Right Stuff,"" ""Apollo 13"" and even ""The Martian"" but nothing could have prepared me for this snooze-fest made all the more boring by the depiction of the Armstrongs. Do yourself a favor and watch ""Contact"" or even ""Space Cowboys"" but don't waste your time on this film."
"ameliabrianneparker","10","2","2","7 August 2019"," DONT EXPECT IT TO BE WRAPPED IN GLORY
","I think the main problems that arise in other people's reviews is that they all expect this movie to be glorified and happy since the moon landing is presented as an exciting and exhilarating moment in history. Don't get me wrong, it is very much that, but this isn't about the moon landing per say, and instead it focuses on Neil Armstrong's journey to how he got there. His story is depressing to say the least. There were points in the movie that I teared up because it depicts what Armstrong lost to get to where he got, and this is extremely interesting in my eyes. I think with this film we got to see behind Armstrong's fatigue, and the happy man you see on historic evidence.<br/><br/>Overall, I absolutely loved this film. But if you don't like depressing and shocking films and would rather stick to the moon landings being about celebration and making history, then I don't recommend First Man to you. Despite saying that, I think at the end of the film you feel a lot of contentment and tranquility, and at times the scenes are extremely silent or shocking. So I don't know how people found it boring. Could watch 100 times. Very highly recommend to people who seem interested."
"myriamlenys","4","2","2","30 July 2019"," weirdly boring
","The story of mankind's travels to the Moon is a riveting story of heartbreak, suffering, ingenuity, courage and perseverance. As a result one might think that even a two-year-old baboon could make a halfway entertaining movie about the subject matter. Yet this is a boring and soulless movie - I can honestly state that I have seen more compelling documentaries. Even watching the actual contemporary footage, with or without comments, is more compelling.<br/><br/>The problem here is dramatic and narrative rather than visual and technical, since the cinematography is superb. So are the various special effects.<br/><br/>While we're at it, the ending too is remarkably bland and cold and ineffectual.<br/><br/>""First Man"" doesn't satisfy as a biopic, either. I hope, from the bottom of my heart, that Mr. Armstrong didn't go through life looking and feeling that sedated, bland and wooden. At times it felt like seeing the ""Dilbert"" cartoon character step into an experimental jet or an Apollo capsule. May God keep you on your perilous journey, Dilbert - and remember, you are carrying the hopes and aspirations of the whole human race !<br/><br/>All in all, the movie obscured rather than illuminated Mr. Armstrong's personality - I now know LESS about him than I did before watching the movie.<br/><br/>So no, not recommended, although there are some fine images and effects to savour."

"Floki_Thorfinn","1","11","20","12 November 2018"," Go home Chazelle, you belong to music films
","First Man is the most boring and slow paced film you'll watch this year, or: how to see a two hour movie about Ryan Gosling in two facets: depressed or poker faced.<br/><br/>Since we all are familiarized. with Neil Armstrong's mission to the moon, the main task was to create a really hooking view, atmosphere or context so we won't be bored to death, instead, they only achieved an uninteresting drama with standar actings and a overacted Claire Foy.<br/><br/>I think the overkill ovation of First Man relies on the fact that this historic event was achieved by americans, leaving out the cinematic values of the movie.<br/><br/>I can respect the fact that Damien Chazelle tried a different topic, but he dissapointed me horribly, since I consider his previous works masterpieces (Whiplash and La La Land).<br/><br/>The scenes in space were so dizzy and unrealistic, I was amazed that films from the 60's like the sublime 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968) felt so real as if it really were filmed on space, in contrast with First Man which is a super production from Universal Studios Â¡filmed in freaking 2018! And this particular scenes only capture the inside of the space ships or really close to them, It's so baffling, it was filmed like a very low budget indie film about space.<br/><br/>I can't label this film as bad precisely, but really boring and slow, very uninteresting in all possible ways, an awful cinematic experience. Damien, unload that genius of you in music films please, because you suck at biographic dramas."
"HorrorFan6969","8","96","240","1 September 2018"," Spectacular movie !
","Damien Chazelle trades in the arts for the sciences with First Man, focusing in on Neil Armstrong's moon landing in this handsome, technically astonishing awards contender. It's a surprising choice for the Whiplash and La La Land director, moving from pacey musical drama into the realm of biopic, scripted by The Post writer Josh Singer rather than Chazelle himself.<br/><br/>For the most part, this change is handled extremely well, and Chazelle gets to retain one of his favourite themes - obsession. Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) was near fanatical in his devotion to his impossible mission, and Gosling nails the way this commitment often overwhelmed his emotions. Claire Foy is on equally good form as Janet Armstrong, generally more held together than the volatile Neil, but capable of fearsome fury.<br/><br/>If you've seen an Oscar-friendly biopic before, there's not much in First Man that will surprise you, but with strong character work backed by an ensemble of solid performances, that doesn't end up detracting from the experience. Knowing that Armstrong and his crew make it to the moon doesn't make their flights less thrilling or failures less frustrating. Singer's script does place the film in its Cold War context, but smartly avoids jingoism<br/><br/>The flights themselves are spectacular, from a thrumming, intense low-orbit mission in 1961 to the fateful Apollo 11 landing itself. Almost documentary-esque camera work and superlative sound design immerse you in the shuddering cockpits, death never more than one minor mistake away.<br/><br/>At a time when the governments of the world feel more insular and backward looking than ever, it's important to be reminded what humankind can achieve when we expand our horizons. First Man may not quite be on a par with Chazelle's previous two masterpieces, but it's still a remarkably well-executed look at an inspiring slice of history.<br/><br/>RATING: 4/5"

"ashwetherall1","8","13","25","25 November 2018"," Not Boring . Just an insightful character study that stuck mostly to the facts.
","Firstly when making a biopic about an individual the film maker has to ask themselves am I going to make the bio historically accurate to capture the fact and the individual/ characters or are you going to give your audience a flavor or the facts and main characters with out being historic. I say this because a recent film by the name of Bohemian Rhapsody came under fire for being historically inaccurate and now The First Man has been called boring by some on this site for being very accurate.<br/><br/>The First man isn't and action movie, nor is it a Team up against it film. No its an in depth study of a man who did an extraordinary thing. Neil Armstrong is possibly's histories biggest enigma. The first man to walk on the Moon but is the last man ever to seek publicity from that experience.
From what I've read over the years Neil Armstrong was an Ice man, a man who would never fold under pressure. He was also a family man who did his job without drawing attention to himself.
What the film tries to do is find out what made Armstrong tick. This is achieved with the near perfect casting of (less is more) Ryan Gosling, who hardly needs to say a word to emote what Armstrong is feeling .
Then there's Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife Janet. She is the audiences window into Neil's personal life. She also challenges his cold exterior and shows us his vulnerabilities . The scene where she pushes him into talking to his sons about the Moon mission is more powerful than a Saturn 5 rocket and yet she hardly needs to raise her voice.
The supporting cast is also excellent I especially liked Cory Stoll as Buzz Aldrin, The only man to say say out loud what everyone's thinking.<br/><br/>Also it must be said that this film is not boring, in-fact I found some scenes terrifying simply because they used the effects so well.. The effects put you in Armstrong's cockpit and not a Star Wars inspired tracking shot..
The First Man gives the watcher a realistic picture of what it probably like to be an astronaut. and for that is commendable. I don't think it was ever designed to be a blockbuster. It just got marketed that way."
"mharah","6","33","75","7 October 2018"," A TV Movie on Huge Budget
","Ryan Gosling seems able to do just about anything on screen successfully. For director Damian Chazelle, he got La La Land - an otherwise unmemorable film musical - across the finish line admirably, even though he did not receive due credit for it. In First Man, he tries valiantly, but in the end the production values and the enormity of the story weigh him down, a burden he pushed aside in La La. First Man is only incidentally about the moon mission. Principally, it is about Neil Armstrong the man himself. The film practically ties itself in knots - unnecessarily, in my opinion - to show Armstrong as single-handedly committed to making the Gemini/Apollo program a success. The script carefully portrays Armstrong as somewhat one-mindedly committed to his flying career, cleverly linking it to Broadway musicals in his youth - a monomania for some theatre wonks. (He even revered Gilbert & Sullivan, the Holy Grail for true musical nerds). Gosling seems to be finding his balance between the pilot-Armstrong and the family-Armstrong several times , only to be interrupted by NASA wizardry, which would have been better served by being more tightly delineated. Claire Foy ably assists in a role which should have been more a principal focus. Foy's portrayal of Neil's wife, Janet, could have been seen as the home front spouse who nurtured Armstrong's familial side which she surely did. But the only dynamic indications of this we see come across as angry more than determined. However, First Man is Gosling's charge, and he does everything possible to bring it home. Chazelle could have helped a lot had he seen the project as more Whiplash - a virtually perfect film - than La La Land."

","""You're a bunch of guys making models out of balsa wood! You don't have anything under control!"" Janet Armstrong (Claire Foy).<br/><br/>After Janet, wife of Neil (Ryan Gosling), in 1969 has been told by Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) at Mission Control that they have everything under control for the moon landing project, Apollo 11, the audience has to agree with her that the control is dicey and probably rests mostly with the astronauts. As Janet implies, no one is completely in control, perhaps only fate is.<br/><br/>First Man is the story of the flying '60's, from Neil 's X-15 ride in 1961 (""bouncing off the atmosphere,"" as Mission Control says), to the Apollo 11 initiative as the crew prepares to land in 1969 on the moon. Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) walk the walk.<br/><br/>Throughout, the film is as cool as President Kennedy seeing the obstacles merely a proving ground for the greatness of the US and mankind. It's a powerfully immersive film placing audience in the seat with the star sailors, especially Armstrong, as they go through the various stages of space flight from the important Gemini Project in 1961 to Apollo 11 in 1969. <br/><br/>The Apollo 13 film about the aborted 1970 Apollo lunar mission and The Right stuff about the first manned space flight by the US are romantically right on and visually glorious. A different kind of success for First Man is director Damien Chazelle's, who takes us into the cockpit in the air, and at Neil's home, for what are reality shows as they ought to be. <br/><br/>The glamour is in the sealed capsules and the ingenuity of the astronauts, whose engineering skills are amply used in harrowing glitches. The reality is the possibility of failure and death families must live with each day.<br/><br/>The point of view is mostly Armstrong's even when he's not at the controls. Jane is unlike many other whimpering, complaining 
wives in films where the men do the daring; like Armstrong, she's cool, and especially when she exhorts him to explain to his sons that he might not return from the moon. She's tough with the right stuff for a partner in what the film shows to be an icily daring and dangerous profession.<br/><br/>First Man is a story of history, adventure, sentiment, and humanity. It has it all, and while some may complain we don't see the colorful earth and moon enough, Chazelle has shown what the astronauts saw, not what film makers would have liked them to see.<br/><br/>""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."" <br/><br/>What Neil Armstrong supposedly said with his first step on the moon.

First Man is a disjointed mess with no clear objective other than to prove to the world that no one is perfect. Apparently you cannot be an American hero and loving spouce and parent at the same time.<br/><br/>People who will be interested enough to see this movie will likely fit into two categories. First they are fans of the ""space race"" and they space program in general. If you (like me) fit into this category, save your time and money. Do not see this film. It is grossly inaccurate in its depictions of real people. Such as the embarrassing, factless depiction of Buzz Aldrin. And on top of the people it misrepresents, it spends too little time on the actual ""space race"" stuff.<br/><br/>The second category of people who will want to see this film are likely fans of the director. Those people may also be disappointed as it does not deliver in its performances, writing, and drama. This is no Whiplash.<br/><br/>The only genuinely good thing I can give this film is the cinematography. Beautifuly shot, however the handheld aspect gets kinda old."

","The film neither captures none of the following 1) the man himself 2) his life as it happened 3) the nature of space flight 4) the actual drama of the events that he was a part of 5) the character of Jan Armstrong, although it was best at this latter thing.<br/><br/>1) The character played in this film by Ryan Gosling is, as far as I can tell, nothing whatsoever like the actual Armstrong, who above all was known for his intelligence and dry sense of humor. Gosling's performance is dull and humorless.<br/><br/>2) The events depicted are correct in gross details, but absolutely botched in terms of fine ones. By dressing up the proceedings with imaginary shaking and unheard sounds, all the director does is demonstrate how little he understands either the events themselves or the nature of space flight in general. The film opens with a scene in the X-15 that has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual event which inspired it. The depiction of the emergency experienced on Gemini 8 is plain stupid, and by being stupid, destroys the real drama of the event and obscures the actual emergency, which was very real. I will not even discuss the lunar mission. By this point in the film, I was finished with it.<br/><br/>3) The film gets absolutely nothing right regarding either the details of space flight as revealed in actual films and recorded transcripts, or indeed even as a half-assed representation of the reality of being in orbit. To tell the truth, the early Buck Rogers films are better than this turkey.<br/><br/>4) By being so stunningly incompetent regarding details, the film finds it impossible to get even close to even the broad outline of life as an astronaut in the mid 1960s during the height of the space race. The obsessive use of handheld cameras makes this completely idiotic anhistorical approach even worse.<br/><br/>5) Jan Armstrong was, like Neil, a witty, perceptive person with a naturally sunny disposition. In the film, she is played as a frowning, obsessively fretting scold. It is a terrible disservice to the real woman. Nevertheless, her performance has hints of the real person.<br/><br/>I could list any number of other defects. NASA was not just Neil Armstrong, and above all functioned as a team with shallow management layers. That is completely missing in this film, as if it had never existed. The many interesting characters and personalities with whom Armstrong interaced are either entirely missing, or cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>The technical realization in the film is also embarassingly affected an amateurish. That's enough said about that. It's just as well.<br/><br/>A bad film."

","You have to hand it to everyone involved in this film, particularly Chazelle and Gosling. They took one of the most momentous and important events in human history and turned it into a boring, lifeless snoozefest. That could hardly have been easy to do. Gosling, who has all the charisma of a dead cat, played Neil Armstrong to be practically a zombie. Yes we know Armstrong was a humble, low-key man of few words, but I do believe he was alive. We also know that his dead daughter was always in his thoughts, and that was the reason for much of the morose, lifeless way he carried himself. The dropping of her necklace was a fairly well-done scene (symbolism of letting go and all that), although somewhat contrived. The guy who played Armstrong in a couple of brief scenes in Apollo 13 was much better. It is also common knowledge that there were 2 other astronauts on Apollo 11, namely Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, but you wouldn't know it from this film.
Ah well, so depressed at how depressing this film was. Want to watch an entertaining and informative look at Apollo 11? Skip this and check out any one of the various historical specials that are constantly being run these days on the various cable channels."

","In July 1969, the world watched on their televisions as Neil Armstrong became the 1st man to set foot on the moon. The film, First Man, should have been a celebration of this man and the events that led to his momentous achievement but such was not the case. What I ended up seeing was a dull, passionless, drawn-out account of those events and a bland portrayal of a man who is an American hero.<br/><br/>Where do I begin to describe how bad this film is? The director's obsession with death throughout the film; the lingering camera holds at the end of scenes that are meant to draw out emotion but last three to four times too long (if edited correctly, the film would have been 15 minutes shorter); in every flight scene, the camera is jumping about, the plane/capsule/rocket is about to come apart at the seams, and the noise is deafening; the sheer lack of chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy; the lack of any passion throughout the film.<br/><br/>Claire Foy, whose portrayal as Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown is superb, is wasted in this epic blunder. Ryan Gosling needs to expand his emotional range beyond sullen, angry, dispassionate, and moody (try smiling for once - it means happy). His portrayal makes Armstrong look like a self-centered jerk instead of a hero.<br/><br/>If your looking for a film that will make you admire the first man on the moon, avoid this one."
"evanston_dad","4","4","6","25 February 2019"," Who Knew Space Was Such a Slog?
","Seriously, is the space program really this dreary?<br/><br/>Ok, so Damien Chazelle, the wunderkind director who wowed everyone with ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land,"" didn't want to make an astronaut movie in the traditional Hollywood mode of films such as, say, ""The Right Stuff."" Fair enough. Neil Armstrong was a bit of a reluctant hero, shy of fame and press and motivated more by internal reasons (according to this film, at least) than by the glamour of the space program. Indeed, this movie seems to be saying that the glamour highlighted in other movies is largely a fiction, and that the real story is one of hard and thankless work, drudgery, stress, anxiety, loneliness, you name it. I believe that that's true. But is any of that reason to inflict such a gloomy slog of a movie on us? Was Neil Armstrong really the blank-faced automaton as portrayed by Ryan Gosling? Do we have to drain every ounce of excitement and wonder out of the story just to make it more authentic? Because even if it's not as exciting or dramatic as ""The Right Stuff"" makes it look, still, space travel is pretty cool, and we should be allowed our sense of awe at seeing a man walk on the moon for the first time.<br/><br/>And Chazelle's directorial choices are irritatingly claustrophobic throughout this film. I get that he wants us to perceive events from the perspective of the astronauts, which accounts for the tight and shaky frames and limited viewpoints, but he sticks so rigidly to his aesthetic that he makes it literally difficult to see what's going on, which just becomes aggravating after a while.<br/><br/>The movie does have one thing going for it, which is Justin Hurwitz's wonderful score. It's the only thing about the film that comes close to being rousing, and it deserves a better movie.<br/><br/>No wonder this one bombed.<br/><br/>Grade: D"

","Chazelle beautifully takes viewers on an emotional and disorienting journey through the most formidable years of Armstrong's life and the risks these pioneers of space exploration took. If you're looking for an Apollo 13 or Right Stuff experience solely focused on the endevours of NASA and the American triumph in the Cold War space race, you may be disappointed by First Man. This is not a movie about Apollo 11. While Apollo 11 and the journey to the moon are the primary focus of Neil Armstrong's experience in First Man, this movie is instead exactly what Chazelle promises in the choice for the film's title; A biopic on the First Man. <br/><br/>In First Man, we get a glimpse inside the soul and character of Neil Armstrong. Gosling truly nailed it. His portrayal of Armstrong's calm coolness in the face of extreme danger, his quiet and inwardly shy demeanor, and his contemplative stares. Gosling really shines when we see Armstrong's stunted, yet deeply personal emotions, even to the point of appearing cold to the ones closest to him. <br/><br/>The real heart of the movie appears during Armstrong's flight missions on Gemini 8 and Apollo 11. Chazelle does a great job showing the audience how rickety the earliest flying machines were and how limited the astronaut's visual field was. The sounds and shrieks had me on the edge of my seat. The limited space in the space shuttles is claustrophobic and the appearance of the moon as the Apollo 11 space shuttle approaches its surface is as eerie as the actual nasa footage.<br/><br/>This movie was definitely a must see. I've never seen a movie that more accurately depicts the beauty and creepiness the astronauts of the early space shuttle have described."

"paul-allaer","7","7","13","15 October 2018"," Good movie, but questionable sequences and headache-inducing camera work
","""First Man"" (2018 release; 141 min.) brings the story of Neil Armstrong and NASA's quest to get a man on the moon before the Russians could. As the movie opens, Armstrong is testing a plane in the upper reaches of the atmosphere (140,000 ft. altitude), and after initially bouncing off of the atmosphere, managers to get back safely, at which point the movie tells it's ""1961, Mogave Desert, CA"". We get to know the Armstrong family, including the desperate health battle of their young daughter Karen. Armstrong makes it through the Gemini astronaut selections in 1962, prompting a move to Houston. ""It's a fresh start"", comments Janet. At this point we're less than 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from director Damien Chazelle, whose previous two films (""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"") hit the bull's eye. Here he brings the book of the same name to the big screen. The biggest challenge with a movie like this is how to keep things interesting, if not dramatic, when we already know the outcome (will Armstrong perish in the test flights? urr... NO!). That doesn't mean that some of the footage of these flights isn't terrific. I have a greater issue with the camera work. I totally get it that Chazelle wants to convey the claustrophobic feeling of being inside the small space capsule , and he does a terrific job at that (if you have visited the National Air $ Space Museum, it truly is shocking to see how small and primitive-looking these capsules were). But the movie incessantly features extreme close-ups and headache-inducing handheld cameras for much of the time, for no apparent dramatic reason (at one point Janet crosses the street to talk to her neighbor Pat--you'd think that an earthquake with a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale has just hit). Also questionable to me are some of the sequences involving Neil and Janet (just one example: when Janet visits Neil in quarantine upon returning to earth, neither of them has any smile or joy--or sign of relief. I doubt that was really the case. But maybe I am nitpicking.<br/><br/>In case you aren't aware, Neil Armstrong lived the last 30+ years of his life here in Cincinnati (where I am) until his passing in 2012. He was a notorious pack rat of memorabilia throughout his career (never mentioned or alluded to in the film) His sons Mark (who still lives in Cincinnati) and Rick have recently announced that thousands of items from Neil's personal collection will be auctioned off...<br/><br/>The movie opened wide this weekend, and the Sunday evening screening where I saw this at was attended nicely but not quite a sell-out. The movie performed not quite fully up to expectations at the box office ($16.5 million). I can't help but feel that many expected bigger things. The movie is good, maybe very good, but it is not the critical home run that was either of Chazelle's earlier movies. Still, it will likely garner a number of Oscar nominations. If you liked ""The Right Stuff"" or ""Apollo 13"", I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"mjjusa-1","8","18","42","14 October 2018"," American Exceptionalism
","First Man is a compelling, emotional, riveting tale of how America, NASA, and a bunch of what would now be derided as 'privileged white men' created the singular event in human history: a human being on the moon.<br/><br/>Neil Armstrong describing to the world, live on television and radio, that his was but one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.<br/><br/>I would guess that practically everybody in the world, even now, knows what he said.<br/><br/>Most have read of the controversy surrounding the conscious, politically motivated, decision to not show the American flag being planted on the moon by the Canadian (read citizen of the world) Director. But, as we saw this afternoon, there's now a lingering wide view of the LEM resting on the moon's surface with the newly planted American flag clearly in the picture...causing this viewer to wonder if it was newly planted 'post final cut' addition to stem the potential loss of audience the negative reaction that the omission caused?<br/><br/>Otherwise, the movie is a rather straight forward, linear telling of how NASA's moon landing came to be: the barely mentioned Mercury program, followed by several two-man, Gemini launches to test the theoretical possibilities of using multiple vehicles requiring in-space rendezvous to make the mission viable with available technology. And, then, the audacious Apollo program which had to invent and test the largest rocket ever constructed to get humans to the moon and safely back...the gigantic, strangely beautiful, instantly recognizable, Saturn.<br/><br/>Which had a test launch one night when I was home from college and lit up the Indian Harbour Beach sky like it was a man-made, sun. The rippling, guttural roar of the launch reaching us as the Saturn rose in a new day sky, shaking the windows of my parent's home, and pressing my shirt to my body, twenty miles from the Cape.<br/><br/>In its retelling, First Man recounts the drama and tragedy of those years. Incidents now mostly forgotten: A T-38 crash that killed two of the Gemini astronauts during training; the disastrous fire that killed an entire Apollo crew while the capsule was being tested on the launch pad; the first attempt at a space rendezvous causing the Gemini capsule, piloted by Neil Armstrong, to careen out of control, tumbling wildly and dangerously, as the crew fought to stabilize it before they blacked out and the capsule was destroyed. Then, near the end of the movie, the mounting tension and drama played out live on television, as the LEM sought its landing location and not finding it until Neil Armstrong overrode the computers, taking manual control, and landing the LEM with no fuel remaining.<br/><br/>Some of this, in First Man, is breathtaking. All of it is riveting.<br/><br/>The human story that holds the movie together thankfully doesn't use the normal Hollywood stereotype of a complaining wife and a noble husband attempting to do heroic things. I wish that such unreal, unnatural, uninteresting, and demeaning depictions of women would be forever consigned to the dust heap of Hollywood tripe and a more natural male/female/husband/wife life become common in movies about uncommon people who do great things.<br/><br/>Which happily and realistically occurs in First Man.<br/><br/>A family tragedy becomes the moving subplot of this powerful recounting of one of the world's most historic events. Yet, even as a subplot, it is not a contrivance, and its emotional impact on the Armstrong's had me verklempt and more accepting of Neil Armstrong's almost off-putting stoicism in the face of all things. And, makes Ryan Gosling's laconic, strong, and silent portrayal convincing. Indeed, at some point in the movie, he becomes Neil Armstrong, something, I would guess, all actors act to achieve.<br/><br/>First Man shows the astronauts and their families as human beings. Extraordinary, but recognizable human beings. Men, women and children, all with hopes and fears and frailties. All displaying courage, humanity, skill, and drive. Watching them, I thought of the children and families I grew up around on Army posts around the world. They were like the people in this movie. All of us are. We're Americans.<br/><br/>The movie, though directed by a Canadian, and starring a Canadian, despite the kerfuffle about the flag, is a love story about what the meritocracy that is America can do, what humankind is capable of.<br/><br/>John Kennedy promised that America would put a man on the moon within the decade.<br/><br/>We did it in less than seven years.<br/><br/>Fifty years on, it remains a universally shared example of human accomplishment.<br/><br/>I watched the second moon landing in a bar in Athens...the Greek crowd cheered, pounded us on our backs in joy, wept and bought us glass after glass of retsina.<br/><br/>We drank to America, to Greece, to Mickey Mouse, to John Wayne, to the world.<br/><br/>First Man will remind you of those times, and make you hope for more like them."

I didn't care for the score. It didn't grab me like James Horner's score for Apollo 13. I felt no excitement for the characters. I felt bored most of the movie. The acting was bland and I felt not emotion for Neil. I just thought it could be better. They should have shown the planting of the flag."
"hatlad","8","16","37","12 October 2018"," First man is a good look into the MAN Neil Armstrong
","Though I've been a fan of Neil Armstrong since I watched him walk on the moon as a kid. So, I was super excited this film was coming out.<br/><br/>Then, I heard that the director had dissed America in the movie not showing the American flag on the moon and defending that decision with some wishy-washy thing about Armstrong thinking they were ambassadors of all nations etc. <br/><br/>So, I thought about not going to see it. But, then I thought, ""Hey; it's a movie about NEIL ARMSTRONG. I can't miss that."" So, I went and was glad I did.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT:
Firstly, let's get the flag thing out of the way up front. They showed plenty American flags in the show - from the flag shoulder patches on their space suit to one of Armstrong's boys raising an American flag at school and finally a wide angle REAL footage shot of a (later than Apollo 11) Lunar Module on the surface of the moon with the American flag planted in the lunar soil. So, as an American, I was ok with that part of the movie.<br/><br/>But what really makes this movie is the look at all the things weighing on Armstrong the human being, husband, father and astronaut during his decision to become an astronaut and eventually to land on the moon. It explored the tragic death of their infant daughter Karen and how he kept that locked inside, his very low-key personality and engineer's mind analyzing and - most importantly, the strain of all this on his family life.<br/><br/>The only criticisms of this movie I noticed were minor ones; the film is no ""Apollo 13"" - seemingly a little less brightly lit and dynamic than that film, and I could've done without so much shaking the camera - especially during the launch sequences. That got wearisom on the eyes.<br/><br/>But, again; those are minor points. This is a pretty good movie, I'd say."
"CubsandCulture","10","10","21","18 October 2018"," Chazelle is 3 for 3...
","For my money Chazelle is the best young director working today and First Man is another smashing success. Mostly interested in the subjective feelings experienced by Armstrong during space travel on the one hand and the human cost to his family on the other this is a gripping portrayal of man who loses himself to impossible work to hide his grief. The story does de-empathizes the political aspects (most are mentioned in passing) of the history but it does so to focus on the personal. Through I love how the question of whether the social-political cost of the space program is worth its benefits is asked along side the question of with whether the human cost to Armstrong's family is worth it. It makes everything personal about this telling of the story<br/><br/>The film is at its best when it is entirely visual. The various space flight sequences are shocking and fresh given the close up and subjective camera work Chazelle favors. And when the film does go wide for various shots of space travel they are striking and refreshing different from other films covering similar material. The film is interested in the juxtaposition of the the infinity of outer space against the infinity complexities of single human being. Chazelle keeps this juxtaposition throughout but its subtle and not over done.<br/><br/>While the film isn't as personal as Whiplash or La La Land, Chazelle does manage to let his personality through. Several of the space travel scenes are scored with jazzy music and it feels like a modern update of 2001 in that regard while connecting to Whiplash and La La Land. <br/><br/>The script is smart, the acting powerful and the direction sublime. All in all this is a fine film and should be in the running come award season."

","The historic integrity and realism of experiencing the Gemini and Apollo missions from the astronauts' perspectives and a bit of their families really made this enjoyable.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the casting choice of Ryan Gosling is a poor choice and really hurt the movie and the role of Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>Gosling has an extremely narrow range and can be not only quite unconvincing but even oblivious and vapid, which are not traits of Neil Armstrong as evidenced in a great deal of available footage. <br/><br/>Also disappointing was the rather obtuse usage of shaky handheld shooting which is frequently out of focus, dizzying and leaves us, the audience, believing that the cinema's projector is not working correctly. In fact, how would the projector personnel even be able to focus when it appears that the footage is so poorly shot. <br/><br/>To the director and producers: we the paying audience pay our high ticket prices and expect to see a multi-million dollar production shot with the highest quality cameras, lighting, equipment and editing. We do really ever want to see a box office movie that appears it was shot by our 7 year old with the first iPhone.<br/><br/>In addition, there already exists ample original, old footage which suffers from age and dated technology. We all lose out on the perfect opportunity to see historic moments and life the way it would have and could have been recorded had they possessed today's technology. Not everything in the movie is shot this way, but enough that it really ruins the flow and continuity of the story, becoming a distraction."

"vannekr","10","16","38","13 October 2018"," A superbly crafted drama that gives a fantastic insight to the lead up to the moon landing
","The film 'First Man', directed by Damien Chazelle, is a brilliantly shot and edited film depicting the life of Neil Armstrong up too the infamous moon landing. 
The film uses film grainy footage to give the film a nostalgic feel and is shot mostly in closeups of the characters, creating a claustrophobic feel. Chazelle does not resort to extreme long scenic shots of the space environment, instead choosing to use closeups and extreme-closeups to better understand Neil's perspective of the event. 
The actors all are outstanding in the film, particularly Claire Foy who brings a lot to the character. 
Overall the film was very entertaining, had great pacing and was very entertaining to watch as well as informative. I would highly recommend this film to any lovers of film, however it is very mucj different to the usual style of Chazelles films. 
10/10"
"TheMovieDiorama","10","16","38","13 October 2018"," First Man lifts off as the perfect biographical leap for mankind.
","We've seen plenty of space exploration films, particularly those that attempt to traverse the Moon. 'Apollo 13' and 'Hidden Figures' to name a couple, where both the pressured astronauts and intense mission control have been equally portrayed. This film should be cataclysmically generic, sparking little to no ignition for a story that has been shown in film for decades. Yet, not only does Chazelle craft a thrilling biopic, but one that is masterfully astute. One that radiates wonderment and awe. It's one small step for biopics, but one giant leap for Chazelle. Cementing him as one of the best directors working today. First Man chronicles the career of Neil Armstrong and the race against the Soviets to conduct the first lunar landing. These mathematically complex calculations and trajectories are accompanied by Armstrong's personal life which is filled with loss, sorrow and fragility. Two juxtaposing environments exhuming differing emotions that inherently affect Armstrong as a person. The colossal pressure to succeed in opportunities that no one else has been presented with contrasts a different type of pressure. Family. Chazelle ensures that his personal life is just as important as his historical achievement. Balancing various thrilling rocket tests, from Gemini to Apollo 11, with the dramatic tension spawning between him and his remaining family. Both equally as intense, yet both consistently intertwining. It's an ecosystem of melancholy and grandeur. For every death, there is a funeral. For every groundbreaking milestone, there is a celebration. Each event that takes place manifests in Armstrong's mind, making his perilous journey personal and dangerous. The tragic loss of his daughter could've affected his working ability, however his focused demeanour reassured NASA that he was the correct choice to lead the space race. Chazelle presents this delicately, but never resorts to melodrama. Several scenes of Armstrong reminiscing or imagining his daughter's life ensures that she is a source that powers him through tough challenges.<br/><br/>There is not a single scene that feels drawn out or unnecessary. Every action and line of dialogue acts as a star, slowly forming a glistening path to the Moon. Chazelle, much like Armstrong, was focused. Exploring several perspectives on how the space race was viewed during the 60s. From civilians believing it to be waste of tax payer's money to astronauts wanting to overtake the rivalling Soviet nation. He compacts a wide range of views in the film's 140 minute runtime, and yet it never once felt bloated. The wealthy runtime allows Chazelle to be patient with specific historical segments, and it works seamlessly. The heart-stopping opening sequence reassures us that this is an authentic biopic. Intense, powerful and exhilarating. He somehow manages to make the predictable Apollo 11 mission, which we all know was a success, a hyperventilating experience. As the fuel levels dramatically decrease, my heart rate increases. For a director to make a predictable story unpredictable is an achievement. His succinctly subtle long takes and technical prowess only heightens the high quality that is being produced. The Apollo 11 lift off sequence, accompanied by Hurwitz' euphoric score, was outstanding. The astonishing sound editing as the rocket pressurises, the gorgeous cinematography visualising the Moon's tranquility and the claustrophobic camera movements intently focussing on Gosling's eyes. It was a symphony of technical splendour. For the first time since 'Gravity', I experienced the feeling of awe. So much so, that I became emotional towards the film's conclusion. It reminded me why I love films so much, why we go to the cinema and why powerful stories that represent humanity need to be told time and time again.<br/><br/>Gosling was the perfect choice to play Armstrong. He is able to portray the pressure, intent and emotional damage from just his eyes alone. It's a nuanced performance that stays with you hours after the credits roll. Foy embodies his wife perfectly by harnessing the fear of losing her husband. You can see the build up as the years pass by, to which she soon unleashes all of her thoughts upon Armstrong in a scene that should garner her some acclaim. However, there is one pivotal scene that sublimely illustrated Armstrong's position. As he says farewell to his children before departing, his youngest gives him a hug. The eldest however shakes his hand. And it's at that moment I knew this film was something special. The struggles of maintaining fatherhood with work was eloquently illustrated in that one scene. No dialogue. Just two actions. I could also discuss the bracelet scene on the Moon, but I would rather not become an emotional mess again. First Man truly surprised me. I was expecting Chazelle's weakest film, considering his perfect career thus far, but I received one of his strongest yet. It reassured me that film is not a dying art, but a universal medium that can transcend time itself. Suffice to say, First Man gets the perfect rating, and is quite simply the best film of the year so far. An absolutely incredible journey that should not be missed."

"themadmovieman","8","11","26","12 October 2018"," Combines grounded and moving drama with a jaw-dropping portrayal of space in truly spectacular fashion
","Not only is First Man an excellent biography that tells a riveting and often moving story, but, rather unusually for the genre, it's an incredible technical achievement, with stunning visual effects, brilliant directing, incredible cinematography, beautiful music and more adding to the emotion back on Earth, as we see an excellent lead performance from Ryan Gosling bring the story of Neil Armstrong to life in vivid fashion.<br/><br/>For starters, one of the best things about this film is how well-balanced it is between the personal life of Armstrong, and his work on the space programme during the 1960s. In that, it has all the emotion and depth of the best biographical dramas, but with the added element of the thrills of the Space Race, in a story that's certain to satisfy both those looking for a great drama as well as a brilliant portrayal of the Apollo mission.<br/><br/>Let's start on the personal side of things, which is arguably the harder side of the story to tell, given the legendary status of Armstrong's role in the space programme. Most will likely be going into this film waiting for the moment we see him step on the Moon, but what First Man does so brilliantly is give due focus and attention to the personal background of the whole story, which is what makes that final payoff all the more powerful.<br/><br/>Although I can't say the movie starts in spectacular fashion, with an opening fifteen minutes or so that fails to live up to the dramatic power it's trying to push, that side of the story grows and grows in emotional intensity as the movie goes on, and given the rather long runtime of nearly two and a half hours, it reaches a stunning emotional peak as the story comes to a climax.<br/><br/>And while you may want to see more of the space stuff, the screenplay creates such emotion around Armstrong's personal life and motivations as he finds himself closer and closer to that legendary mission. Whether it be his relationship with his wife, played excellently by Claire Foy, or the constant setbacks he suffers due to losses of family members and friends, there's so much emotional depth on display here, making for a thoroughly engrossing watch throughout.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling does a brilliant job in the lead role too, and with his understated but effortlessly likable and relatable performance, portraying Armstrong as a deeply dedicated and caring man, even though he may appear cold and introverted on the outside at times, it's so easy to believe in his story right the way through, and to be completely pulled into all of the ups and downs that he went through over the course of a tumultuous decade.<br/><br/>Now, on the flipside, there's the story about the space programme. Without the personal side of things, this wouldn't have the same emotional punch as it does, and that's the film's greatest achievement. However, it also makes a fascinating watch out of telling the story of the Space Race, and in particular puts into perspective the reality of the programme beyond the legend of the Moon landing in 1969.<br/><br/>In that, the film's main discourse focuses on assessing the cost of the space programme, with particular attention being drawn to the human cost of dangerous tests and mistakes that is somewhat glossed over when looking back with rose-tinted glasses. It's not a downbeat or overly critical look at the space programme, and rightly so, as it clearly identifies many of the immense benefits brought about by the historic work done by the brave and bright men and women of the era, but it does feature a fascinating degree of introspection that makes it thoroughly worth the watch.<br/><br/>But then, there's the pure romance and wonder of space exploration, and that too is something that First Man brings to light in stunning fashion. Much like director Damien Chazelle did with his passionate love letter to the old movie musical in La La Land, there are moments in this film where he completely strips away all of the anxieties and problems associated with the space programme, and lets you sit back in wonderment and awe as you witness man going further than ever before.<br/><br/>The sequences set in space are by far the film's most moving and awe-inspiring moments, and as I was watching some of these visually breathtaking moments above the Earth's atmosphere, I was taken back to that childlike wonder that was always associated with space travel, reminding me of that old feeling when being an astronaut was the coolest, most exciting job you could ever think of, something that absolutely blew me away at times here.<br/><br/>Of course, none of that could have been achieved without the exceptional technical work on this film. More so than any other, I feel that First Man is a crowning achievement for how far visual effects have come, with CGI and immense ambition that used to be reserved for only the biggest blockbusters being combined with a down-to-earth and deep story, and making for some of the most powerful and awe-inspiring sequences you've seen in a very long time.<br/><br/>Chazelle's direction is exceptional throughout, the cinematography brings both the claustrophobia of sitting in a rickety old rocket as well as the immense scale of space to life in stunning detail, the score is a beautiful and inspiring work, and those visual effects are jaw-dropping to witness, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved on screen further and further in electrifying fashion.<br/><br/>Overall, I was hugely impressed with First Man. A riveting and moving personal story that's combined with a fascinating and grounded portrayal of the space race, as well as some of the most spectacular space vistas you've ever witnessed, it's a thoroughly engrossing and often even mind-blowing watch."

It was phenomenal. Ryan Gosling managed to make a boring and the lowest of key hero seem so complex and compelling. I'm very glad I don't have to choose between him and Bradley Cooper, easily the two best male performances I've seen in a long time. Claire Foy..... this was the first work of hers I've seen and I understand why she's so beloved, an absolute talent. It was definitely a slow burn but that final act was probably the most beautifully intense finale I've ever seen. The entire film was just such a technical achievement. I have a weird feeling it's not going to get the full credit it deserves, but this is undeniably another masterpiece at the hand of Chazelle. P.S. that score tho ....."
"rannynm","7","11","26","11 October 2018"," The Man Behind One Of The Most Famous Events In Human History
","Easily one of the most famous events in human history is centered around a singular man, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling). Behind the Apollo Mission that landed the first human on the moon, Neil is a man with conflicts, a man with a history and a man with a mission.<br/><br/>Despite being mainly focused on an intense-action packed mission, First Man explores many avenues that include dramatic and intense moments which spawn from the heart-wrenching grief of losing a child to the intricate and beautiful romance with his wife, Janet (Claire Foy). Much of the movie has emotions that are quite far from being out of this world, specifically in its massive focus on the family.<br/><br/>The film begins up close and personal seeing Armstrong in his daring mission on the rocket-propelled plane, the X-15. Immediately, the story shows just how dangerous space exploration can be and how close those who brave exploring the final frontier get to never returning home. It follows Neil and his story intimately from the X-15 mission to the loss of three astronauts (close friends of Neil's) in Apollo 1, the near-lethal mission of Gemini 8 and, of course, the incredibly daring mission of Apollo 11, that landed the first people on the Moon. Throughout these milestones in space exploration, the story pauses to look at the relations and life of Neil, truly unveiling the blueprints showing who he was as a man.<br/><br/>While incredible in revealing a massive side of this well-known historical event, the film attempts to focus so much on a story that has little to tell. The length clocks in at just under two and a half hours, which feels very stretched after the adrenaline of the exciting opening scene wears off. Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a deep man with little visual emotions mixed with dramatic internal conflicts. While this decision allows for excellent character design, it makes him rather boring at times. It seems the writers wished to divide First Man into three stories - one, the story of Neil as a man; two, the story of Neil as a father and three, the story of Neil as an astronaut. All three have their pros and their cons, but mixed together, the film becomes daunting and stretched.<br/><br/>The cinematography sadly could have been better. Only a handful of camera shots do not shake. In most shots, the camera moves constantly or jitters. In the beginning, with the X-15 mission, this effect adds to the entertainment of the film. The audience quickly becomes sucked into the important and lethal mission with dangers at every corner. After two hours of shaky camera shots, that excitement changes to annoyance. While a mix would be ideal, and in more intensive scenes a camera shake would be appropriate, having the entire runtime featuring shakiness as well as many blurry shots, looks amateur and comes off as poor execution of what should be an interesting and captivating story.<br/><br/>However, the film does go beyond the moon in many ways - predominantly, in the acting. Neil Armstrong has deep faults and that stands as a challenge to any actor. Ryan Gosling nails the role in what turns out as an OscarÂ©-worthy performance of the famous astronaut. Others, including Claire Foy, also deliver extraordinary performances bringing each character to life. Despite the fact that no one can hear you scream in space, the sound design really belongs out of the world due to the quality and complexity of the sound effects. Much of First Man contains loud, intricate sound effects that vary and cover a massive spectrum. Perhaps more powerful would have been the use of silence in the most dramatic moments, sending chills to the entire audience.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is one of these moments of eerie silence. In this scene, three members of the Apollo 1 mission do a test in the Apollo capsule. It goes horribly wrong and the interior of the capsule catches on fire, sadly, resulting in losing the lives of all three. Yet, the film takes this a step further, as the three fallen heroes are not new in this scene. The viewer gets time to like them, understand them and befriend them - just as Neil did in real life. This makes their sudden and dramatic loss nothing short of shocking and cold, replicating the real-life impact it had on Armstrong.<br/><br/>Although, First Man has a strong beginning, a strong ending and many high points throughout, it also has many mistakes and things that could be improved that simply negate the extraordinary story of this story. For that reason, I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. The story is quite intensive and is best suited for older audiences that will understand the impact of the events so I recommend it for ages 12 to 18. This film opens nationwide in theaters on October 12, 2018 so, look for it. If you are a fan of space exploration, it is sure to make an impact, but even if you aren't you will learn something new.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

","Of all the things you could have done with a movie about the first man to go to the moon, this must be one of the worst directions to take.
It totally deflated the achievement by focusing on and portraying his wife as a negative flat and in this movie ugly (on the inside) shrew, and Niel being as emotionally flat and dull as her. I get that American cinema is all about reflecting and focusing on the dark at the moment, but my god it's a tedious and humorless film watch. I've had more fun at the dentist. I've had a less arduous time watching paint dry, and at this movies length I could have done a little of that while the movie played.
Apparently Armstrong and his family aren't as unlikable as this movie portrays, and he had a much more interesting arch to his life than we got to see in this visually clever but emotionally bitter film.
Thanks for dismantling and burning a story of triumph, and making another entry into the unwatchable disintegration of modern movie making."

It was impossible to have any empathy with any of the main characters as none of them had any them had a spark in them. These men were American heroes, agreed they were human too, but they were depicted as shallow ordinary men. Not to be recommended."
"brianjohnson-20043","6","6","12","16 October 2018"," Better story than expected. But too slow and shaky
","I was pleasantly surprised that this isnt an Appolo 11 version of Appolo 13 as I expected. <br/><br/>Instead it is a Neil Armstrong biopic encompassing his time from the early 60s till his moon mission in 69. The strength of the movie to my surprise was how interesting Armstrong's life was leading up to the mission. And what makes the movie work (to the extent in which it works) is seeing how lucky and unlucky Neil was to have survived all the roadblocks he faced to get to command the his successful historic mission. It was fascinating to see all the roadblocks he and his family faced. Neil and his family had a very effective real quality to them. The acting, sets and effects all seemed very accurate to me, although I'm hardly an astrophysicist and NASA historian.<br/><br/>What didn't work was the pacing. Over much of the film it is glacially slow. The film is about 2 1/4 hours long and IMO it would have been better closer to 1 3/4 hours long. For the dvd instead of an extended cut they should have an abridged up tempo cut. <br/><br/>The other issue is all of the camera shaking. Yes it really is that big of a problem. The director was clearly trying to illuminate the feeling of the astronauts from their perspective and how unstable much of this early NASA technology was. And I don't mind some shaking cameras from time to time for those goals. But this film far eclipsed the point where it was effective and instead it became a distraction. Many of the scenes where they weren't even in motion had the camera shaking. It doesn't have to look like a home video for me to treat characters seriously. The shaking was too much. You know the idea failed when it doesn't feel like I was experiencing things shake. Instead I was observing camera shots where the camera as/or background must have been shook. And wouldn't stop snacking no matter how I was looking at the scene or for how long. I want to be following the story, not thinking about the crew shaking the camera."

"TopDawgCritic","7","7","15","23 November 2018"," Very underwhelming and poorly produced, considering the historical significance, talent and anticipation.
","141 minutes and the producers give us this garbage?<br/><br/>Only the last 30-35 minutes of this film stopped my nausea and kept me awake. Allow me to elaborate...<br/><br/>Either Clint Eastwood or Steven Spielberg SHOULD HAVE directed this film and NOT Damien Chazelle. His atrociously annoying shaky-cam and zoom in/outs were way overdone and unbearable. Has he never heard of a camera stabilizer? Did he film this holding his iPhone? I may have been able to handle it watching 30 mins of The Office, but 141 mins of amateur camera work was garbage and gave me nausea. Only the lift off, flight, landing and moon scenes where steady and enjoyable for the full 30-35 mins, and a few shots where I guess his hands got tired and he used a tripod or stabilizer. This was a HUGE flaw for a film of this caliber and length.<br/><br/>Then there was the hack-job screenplay by Josh Singer (poorly adapted from the biographical book by James R. Hansen) who should have stuck to writing TV series. I mean seriously, 141 mins of irrelevant shots of a swing, long walks, pointless conversations, multiple long shots of the moon, and constant irrelevant directions towards his daughters' grieving? I get this film isn't supposed to be ""Hollywood"", and instead seen from the perspective of Neil Armstrong, but way too much drama was focused on his struggles over his daughter and wife, and less about his mission and progress towards it. This films pace was WAY too slow it was annoying. Too many dragged out scenes - was this film even cut for final? The pace may have been acceptable had the film been cut down to 90-110 mins tops.<br/><br/>Finally the overly rambunctious and overbearing score was so loud, I missed most of the dialogue during important scenes, especially when Gosling whisper-spoke like he was in a library. Score volume 10-MAX, Gosling volume 3. I get all the producers missed this, but not even Spielberg didn't catch that and all the other flaws??<br/><br/>As for the acting, I'm not sure if (especially) Neil and his wife's personalities were that drab, because if they weren't, then Ryan Gosling sure looked bored acting out his character. The rest of the cast were decent, but nothing spectacular. Corey Stoll as Buzz's character seemed to be the only fully awake actor.<br/><br/>The 1960's sets and wardrobe were impressive, but the winner in this production was the S/VFX - simply outstanding shots of space and the lunar planet.<br/><br/>This film was disappointing and missed the mark for me, by being very underwhelming and poorly produced, considering the historical significance, talented cast, and anticipation of learning more about Neil Armstrong and his mission.<br/><br/>Would I see it again? Certainly not - my time is much more valuable to waste 141 mins again on this mess. I'd rather spend many more hours and read the book by James R. Hansen. Would I recommend it? Nope. Read the book and see Apollo 13. It's a VERY generous 7/10 from me."

","First Man reminds us how goddamn scary space travel is and that sheer bravery and heroism that fuels the impossible being possible.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle continues to be a director I very much have excitement for. From the universally acclaimed Whiplash to the divisive La La Land (I love it), Chazelle has put together a completely different beast. Music isn't the through-line for once - though don't think that means that Justin Hurwitz once again knocks it out of the park - but instead it's the claustrophobic, captivating journey and motivation of Neil Armstrong towards the one thing the world knows him for.<br/><br/>Starting almost a decade prior to the event, whether you know the history or not, First Man highlights it's the work of many brave people and sharp minds to put man on the moon, and the cost therein. Film tends to paint a pretty picture of astronauts (unless things go wrong), but even when things are going right you're thrown into extreme closeups of men packed like sardines thrown about by the threat of burning rockets and technical hitches and sound design that keeps you rattled alongside them.<br/><br/>In fact, the sound design is so on point, there's a particular moment that took my breath away. For best effect, go out and watch this movie in IMAX. You'll see what I'm talking about. Once again with space on film, bigger is better. So don't wait until you can see it at home or on the phone or heaven forbid, a boring-ass airplane.<br/><br/>First Man is damn fine filmmaking, even if it does strip the glamour from it. Gosling powers through with a solid cast as Armstrong, and the film faults only really with some second and third act pacing (which is initially perfect) and how the breathtaking and powerful moments are few and far between. But maybe that's just because we know how it ends, and it costs a lot to get to that money shot."

At the end of the movie I did not feel attached or close to any of the characters. They were all flat and one dimensional. What I did find humorous, by a humorless movie, was the insertion of the LA LA Land theme music at the end of the movie. I will not spend anymore effort to review this film because it was simply not worth anymore of my valuable time."

","There is no doubt that the moon landing was a seminal moment in United States history. However, that landing took place in 1969. Since that time, it has been covered in more books and forms of media than can probably even be counted. So, in order for ""First Man"" to tell an original or engaging story, it would seem to have to find an angle, whether that be cultural or character-based. Sadly, neither of those things happen here.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""First Man"" is a biopic of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), especially focusing on the events leading up to and transpiring during his infamous moon landing mission in '69. Key factors in his backstory include the death of daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), relationship with wife Janet (Claire Foy), and just his overall attitude and demeanor as an individual.<br/><br/>The problem with ""First Man"" is very easy to diagnose: it has absolutely no soul, instead choosing a very mechanical beat-by-beat description of the Gemini and Apollo missions that led up to the moon landing. Two main missteps really hamper the proceedings here:<br/><br/>1. Only lip service is paid to the social conventions or frustrations of the day, and that is a shame. Had this movie focused on, say, the controversy over the space program itself or its place in a culture going through the civil rights movement, then maybe it would have had something emotional to examine. As it is, this is about as mechanical of a film (just plodding forward) as you'll ever see.<br/><br/>2. Even a bigger faux pas is portraying Armstrong and his wife as so dour and lacking in any real emotion. I'm not sure if this was just bad writing or an interpretation of the real-life figures themselves, but either way it is inexcusable. Emotional moments are telegraphed left and right only to fizzle out with Gosling's Armstrong looking dour and serious and Foy's Janet coming across as cold in comparison. It's been awhile since I've seen a film with so little emotion, especially odd considering they are trying to describe a cultural touchstone moment that everyone who saw remembers vividly!<br/><br/>I had been anticipating ""First Man"" for quite some time. Director Damien Chazelle's ""La La Land"" is a favorite of mine, as is Gosling, and the trailers/concept seemed incredible. I left the theater feeling incredibly disappointed, however, at such a wasted opportunity. One can't really call this film ""bad"" in the sense that it was technically deficient, but it just lacked any reason to care about any part of it."
"MysteriousStain","8","6","13","20 October 2018"," A different perspective
","I'm going to assume that if you go to see this film then you have at least a passing familiarity with the space race and the moon landing. A lot of reviewers here seem to have missed the title and that it focuses on Armstrong - just the man - and want a rehash of everything from every other space film.<br/><br/>I never noticed aggravating camera shake nor could count nose hairs. I did appreciate the in-depth look at an amazing man and how he conquered his own troubles as well as setting foot on the moon. Never did it seem overly long. As an introvert and father, this was a compelling two hours."
"joshbarton15","10","6","13","16 October 2018"," A technical marvel.
","Having been amazed by Damien Chazelle's previous two films, Whiplash and La La Land, there was an unavoidable sense of high expectation from me towards his latest film, First Man. One of mankind's greatest achievements gets the silver screen treatment and, with Chazelle at the helm, there was every chance it'd be out of this world.<br/><br/>In 1969, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) became the first man to walk on the Moon. It's an iconic moment in history and Chazelle's film takes a look at both the life of Armstrong and the work that went into the dangerous mission, a number of years before it even happened.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle certainly has a sense of grandeur that can be found in all of his films, Whiplash having it in the phenomenal sequences of music and La La Land having it in spades serving as an ode to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. When it comes to First Man, he achieves this with some quite stunning moments that places the central character, as well as the audience, amongst the stars. The space sequences are utterly breathtaking, Linus Sandgren's spacious cinematography and Tom Cross' editing capturing the wonder of such an achievement for mankind, the Moon landing sequence in IMAX up there as one of my favourites of the year.<br/><br/>It's not just the visuals that work wonders in First Man either, the use of sound prominent once again in a Chazelle film. The sound department often go under the radar in a film's success however, Chazelle utilises them so well again in First Man that it's too hard to ignore the great work they carry out. Then there is the score from Justin Hurwitz, tense when needed but also balletic when we travelling through space.<br/><br/>Josh Singer's screenplay does more than just tell the story of the Moon landing, it tells the story of a man driven by personal tragedy to succeed in his field and make this American dream become a reality. Singer's screenplay doesn't require a performance full of charisma and with Ryan Gosling as the lead, Chazelle's film is driven by a perfectly understated performance. Then there is Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife, Janet. Foy has made quite a name for herself as the Queen in The Crown and she doesn't do her growing reputation any harm here with a steely performance in First Man.<br/><br/>It's a film that ultimately blew me away in the IMAX format and I'm sure I'll be as transfixed on repeat viewings. Damien Chazelle has earned a place as one of my favourite directors of all time in just three films and with First Man, it just further proves he has the filmmaking world at his feet."

Astronauts do extraordinary things, but at the end of the day, they're human, just like anyone else.<br/><br/>What I didn't love was the execution, namely, the camera work. I saw this in a large format theater, and the hand-held camera work for the vast majority of this film was jarring. As a viewer, I shouldn't be aware of the camera.

","First Man, starring Ryan Gosling, and Claire Foy, with Damien Chazelle directing, he of La La Land, and Whiplash. This film was I think a progression of both styles.<br/><br/>First Man, is the story of Neil Armstrong, first man on the Moon, and his journey not only in space, but of the NASA programme for the previous 10 years. However, rather than go the grand adventure route, which it most certainly does include in the film, its more of an introverted look at the life of the Armstrong family and what they went through. Opening with an early test flight of his as a civilian pilot and the death of his young daughter, slowly from cancer. This film actively avoids lingering on anything of the wider issues, Racism, Government policy, the Soviets vs America, or Kennedy's promise. it certainly doesn't ignore the politics behind the story, but it is always from the angle of NASA looking out at it, and swiftly returns to the man in the middle.<br/><br/>Through the use of intimate handheld cameraing and very quiet, close moments at the beginning especially but used throughout, you are thrust straight into the life of this man, and feel transported along with him. The sound design is incredible and even when dealing with Space, they keep it very close and intimate, how these men actually felt in the tiny cramped modules and suits.<br/><br/>Gosling gives a great performance, but it would be nothing without the natural presence of Foy, who utterly convinces as the quietly pained and suffering wife/mother. The superb support cast, littered with talent, again play well, but always remain bit parts to intense concentration on the Armstrongs, Neil in particular, of course. As in Whiplash, its an intense two hander between these two people, there just happens to be the most famous story in history happening at the same time. They marry these two challenging scales very well. <br/><br/>The weight of history is almost inevitably where this film reaches issues. How to retell a story that everyone upon everyone knows, and worst, has their own version of what actually happened? You can never really lose the sense that you spend 2 hours just waiting to here that line! When it actually comes to this point, they handle it well, and predictably/cautiously give it over to a very human moment with Neil Armstrong remembering his lost daughter. But throughout the NASA parts of the film, they retain that sense of them taking a massive unknown risk, which for me was beautifully reflecting in Armstrong actually taking the first step, where he hesitated because no one actually knew if the surface was even solid!<br/><br/>This film achieves big and small at the same time and at points is almost breathless in its intensity. A throughly good cinema experience and a film, that quietly asks a question of you and your place in it all. But how could the greatest story, not ask such question. 8/10"

He makes no discernible response to the news. Instead of asking his superior about the matter he just stares at him and waits for him to talk. After a pause and a small smile he nods.

And I have to mention this... was this Hollywood's way of belittling something that, although it was a massive taxpayer expenditure, they truly minimized how the people of the United States felt at that moment. I was 12. I don't believe there has been a moment in this country's history when I remember us feeling so united in one single peaceful accomplishment. We ALL remember right where we were at that moment. Contrary to this 'movie's' depiction of it... we were proud and touched by the courage of the astronauts.

"julianbrownnote","9","3","5","31 January 2019"," First Man makes Damian Chazelle look be a veteran.
","Damien Chazelle was catapulted to the top of America's hottest young directors so quickly, it's difficult to comprehend his thrillingly original music drama cum psychological horror story debut, Whiplash, was only four years (and six Oscars) ago. But as much as I loved that pneumatic opening act to his career, I detested the second; the inexplicable awards and acclaim devourer, La La Land. I didn't think it was overrated or not worthy of the all the shiny baubles that went its way, I actually hated everything about it. Almost uniquely both a bad movie AND a bad sloppy, cheesy, clichÃ©d musical, with sit-com worthy acting, that saw him become the youngest recipient of a best director Oscar in history (and Emma Stone, perhaps the worst performance to win Best Actress this side of Gwyneth Paltrow in Shakespeare in Love).
So I arrived in the orbit of his Neil Armstrong-moon landing biopic at a loss as what to expect, something compounded by the name Steven Spielberg in the executive credits - the last person I'd want near an all-American hero movie, as prone to black and white moralizing and sentimental heart string pulling as he is. Yet once again and in another very different environment to either of his previous movies, Chazelle's dynamic confidence gives an accurate indication of what's to come from the opening minutes.
Here Hollywood's go to young leading man Ryan Gosling (arguably usurped now by Bradley Cooper) playing first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, enters the 1960's cocooned inside a rocket with wings, bouncing off of the edge of the earth's atmosphere, almost achieving space flight before intending to. It's a thrilling gut punch, full of the eerie silences, scraping metallic noises, whirring dials, serene beauty and absolute terror that inform much of the film's sky high action. Quickly we are back to the suburban white-bread American home with his wife (played with wide-eyed edge by a stunning Claire Foy) and their young children, the youngest of whom is at the end of her short life.
First Man makes great use of these opposing environs, juxtaposing the near impossible danger of Armstrong's day job, with resolutely normal home life - just with a little more relief greeting each, ""Hi honey, I'm Home'. After Gosling's Armstrong manages to score a spot on the nascent Gemini astronaut program (designed to prepare for the actual Apollo moon landings themselves), the wider cast of like-minded picket-fence adventurers assemble in a Houston via NASA recreation of suburbia. In particular he befriends fellow pilots, Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and Ed White (the always excellent and increasingly prevalent Australian actor, Jason Clark).
What follows (taken from James R. Hansen's official Armstrong biography, First Man: The Life of Neil Armstrong) is a decade of growing family life, terrifying technological milestones, ambition, personal rivalry, tragedy and the social upheaval of the sixties, where Russia is always one crucial step ahead and where the enormous physical and monetary cost of the race to the moon, is equally unpopular with the public and politicians alike.
If there are many praises I could sing about First Man, I'd start with it's even handed, subtle dryness - my fears of a saccharine, noble, swelling, heroic guiding hand from Spielberg were completely unfounded, to the extent I wonder how much of his influence was flat out rejected. There's a matter of factness to proceedings and a focus on detail and events that's entirely welcome, these men are extraordinary in their work but resolutely ordinary men. Chazelle doesn't amplify faults or heroism to histrionic levels, neither does he engage in the kind of reductive moral absolutism and offensive simplification (bordering on propaganda) that blighted a film like American Sniper.
His cast are similarly allowed to breathe and exist without the awards-worthy grandstanding so common in ""great"" true life stories, Gosling's low key internal performance (something a grand-stander like Cooper could learn from) won't win him awards but is pitch-perfect for a modest, quiet man like Armstrong. His role is amplified by the late arrival of Corey Stoll as the far more vivacious, outgoing and polarizing Buzz Aldrin - who would accompany him to the grey shore. The standout is undoubtedly British actress Claire Foy, as Armstrong's wife Janet - she is magnetic without doing anything, her startled eyes conveying incredible building pressure, she owns every scene she is in and is almost the antithesis of the kind of American housewife we are used to in this terrain (ironically it's Chazelle's own real life wife Olivia Hamilton, who gives us that standard Tom Hanks wife role).
Chazelle's direction is mature, appropriate, sure-footed and intelligent throughout - rarely making himself centre-stage. Gone is the all-singing floral overkill of La La Land or the dynamic intensity of Whiplash, showing we are just coming to terms with his already formidable range (I could not tell you what I expect him to offer next). He handles the scary intensity of action, the mundanity of home life and the transitions between both with equal consistency. This already excellent and fascinating drama (seriously, how any sane human had the courage to get one of these explosive, metallic death traps is beyond me) is elevated further by some stellar production values.
The sound is across the board magnificent - regular stalwart Justin Hurwitz's score is one of the best in years, a sometimes exciting, sometimes haunting amalgam of period appropriate vintage electronica that heightens or enhances anything it touches. The broader spectrum of sound effects is equally compelling, particularly the clanking, creaking terror of the giant, possibly malevolent, shiny space beasts. The cinematography by Linus Sandgren (his work on La La Land the only high point for me) is notably realistic - often the tranquil beauty of space collapsing into a vortex of impending, furious calamity.
The moon landing itself is of course the denouement, thankfully mirroring the rest of the film's dryness and with an eye for recreating the collective TV experience we all have of that one small step moment in history. I'd love to know who was responsible for the brief moment with Armstrong's daughter's bracelet - it's the only time I felt the ghost of Spielberg in the entire movie.
First Man is a near magnificent biopic but more than that, it effortlessly sidesteps all the pitfalls of the overly heroic, simplistic, swelling, borderline jingoistic film I'd feared and for that Chazelle deserves all the praise. Much was ludicrously made of the failure to include Armstrong planting the US flag on the moon - in these polarized times, one single solitary moment can have an entire section of society write something off as the enemy. This is doubly stupid in a film that never stops being about a heroic and entirely American adventure, filled with nonsense low-key American heroes. Especially as the flag does indeed wave, both on the ground and on the moon. I wonder how Armstrong would feel that so many American's now feel he was nothing but a crisis actor, in some converted warehouse and that his most impossible achievement never even happened.
The two true apexes of this story are not the flag planting anyway but that first step on truly foreign soil, by any living creature we know, and that creature's return to his wife's gaze - both handled beautifully and without embellishment.

","If you enjoy queezy unsteady camerawork, extremely extreme closeups and angsty joyless characters, you'll like this movie. The first thing that I noticed about this movie was the awful cinematography. Every single second of this movie is unsteady and shot with a constant swaying or shakiness even though there's very little action footage. The extreme close-ups are also distracting. It's as if the cinematographer wanted the camera to closely track every hand motion and eye blink. It makes me wonder if Neil Armstrong and his team were really that sad and joyless. Every single character seemed as though they were about to have a nervous break down from beginning to end. Oh, then there was this quick thing towards the end about a moon landing or something..."

By moments I mean elevated scenes, great build ups with a good soundtrack so you create an experience. What we got instead was rather boring and lackluster. It did not feel like a blockbuster film but a miniseries broken into 4 or so parts.<br/><br/>The acting and lead could have been better. Gosling is a box office draw but he did not have the chops to pull off this role. He is an average actor with no noteworthy roles under his belt, this film can be added to the list. Somebody in the category of Tom Hanks or Christian Bale could have been suitable. Despite some good performances from Claire Foy and the other cast this film does not hit the mark. Neil Armstrong was a hero and the moon landing was iconic for humanity. A film should have lived up to a high standard and paid good homage."
"maurice_yacowar","8","3","5","19 October 2018"," The humanity and heroism of astronaut Neil Armstrong
","On the level of plot the title refers to subject Neil Armstrong, the first human to set foot on the moon. The level of theme points elsewhere: The man precedes and predominates over the astronaut.
From beginning to end the film puts us into Armstrong's life, his experience. First as a father, his heart broken by the cancer death of his little daughter, then living a dedicated, stoic model for his young sons. The older son's handshake shows the promise of his manhood., Then as a husband - sorely testing and relying upon his oak-strong wife. Finally, as the professional, disciplined, dedicated, steady even as his friends die on their parts of their mission.
Ryan Gosling gives Armstrong a profoundly sunken emotional life, feeling deeply but all expression virtually buried. But for one outbreak, he keeps his head about him privately as well as professionally. His job interview for the Apollo mission is the most revealing since Judge Kavanaugh's.
The film reminds us how human our heroes are. Their losses, suffering and demands upon them and theirs make their successes so much more impressive than those of the superheroes. That makes this film so much more engaging and emotionally illuminating than the abstractions of Kubrick's 2001.
Finally, this film very much addresses the American moment. That was the Kennedy future. There's a sad nostalgia in harkening back to an American government that respected science, that propounded lofty ideals and that embraced America's responsibility of giving the world political, scientific and moral leadership.
For me three moments stand out. One is the repeated scenes of the capsule spinning wildly out of control, Armstrong manfully trying to recover its stability. That's the true American, of the great America, trying to bring stability to chaos, in the lab as on the globe and beyond. The good old days.
Then there's Armstrong's rationale for the space exploration program: ""I don't know what space exploration will uncover, but I don't think it'll be exploration just for the sake of exploration. I think it'll be more the fact that it, allows us to see things. That maybe we should have seen a long time ago. But, just haven't been able to until now."" His craving for the fullest possible perspective upon mankind and the universe is so at odds with today's willful ignorance and tribalism.
And the last shot. Armstrong and his wife have been through so much that separated them - even beyond the shattering loss of their child - that their reunion still carries a chill. They have so much gap to cross. In the quarantine room they can only play at a touch, through a glass darkly, a gathered pain between them. It's the perfect end to a story of heroism so dearly bought. And an America so sadly lost."

","So Damien Chazelle had Ryan Gosling dance amongst the stars in La La Land. What higher place is there to reach next but the Moon. <br/><br/>Gosling is first man Neil Armstrong, a pilot picked for the Apollo 11 mission that had it's fair share of hiccups as well as triumphs. <br/><br/>The movie itself is made up of mostly those tests- watching the pilots as they rattle and spin in high speed simulations and practice pod launches, sometimes at the mercy of technical equipment that does not hold up. <br/><br/>To it's credit there is a dizzying effect here. I haven't felt this nauseous in a movie since Peter Berg's Mile 22, though here the effect makes way more sense. <br/><br/>When the pilots wind up puking you understand where they're coming from and you have a new respect for their calm as well as ability to even remain conscious.<br/><br/>By far Chazelle's best feat is the moon landing itself, something as nerve racking as everything else in the film but also done with meticulous detail and moments so triumphant it almost feels like you're watching them in slo-mo. I could not look away.<br/><br/>There are references to the space race and to American Patriotism, it doesn't change the fact that they kind dropped the ball the iconic image of planting the flag on the moon. To me it kinda felt like following your favorite sports team only to see them not hoist a trophy. <br/><br/>It's also hard to gauge the public's interest in all this. Chazelle briefly looks at that but mostly seems to make us think there were far greater interests in Vietnam and Civil Rights. <br/><br/>Later, the public seems to can't get enough of it though. It's a movie that feels very verbatim about the mission, sometimes to the film's detriment.<br/><br/>Gosling is very good here though. It's not a very showy performance, Armstrong was in actuality a very stable ordinary man, emotionally distant, but humble and loving in his own way. <br/><br/>One thing the film does really well is show the amount of deaths he actually endured and the quiet, secret suffering he went through during those periods. <br/><br/>Claire Foy is great here too as his wife, the only person who seems even moderately interested in asking the tough questions, like what if the mission completely goes to crap. <br/><br/>And we don't get much of the relationship between Armstrong and Corey Stoll's Buzz Aldrin but what we do seems as stand-offish as what we've heard. <br/><br/>Overall First Man is a chronicle. That means it can feel long, it can feel too concerned with the facts, but technically as well as performance wise, this hits on the trials and successes of space exploration really well.<br/><br/>If you like this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more"

","Review:
Man, this movie was boring! I know that it's based on a historical moment which will never be forgotten, especially in America, but from an entertainment point of view, it sent me straight to sleep. None of the characters had a personality worth watching, and Gosling just seemed to be his usual moody self. Most of the missions into space are documented, and we all are well aware of the famous Apollo 11 flight, so we don't get to see anything that we don't really know. The scenes concerning his daughter were a total surprise, and extremely emotional, and you can see that it made a big impact on the Armstrong's, but the movie is mostly based on the first manned mission to the moon, which I found quite dull to watch. It's not in the same league as Apollo 13, which was 100 times better because the characters were actually interesting, but the director did capture the period well, and the scenes in space did look realistic. After watching the bonus material, a lot of the people surrounding Armstrong said that he was a funny character, who was fun to be around, but this film didn't show that side of him at all. Anyway, In 1961, NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is flying the X-15 rocket plane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he managed to land the plane in the Mojave Desert, his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction and he is grounded. His two-and-a-half year daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumour. Desperate to save her, Neil keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Neil applies for Project Gemini and is accepted to NASA Astronaut Group 2. Neil then moves to Houston with his son and wife, Janet (Claire Foy), alongside other astronaut families. After the Soviet Union reaches every milestone in the Space Race, ahead of the United States, the pressure is on for the new Americans astronauts to impress with the new Gemini program. After the Soviets complete the first extravehicular activity, Neil is informed that he will be the commander of the Gemini 8, with David Scott (Christopher Abbott) as the pilot. Prior to the mission, two of his friends are killed in a T-38 crash, deepening Neil's grief at the string of recent losses. After another mission fails, Neil initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. During a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a fire kills the Apollo 1 crew, and Neil hears the news while representing NASA at the White House. Neil is selected to command Apollo 11, and he is informed that it will likely be the first lunar landing. When Apollo 11 successfully launches, it finally arrives at the Moon on the fourth day. Neil is forced to take manual control of the spacecraft, after realising the landing area is full of large boulders. When the lunar module successfully lands, with minimal fuel remaining, Neil sets foot on the Moon and he drops Karen's bracelet into Little West Crater. After returning home, the crew are placed in quarantine, where a rerun of JFK's 1962 speech ""We Choose To Go To The Moon"" is shown. Boring! Boring! Boring! On the plus side, the director chose not to pack the film with technical jargon, which would have made the film worse, but it did feel like it jumped from one mission to another without much explanation. Although the achievement was truly amazing, I personally think that Neil Armstrong's true-life story needs to be remade by a director who will help the audience to connect to characters because this director failed to make this picture interesting. Boring!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Damien Chazelle, who brought you Whiplash and La La Land. After the success of his previous movies, I did think that he was the perfect choice for this film, but he made a right shambles of it. Ryan Gosling tried his utmost to be authentic throughout the film, but he seemed distant and pretty dull. I don't blame him for his performance because Neil Armstrong might have actually been like that, but from an entertainment point of view, I couldn't wait for the movie to finish. It was written by Josh Singer, who brought you The Post starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, Spotlight and the Fifth Estate, so the movie was in good hands, but they just failed to execute. As the movie was also based on a book, called First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, I would have to read it to see how close this film is to the story. Anyway, it's been nominated for 4 Oscars, which are Visual Effects, Sound Editing, Production Design and Sound Mixing, which proves that this historical concept didn't go down too well with the big players in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Budget: $59million
Worldwide Gross: $104million<br/><br/>Genre: Biography, Drama, History
Cast: Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Patrick Fugit, Christopher Abbott, Ciaran Hinds, Olivia Hamilton, Pablo Schreiber and Lukas Haas. 2/10"
"wilsr","1","4","8","1 February 2019"," I managed to stay to the end. Do I get a medal?
","""Testament"", ""Visceral"", ""Powerful"", ""Breathtaking"". Just some of the words used by the professional critics' reviews.
I obviously saw a different movie. No, I checked the date and cast: it was the same one.
I have debated with myself as to whether this was the worst film I have ever seen, and came to the conclusion that possibly ""Four Lions"" just edged into that slot - but it is a very close thing.
Let's get the technical aspects out of the way first. The sound is dreadful, and not helped by the appalling diction of many of the cast. Nor by the overwhelming soundtrack, which dominates and destroys the visuals. The constant use of tight closeups combined with the lighting and what appears to be aout of focus effects make following the action not an easy task.
Gosling plays Gosling: he shows several expressions none of which have much relevance to the narrative and left this viewer emotionally detached from the story. Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife made a competent fist of her part but no-one stood out in any way.
Now to the main problem, and it comes down to appalling direction. It is not a well constructed movie in several ways.
Firstly, it is far too long. There are multiple examples of scenes so drawn out they become self parodies, and show self indulgence. One wonders if the shots cost so much to set up every foot just had to be used?
And, oh! the cliches! Just because one film uses hand-held camerawork to put the audience in the middle of a war battle doesn't mean that it is mandatory to use the technique at all times: it detracts from the story and becomes so irritating that the viewer loses the will to live. Then there's the meeting after the return - which was never shown or hinted at despite being arguably the most critical part of the mission - of Neil and wife in the quarantine room, separated by a glass wall: i actually sat there waiting for the inevitable placing of hands on each side of the glass.
Casting is always the most important part of a movie's birth, and especially so when attempting portrayal of current or within living memory events as docu-drama. The only character who had even a fleeting resemblance to his real life alter ego was Mike Collins, who of course stayed in lunar orbit. Compare that with the lead in Vice, where one wonders how they got Dick Cheyney back to play himself!
I don't really follow film directors very much, but on the DVD extras Chazelle comes over as immature and full of self importance: then my wife told me that he also directed La La land (which I haven't seen) and she could only stay watching that for twenty minutes before leaving the cinema. I can see what she meant.
The story of Neil Armstrong, Buss Aldrin and Mike Collins - and the thousands of designers, engineers, technicians, mathematicians etc who made Apollo complete its mission - is etched in everyone's minds who watched the project from Mercury, through Gemini , Apollo, the ISS and shuttle. The mindblowing complexities of making and guiding spacecraft deserve a much much better portrayal than this feeble attempt which makes the whole thing seem little more than strapping in and turning the ignition key. Yes, it is attempting to show the mind of Armstrong as much as the mechanics, but I'm afraid that, for this reviewer, it fails miserably at both."

","""First Man"" is sadly, awful. First Man made our space program and successful flight to the moon, seem like a waste of money, time, and a dark time for our country. From the direction to the story line to the cinematography to the sound, to the music, to the editing. It was a barf-a-rama. I am proud of this country's space program, and I could say that Neil Armstrong is not just a hero to me, who at the age of 10, was left speechless at seeing Mr. Armstrong walk on the moon, but a hero to so many men and women who followed in his footsteps to go where few have gone before, and hopefully will go again. The director, Damien Chazelle, took a story of an amazing man, a hero, and one of the proudest moments in American history, and turned it in to a dark and dismal film. There was a darkness throughout the film. There were very few happy moments. Deaths, protests, and little joy or jubilation. Even on the moon, Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) appeared sad. One of the greatest triumphs of man's ingenuity was reduced to blah. The direction was all over the place. I worked in the Directors Guild of American (DGA) for 5 years in the early 1980s. Not only did get to meet some of the greatest directors in film history, Stanley Kubrick, Frank Capra, Warren Beatty, Elliot Silverstein, I also attended most of the special projects films at the DGA and premieres, including The Right Stuff (a movie I've seen 20 plus times), where I not only met the director, Philip Kaufman, but also meat Chuck Yeager who was there signing The Right Stuff books. I also loved Apollo 13, a master piece of direction by Ron Howard. I am sure many of the greatest directors in Hollywood who have passed, are turning in their graves. This movie war pure garbage, and an insult to Mr. Armstrong's heroic walk on the moon and his legacy. I gave it one star, but it really deserves a negative star."

You know, human eyes have built-in optical image stabilization system, so that when you walk or even run, you see everything smoothly, with little or no noticeable shakes.
But here they added shaking EVERYWHERE! Actors are just having a calm dialog, while STANDING in one place or slowly walking - and they shake the camera, like it's an intense action sequence...<br/><br/>Emotional accents felt lacking in some scenes and out of place in others.

","Midway through First Man, astronaut Neil Armstrong is asked by a reporter at a press conference how he feels about the fact that, should the Apollo 11 mission be successful and he lands on the moon, he'll go down in history.<br/><br/>Armstrong can't answer the question. He impatiently snaps that NASA and the ship's crew plan to be successful. Buzz Aldrin, seated by his side, eventually has to step in to talk about the crew's great responsibility and excitement, while Armstrong stares intently into the middle distance.<br/><br/>The stoicism that might have prevented a man like Armstrong, who was facing either death or a kind of immortality, from being able to articulate an answer in that moment is the heart and soul of First Man. The film is less concerned with delivering a triumphalist portrayal of the 1969 moon landing - which has been done before, we've all seen it - and more with probing what kind of person is able to white-knuckle through the physical, emotional, and psychological toll of this sort of mission and successfully pull it off.<br/><br/>The answer is gratifyingly, understandably intricate. Like last year's Dunkirk, First Man funnels a historical moment through an intimate experience, reminding us that events that appear triumphant in history's rear-view mirror often come at the expense of pain and great personal sacrifice shouldered by real people. But the movie, first and foremost, tells Neil Armstrong's story. We're allowed to see it through his eyes, but in return, it asks us to respect what he went through - and that is not always easy.<br/><br/>First Man is the story of Project Gemini and the moon landing through one man's eyes. At the distance of a half-century, the facts of the moon landing are well-known to most Americans: Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first humans to set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, the culmination of a ""space race"" between the US and the USSR.<br/><br/>All these elements are present in First Man, but the challenge with any movie based on epochal historical events is to find a fresh story in familiar facts. In this case, screenwriter Josh Singer (The Post, Spotlight) adapted James R. Hansen's authorized biography of Armstrong. (Armstrong was famously private, but he granted more than 50 hours of interviews to Hansen and gave him access to private documents and family sources.)<br/><br/>The resulting film, directed by Damien Chazelle (who won the Best Director Oscar for La La Land in 2017) is laser-focused on Armstrong's life, beginning with the tragic cancer-related death of his 2-year-old daughter Karen in 1962, prior to him being chosen for Project Gemini. Like the book on which it's based, First Man paints a portrait of Armstrong as someone for whom heroism was never a motivator, and who viewed notoriety with deep reluctance.<br/><br/>That the movie never really reaches a state of full-blown exhilaration is likely to frustrate viewers who are looking to have their sense of ownership in its historical events reinforced. But rather than focus on American achievement, First Man pays its deepest respects to Armstrong and to the men and women who risked and sacrificed their lives to get to the moon. The movie sees Armstrong's reserve as both a blessing and a curse, a gift and a problem, but it's unequivocal in its admiration of his humility. And in this way, it feels less like it's forcing a myth onto the man who made it clear to his biographer that he wasn't seeking renown - and more like a statement of gratitude."

Ryan Gosling is asked to play Armstrong as utterly emotionless. Since this is something Gosling does in so many of his films, he does it very well. But it doesn't make you care about Armstrong. Nor do you care about his wife. In fact, they are both people you are quite glad that they don't live next door to you, a miserable, joyless pair.<br/><br/>The film is also dull and boring. How on earth did they manage that, given the story matter? But they did.<br/><br/>The actual moon landing is done well. That's about 5 minutes at the end of two and a quarter hours.<br/><br/>This should have been MUCH better than it is."
"bLuR-7","8","6","14","19 October 2018"," A fine balance between the epic and the intimate
","A deftly riveting film by wunderkind Damien Chazelle, First Man retells the story of NASA's first successful lunar landing mission in a way that is both epic in its scale, yet intimate in its focus. The sequences inside the space capsule are surprisingly immersive, with every thud and shudder feeling of viscerally well-earned. Gosling is perfectly cast as the taciturn Armstrong, whose stoic demeanour belies a familial tragedy that plunges him and his wife into a black hope of grief. A dizzying technical achievement. And once you land on that big rock in the sky, you'll truly be left breathless."

Good attention to small details that you don't necessarily think about when it comes to spaceflight. Sound, 1st person view shots and overall tension makes this movie a great watch, especially if you have an interest in the subject. A great addition to The Right Stuff.

","This is a biopic of the first man on the moon. Neil Armstrong was a quiet private reclusive man who had a difficult time expressing his feelings. He had a number of brushes with death and through a combination of skill and luck managed to survive. The film also shows the protests and attempts to stop the program. It spends time showing his wife and the difficulties she had with his quietness as well as his brushes with death. It was an era when you could smoke inside a house without being looked upon as a criminal.<br/><br/>The astronauts never drank Tang in the movie, nor is the film a good fit to watch while listening to ""The Dark Side of the Moon."" Sometimes our heroes put their pants on one leg at a time. His deist religious views did not come up in the film. Armstrong passed in 2012 with his ashes scattered at sea.<br/><br/>Don't expect the film to be a tribute.<br/><br/>Guide: 1 F-word. No sex or nudity."
"sjspol","9","5","11","21 October 2018"," Great Biopic!
","Best biopic in years. Engrossing from start to finish. Armstrong's personal life was as interesting as his space ventures. The editing of the movie was first rate. Even though the movie covered a long timespan in Armstrong's life the transitions were seamless. The photography was also outstanding. You actually felt as though you were inside the cramped capsules. I'm not a big Ryan Gosling fan but he was perfectly cast in this movie. His performance was low key just like Neil Armstrong. I think his performance is Oscar worthy. Claire Foy was also terrific as his wife. As a history of our space ventures I would rate this movie in the same category as ""The Right Stuff"". Hard to believe all the transpired in the film including the moon landing was about a half century ago."
"The_Film_Auditor","9","5","11","20 October 2018"," Fantastic...
","First Man is a technical wonder. The first thing that stands out is the sound of this film. Justin Hurwitz again does a fantastic job creating a score that fits the mood and emotions of what is captured on screen. Not only is the score killer, but the sound design/editing is phenomenal. The sound (or lack of it) during some of the space scenes did a great job of heightening the suspense when something went wrong and exaggerating the sense of awe felt when viewing space. The sound is also paired with some breathtaking cinematography. It is obvious that a lot of time went into planning the shots for this film. Every shadow and reflection feels deliberate. Many have complained about the use of close-ups and shaky cam, and even though I can agree that they were used a little heavy-handedly, I think they were used deliberately to give a certain feeling of anxiety and uncomfortableness that Neil himself felt when piloting a rocket.<br/><br/>The film also has some great performances. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy do a great job of displaying emotion, showing not telling how they feel. Claire Foy in particular does a fantastic job as Janet Shearon.<br/><br/>As for the story, First Man tells Neil's untold personal side of going to the moon and his life around that time. The story was unique in that it humanized Neil Armstrong. When you think of Neil Armstrong, you think of a historical icon and not a father, a husband, a friend, a man. Throughout the film, you witness Neil being all of these things along with an iconic astronaut. This allows the viewer to put themselves into Neil's shoes. Neil feels anxious, sad, and scared just like any of us. Neil's relationship with his wife, his kids, and his co-workers are all explored to some degree, giving us the opportunity to see Neil in a different light. Of course, this is only a portion of the film; the other plot points that deal with the actual journey to the moon are very interesting as well. One thing that this portion of the film demonstrates well is the level of technology used to make the trip to the moon. In hindsight, the technology used to communicate and control the space shuttle wasn't advanced, and this film demonstrates many of the technical issues they had with completing this monumental task. This allowed for some great suspenseful scenes in space. With the combination of some great space sequences and the personal relationships of Neil Armstrong, the pacing of this film feels consistent. Overall, I would highly recommend this film.<br/><br/>The Good

The relationships were stale and the characters were less interesting than a 1980's bland sitcom. This was supposed to tell you the life story of Neil Armstrong, not just the 8 years leading up to the Moon Landing. Hardly any mention of his genuine passion for flight. And how could you make a film about Space Flight so boring? They really needed a better screenplay, and a director who thought it'd be a good idea to simply HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY!

Many viewers who watch this to relive the glamorous photography and technological wonders of the Gemini and Apollo space programs will be disappointed. I did learn things about the life of Neil Armstrong that I did not know before assuming this is an accurate representation. The musical score also did not seem to fit the film. At times it sounds more like an old 1950s Sci-Fy movie and leaves one feeling more depressed about the incredible achievements being made.Glad I did not spend the high price of actually going to a theater."

Scenes with his wife or almost any of the NASA men as far as dialogue left me bored, seemed pointless, and thrown in randomly between his flights as drivers of plot.

"chintanparekh84","6","2","3","14 January 2019"," A slow & negative perspective to a humankind's most inspirational milestone
","The movie's storyline surprisingly takes a very sombre approach leaving you with negative feeling instead of being getting motivated after watching it.
The director and writers have done a poor job in getting in-depth with any aspect or emotion in the movie. They ended up showing all aspect of an astronaut's life but not in detail that makes you feel part of it.
All aspect like loss of child, loss of colleagues life, effects of loss of astronaut's life on family (wife & kids), lack of pragmatic approach to people opposing the initiative and completely missing euphoria on landing on moon. They have touched each aspect but from 10,000 feet top.
The movie also shows Neil suffering from some sort of depression after lost of his daughter and am surprised how he run away from his family later. I am surprised that NASA didn't noticed it during their evaluation.
Also, the movie ends up demeaning the role and involvement of other crew members and NASA team involved in getting a man on moon.
The picturisation on landing on moon was more positive in TV Series Mad Men than in this whole movie.
Overall, a great opportunity lost in inspiring viewers towards space exploration."

","As one who badgered the owner of a caravan site, where I was at the time of the moon landing, to lend me the key to the television room so I could watch the landing at some silly time of the UK night, I was dissapointed with this film.<br/><br/>The film destroyed my image of Neil Armstrong, making him out to be sullen and not what you would call a family man. What man wouldn't want to talk to his kids before he leaves home to go to the moon? Neil Armstrong may have been exactly as depicted in First Man, but surely this could have been moderated to save his reputation with many people, especially when so many other things were omitted, changed or drowned out with sound effects.<br/><br/>The sound effects were too loud which meant any of the conversations between the crew and ground control could not be heard. The famous conversation about the computer codes and the fuel warning count was missing entirely, or just lost in the engine noise which was not on the original 1969 soundtrack.<br/><br/>All in all a very dissapointing film and actually worse than the film Apolo 11 from a few years ago.<br/><br/>Not worth the trip to the cinema."

"junshiwilda","6","2","3","24 November 2018"," 👍A good idea executed in a way I am very mixed.
","If you are expecting this movie to be a space adventure like Apollo 13, you would be wrong. First man would offer you more than just a adventure to the moon. Resisting the temptation to make a pop corn entertainment about the moon landing mission itself, Damien Chazelle decided to make a human drama and a character study of Neil Armstrong himself. Though many have criticized this for not being a movie like Apollo 13 but about a successful landing instead of a unsuccessful one, I personally really respect the direction of a human drama they went for. Instead of doing what came before, Damien Chazelle took a risk by making a movie no one expected from the source material. Even though I like the direction they went for, the final product which is the film itself I have very mixed feelings.<br/><br/>There are many fantastic aspects about this movie. The look of the film itself is very good from the sound mixing to the production design. It was nominated for 4 oscars and won 1 for visual effects, and I think they were all well deserved nominations. There is not a single bad performance and many of the best performances of this year was actually from this movie. Ryan Gosling does a phenomenal job as Louis Armstrong and Claire Foy of course gives a amazing Oscar worthy performance as Neil Armstrong's wife. The script is well written in a way that it literally digs deep into Armstrong's character and of course the score is fantastic. In general there is just some fantastic moments inside this movie worth watching. However, I do have issues with many aspects that almost outweigh the positive aspects.<br/><br/>
The big problem I have with this movie is the tone. Since this movie is a character study, it digs deep into the past regrets and losses Neil Armstrong has experienced. Therefore the film naturally goes into a more darker direction quite literally. Inside this movie there are numerous funeral scenes, and Neil Armstrong himself is portrayed as a cold emotionless man. I can see that they wanted to show how there were many losses and emotional punches people had to experience to make the moon landing possible in order to make it respectful, but I think their attempt to be respectful backfired a bit and became a bit disrespectful. What I mean by that is by making a movie centered in loses and regrets, this movie just became pure depressing which I personally don't think fits the source material. Even in the final moon landing sequence this movie didn't have the triumphant atmosphere this event deserved, and the conclusion to Neil Armstrong's character arc was pretty ambiguous and unredeeming. As I said before I really do respect the direction they went for, but I just think the end result was a bit too disrespectful by being overly dark and depressing.<br/><br/>
Overall this is a movie I have very mixed feelings about. Though I didn't like the overall outcome of the movie, there is just a lot of phenomenal moments inside this film. Many people actually love this film, and if you say you loved it I would not argue since I can see why. I rate this a 6/10 and a C-. Though I am not sure whether or not I can recommend this, it's still a thumbs up and do consider this a positive review."
"thinkMovies","6","2","3","24 November 2018"," Depressed, all the way
","I'll get right to the point. It is said Armstrong was humble, almost shy. But the Armstrong in this film is clinically depressed and somewhere between depressed and catatonic. I'll go with catatonic, all the way.<br/><br/>The effects and realism were incredible. But too many tight shots and not enough establishing shots or hero shots.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was hate it or love it, and it was 50ies and 60ies show tunes melodies.<br/><br/>We follow Armstrong day in day out, year after year tragedy after tragedy, and did I say clinical depression? Even his wife gets depressed in the end. A descent into depression where everything seems to be just there and happening and so what.<br/><br/>By the time we get to the moon it is not a climax we were building up to. It's just another day at the office.<br/><br/>I did not at all mind that there was no flag-planting scene. The flag was there. The scenes on the moon beautiful. Armstrong still depressed out of his skull and not interested.<br/><br/>And then, as the LEM shoots up from the Lunar surface, cut to quarantine on earth. No return trip, no splashdown, no arrival.<br/><br/>But there is one thing more bizarre than any of the others. The completely skipped, they did not mention, we did not see nada of Apollo 8, an essential lead-in to Apollo 11.<br/><br/>I needed to watch the Right Stuff immediately after, to return to regular brain function.<br/><br/>If Neil Armstrong was half as clinically catatonic and depressed as in the movie he would not have been able to go to the moon. He would not have been able to hold a job or go to a store to buy a postcard of the moon."

"davidmvining","8","1","1","17 January 2020"," Very good
","First Man's director, Damien Chazelle, thought that Neil Armstrong's story would fit in well into the thriller genre, and I don't think he was wrong at all. But, there's something else that Chazelle brings to the film that heightens the experience in an unexpected way. The tangible sense of absolute terror at the vastness of space infuses the action with such an enhanced sense of extreme and existential fear that takes the sensation onto another sensory level.<br/><br/>It's the story of a man so wholly dedicated to his career and the task of getting to the moon, filmed entirely in a way that feels like the audience is along for the ride. Armstrong is quiet, though. He's driven and seems to have receded into himself in the face of his daughter's death. It's this death that really frames the film, and I feel like it's the only real flaw. The movie seems to imply that the girl's death was the incentive and source of Neil's drive to reach the moon, capping with him dropping the girl's bracelet onto the lunar surface. It feels so facile as a motive for such a monumental personal task. The little girl's ghost appears in flashes of Neil's vision here and there throughout the film, and it does seem to be the source of his laser-like focus on the task at hand. Perhaps it's based on reality (I wouldn't know), but it just seems so reductive and implausible.<br/><br/>However, moving on from that, the movie's really well assembled both from a character point of view and from a visceral perspective. I've read that the movie is the story of the exciting Neil and his boring wife Janet, but I would argue that it's just the story of Neil with Janet used as a contrasting device (a well built, rounded, character nonetheless) who demonstrates what Neil is leaving behind by going to the stars. They contrast really well. Neil is reserved and quiet, hardly showing any emotion and personifying the professional, and Janet has big, expressive eyes and is ready to speak her mind to whomever needs to hear it.<br/><br/>The sequence that contrasts them best dramatically is what is probably the best part of the film, Neil's Gemini mission. The mission goes well, hitting its main objectives (the first connect between two vessels in orbit), but something goes wrong. There's a mechanical failure that sends the linked vessels into an uncontrollable spin. We see the sequence from two points of view, Neil's and Janet's. Neil is trapped in his small capsule with only small views of the outside world spinning, and we share that perspective, feeling the terror as things go wrong against the empty void of outer space. Against that, we see Janet, listening to the little white box that pipes in the chatter from NASA as things go wrong. She's trying to balance life with her children while taking some small part in her husband's life, but when things go wrong and the audio gets cut by NASA, she's powerless and frantic. She needs to know what's happening to Neil, and no one will tell her. They're truly separated at that moment, Neil alone and near death in space while Janet can't find out anything below. It's a great sequence that contrasts the two halves of Neil's life.<br/><br/>The capstone of the film is the landing of Apollo 11 on the moon, of course, and it's handled with the same sense of tension as the Gemini sequence. The landing is terrifying, as alarms blare and everything moves faster than one might expect from the grainy footage we've lived with for decades. It's exciting and the culmination of the film's promise, both personal and in terms of plot, creating a fantastic finale that, I feel, gets slightly undermined by the dropping of the bracelet. I know it provides an emotional framework for the large task Armstrong put himself through, but I just can't get past the feeling that it's facile and too easy.<br/><br/>The movie, by capturing everything so tightly from Armstrong's perspective, creates an incredible sense of tension. Combined with the super-realistic take on space travel, it lends a sense of real terror to the dangers of traveling through the void. Contrasting that is the emotional reality that grounds the film most exemplified by the use of Neil's wife, Janet. It's a very good entertainment with intensely gripping passages."

","First Man is not the first of it's craft, in fact, the genre is quite saturated at this point, but what the movie achieves is impressive nevertheless. Everything that you would want from a space biography, First Man has it, the physics, the build up, and the drama. First Man does bring some things new to the table, such as, introducing in Neil's family and the Gemini missions into the equation. Everything that you would expect to see in a film such as this, you get, it's pretty much Apollo 13, except for the part where the spacecraft explodes in the middle of space.<br/><br/>As far as the realism goes, it's fairly realistic. They get a lot of things right, like the haircuts they had and Neil's history. I would've liked to see more physics involved, but the film focuses more on Neil's family, which isn't a bad thing at all. I'm not sure if Neil Armstrong had such a severed family life, but if he did, then the writers did a good job with that subplot. The biggest issue I have with First Man, is the extremely long pacing. I understand the whole build up to the finale, but it didn't have to be almost two and a half hours long.<br/><br/>Technically, First Man was well crafted. The cinematography was very well filmed. First Man won an Oscar for best visual effects, but in my opinion, that's not where the movie strives. First Man should've got the Oscar for best sound editing. The scenes where Neil is in the spacecraft feel so realistic, mainly due to the amazing sound mixing and editing. There is constant ambient sounds in the cockpit that really sells the fact that these characters are actually in a spacecraft.<br/><br/>When it comes to performances, Ryan Gosling takes the cake. This is one of his best performances in a movie so far, and he really sells emotional scenes. Surprisingly, the actors that played the two little boys did a great job. Having young children play characters can be unpredictable, but the two actors did a great job.<br/><br/>First Man on paper is an amazing movie; and it is an amazing movie to watch. The vibe First Man gives off feels so realistic, and that's one of the strongest parts of the film. Seeing that First Man won an Oscar for best visual effects baffles me, as First Man does a better job with sound editing. I wouldn't recommend this movie for casual moviegoers, as it can be very boring, but if you're a fan of this genre, then it's definitely worth a watch."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In the 1960s, NASA is preparing one of the most audacious exercises in the history of time, the first manned space mission to the moon, on the Apollo 11 spacecraft. Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), one of the candidates up for selection, is still recovering from a traumatic personal tragedy, but displays an aptitude and ability that sets him far apart from the other test pilots putting themselves forward. As he prepares to take the lead in an endeavour that will push the boundaries of what was thought possible further than ever before, he must contend with the inner dynamics of NASA, the social upheaval of the time and his own conflicts in his personal life.<br/><br/>I often wonder if the present generation would feel more inspired to aspire to greatness and really dedicate themselves to what was possible if some great, magnificent event were to occur that opened their eyes to what can be achieved with determination and dedication. Instead of pandering to be on the next vacuous reality TV show or going on some demonstration about largely perceived racism or climate crisis, something like the moon landing could motivate them, something that still stirs the pool of wonder today, with various people even claiming that they were faked.<br/><br/>The actual moon landing itself is fascinating enough, but Armstrong the man behind it is also has dynamic potential for the story , a studious and slightly nerdy man who developed the personality to command the mission to the moon. Gosling's physical resemblance to the man helps no end, and his performance is thankfully assured and convincing. Reuniting with La La Land director Damien Chazelle (making his second feature film), their respective roles within the production combine to produce something markedly different from their last outing.<br/><br/>In the end, it's just not exceptional enough to truly linger in the memory, but it's involving, well acted and examines a fascinating real life character/event that were two parts of one of the defining moments of our age. ****"

However what is different about it, is that the focus is not on the missions but on Neil himself.<br/><br/>It follows the sacrifice and loss experienced by Armstrong both professionally and personally, and Claire Foy is outstanding as his wife.

","So I just watched this one and I am disappointed. As I watched it I searched how real to the real story this was and it gets really close which for me personally made me lose trust in NASA or USA. So about the movie itself. Its based on the book by Neil Armstrong so its really close to the real story but I was disappointed and I'm not american so I don't know what it will be for the proud americans. The most interesting parts of the movie are in the beginning, basically the first 3rd of the movie is the best which is ironical because we're nowhere near to space flight yet. The actual space flight meaning the whole mission is kinda put there for filling and you don't feel like the movie is about that. There were 2 alarms which nor even NASA control knew what were they and I guess they were nothing because we see just the lunar module just lift from the moon and we jump to quarantine back on Earth. The first mission to the Moon with everything theoretical since no one have done it before and we get 2 alarms that we didn't even get what they were signaling about is just ... I really expected more from this movie because this is like a corner stone in US history so I would expect to put some effort in it. I saw that the director is the one who made La la land so that gives some explanation. No director can make good movie in every genre so that is enough explanation for me why this movie isn't awesome. Its still a good movie but I watched it once and its enough for me."

"Mike_Devine","6","1","1","24 August 2019"," Armstrong biopic prioritizes conflict over outer space
","The renewed interest in the final frontier in film has resulted in some really good (and pretty bad) projects. Damien Chazelle's critically acclaimed box office bust 'First Man' falls somewhere in the middle of the pack, as some had a much different vision of what this film would be about.<br/><br/>At its core, 'First Man' is the story of the conflict experienced by the most famous man to ever visit space. Ryan Gosling stands in as Neil Armstrong alongside Claire Foy as his wife, Janet. The two are very good actors in their own right, but they do not have the necessary spark or chemistry to make the strained relationship feel authentic. That said, this is very much an actor's movie, and neither one should be disappointed with their performances. The supporting cast is alright - nothing spectacular, but they do the job. The special effects are not the main attraction here, that's for sure. Yes, part of the film takes place in space (and more specifically, on the moon), but these scenes feel like they are inserted just because they need to be based on the story.<br/><br/>The one aspect that really stands out in 'First Man' is the soundtrack. Just Hurwitz ('La La Land,' 'Whiplash') really goes all in and delivers a memorable story through sound. It earned a Golden Globe, and easily could have ended up with an Oscar, too.<br/><br/>Despite its poor commercial success, 'First Man' did not deserve all the negative attention it received. It's not an amazing film by any stretch, but it's an important story of one of the most beloved American heroes."
"jaigurudavid","6","1","1","19 August 2019"," A biopic about a not very interesting person
","Don't get me wrong. I have the utmost respect for Neil Armstrong and from everything I have read or heard about him from people who knew him personally he was the perfect man to become the first human to set foot on another celestial body. Despite his well-deserved place in history, his life and personality don't make good cinema. Armstrong kept most of his emotions and thoughts to himself for a reason -- that's the way he wanted it. To speculate about what emotions the man might have had and displayed privately borders on disrespectful. It as if the film wants us to believe that Neil Armstrong was more emotional than he was, so it fabricated moments in which he was emotive. It was the man's ability to control his emotions that made him great."

They desperately need some new angle, some reason to watch this story line.<br/><br/>Add to it all I lived through that entire period of time, I was excited when it actually happened but I have no more excitement saved up to go through it all over again.<br/><br/>Nothing remarkable or bad about the acting or the production values but I want to see something special and this just was not it. I gave it a 5 out of charity for loyalty to the American space program in which I worked as s technician."

","Damien Chazele's follow up to his big film La La Land is a biography on one of the bona fide heroes of American culture-scape Neil Armstrong. Collaborating once again with Chazele is Ryan Gosling who plays the main lead. The film is good although expecting a straight forward larger than life biopic the kind Hollywood is known for is not what this film is. This is a personal take on the nature and character of a public figure who hated the attention and adulation. The scenes with Armstrong's family gives us an inside look at the legendary man's state of mind both before and after launching. Of course, the actual mission is given weight and some scenes are bound to bring goosebumps to space aficionados. I was impressed with this film even though there aren't many uplifting, resounding scenes and the pacing is more of a gentle flow than a typical three act script structure."

I loved Ryan Gossling in this movie he's so versatile.
My only criticism is there were some scenes where there were lights flashing and cameras shaking that went on a bit long but overall great realistic and accurate movie.

","First man, although driven by the astonishing events of Apollo 11 and the greatest human achievement, focuses primarily upon what was lost in order to go to the moon, for all of NASA, the individual astronauts and the families if the men who gave their life for us to go to the moon.<br/><br/>To begin with, First Man is a beautifully crafted film that accurately displays the events of and leading up to Apollo 11. Chazelle uses the fearful emptiness of space as the metaphor behind the film emphasising what was lost on the journey to the moon. The original score from Justin Hurwitz not only shows the talent if this film duo, but how a soundtrack can develop a plot. The visual effects used fully deserved the Oscar it won, the film felt so immersive it is almost as if you are there with them. Technically this film was impeccable, everything felt in the right place and felt true to life. Simply fantastic.<br/><br/>The plot of First Man focuses fully on what was lost when humanity gained a new frontier. I feel it was a beautiful direction for the film to focus upon Armstrong's daughters death, and later on the moon this allows for a beautiful moment of reconciliation with Neil and his daughter. Throughout the film, there are more nods towards the mental factor of going to the moon and the toll it has upon the families who face the difficult task of waiting for their loved ones to return, and not knowing if they ever will.<br/><br/>First Man should be respected to the same extent as Apollo 13, both films have creatively immersed the viewer, however I believe First Man is an emotional drama rather than the adventurous plot of Apollo 13.<br/><br/>9/10"
"witster18","7","1","1","23 July 2019"," Refreshingly real, deliberate take..
","First Man is not a film that will endear itself to younger audiences. The film is slower-paced and centers more on the emotional toll of everything that led to the first small step for man.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch this film because i am a fan of the directors' previous work. I think this film sits on near the top shelf, below ""Whiplash"", but not an eye-sore by any means.<br/><br/>The film succeeds in some ways and fails in others. The film has a consistent, washed-out yet appropriate look for the time-period, and many(not all) of the visuals are spectacular. The music is solid(as to be expected from this director). The final 20-minutes is spine-tingling goodness. Each action sequence, while rare, is handled very well, and each of those moments is suspenseful and feels quite real. The aspect of creating danger and echoing that sentiment through the actions of the characters works here, but the film is far from perfect.<br/><br/>Some visuals are a bit hacked - like the final rocket launch, and perhaps a bit too much unnecessarily over-used handheld camera-work.<br/><br/>The film also fails to bring in emotion outside of the Armstrong household, and almost all the supporting characters feel like an oversight. To boot, the emotional weight of all of the Armstrong households' struggles, fail to hit the mark, perhaps due to a thin, under-written script. A private mans' home life seems as private and restrained as his media personality, and the film suffers because of it. It's not Gosling's fault, but realistic or not, when your lead character seemingly walks away speechless from every emotional moment, it doesn't help the impact nor the pacing of the film you're making. The ending suffers for it too.<br/><br/>Overall, its still a good film, with solid visuals and really tense action sequences, great music, and solid-yet-restrained performances. I won't say I won't watch it again, bit I won't watch it again anytime soon.<br/><br/>67/100<br/><br/>You'll like it you liked(Thirteen Days - a touch below this), The Right Stuff(a clear notch above this), Indian Runner(a small notch above this), and Apollo 13(a small notch above this)."

The Apollo moon landing is thrilling, as Neil makes several decisions as the Eagle lander is running out of fuel, during constant Emergency Warnings (faulty sensor overloads) to land on empty.

"mjcritelli","9","1","1","10 April 2019"," A Subtle, Well Done Film
","Having seen this film twice and liked it a lot, I also can understand why it has received so many harshly negative reviews. This is a character study of a famous man. However, it also strips away much of the glamour and nostalgia with which older Americans remember the space program. It has many scenes filmed in darker colors and deliberately has a claustrophobic feel to it. The handheld camera shots annoyed many viewers, but I felt that they symbolized the haphazard way in which the space program moved forward. As a country, we spent a lot of effort to lock up a few men, send them off into space, with the goal of having a photo-op on the moon before the Soviet Union got there. It is difficult for anyone who did not grow up before the 1980's to understand how frightened we were about the Soviet's lead in space exploration and how we made everything a battle between good and evil, with the Soviets being portrayed as evil. Given the logic of the Cold War, the notion of beating the Soviets to the moon made sense. We see a little of this emerging today with the fear of China, but it is hard for someone who did not live through the 1960's to appreciate how well this film captured what likely was going on under the hood.<br/><br/>For someone who wanted to see a real-life version of Star Wars, and wanted nonstop action, this is absolutely the wrong film to see. For someone who wanted a well-crafted study of a person who was really a pawn in the Cold War, this is a masterpiece. This is a film that bears additional viewings, becaus there were many scenes in which what was not discussed, but was in the background, whether it was the music, the staging, or the throwaway dialogue, was more important.<br/><br/>I did not give it a ""!0"" rating because I felt that it could have been 10-15 minutes shorter, retained the message and feel of the film, and been even more powerful as a result."

As it goes right up to Armstrong's landing on the moon.

","Very slow plot. The movie puts Armstrong and his family in very unfavorable and strange light focusing more on his depression instead of his accomplishments. Also putting today's political issues into 1968. such as Gay rights, insurance for all and immigration was just silly Hollywood propaganda. People from around the country, including myself, were captivated with the Apollo program and the pride it created amongst the american people was strong at a time when Vietnam was ripping the country apart. This movie fails to show this. It makes the viewer feel that most Americans disapproved of nasa which wasn't the case. And to strip the fact that it was an solely an American accomplishment was the cherry on the top of this failure of a movie. I expected better from Ryan Gosling. Sad it should have been a great movie but it was a waste of time."

"kgprophet","6","4","9","14 October 2018"," Great Filmmaking but not Oscar-worthy
","I've always thought there needed to be a sequel to ""The Right Stuff"". That movie followed the Mercury program, the first step to getting to the moon. It was an exciting and fun ""you are there"" inside look into events that occurred and the people involved. Finally we have a movie that picks up with the Gemini and Apollo programs and gives us a first hand glimpse of what it was like going to the moon. <br/><br/>However, while ""The Right Stuff"" was an ensemble narrative, focusing on the bigger picture, ""First Man"" is a very personal look at Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon. While the other film spent time showing a lot of details of the space program, that time instead is spent showing Armstrong with his family. The movie's real narrative is about how Armstrong hid his personal demons from other people. If this was a fictional character, there would probably be a scene where all those upsets that he kept inside come out in some dramatic way. But this film, the only apparent consequence is that his wife demands he opens up.<br/><br/>Gosling seems to be a natural for introverted characters and works well. But there was one thing from the outset that prevented me from really enjoying this movie. Shaky Cam. I remember the time when ""Bourne Supremacy"" came out. It was a time where filming trends had turned to shaky cam to give the impression that it was more like a documentary and feel more authentic. The down-side is there are people out there like me that are sensitive to motion sickness, and the exaggerated shaking seen on the large screen easily induces nausea. Within the first couple minutes where I realised nearly the entire film was going to be shaky, I had to move farther back from the screen. Even then, with the majority of the framing being extreme close-ups, I had to look away a few times to keep my stomach under control. I was extremely disappointed they chose to film using this overrated and outdated style of cinematography. Latest trends have the majority of a film like this being shot Handheld, but without deliberately bouncing the camera all over the place. Handheld camera operators are capable of shooting very smooth shots, and capture the action without calling attention to itself. There was an interesting technical flaw that I was able to catch while watching this film on the large screen (not real Imax, but the Minimax featured at the AMC theater near me). I could see dirt and hairs in some shots. Real film not digital! It was a nice reminder of how dirt on films was accepted like it was in the 70s. On the other hand, I wonder if the camera assistant was checking the gate properly. <br/><br/>One other nitpick is the lack of factual accuracy when it comes to what happened in the NASA space program. There are times that Neil seems to be the subject of attention (as if he's the one in charge) to the expense of the other fellow astronauts. At times it felt a little frustrating that the film would not show major events outside of Armstrong's perspective. As for all those scenes with the family, Claire Foy does a fine job as his wife. There are moments of family time that seem derivative of ""The Tree of Life"". I usually groan when films go over 2 hours, however the subject matter for First Man is so deep, it could easily run 3 hours to cover the many major aspects of the space program. <br/><br/>One thing that stands out is the use of sound design. There are moments during the launch or flight that a loud cacophony of sounds scream out of the speakers. Some of these sounds are intentionally meant to be scary haunted house type of sounds. Including the sounds of screams, moans, and eery wind howls blended into the mix. Again, in the name of factual accuracy, were there really such spooky sounds happening? On the other hand, those sound effects do a great job of adding tension during the test flight scenes, which are very exhilarating. <br/><br/>In the end the whole is equal to the sum of it's parts. Not greater or lesser. It definitely wants to get Oscar attention, but I doubt it will be a front runner. It achieves what it sets out to do, and tries to explain Neil Armstrong's psyche as he went through the space program. In real life, Armstrong never revealed his thoughts and reaction to being the first human to take the first step toward reaching the stars. This film probably feels required to give us some private insight of what Armstrong was thinking while on the moon, but it is probably not accurate."

"bvnisarga","10","3","6","21 February 2019"," An inspiring biopic that will make you appreciate the man it is based on
","The norm of an average biopic is that the person it is based on is deified and the narrative distorted to suit the worshipping of the protagonist and an almost predictable story of rags to riches. There have been many movies about the various NASA missions told from various perspectives but 'First Man' is not like any of them and that is what makes it unique.
'First Man' is an extraordinary inspiring biopic of the first man to set foot on the moon, what I loved about this movie is that the narrative is extremely personal. Neil Armstrong is not portrayed as a 'hero' but as a man who is driven by personal motivations. Ryan Gosling delivers a delicate, nuanced performance as Neil Armstrong, it's his movie through and through.
The direction, screenplay, costumes, set design, background score and cinematography is top-notch. The cinematography, in particular, is just out of this world. The space sequences give a sense of awe and wonder. Honestly, I was on the edge of my seat during the entire Apollo 11 sequence. It gave me goosebumps as it is shot with such precision and accuracy.
This movie was one of my favourites of 2018 as the scale and talent on display here is stellar. Go watch this movie, if you love cinema and appreciate good film-making."

Yes, Ryan Gosling couldn't even make this movie worth watching. Hey Mr. Screenwriter, give me some levity or something! Geez. These people did not seem relatable.

"er_ouz","5","3","6","16 December 2018"," Long, quiet and solemn, this film tries to look inwards, only to find dullness
","First man is the story of Neil Armstrong and the events leading up to the moon landing.
Niel is portrayed as a rather silent type, and whole swathes of the film are devoid of dialogue or even any real actions, in an attempt to portray solemnity and introspection. These long arduous swathes of quiet life are routinely interrupted by realities of Neil's position in the forefront of the space race, operating in a dangerous, high octane and pioneering world of space exploration.
The juxtaposing effect of switching between dull solemn slow moments in life and the high risk extreme moments of the space program is a nice idea, but it's a trick that runs out of steam the first time it is used, and certainly doesn't hold up for an entire movie where it is used again and again.
What you're left with is an incredibly long movie, with huge swathes of boredom and inactivity. The dialogue is almost non existent, and most of the characters flat and devoid of interest, most of all- the character of Neil Armstrong which is portrayed as a joyless dull man.
Maybe if this movie was a full hour shorter it could had been good. The current edit, for me, was agonizingly dull.<br/><br/>If the subject matter interests you enough, or if you're into slow brooding introspective movies- as long as you know what you're getting you self into, you could give this movie a go. Alternatively, if you're having trouble sleeping- here is your chance at a good nights sleep."

Comparing it to Michael Rennie in the original 50's classic, Ebert said Reeves made Rennie seem like Hunter Thompson at closing time.<br/><br/>Gosling must have studied Reeves' performance carefully. A family tragedy torments him, and as a result there is a single emotional breakdown , but in the remainder of the film Gosling seems completely devoid of emotion. He is grayer than the lunar landscape he eventually walks.<br/><br/>And that lunar landscape, and the authentic re-creation of the astronauts' other flights and missions is the only reason this film deserves a five-star rating."
"burlesonjesse5","5","3","6","17 October 2018"," VIEWS ON FILM review of First Man
","The true account of asocial astronaut Neil Armstrong and NASA's tireless efforts to make him the first dude to set foot on the moon, is depicted in 2018's straightforward and somber, First Man (my latest review). <br/><br/>Question: What overlong flick would under-utilize known actors like Patrick Fugit, Corey Stoll, Kyle Chandler, Jason Clarke, Lucas Haas, and Ethan Embry? Answer: First Man would and does it in spades.<br/><br/>Anyway, First Man is not the ""first"" film to tackle the notions of Space Race, lauded craters, and/or extravehicular activity. Apollo 13, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Contact, and The Right Stuff came before it and therein lies the problem. First Man may be educational and helmed by a guy who just won an Oscar (La La Land's Damien Chazelle). However, it feels dated and almost would've been better off as a History Channel documentary or a filmstrip via my napping days in junior high school. <br/><br/>Projecting at 141 aseptic minutes with a bleakness and an audience detachment equivalent to its aloof, leading man (an always droopy-eyed Ryan Gosling), First Man goes through the motions with its bullet point presentation masquerading as simplified narrative. The movie has little sense of awe and because most Americans know what went down on July 20,1969, almost has no sense of elaborated surprise.<br/><br/>Sans some terrific sound mixing by veteran Mary H. Ellis, the only thing that saves First Man from tumbling into a regional black hole (no pun intended), is the rattled performance of Clair Foy (she plays Armstrong's wife) and Damien Chazelle's solid if not unconventional direction. Chazelle's obsession with close-ups, his aeronautic attention to detail, and his need to put you in the seat of his loud and visceral cockpit, kinda serve him well here. If only the rest of First Man wasn't so filled with underdeveloped side characters, a sophomoric film score, and pretentiousness the size of Jupiter. My rating: An ""unmanned"" two stars."
"adrian-nuno13","6","3","6","15 October 2018"," What a disappointment
","What a disappointment. <br/><br/>I never thought I would use those three words to describe a film made by the man who gave us Whiplash and La La Land. But when you have a film that is mostly empty of emotion, doesn't give the actual moon landing sequences the grand feeling it deserves and then have such a weak ending from a director who has given some of the best film endings I've seen in the past few years, as I left the theater, I couldn't help but think what a missed opportunity this was. <br/><br/>If anything, my favorite thing about this movie was Claire Foy as Jane Armstrong. She gives this film the tension and emotional depth that still gave me any interest in the story. But the music by Justin Hurwitz doesn't work, Ryan Gosling's performance is weak and the entire experience felt incredibly underwhelming.

I learned and was reminded about some of them but it's a rude and sometimes very dark ride that leads to the launch, arriving, landing, setting foot on the Moon and return to Earth.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake for this film is at the end. The music and visual of the landing reminded Interstellar's best moments but in a real situation setting. ""Hey, for all mankind, we are going to land on the MOON!!""<br/><br/>It's the Neil Armstrong and Apollo 11 story. In no way another Apollo 13 or Right Stuff.<br/><br/>The only important things missing are why Armstrong wanted to be an astronaut and the World Tour that came after the landing.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","3","7","11 November 2018"," An epic event, a very mediocre movie
","""First Man"" is a new 2018 movie and this was considered one of the big players this American awards season in fact. Until its release that is because the reception was not extremely positive here. But first things first. The director here is Damien Chazelle, despite his age an Oscar winner already, and looking at the awards recognition for his previous 2 movies it is easy to see why so many thought this one could be a huge hit too. He is not credited as a writer this time, which may be the film's biggest problem because as good or even great as Josh Singer was on Spotlight, here he is extremely underwhelming when it came to adapting Hansen's novel. The subject is of course based on real events, which the name Neil Armstrong should tell absolutely everybody, even people like myself who were born a long time after the moon landing. And looking at words from my mother, I found out how this was really among the most defining moments that she remembers very well half a century later apparently. So it is really surprising why it took this long for a big film to be made around this spectacular subject and looking at the success of the likes of Gravity and The Martian, it's probably no surprise it came out now. But it is inferior I must say. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Chazelle's direction, but looking at how his previous 2 successful films are works of fiction, it may be better for him to return to said approach. Also here the more fictitious sequences are better than the historic ones, even if of course he did not write the script. With the fictitious parts, I am referring to all the marriage scenes mostly. I am pretty sure there is very little real life reference to these with what was between Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong aside from the daughter's death for example which must have been based on actual events. The best moment is probably when Gosling's character tells his kids that he may not return or lets say what follows afterward when we see the kids leave the room. Even in this scene, Gosling feels incredibly bland and I thought he was a weak casting decision here to be honest. Then again, I am not a fan of him at all and I swear he has almost always the same face expression during his films. I wonder why people are criticizing Kristen Stewart for that and not Gosling. Anyway, of course Gosling was the lead in Chazelle's La La Land, so I am not too surprised to see him here again. How much or if he resembles Armstrong physically, I cannot say.<br/><br/>As for the very final scene with the hands and the glass between them, I am undecided. I think it was a bit too long with Foy's reaction, but the very last shot was pretty good and the film could have ended on a weaker note for sure. As for Foy, she is enjoying quite a career these days with her role as Salander in a new film, here as Neil Armstrong's wife or in a recent psycho thriller a(n alleged) stalking victim. And this does not even include her small screen trademark role where she won (surprisingly) big this year again as well over Lizzie Moss. But back to this movie we got here. As you see from my rating, I really don't rate it highly. This also has to do with my personal approach on the idea of higher faster further and the fact that I am completely d'accord with the African American guy who complained how they use so much money for space exploration and lost so many lives of astronauts. Add to that that the concept of space exploration is so far in the past now that it may be a difficult time for releasing a film like that. The epicness that past generations saw in this achievement is lost on today's people and sadly this film cannot rekindle the fire. Interesting references like Gagarin being in space before the Americans felt rushed in and wasted. Same about the very personal story of the girl's death early on. It sure felt a bit clumsy there unfortunately. The big counter plot to the space story here is the family conflict about Foy's character's criticisms of Armstrong risking his life despite being a father of two and the neighbor family going through the same fate cannot alone make up for it. Besides, the film did feel far too long in my opinion. It had some lengths in the first half and it did not feel half as relevant as it should have with one dangerous space mission following the next. Sure there is nothing wrong with the film visually and technically, but this alone is not enough. It lacks way too much in my opinion in several other departments for me to recommend the movie. This is not Apollo 13 and Ryan Gosling sure isn't Tom Hanks, not even in a film that is not among the very best in terms of performances in my opinion for the latter. So yeah, skip this one. It's not worth spending almost 2.5 hours on."

","I loved ""The Right Stuff"". Must have seen it more than a dozen times. Loved ""Apollo 13"". Loved"" Top Gun"". This movie, while for the most part being historically accurate, doesn't warrant the same type of reaction. It's an emotional effort that last bare the feelings of one of the most private individual this side of Howard Hughes. The history, the X15, the training, the flight, all are second tier to the dark brooding character that gets portrayed. Only the Armstrong children can attest to how accurate the portrayal is, but the final scene is so dark and unnecessary that it soured the previous two hours for me.

A few great moments are highlighted during the film but basically it tells more of what it took socially, psychologically and intellectually to get through the training and eventually succeed in the mission. Yes, so much emphasis on the family life can be a bit long and slow, but understanding more of what it was like to do it makes it worth seeing. It would help if one has the knowledge of what it took to be a test pilot in an X-15 getting dropped from the wing of a B-52.

It then dawned on me that these special sound effects were at the core of the movie and I should appreciate them. And so I did, right till the moon landing at the, which is also a protracted screen shake. But really, getting you to feel what it must be like inside a space ship landing on the moon is not enough to make for an enjoyable movie.

","And Keir Dullea was wooden, get ready for almost two and a half hours of close-ups of Ryan Gosling's eyeballs. I remember watching 2001 when it was released, and the Moon landing when it happened, but movies like Hidden Figures and The Right Stuff give much richer portraits of the time and the people involved. And who can forget Sam Shepard as Chuck Yeager striding away from the crash scene--a much more powerful image than the one depicted here. Yeager, by the way, gets almost no notice here. As with other recent historical movies like The Post, this film would benefit from subtitles identifying some of the true giants who flit almost un-noted through the story.<br/><br/>Granted, I loved Claire Foy as QE II, but for my money this is her movie, and she's the emotional center. Maybe she should have married that boring dentist after all.<br/><br/>Star Wars gave us space operas full of beat-up junky old crates, and First Man has something of the same feel, with cramped claustrophobic capsules and drab GI offices. Not unlike the new Blade Runner, but Gosling isn't Harrison Ford, and he isn't Sam Shepard either. <br/><br/>On a final note, this movie opened nationally just as Gus Grissom's widow finally passed away some fifty years after his heroic death. Folks who get their knickers in a twist about insufficient displays of Americanism in this movie might reflect on how our Great Nation treated the widows and orphans the Space Race cost us."

However, I cannot give this film a bad review. The performances were good across the board. The score was acceptable but forgettable (again surprising given Chazelle's previous work).

","This is my opinion on the movie so if you like the movie don't get angry from what i say. This is my opinion so yeah. First man is a story about the people going to the moon. It has a really good story and got a Oscar award. But it was a bit boring. Most of the movie was just the people talking. When there was scenes when they go to the moon on a rocketship they weren't that exciting. I went to the cinemas to watch it and I just talked to my friends because it was boring. But it's good if you want to watch a movie about a true story. But to me I'm not that type of person. I like action movies and stuff as you see on the John wick reviews I did. But it still had a good story. It shows all the full details as Neil Armstrong prepares to go to the moon. It's a alright movie to watch.

","I'll admit: I'm already a fan of Damien Chazelle. I'm not sure if it's because he's only a few months older than I am, or if it's how I can personally relate to the subjects of his films. I understand the obsession he covered in Whiplash (2014). I can relate to the dreams of creative individuals he brought to light in La La Land (2016). Now, Chazelle has used his filmmaking talent to cover another topic I have a great interest in: space. First Man (2018) feels like a film that's been waiting for the right director to come along, and Damien Chazelle hit it out of the park.<br/><br/>Lying somewhere between The Right Stuff (1983) and Apollo 13 (1995), with a little bit of Interstellar (2014) thrown in as well for style, First Man does a fantastic job of showing how dangerous the missions that landed us on the moon really were. There seemed to be an adherence to realism in this film that helped to convey how claustrophobic, terrifying, and risky these few dozen missions were. The fact that we even successfully pulled off the ""moon shot"" is a testament to the engineers that made the program succeed.<br/><br/>While the segments set in outer space help to define the film's three-act structure, following Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) from test pilot to Gemini VIII to Apollo 11, they are the breathtaking set pieces that give this movie its strength. Consequently, some of the moments on the ground seemed a little slow in comparison. Granted, these moments felt quite intimate as the audience is shown how private and introverted Armstrong was and how he dealt with the stress of work and family. After all, I think we often forget how the multiple deaths of astronaut co-workers can affect the rest of the team and their families.<br/><br/>A personal, gripping, and realistic look at what got us to the moon, I give First Man 4.5 stars out of 5."

The man literally lead an out-of-this-world life with outstanding achievements. That alone can't be labled boring, but the fact that this film has paid respect to Armstrong's life and work in such a beautifully cinematic and respectful way? I don't really understand some people.<br/><br/>I hesitated watching this flick as I saw the trailer in which Janet Shearon (Claire Foy) is angrily berating a group of NASA scientists telling them they're ""a bunch of boys playing with toys"".. or something along those lines. I rolled my eyes and didn't even finish the trailer.<br/><br/>Eventually I watched it, purely out of nothing else to do at the time and quite honestly expecting to roll my eyes out of their socket until I fell asleep.<br/><br/>The review:<br/><br/>From the moment of the first opening scene - my heart was in my mouth. It was just so intense and placed you right in the cockpit with Armstrong. This is done through a means I usually cannot stand - shaky camera and extreme close ups. I mean, I really can't express enough how much I despise shaky camera and full face close ups. And yet here, it works in a way I never thought possible for such a technique.<br/><br/>As a huge Sci Fi fan I'd rate this as a great Sci Fi film. The family scenes not only didn't make me want to cringe and barf (a usual reaction to family drama), but were instead touching in such a way that I felt a real heart ache for Armstrong and his wife, Janet - the drives and millstones.<br/><br/>The music was perfect for every scene. I take my hat off to Justin Herwitz. Every actor played the part to a T. I take my hat off to Damien Chazelle. I didn't know it was the same guy as Whiplash going into the film.

Also liked Apollo 13 but not as much as the first two I've named. Hated ""Gravity"" which I found absolutely silly.<br/><br/>This has probably been the first time I've watched a movie involving Gosling and I do understand the criticism of one- dimensionality that comes across within his acting. Also I understand the cricics of the flat soundtrack. But that's all I can agree with. Did this movie really need more? Did it really need more goosebumbs, action, happiness or drama? My opinion is no. It was absolutely stunning and hypnotizing in it's trepidation. It made my dizzy in the way I wished to become an astrounaut when I was a child. The fascination and fear... I always felt the same about it all when my father told me about this day the entire world was sitting in front of a tv. Older guy was sitting besides me in the theatre had tears in his eyes, told me about that day and sat speachless in his chair for a very long time after the movie ended.<br/><br/>I personally never though about this human achievment in a glamorous way. I always connected it with fear and incredible braveness, pretty horrifiying for these astronauts families. I'm no expert of Armstrongs Biography but I think it is a very sensible portrait. Overall I give it a solid 9 for being so hypnotizing in it's plainness. Absolutely loved it. Loved it much more than overloaded ""Interstellar""."

","Ryan Gosling is back! Fresh off of his great success last year with La La Land. Gosling came back with the same partnership in Damien Chazelle and delivered once again. Showing just how a great actor and director can produce many different kinds of movies if made correctly. Now was it perfect? Not at all, but it was one of the best performances, so far this year.
Showing a true story of a man that many knew at one time, but by now most have forgotten. Gosling embodied the weird, nerdy, and sometimes day-dreaming Armstrong with great success. He showed off on the screen infront of us. He can do it all. Serious. Sad. Passionate. Action.
Now this movie was more than just Gosling. It featured other heavy hitters in Claire Foy and Jason Clarke as well as Kyle Chandler. They helped to round out the acting performances into a stellar movie. The writing was able to navigate through a somewhat cluttered film, but had impactful moments and a strong finish. Which sometimes can make a film feel better than it was the rest of the time."

","Quite apart from the extreme shaking shots of Ryan Gosling's head and eyeballs, I was very frustrated by not seeing appropriate clips of the vehicles which did the work. The X-15 rocket plane (seen in background), the Gemini 8 spacecraft (not shown at all), the massive 1 mph Crawler which transported the Saturn 5 from the Vehicle Assembly Building to the launch pad (only views of its tracks are shown), the Atlas Agena docking rocket (tiny view from a very long distance), take-off from the Moon, all come to mind.<br/><br/>Views of some rockets are shown at extreme angles, looking along the hull - no ""beauty shots"". This is in marked contrast to Apollo 13 where brief but appropriate cutaways to the ship are shown and greatly enhance the storytelling.<br/><br/>The view that ""It's about the man, not the machines"" is dumb IMHO. Without those machines we would still be navel gazing and howling wistfully at the moon.<br/><br/>Surprisingly the Saturn 5 for Apollo 11 is shown in all its glory during launch. Director could have maintained his anti-engineering stance and only shown ultra-close ups of rocket plumes, ice falling off the body, weird views looking down the body etc. I wonder why he broke his consistency here?<br/><br/>Normally I would add a movie like this to my collection but I found it so frustrating to watch for reasons outlined, I don't think I will..."

","It was really annoying from the start that all the actors didn't seem to speak clearly and that made it harder to follow than it already was anyway.
I also advise that if you want to see this movie you read the Wikipedia article on Armstrong or the Gemini / Apollo missions first. I went into the movie with a vague understanding, but felt left way behind because they don't explain much in the movie. I didn't know the timeline of the Gemini and Apollo missions and they don't bother to explain, so I was left wondering where in the timeline they were and how many more missions there were to come before the Apollo 11.<br/><br/>They use the shaky camera style a lot, which is okay since many parts of the movies are taking place in rockets or other fast and unsteady vehicles, but during the personal scenes there are also some weirdly fast cut scenes that didn't seem to serve a purpose. In addition, I also think they either used old camera equipment or some sort of filter to give the movie a vintage appeal. That is interesting in an artsy way, but for the viewing pleasure it was more bothering.
The sequence on the moon was quite beautifully executed and the highlight of the movie, though."

Clearly this director only used this subject as a prop for him to exercise his artistic impulses, which for this film were over the top.<br/><br/>If this were supposed to be a character study of new Armstrong the man, the astronaut, it was far off. While Armstrong was an introvert, and a classic specimen of mid 20th century midwestern values and traits, he was not cold or devoid of feeling. True, he was an engineer in the fullest sense of the character, but had a passion for flying and celebrated the accomplishment landing on the moon. None of this is communicated in this movie."

","This movie about the most famous of astronauts does a great job portraying him as a human being, but is nearly ruined by the awful job presenting the details of his profession, details that have been seen so accurately presented in other movies, for decades. Anyone even slightly familiar with spaceflight will be shocked by the movie's space vehicles. They aren't the pristine machines of Apollo 13, nor the stylized craft from The Right Stuff. They are worn and grimy and they creak and squeak alarmingly. The paint is peeling from the White Room ceiling...there are streaks on the cockpit windows...no one uses a checklist, they just hop in and go. And every flight Armstrong takes is presented as a white-knuckled, seconds-from-disaster endeavor. And it was dangerous, certainly, but it wasn't all terror and being thrown around the cockpit - it's hyped up film-making at its worst by people who apparently didn't know or care about the details. As such, it's the yang to films like Apollo 13 or the HBO series From the Earth to the Moon.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling does a good job portraying Neil Armstrong as the stoic, occasionally icy professional who tries - and often fails - to balance his most risky profession with being a father and husband. Claire Foy is wonderful as Armstrong's wife Jan. Jason Clarke plays Armstrong's neighbor and fellow astronaut Ed White, trying to break through Neil's shell before dying himself in the Apollo 1 fire (which is an intense scene but not at all gruesome, much to my relief.)<br/><br/>At 2:20, this little-film-within-a-big film could have benefited from lots of trimming (endless scenes of astronauts getting slammed around during launch get old quickly.) A noble effort, but not a film I'll remember or revisit, especially when I can yank a copy of Apollo 13 off the shelf."

He probably decided to be ""original"" just for the sake of it and introduced all the bad parts in the movie.<br/><br/>All these extra close shots, bordering on the macro video, when half of the face fills whole screen from top to bottom. Constant intense shaky cam in still shots and regular room scenes. Walking a few steps after character and managing to wave camera everywhere, from empty corner to character and back. And all silence scenes, that look so ""original"" compared to the usual shouts, cheering and talking in normal, not so ""original"" space history movies.<br/><br/>While operator/director managed to screw half of Earth scenes, their rocket scenes are amazing. Only minor nitpick is abruptly cut Apollo 1 scene. They could throw away a few minutes of Earth footage and instead complete A1 scene properly.<br/><br/>Casting was mostly good and I suppose in character.<br/><br/>This easily could have been a 9/10 movie with a more thoughtful editing and stabilized camera with normal distances in Earth scenes."

It portrays missions accurately but then also adds in cinematic cliches like Neil seeing his dead daughter in places, which would've never happened. And the scene where he dropped his kids bracelet into the sea of tranquillity is pure Hollywood. A real juxtaposition with what the rest of the film is trying to achieve. It's a rather dull slog to the inevitable payoff which was all too brief. Without musical scenes, the Director is out of his depth in maintaining viewer attention for a biopic. It's a film to watch once just to say you be watched it but it won't stand the test of time."

Hoping for a climatic ending, or for even one poignant frame of the 'pale blue dot', was a mistake: neither happens.<br/><br/>They were going for a character study, I get it. But the narrative was so emotionally tone-deaf that it robs the characters of redeemable (or even human) qualities. We feel neither connection nor empathy to root for them. Even in their worst, most vulnerable moments, it just feels exploitative and invasive.<br/><br/>The only achievement here is how the filmmakers took a subject as awe-inspiring and majestic as spaceflight and managed to churn it into melodrama.<br/><br/>Forego 2.5 hours of discomfort and read Apollo Program's Wikipedia page instead."

","OK, credit duly given to the technical accomplishments of ""First Man"" are indeed something to behold-Chazelle shot it on 35MM with IMAX cameras-but sadly he never explored the inner universe of his subject. We are left with a relentless and mind-numbing shaky-cam torture chamber for the viewer that at the end of the day undermines even the greatest strength of the film, its cinematographic prowess.
The consequence of such technical one-dimensionality is we never feel the complexity of emotions and politics that created this uniquely American man and narrative. Chazelle frames Armstrong's journey by starting with the death of his daughter at a very young age. Already a quiet man, Armstrong became even more so after it, never even talking about it with his wife , and pouring himself into his work. Sadly, Chazelle's trajectory remains merely psychological. We are left with a reading of ""First Man"" that it's about a man who had to go to the moon to get over a tragedy no one should ever have to face. Chazelle reduces the cultural, emotional, political and spiritual complexity that is and was Neil Armstrong into a one-dimensional psychological narrative: the grieving father. There is more to both the Apollo Generation and Neil Armstrong than that.
Chazelle mutes and ignores the interwoven cultural, social and political milieu that fueled the NASA projects . Technical virtuosity alone cannot tell that story.
Neil Armstrong and Apollo's triumph was about more than the merely therapeutic."

","My husband and I were really looking forward to seeing this movie! We both remember the Apollo landing (yes, we're that old), and I'm a huge fan of Ryan Gosling. I was especially disappointed. The movie was WAY longer than it could have / should have been.
Although I love looking at Ryan Gosling's face, there were too many times and too many minutes of close-ups. I'm not a fan of the camera technique that was used - it reminded me of my poor attempts at using a video camera to record family members in motion. Can you say motion sickness?
Several scenes went on far too long, and yet, I felt like the characters were not developed enough for me to understand them or feel anything towards them.
When the movie abruptly ended, my husband and I just looked at each other and said, ""Oh well, I guess it's over.""

You meet Armstrong before the glow of triumph and mission success, when everything was still unproven and in doubt. Also, it captures the home-front extraordinarily well. More melancholy than I expected, but life for any 'hero' is not all roses and well lit paths. Armstrong is an engineer/pilot and compartmentalized personal and professional events at an extraordinary level, as one in his profession should. Gosling executes well, making the viewer feel the weight of the story and events instead of the actor merely displaying the emotions, which would've been a discredit to Armstrong's understated personality and quiet exercise of character.

","To a space enthusiast like me, you could just show 2 hrs of Apollo mission footage and I would consider that money and time well spent, which is why this movie managed to be kinda satisfying DESPITE all the efforts of the writer / director to make this exciting human achievement dark and depressing.<br/><br/>There are many ways of injecting drama and emotion in a space movie, by showing the terror, the uncertainty, the camaraderie, or even a nuanced look at astronomers' relationships / friendships, but First Man chooses to just show unsympathetic glimpses of Neil Armstrong's life that are neither comprehensive enough to be biographical nor have the emotional heft to be engaging. <br/><br/>1. Characterization: <br/><br/>Neil Armstrong's family is perpetually depressed, he is always aloof and detached, has no screen chemistry with wife, who is icy, tight-lipped and always seems to be on the verge of tears / exhaustion. Watching their conversations make you feel like one trapped in a 2+ hour road trip with a passive-aggressive couple. We are to believe all this is because they lost their daughter to cancer 6 yrs ago at the age of 2. Whether it be scenes of him staring wistfully at the moon for the umpteenth time, or sulking most times he's shown in the vicinity of his family, it becomes progressively hard to care about the guy who needs a lecture from his wife before he'd talk to his sons on what could very well be his last night ever with them.<br/><br/>2. Lighting and Camera: <br/><br/>Their house is never well-lit and feels like an interrogation chamber half the time. Most of these scenes are grainy and shot handheld with a shaky camera, often getting into the faces of the characters which lends a dizzy, disconcerting feeling to already uncomfortable scenes. This perma-zoom means Claire Foy's freckled arms probably had more screen time and took more screen space than the moon's surface. The camera work and color grading make you feel like you're watching a horror film / tragedy rather than one of mankind's greatest triumphs. OTOH, the cockpit scenes and space scenes are quite well executed and realistic, but be prepared for a lot of shaking, vibrating and spinning. That being said, this is no Gravity / Interstellar in that department.<br/><br/>This film has two slightly funny scenes, but such is the pall of all-pervasive gloom in the film that even those didn't manage to elicit more than careful chuckles from the audience.<br/><br/>Thankfully, if you have any love for the space program, the movie offers plenty to watch. Lots of mission-related scenes, launch sequences, some technical terminology, and the moon landing scenes are brilliantly shot, managing to make you emotional in an otherwise sterile movie. The background score and sound editing are top notch and really put you in the situation, and Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong is passable. Claire Foy is quite underutilized as his wife and most of the other numerous characters are largely forgettable."

","I look forward to this biographical movie when I see the name. What kind of story will I tell about this character experience?<br/><br/>My personal favorite is that the film chooses to tell from a personal point of view.Combining the rapid switching of the camera makes each section of the bridge that performs the task encounter an accident. It is particularly thrilling and especially catches people. Especially many lens details can reflect the character's uneasy tension and anxiety. This is done very well. On the contrary, it is really the last process from launching to the moon. It seems that the long lens on the moon's surface is calm and empty and beautiful. The whole process is like the psychological reaction of the character. It is not excitement and excitement but great pressure. After the task is completed, the past is relieved.<br/><br/>The film avoids a large number of main themes and political elements. The point is so far. It shows the influence of the pressure of social public opinion on the characters and reflects people's thinking about the significance of this moon landing. However, it is a pity that the emotional drama with the family is not enough.<br/><br/>It can be seen that the film wants to express Neil's hard work and concentration. On the one hand, it is also to forget the pain of losing the daughter. To avoid talking with the family about the task, I don't want them to worry about dropping the daughter's bracelet after landing on the moon, and the goodbye in the past should have been tender but actual watching. The experience is not enough to make the audience enter the show, but the characters appear to be Facebook. Neil is more like a working machine focused on the moon and the family's emotional drama. It is only like passing the set. This makes the last moment of throwing the bracelet not powerful enough. The movie watching process also seems to have been difficult before the preparation process, but it was particularly worrying, but the most important part of the moon landing was emotionally relieved and a bit discouraged. Presumably the script if the script can make the emotional drama part of the character more concentrated, then some real emotional savings will eventually be More moving to reach sublimation<br/><br/>Generally speaking, the good part is very good, but the whole can definitely be better, but unfortunately it is impossible to remake in the short term, even if someone else shoots this biography, it is not necessary to start from this angle."

","Biopic on the life of Neil Armstrong in the sixties, starting in 1961 on a test flight out of the atmosphere, until reaching the moon in 1969.
After his 2 successful films ""Whiplash"" 2014 and ""La La Land"" 2016, a more mature Damien Chazelle presents ""First Man"" about the life of a man with clear goals and his full personal commitment to achieve them.
A detailed vision that revolves around the intimacy of his family life and his friendships and that, at the same time, contrasts with his iron discipline and total dedication to his work. Within that antagonistic environment, the director communicates the anguishes, fears, disagreements and fatalities that were present throughout this period of his life.
And so Chazelle captures, on the one hand, a silent, self-absorbed and tormented Neil, 100 % dedicated to his own spatial challenge, to help him overcome the tragedy that overwhelms him and culminates in getting rid of Karen's bracelet on the moon. On the other hand, Jane his wife, who comments that Neil ""seemed very stable to her, that she aspired to live an ordinary life with Neil"", she represents in this story, the character ""down to earth"" who enables and generates coexistence and more importantly: it means family stability.
""First Man"" 4th. and most recent feature film by Demian Chazelle, is a game of mixed positions and a mixture of ironies between political actors, the scientific community, the media, society and primarily the family.
Convincing Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy performances with a climactic scene demanding Neil talk to his children about the risks of the mission.

","To say why ""First Man"" inspired my desire to express so much, it should be because this movie allows me to enjoy the ample fun of interpreting the movie.
After watching the movie, I wiped out very emotional tears, and quickly hit the five stars. First of all, this film really touched me on the emotional level. Two nights after watching the movie, I turned over and over in bed to think about every plot and every shot to understand what the director wanted to express, and I think I got a more self-consistent logic. I found a sufficient reason for my touching.
In short, this is not my first attempt to decipher the hidden password in the movie, but this is my first strong urge to write something.
In the play-focus on the individual's heart from the background of the grand story
The outline said that the movie watching experience when watching ""First Man"" reminded me of Rome. Both are focused on an individual in a macro era environment. The main line of ""First Man"" is about the story of landing on the moon, but the difference is whether it is ""the story of the first man on the moon"" or ""the story of this man on the moon."" The film obviously pays more attention to this individual and tries to ignore the entire human Category. For this reason, the film shows a lot of family dramas that have nothing to do with landing on the moon.
When it comes to family, it involves a theme of death in the film. The death of the daughter is crucial here. This is the beginning of Neal 's estrangement from the family and the world. In fact, he is indulging in a sense of absence. This feeling runs through the whole film, and the clues of the daughter have been embellished in the film, including the daughter The chain, seeing the swings that I knew before, and most obviously Neil stared at her daughter 's bed many times, and often dreamed that her daughter was beside him. Later, his colleagues' deaths also affected him to varying degrees. The key is that the deaths in the whole film also helped Neil step on the moon landing step by step, so the moon landing became Neil's A journey of mourning with death as a stake.
In the end, he landed on the moon, which is the most important scene in the film and the closing of the theme of death. The camera circled 360 degrees around Neil's endless void, the white and cold everything on the moon. At this time, he stood in front of a huge pit, just like the beginning of the film he looked at his daughter's tomb slowly, Tossed off her daughter's bracelet and gave it back to her, completing her final tribute to her.
Listen to it-Focus on the enclosed cabin environment from the infinite exploratory universe
In the movies of space, the display of outer space and spacecraft is often the spectacle itself, which is the selling point. In ""First Man"", we can hardly see the magnificent landscape. The director used his unique set of audio-visual systems to try to go Wonderful space movie shooting."
"Dello_","8","0","0","26 March 2020"," An intimate take on the Moon landing
","""First Man"" was very different from what I expected because it's not the story of the first man to ever walk on the Moon but this is just the setting. The film is more interested in his feelings, in telling the story of an introvert man who never fully managed to move on after the death of one of his relatives. And in this way the viewer experience a sympathy for that man and is able to relate with him rather than merely watching his triumphs and failures. Ryan Gosling gives a great performance as Neil Armstrong but also Claire Foy as his wife is very good. The director Damien Chazelle did a fantastic job, especially in the flight scenes where he decided to mostly only use a point of view placed inside the vehicle. This and the frenetic camera movements that simulate strong turbulence makes you feel there in full anxiety. Regarding the score, it was great and we should agree that the Chazelle-Hurwitz duo is phenomenal.
So ""First Man"" is a slow paced movie whose focus is on the emotions of a man. Yes, it is a biopic about Neil Armstrong and has also the structure of the genere but it's even something deeper that manages to reach the viewer in a very positive way."

The film does a great job of underplaying the moments of genuine drama in the film and builds nicely to the films climactic moon walk. It also nicely avoids Hollywood biopic cliches.

"nizzambaharuddin","10","0","0","11 December 2019"," EXHILARATING AND CLAUSTROPHOBIC AT TIMES
","SPOILER-FREE<br/><br/>Have you ever want to be an astronaut? I'm sure most of us if not all, have dreamt it. Well now you can (or at least as close as you can) by watching this film. This film depicts a very realistic view on being an astronaut when space exploration is still relatively new. It's definitely not at all glamorous as we've all imagined it to be. They (NASA and the astronauts) went through a lot of scrutiny before that successful Apollo 11 mission.<br/><br/>The film follows the trials and tribulations Neil Armstrong had to went through before making history. If you're going in hoping for a science fiction film, then you might be disappointed. It's more biopic dan sci-fi. However, I can say it's more real science than most sci-fi. Why?<br/><br/>Well, for instance it shows what went through when a space mission is happening. Even the slightest miscounted steps can make you go off course quite far. You need many readjustments and the ability to adapt to any changes and challenges. It shows the training needed to be one. And also the brains. Imagine, a chapter of physics consists of 600+ pages, which they need to go through in one lecture.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film is spectacular. Most of the scenes were shot brilliantly, especially the Agena attaching scene. Linus Sandgren definitely managed to show his wide range of skills. You will feel what Neil and the others felt during that time. You might feel uncomfortable, anxious, claustrophobic, sweaty and nauseating. Hell, I'm not even surprised if some did threw up watching the film. It's that real. You feel like you yourself is the astronaut going to space.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the score choice of the film is very interesting. Usually, a sci-fi film would use epic or alien sounding score for these films. But the film instead uses old 50s and 60s music, which actually quite appropriate given the time period. Who would've thought that old classic music would fit so seamlessly in a sci-fi film? Props for them on using that advantage. It's probably why La La Land won that many awards.<br/><br/>The only downside to this film is it's a bit long, sitting in at about 2 hours and 20 minutes. Therefore, it's definitely not for people with short attention span. Other than that, it's a near perfect film. Definitely try and watch this on IMAX theatre if you can."
"Turfseer","4","0","0","9 December 2019"," One dimensional supporting characters coupled with unemotional protagonist undermine otherwise technically proficient tale of first lunar landing
","I was a bit surprised when I saw the director of a film about the first man on the moon was Damien Chazelle. His prior films were quite different. There was that turgid melodrama, Whiplash, about an angry music teacher; and then La La Land, a musical with a mediocre script but some great music which almost won the Academy Award for best picture. Chazelle helped his cause here by again employing Justin Hurwitz to write the score which probably saved the film from complete oblivion.<br/><br/>
Chazelle seeks to humanize his protagonist, astronaut Neil Armstrong, flatly played by Ryan Gosling. Unfortunately, attempting to turn Armstrong into a multi-dimensional character is a tall order indeed. The problem is that Armstrong was a very dry, unemotional individual, a character who doesn't lend himself to great drama.<br/><br/>
Chazelle suggests that the death of his two year old daughter in 1962 from a brain tumor drove him into a deep emotional shell which he never completely emerged. Chazelle repeatedly reminds us of the emotional toll Armstrong's daughter's death had on him throughout the film. Armstrong's first wife Janet (Claire Foy) ends up feeling beleaguered due to her husband's emotional distancing (one notable scene occurs when Janet orders a reluctant Armstrong to sit down with his two young sons and warn them that he may not be coming back from his moon mission).<br/><br/>
But aside from Armstrong's reticence to display much emotion and his wife's compulsion to push back at that, there is little discernible human conflict in First Man. This extends to the other characters Armstrong comes in contact with throughout the film who remain one-dimensional and underdeveloped. Had Chazelle's screenwriter, Josh Singer, been able to flesh out some of these characters more effectively, First Man probably wouldn't feel as slow moving, already hampered by its 141 minute running time.<br/><br/>
Chazelle on the other hand shines in the technical department. The early scenes of Armstrong as a test pilot are engaging and even better is how he shows just how flawed the space program was until finally perfected when the moon landing was accomplished. Particularly harrowing is the scene in which a flash fire kills three astronauts during a cockpit simulation for Apollo 1. There's also the early Gemini 8 mission in which Armstrong almost lost his life when he and his crew almost lose control of their malfunctioning spaceship.<br/><br/>
In the end, Chazelle can't avoid hagiography. With a better script, his aim of presenting the events leading up to the first lunar landing may have ended successfully."

","NASA plans to put a man on the moon by 1970 and Neil Armstrong ends up being mission commander and first man to stand on another celestial body. Well written and directed, the film manages to maintain a degree of tension despite the fact that there would be few people in the world who don't know how the story ends. Ryan Gosling is good as a steady, no-nonsense Armstrong and the fly-boy theatrics are kept at a minimum (in contrast to ""The Right Stuff' (1983) for example). The special effects are outstanding and the film avoids Hollywood's usual distain for the facts when fiction would be more entertaining. I was surprised at how much I had forgotten about the 'space race' that I grew up during, so despite knowing the final outcome, I found the film educational (in a good way) as well as entertaining and nostalgic."

","The director of this movie has obtained beautiful and stunning visual and audio effects.
He has also tried to involve the viewer into the NASA-s routine of excercises and techniques but in wanting to make it as realistic as possible he has overaccentuated the terms used in communication between the astronauts and engineers.
The historical importance of NASA-s first attempts, the small steps and big failures that made many people question if the NASA projects should have been continued and financed for those ""dreams"" to touch the space and set foot on the moon, have been caught superficially in this movie and thus losing an opportunity to grow the dynamics and dramaticity of the times when not only the ""dreamers"" were affected but also the normal people and the american taxpayers.<br/><br/>The main actor and hero of the movie has given his best to portray the role of Neil Armstrong who is very unaffective, cool and especially psychologically stable after losing his daughter due to a heavy tumor in a small age but it lacks the transmitting of those emotions; maybe because of the unsuitable mimicry of Ryan Gosling for such a role."
"jrarichards","8","0","0","17 August 2019"," Surprisingly ready to suggest that the mission WAS greater than the men
","While Damien Chazelle's ""First Man"" is definitely an interesting and even important film - as befits its ""anniversary"" status, it may not quite be the film most were expecting. This has its good and bad sides - good, because a straight telling of the true-life experience might have lacked depth and artistic merit (which the movie has); bad, because this presentation does not do ""First Man"" Neil Armstrong many favours, and appears to do ""second man"" ""Buzz"" Aldrin almost none at all!<br/><br/>As rendered here by Ryan Gosling, Armstrong is naturally and understandably overwhelmed by the death from cancer of his young daughter Karen, which is portrayed close to the start of the film (the very start features Armstrong in a semi-disastrous X-15 mission).<br/><br/>These two plot items are salutary in themselves, reminding us that cutting-edge high-tech of the late 60s (yes, I remember that quite well, kid though I was) was hardly good enough for space travel and not good enough to cure many (even most) diseases. And - as we are regularly reminded - it was far, far below the tech present today in one's mobile phone! The dialogue also comes back twice to the matter of the relatively limited interval in years that separated first aviation of any kind and travel to the moon. (We of course know, with some discomfort, that it was two awful wars which propelled that development along).<br/><br/>Anyway, what happens to Armstrong does not quite make him a bad husband to wife Janet (an entirely Americanised and 60s-ised Claire Foy) or a bad father to two remaining kids, but it does make him look sullen, moody, difficult and reticent - to the point where he rarely gives a straight or meaningful answer to any question, be this posed by family or NASA. As a result, Neil ""one small step"" Armstrong is muted as a hero. And, as noted above, Aldrin (in the hands of Corey Stoll) is made to look grasping and cruelly/crassly over-competitive, albeit transformed rather magically when finally on the July 1969 mission.<br/><br/>And so to the mission, which does gain effective presentation here, including with the various mishaps and problems that preceded it. Kennedy is shown telling us how we do this because it is hard, not easy ... and indeed it looks it. Above all, we are left convinced that these really were three guys sitting cramped up, cooped up, above a giant bomb. We do get more than a hint of the discomfort and the ever-present danger, and in this dimension almost as much is achieved as with ""Gravity"" - with the difference that here we are referring to real-life science and technology and engineering.<br/><br/>The ""Last Man"" on the moon was Eugene Cernan, and he was there just 3 and a half years after Armstrong and co., in December 1972. This bizarre reality is the backdrop to ""First Man"", and makes the work more thought-provoking than it even deserves to be. The technology of the late 1960s and early 1970s was indeed strained to its limits (one reason why conspiracy theorists doubt the veracity - though there is no hint of that in ""First Man"", thankfully); and hundreds of thousands of people made the amazing missions happen. The world gasped at them, while the astronauts doubtless breathed many a sigh of relief. Heroes they were, carrying the torch for many of us. But just part of a larger team, and - in this take at least - by no means the real-life ""supermen"" we thought they were. The movie is likewise less gung-ho than we might have imagined, and the pleasing soundtrack from Justin Hurwitz is mostly more thoughtful and delicate than triumphalist.<br/><br/>Such are the achievements of ""First Man"", and they have changed a little my perspective on an event of key significance in my life, given the landing coinciding with my 5th birthday. I'm grateful for that, and doff my cap to Chazelle and writer Josh Singer for it."
"asg_2012","9","0","0","16 August 2019"," A film about grief....and closer in spirit to Chazelle's others than you might think.
","I can understand why a certain proportion of the audience would be disappointed by First Man, depending on their expectations of what an Apollo 11 Moon Landing film 'should' be. However, casting those expectations aside and taking the movie at face value will surely result in being invested in Neil and Janet Armstrong's story.<br/><br/>There are definite thematic similarities between this and Chazelle's previous two fantastic movies (Whiplash, La La Land) in terms of the existential concerns and motivations of the characters. What do we want to achieve with our lives? Why? At what cost? Each of the three films speaks to anyone who feels a calling, a 'destiny' of sorts. That the background/experiences of Neil Armstrong is quite different to Andrew Neiman or Mia/Sebastian merely adds a different shade of empathy to the figure of Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>Something quite striking, and explored in a way that few space films have, is the sheer physicality of space travel. You feel the stress that this whole process put on the bodies of those involved. Meanwhile, the mental strain of outright life-threatening risk that the astronauts are taking, and the toll this takes on them and their families, underscores the entire film.<br/><br/>Never once does the relationship between Neil and Janet Armstrong step into melodrama or sentimentality; there is an understatement to both Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy that makes the relationship all the more believable. His inability to deal with his grief in any kind of healthy way is not uncommon; as he realises he can't outwardly express his emotions, his sadness is internalised in a touching, realistic presentation of grieving.<br/><br/>In my view, a committed film that is brilliantly made."

By contrast, a better example of how to shoot a space epic? Watch Interstellar. Linus Sandgren could learn a lot from superior Hoyte Van Hoytema.
The rest of the movie was fine & Claire Foy gave an outstanding performance as Janet Armstrong - just a shame it was captured within really ugly camera angles.

","Damien Chazelle has officially cemented himself as one of the greatest filmmakers working today and just like his last two masterworks First Man is guaranteed some Oscar buzz.<br/><br/>I personally wouldn't hold First Man to quite the same pedigree as Whiplash and La La Land but it is certainly a great film. Neil Armstrong's life makes for a very interesting story and Ryan Gosling plays him perfectly. Gosling's performance has lead to one of the films biggest criticisms and have to say I am inclined to agree with the majority of critics on this one, while I do think that Gosling's stoic and closed off performance if perfect for the character it does at points make it hard to connect with the film as the protagonist never fully revels their emotions in a meaningful way.<br/><br/>The first two acts as a result of Armstrong's stoicism can tend to drag at points. I give the film credit for committing to showcasing the real Armstrong instead of over-dramatising this very real person however it really does make it difficult to stay engaged with a handful of the more character driven moments.<br/><br/>The final act is absolutely incredible! Seeing this film in IMAX has officially been added to my bucket list. Chazelle knows how to make a shot feel remarkable and he manages to make it feel like you are really standing on and looking around the moon with the end of this film. I am curious as to whether or not the sequence on the moon is completely accurate, either way it is incredibly moving and helps to put the rest of the film in context. Having seen the end of this film the first two acts feel less of an issue and even become recontextualised to a extent.<br/><br/>First Man is a really great biopic telling a really great story. It's a solid base hit showing that Chazelle will be around for a long time to come."

","Those of you expecting the high octane All-American space cowboys as portrayed by the 'Mercury Seven' astronauts in 'The Right Stuff' (1983) will be slightly dismayed by the less jingoistic 'First Man' which wants us to believe that, amidst all the excitement and anticipation of landing on the moon, the astronauts of the Mercury and Apollo Programs were just regular rocket scientists who, after a day of being stuffed into flying rockets like sardines would come home to the regular suburban angst of 1960's middle America. While this in and of itself is fair comment, it does make for a less than exciting movie. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy do a tremendous job playing the iconic Armstrongs as more sobering, poignant and complex characters. (Gosling showing particular adeptness at not revealing any jarring Canadianisms. Whew!) The avoidance of the typical themes of American exceptionalism, frontierism and flag waving are refreshing and commendable enough but the movie focuses on Armstrong's inner psyche at the expense of much needed narrative, stronger supporting characters and special effects that are so unspectacular that one might even suspect that the conspiracy nuts are right - and this all could have been done on a sound stage. But it wasn't and that's reason alone to watch 'First Man'."
"databus","5","0","0","1 February 2019"," Even Imax Eye Candy Could Persuade Me To Purchase First Man To View It Again
","Let me begin by saying that I suffer from the challenge of comparing the actions and emotions of a historical film with my recollections of the actual events as they happened. For many years I have used two movies, Philip Kaufman's The Right Stuff and Ron Howard's Apollo 13, in conjunction to my memory of actual historical events as a yardstick to gage the merits of a new release such as First Man. Though I have not seen First Man in 4K, I did view the IMAX biographical movie based on the Neil Armstrong biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong, written by James R. Hansen. First Man tells the story of Neil Armstrong's career relating to his Apollo 11 flight, leading up to the astronaut representing humanity by being the first to step on the surface of the moon.
While many of the Saturn V launch sequences look spectacular in the large screen format, I find the drama of the story line falls short due to more to the emotional limitations of the screen play, rather than the actual acting acumen of the movie's cast.
<<< Warning spoiler alert, if you continue reading... >>> Where First Man fails, is its apparent attempt to recreate similar tensions portrayed in the movie The Right Stuff, by the original seven Mercury astronauts and test pilot Chuck Yeager (For example: between astronauts vs test pilots, physicians vs astronaut candidates, scientists vs politicians, press vs astronaut families, and even Russia vs USA) in a film that portrays a single space launch/event, like Apollo 13. Unfortunately, Apollo 13 is more a homage to the spirit of cooperation and innovation of engineers and astronauts the overcome the deadly spectre of a multiple systems failure following an explosion of a major component of the Lunar Spacecraft's service module. Apollo 13 does create its own set of tension that successfully propels the story line (integrating dissimilar, incompatible systems between the Command and Lunar modules to provide life support to the crew, the stresses experienced by the astronauts family in dealing with the press, neighbors, politicians, NASA policies, as well as the need for finding transparency to the truth by Armstrong's Wife vs shield his elderly mother from the life-threatening circumstances).
The Right Stuff also successfully incorporates elements of superstition and mysticism (Yeager's need for a stick of Beemans Gum before a flight and John Glen's glowing space gadgets seemingly in sync with the flying embers of an Australian bushman's bonfire). The film version of The Right Stuff uses the right combination of Hollywood embellishment and elements taken from Tom Wolfe's book to create an interesting perspective of key events in the US Space Program).
By contrast, we find only Tom Hanks can give us a balanced combination of acting and narration of the book, Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13 , authored by astronaut Jim Lovell and journalist Jeffrey Kluger.
Both Apollo 13 and The Right Stuff, succeed with great, memorable soundtracks that not only blend in with story line, but manage to elevate their respective film, a major element that seems sorely missing from First Man. Many critics consider the soundtrack of First Man to be great, but unlike Apollo 13 or The Right Stuff, no song from First Man lingers in the memory as do the tracks from the other two.
Let me throw two more exceptional biographical movies about flight that, in my opinion, pass muster. First, there is Jimmy Stewart's portrayal of Charles Lindberg's solo transatlantic flight in Billy Wilder's The Spirit of St. Louis, which happens to also have a memorable soundtrack. More recently, Klim Shipenko's Salyut-7 which shows us that America does not have a monopoly on giving us a sense of the challenges of pushing humanity and technology beyond the limits, as to create a crises which is rescued from disaster by a combination of piloting skill, engineering prowess, trust, and luck. Like the crew of Salyut - 7, the movie succeeds visually and dramatically in spite of relying on English subtitles to tell the dialog. And the film's great soundtrack needs no translation.
Of the five flight movies described in this review, only First Man is only on that I have no inclination to purchase or interest view more than once, hence the average five out of ten star rating."

","With a subject like the Cold War-era space program as a starting point, First Man has a lot of promise.

There's plenty of dramatic tension between characters, but it didn't seem to have the right mix of character, plot and emotion in the best places to put it over the top.<br/><br/>One big minus for me was the pacing. Despite paying close attention, my wife and I were asking one another who characters were, how they related to one another, etc. And since several years pass throughout the film, some characters change (e.g., a woman is pregnant in one scene, and isn't pregnant a few scenes later). This can be disorienting sometimes, and threw me out of the stories out of the story several times. This drops the rating significantly for me."
"brooklynheightsbro","6","0","0","23 January 2019"," I really wanted to like this film more than I did.
","The movie nicely portrays the bravery that it takes for astronauts to be strapped into flimsy looking space capsules while sitting atop a controlled explosion.
However, my main complaint is that I wasn't moved to care about any of the main characters in this film. Armstrong is portrayed as being emotionally distant. Why? Was it his upbringing? Was it the pressures associated with his job? What moved him to become an astronaut? Was he a patriot? Was he driven by ego? Was he trying to please his father? Who knows, the movie revealed very little about his character other than his bravery and determination to succeed.
Were the astronauts close to one another? The years spent working and training with fellow astronauts must have resulted in some close bonds of friendship. Again, the film doesn't reveal much in that area either. It's all about the business at hand.
On the positive side, the cinematography was outstanding. The spirit of the 60s was also portrayed well, as Russia and the US engaged in a struggle for dominance in space."

","First Man must of course be compared to Apollo 13, the best movie that has ever been done about the space program. Unlike that movie, there is no joy here whatsoever. Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a man forever haunted by the death of his little girl. As my wife noted, both he and his wife need grief counseling. There are some excellent set pieces such as the near disasters in the LEM trainer and Gemini 8 as well as the almost disastrous moon landing. But after this great achievement we are left with Neil Armstrong in quarantine, still with a flat affect, unable to even say hello to his wife.<br/><br/>Technically, the film effectively recreates the feeling of 1960s culture and the space program. But unlike Apollo 13, Mission Control looks pretty stripped down. The other astronauts, like Neil Armstrong himself, have no personality and are hardly identified. Those with even bit parts in Apollo 13 are clearly identified and memorable. The only exception is Neil's close friend Ed White who dies in the Apollo 1 fire."

Half of the movie is fuzzy and unsteady close-ups of the back of someone's head. Just because you have shot every scene from 15 angles doesn't mean you should use all the 15 angles in a 5 word conversation. What's the point of using talented actors when you completely nullify their flow of portraid emotions. The only scenes when the camera work and editing feels correct is when it's conveying the dangers of exploration and pushing the envelope.<br/><br/>The mission is thankfully almost perfect. There's some run of the mill swoshing sci-fi sounds but there's also real silence and more restful editing.

","Yes, another flight to the moon movie! But unlike all other true stories and science fiction before it, this film focuses on the life of Neil Armstrong giving a glimpse into the individual he was. This film is set apart because we now know more about him and his family including the deeper look into his wife, cheers to Claire Foy who gave a great performance. Knowing this new information, Armstrong was not the most spectacular person to get along with and his wife especially, must have been extremely patient and loving to put up with him.
The film gave more insight into the Gemini mission and what the astronauts had to withstand during their time in space. I thought the movie overdid the ""puke"" cam and at times I had to look away from the screen because I didn't feel well from the unsteady picture. Also, the film was overly slow in places. If the slowness was removed it would have shortened the film time a bit which would have been nice.
Overall, a nice insight into Armstrong and family. Glad I did not see in iMax or maybe I would have had to walk out due to the home movie unsteady nature of filming. Otherwise enjoyable!"

"Field78","7","0","0","26 October 2018"," My guilty pain of the year
","I don't know if it is an official term, but since ""a work of art beloved by the observer but disliked by the masses"" is called a ""guilty pleasure"", I propose the word ""guilty pain"" for the opposite: a movie praised by people in general, but perceived as overrated by me. First Man is an unfortunate example of this: I love biopics and movies about space exploration, and I went in with reasonable expectations (I think), but despite finding some positive elements in it, I already know it is not going to make my Best Of 2018 list.<br/><br/>I liked Damien Chazelle's previous movies, but I also think that all the Oscar-praise and IMDb Top 250 listings that were heaped upon them were way too much credit. Whiplash was a solid piece of breakthrough filmmaking, but it will be primarily remembered for the stellar role of J.K. Simmons and his interaction with Miles Teller, rather than a timeless piece of storytelling. Entire volumes and SNL sketches have been written about La La Land and how a group of its hardcore fans (let's call them Academy voters) made it one of the most successfully overhyped movies of all time. First Man is actually the film that makes me doubt Chazelle's status as wunderkind the most. Whiplash and La La Land, relatively overrated as they were, at least moved and entertained me, whereas First Man failed to actually engage me most of the time.<br/><br/>At its best, FM is a fascinating history lesson about a nation's decade-long ambition to reach the Moon, and the willingness of a group of men (and one man in particular) to risk their lives in pursuit of fullfilling this dream. The film accurately shows the bold choices and sacrifices that these men made, going into a project that succeeded with equal amounts of craftmanship and blind luck. It also shows the human folly of spending (or wasting) resources and human lives out of a desire to beat their competitors. The movie isn't afraid to suggest at times that personal ego was a significant factor in the drive of some of the men, and it takes care not to slavishly portray its protagonists as heroes or saints. As a documentary, FM would have done an accurate job.<br/><br/>However, as a drama, it falls short in several areas. One of them, sadly, is in the choice of its main subject. I have been told that the real Neil Armstrong was notoriously introverted, modest and media-shy, and the devestating loss of a child made him a tragic figure. Although Ryan Gosling accurately portrays him as such, this doesn't help from a storytelling point of view. We simply don't get to understand how this man thinks and why he does what he does. The way that he talks to his sons about the possibility of him not returning alive like he is giving a press conference suggests to me that he had real difficulties in connecting with people. As a consequence, the movie struggles to convey why his character would put himself and his family through such insecurities, given the absence of any noticeable enthusiasm in him. Some will undoubtedly say that this enigmatic man is a mystery best left intact, and part of the appeal of the movie, but I find that the film's inability to get under his skin seriously hampers my ability to identify with him.<br/><br/>My second point of contention is director Chazelle's confined view on the subject. His restraint in re-enacting the events as unsensational as possible is commendable in principle. Stories like this do not necessarily need emotional embellishments, endless character analyses or bombastic enhancements to strike a chord with the audience. Keeping the story focussed on its characters with subtle music is an artistic choice that could have worked. However, in this film, it mostly amounts to a dry presentation of facts that lack a subjective feeling to it. Chazelle keeps the camera locked tight on his actors and inside the shuttles most of the time, and rarely ventures outside that narrow view. Even in the tense scenes, we experience plenty of discomforts and fears of spaceflight, but hardly any of the marvel that I assume makes astronauts want to go into space in the first place. Movies like Apollo 13 and Everest also dealt with people who risk their lives, but it also showed or explained their motivations and euphoria that made you understand and sympathize with them. What I miss is the childlike sense of wonder that would suit a movie about space exploration, which is very strange for a movie that has Steven Spielberg credited as a producer.<br/><br/>The movie has assembled a fine cast, including Gosling, Jason Clarke and Claire Foy. Even the fact that some good actors (like CiarÃ¡n Hinds) have only very small parts isn't a problem. However, as stated above, I find it problematic that the film only incidentally succeeds in explaining what drives these characters. Certain scenes are even puzzling in their lack of purpose (like the final shot). It almost seems as if the makers tried to suggest more character depth by copious use of extreme close-ups, coupled with a constantly moving camera. I don't mind a few close-ups or a bit of shaky-cam at all, but when I start to notice it repeatedly (especially in quiet dialogue scenes) it becomes an annoying style trick. Some have praised the photography for its accurate 60s look, and I concur with that, but shaky-cam for the sake of shaky-cam kind of defeats its purpose.<br/><br/>In all fairness, every now and then, Chazelle succeeds in getting the message accross. Claire Foy gets away with some of the best scenes as the more emotional counterpart of Neil. The dramatic beginning bridges nicely with the cinematic finale; both are quite effective without becoming overly sentimental, and convey the emotional weight of the events, as well as give us some insight into the characters. But there is still a large chunk of a 141-minute movie getting close to boredom by failing to engage me in its narrative or characters. I hear Oscar buzz all around, and I am fine with any of the actors winning it. But not the picture, not the director, and certainly not the photography. The movie has the elements, but it lacks the passion for its subject."

And then came the announcement by John F Kennedy about putting a man on the Moon.

Claire Foy is perfect as ""Janet Armstrong."" But the movie fails elsewhere. There's no mention of Neil Armstrong participating in the Korean war as a fighter pilot. There's no mention of NACA, which was the predecessor to NASA. It also fails to show the Astronauts training and how hard it really is / was for them. And it did not show the backup crew for Apollo 11, which consisted of James Lovell, William Anders and Fred Haise training either. Lastly, though there was a small hint about the political pressure as to why send humans into Space, very little of it is really mentioned and it failed to explain why Armstrong was sent to ""The White House."" A lot of other aspects of the Apollo 11 Mission could have been explained but were not. It could have shown how close-knit Astronaut community was at that time. But it did not capture that. Lastly, having lived through the times when the Apollo missions were taking place, it felt like that Director almost failed to capture the euphoria that took place at the time.<br/><br/>Conclusion: It could have been a better movie.

I often wonder after seeing many Gosling performances where his real personality ends as he comes across as many of his characters. Often looking confused and a bit bland. He gives a decent performance but in my opinion nothing special.<br/><br/>Claire Foy on the other hand is the backbone of the picture. She gives an honest and convincing performance as Neil's wife, Janet juggling the domestic life whilst her husband is away wondering whether he will ever return.<br/><br/>There is a terrifically secure supporting cast with Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas and Ciaran Hinds giving typically strong performances although one wishes Stoll was used more effectively giving his important role.<br/><br/>Disappointingly Justin Hurwitz's score is a massive let down. I didn't care for it one bit and found it bland and conventional.<br/><br/>The cinematography was very effective. In a both positive and negative fashion. On one hand, the 60s tone is very well set whilst the colour hue, documentary realism and composition lead to a well shot picture. On the other hand the shaky cam for me was way to much and I am a massive fan of realistic up close, handheld camera compositions. This film had way to much, yes I know it was to create the realistic depiction and showcase the hectic chaos of the shuttle which would then be contrasted by the smooth framing of the moon itself but it was just too much for me.<br/><br/>Technically this is a incredibly crisp and well constructed film. Sound is used so effectively whilst production and costume design is incredibly authentic.<br/><br/>The silence when in use was used very well and was very effective compared to the at times chaotic audio.<br/><br/>The moon landing was stunning and a massive highlight but in my opinion I believe the film should've ended on the moon instead head back to earth clumsily.<br/><br/>Overall the film was decent and taught me a bit more about the Armstrong enigma along with the mission to the moon. A decent flick but one that perhaps has been over hyped with tales of Oscar worthy performances and blistering narrative structure. Definitely see the film if you are a Gosling, Foy and Armstrong fan or even if you're just a fan of space and the moon landing. A solid decent motion picture, nothing more, nothing less."

You cannot remember who they are and what they had done with Armstrong and this story line occupy 3/4 of the story in the movie.
The second story is the love story between Mr. and Mrs. Armstrong. There are issues between these two persons who they love each other. The director put a lot close up on Gosling and Foy to express the tension between them. However, the story did not give them the room to express or carry the story.

The star in this film is clearly the wife, unfortunately not our first man. <br/><br/>Film was cinematic and beautiful but not properly scored for the content."
"bosquetia2","7","0","0","17 October 2018"," No controversy here
","Spoiler alert unless you already know the story of the moon landing. I understand this is the biography of Neil Armstrong and not a documentary on the moon landing. There seems to be some controversy about the flag of the United States being shown. And it is correct that they do not show Neil planting the flag on the moon but there are plenty of references throughout the movie that clearly show this is an American achievement on behalf of all mankind. It's a good movie and the story is well told. I'm not a big fan of the many close-ups and the camera shaking all the time during action scenes. At two hours and 22 minutes it's a little long in my opinion. The personal side of the story is very moving. It will help if you know who is who before watching this. If you know the names of the other astronauts for example."

","The most daring Human adventure of all times would probably take much more than 2 hours and 20 minutes to cover all steps it took before the Giant Leap, but this is a movie, so they had to squeeze it in some standard format. Unfortunately, of all things happening on the Apollo 8, Hollywood is yet again taking precious minutes of the film to depict all the living hell that The Wife is going through. I'm not discussing how important (or completely not) her role was, I'm pointing out reason people call this film - boring. If all these scenes were used for actual science, action and fuss on the project, it would make it more interesting.
Still, this true movie is worth watching. Most of the people are taking Moon Landing for granted, when this was completely suicidal mission. And these brave men took risk to make it."

","Straight off the bat, it IS a good movie. It just left me wanting more, so much more. <br/><br/>The movie begins with a bang! You are thrown into the exciting and risky life of a test pilot, Neil Armstrong. It seems that the director had a very specific goal in mind. Make the audience feel as if they are riding alongside Armstrong and can sense the anxiety and stress in some of these situations. They did a great job helping you feel the adventure. The unfortunate problem with this; it never stops. The entire movie is made with a shakey camera to add to the thrill, and on top of that they film everything up close to the object and person. <br/><br/>Between the shakey camera and up close shots, you will find yourself trying to figure out what is happening in the shot. Again, on top of this, you find yourself in the seat along with the astronauts in almost all the exciting shots. This means that you will only enjoy space and the scenery through the tiny windows on board the Apollo and other conveyances. <br/><br/>The movie was well done. Great acting, great script, some amazing scenes, and decent storyline. For how HUGE this real life story is and all the amazing scenes that could have come from it, I feel it fell short of my expectations. The entire time the director wants us to feel the intensity inside the shuttle. This is great for some of the time, but while this is all happening, you are missing something wonderful. You are missing SPACE. This is the most amazing, beautiful, grand, mysterious place (or void) that we could ever discover. Yet, you will find yourself never truly getting to experience the joys and grandiosity of Armstrong's experiences, only the stressful moments. <br/><br/>There were multiple shuttle launches during this movie and you will only see part of one. The one I am referring to is great, but it still cuts in and out of shots so quickly, you will find yourself lost. Or like me, you may find yourself wondering if they did up close and shakey shots because its cheaper than doing a realistic CGI launch. By the end of the movie I felt like I have somehow missed out on space exploration, which is literally the point of the movie. The movie should have been called Neil Armstrong, it was far more about the person (which is fine) than it was about landing on the moon or being in space. <br/><br/>It is still worth a watch, easily. Just don't compare it to movies such as, "" Gravity"" or ""Interstellar"" which both do an AMAZING job explaining space and allowing you a way to slightly understand the insanely mysterious and deep vacuum that is space. After ""First Man,"" you will want to go home and search shuttle launches on youtube to fulfill an unsettled desire. Like going on a Grand Canyon tour, but you are only able to see it from within the canyon in a bus with a couple inch wide window and its hitting every bump in the trail and you are never allowed out.<br/><br/>""First Man"" launched with spectacular glory towards the stars with you along for this intense ride of a lifetime. Then it got stuck in orbit and never reached what I know of which it was capable."""

","I'm a huge space nerd and have created a space related business out of my passion. I also have thoroughly studied most major space missions and know most of the details of the Apollo 11 mission pretty well.
But I also was not born American, nor do I have an annoying patriotic streak in me or the need to justify every action by putting hashtags after every tweet.<br/><br/>Having said all that, this was bar none one of the best space movies I've seen in decades.<br/><br/>It is made with passion, detail, love and incredible focus on human condition as opposed to trying to make a political statement.
There are no attempts to put down one nation or another or to try to create an image of something that many Americans want to believe. No, this movie follows a man, the First Man, the man whose family life became a part of the story and it's a story that needed to be told.<br/><br/>Armstrong's sons from what I understand approved of everything the movie was trying to tell and were very proud of the image that was created of their father. And in all honesty, no one else's opinion on the matter really matters. The movie was about their dad, it was a biopic more so than anything else and it did an incredible job of delivering the emotions of a grieving father with a tough mission ahead.<br/><br/>I absolutely loved every moment and definitely thought that the portrayal of Buzz Aldrin was spot on as well. He's always been a controversial character (sued his own kids, what a great family) and honestly his miniscule role in the film was the right choice.<br/><br/>This is a must see for anyone into space, into human drama or anyone who enjoys watching an incredible journey of a man in pain.

Chazele's choice to only focus on the astronaut's-eye-view of the technology that permits these emotional reactions to work stress only limit tje.scope of the narrative at play. We've seen it all before, and it reduces this film to nothimg more than a series of cliched vignettes with only the repetition of grief as the centre of the story. Only towards tje end of tje film, with.the war in Vietnam making Americans question the huge expenditure of Apollo, merely to change one's perspective. By '69, many astronauts had sufferred marital breakdowns necaise.of.tje massive amount.of trainimg involved, including publicity events with the press, and goodwill trips to contractors putting all the equipmemt together.
 Before Armstrong.signed up to be an astronaut, nefore je was.even test piloting tje X-15 rocket pane imto.sub-orbital.space, Armstrong was a fighter pilot during the Korean.War. Early 1950's. Je !arried his wife after the war, whilst a student in university. What motivated her to marry Armstrong is anyone's guess..She knew he was.a pilot. She knew he was a war veteran, and she kmew as a test pilot, that Amstrong was in a dangerous profession. Amd yet, tje film portrays Armstrong as an emotional pressire cooker, only able to cope with the stress through stoicism, and inyense focus on the job.
 By tje time Apolo 11 launched, tjere were 40-odd astros.training for Apollo, amd post Apoo (SkyLab) missions. All of them were qualified to fly Armstrong's mission. Many did with Apollos 12 through 17. Neil Armstrong, BION, was not special.or.different than the otjer guys. Deke Slayton, Chief Astronaut, assigned crewz based on a rotation. If Apoo 11 couldn't do it, Pete Comrad on.Apo
o 12 would have been First Man, with.tje same.150,000 worlers back on.Earth supporting the mission. Ryan Gosling is not portraying a hero; just a very talented man.who.had the right education, and stayed alive long enough to.het a historic flight. But as the laumch abort.of Soyuz MS-10 tje day nefore First Man's wide release demonstrates, being 'first' in tje space business is hardly an achievement. Apollo 11 was quite literally a national.achievement. The guy who made it first, no different than a thousand other guys. The Flight of Apollo 11 has yet to be told."

","First Man is one of the reasons I am continually wary of biopics, and is virtually a metaphor for the all so detestable ""seven out of ten"" film. Being such a film, it lies in between the realms of acceptable and very good, thereby delivering a final product that demonstrates great potential, but fails to utilise it. This may be in part due to the drab and monotone performances of leads Gosling and Foy, presenting the viewer with a more diluted version of the all so refined Gosling we saw in Drive. First Man is undoubtedly a nuanced and competently crafted piece of filmmaking; but one that I fear will claim an undeserved academy award."

They tried to make Armstrong out to be an emotionally disturbed man, which, when considering the rigorous phycological testing and screening that all of these men were obligated to submit to, is completely absurd. Any man with even a hint of mental or emotional issues would never have come close to making the cut in the astronaut program. The director also seemed to have a political point to make by injecting even more irrelevant fluff about racism, poverty, and the rest of the same old tired, politically correct propaganda. I am not sure what his point is but it isn't merely political propaganda that he engages in. He twists the entire story to tell a tale that is conflated, confused, ubsurd and downright boring.

","Damien Chazelle is one of the greatest current directors, and this movie just reaffirms that. First Man was such an incredible emotional and visual experience, that I'm amazed at how they did it.
Chazelle is my favorite director, and when First Man didn't get to any theatres on my city I was so disappointed. This is a movie that NEEDS to be seen on a big screen. Neil Armstrong isn't a character I'm really interested in, but this movie changed the way I saw him completely. Many of the critiques this movie had was that it was kind of ""emotionless"", which I completely disagree in. Armstrong was such a reserved guy that this movie does a great job at studying his character and the way he sees and feel the world. The performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy we're moving but also they have a lot of depth that is unraveled once you analyze the film after it's done.
The way this film is shot and edited gives it such a realistic feel that moments after the film ends you start to release this feeling of tension carried throughout the whole movie. Some criticized that it is too ""shaky"" but that's an aspect I loved. I saw many interviews with Chazelle where he talks about the whole filming process and the way he interpreted the story is transmitted with the filming style. He wanted to create a documentary like film that showcased the life of Armstrong as well as the risks of the space race, and working with the DP he achieved it. The space launch sequences gave me an anxiety lever that I've never felt in a space movie before.
I truly could continue to talk about how great this movie is, but you just need to experience it in order to understand. I cannot wait to see what this incredible director does next."

","In 1961, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is a test pilot for the X-15 with nerves of steel. He manages to save the landing after some difficulties. Others dismiss him as simply an egghead engineer. He is severely private but he does break down over his daughter's death. Janet (Claire Foy) is his dutiful wife. He joins the Gemini program run by former astronaut Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) which would lead him to be the first man on the moon.<br/><br/>This is Damien Chazelle's first film without music as the subject. He is able to bring action to the space exploration. There are a couple of nice visceral close shaves. The Gemini uncontrolled spin is really thrilling. The marriage is interesting with two compelling actors. The over-riding feeling is a dry unemotional narrative. Most of that is due to the quiet reserve of Armstrong. He is not a man of emoting and the movie has to work within the constrains of his personality. The production is impeccable. The vibe doesn't have the emotional highs and lows that are necessarily for a truly intense film."

Chazelle's film never blasts off, maybe the script was at fault for focussing too much on Armstrong who looks impassive when he should be impassioned.<br/><br/>Claire Foy comes across better as his wife with the limited material she is given. The actor playing Buzz Aldrin looks all wrong.<br/><br/>It is such an uneven film with bouts of boredom along with jolts of some wonderful visuals."

","All the main events of the Gemini and Apollo programs are (or should be) well know. We know how the story unfolded. What we don't know is how it was ived by the people who made it happen. This movie shows us that.
Armstrong was apparently one of those close-mouthed types unable to show grief or other ""weak"" emotions. But it's OK to show elation at winning, in his case by succeeding at difficult and very dangerous tasks. Armstrong's daughter died of a brain tumour. Anyone who's lost a child can identify with his grief, and anyone who's lost someone close knows that grief strikes repeatedly and without warning. The movie is based on a bio by James Hansen. I don't know how true to life Hansen' book is, but the movie convinced me. It's an odd thing, that although the moon program happened in the 1960s, the NASA world was firmly stuck in the 1950s.
So the movie's a good psycho-sociological study of NASA and the men who had the right stuff. It's also a hymn to work. The core of the story is the work of getting to the moon, and the personal and community sacrifices that this task entailed. I recall watching the landing on a large TV screen in the dorm in which I was staying while taking a summer course. But I didn't recall much of that while watching this movie. It was all about Armstrong, the NASA team, the moon shot, and the families. The music was occasionally intrusive, and some scenes teetered on the edge of sentimentality. The launches were impressively noisy and jittery: the astronauts are flying on top of a slowly exploding bomb. A movie worth watching."

Instead he probably got carte blanche after the success of Whiplash and La La Land and got carried away with a self indulgent bore fest.<br/><br/>The problem with making a film you know how it ends is that whenever you try to create high suspense and tension the audience isn't really going with it because we know it's gonna be alright, as we know what's coming. And an even bigger problem is Chazelle spent way too much time on those scenes that were irrelevant to the overall story.<br/><br/>A perfect example is the same thing VALKYRIE suffered from, which is they made a movie about historical events but we all knew before seeing it what was going to happen (Hitler didn't get assassinated) so the filmmaker should have focused on a different approach, like James Cameron did with Titanic. There, it was a movie about a historical event, BUT Cameron didn't focus the story on that, instead he made it a love story torn apart by the event.<br/><br/>Amazingly we know Chazelle CAN make an exciting film, like WHIPLASH, but he let the world down with this.<br/><br/>There were really few other problems with it. Collins and Aldrin were totally made into insignificant characters. Like really insignificant. Then the ""first man"" should have been about the moon landing, but we only get about a few minutes of that.

"dogmaticdogs","8","3","10","13 October 2018"," Worth Seeing
","Ryan Gosling did a great job playing the stoic Neil Armstrong. Solid as a rock and never cracking under pressure. So many of our heroes seem to be absent from their family's lives, and Neil is portrayed as being no exception. A man that would give his life for his Country, but feels uncomfortable exhibiting emotion. I only wish the movie did a better job explaining what drove him to pursue this mission. To me that is the most fascinating piece of this puzzle. As usual, you give Ryan a person to imitate and he hits it dead on. The only thing missing from an Oscar winning performance was some psychological depth and darkness. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it. <br/><br/>By the way, I also have to give credit to his wife Claire Foye. She was able to brilliantly display her emotions without using words."
"Squirrel-5","8","3","10","13 October 2018"," The man behind the mission
","This undoubtedly the best space movie I've seen since Apollo 13.. and I've seen quite a number, as I've been interested in studying manned spaceflight for well over 33 years. I've listened to hundreds of hours of archival mission audio too.<br/><br/>I loved how it put a human face on the Apollo 11 mission and the life of Neil and his earlier missions. From his X-15 flights to Gemini VIII and Apollo 11 This is meant to be a biopic and not a film about the moon landing. The filmmakers took some liberties, but this is commonplace in Hollywood. <br/><br/>
The film as the title implies, is about the man, not the mission. This has led to some controversy, most notably (I'm speaking as an American here) over how the planting of the US flag was downplayed in the film, but Neil Armstrong's own family defended this, saying he would have approved since this was a human achievement, not solely an American one. The plaque left on the moon said ""We came in peace for ALL Mankind"" (emphasis added) <br/><br/>Half a million people from around the globe, including my grandfather, made this mission possible, from tracking stations in Australia, (we'd not have been able to watch in on TV without their help) to German rocket scientists secretly brought to the US after World War II. Neil was always a humble man an eschewed the limelight intensely in his later years, and you can tell that from the film.<br/><br/>I saw others complain abut the jump cuts and scenes that made people dizzy. I thought this made the film more authentic. I studied the Gemini VIII mission closely and knew much about the incident featured in the film. It is intense but made almost me feel like I was actually there. <br/><br/>
The musical score was incredible and had some tributes to many other films including the ""Blue Danube Waltz"" scene from 2001 A Space Odyssey. The inclusion of a theremin is perfect and gives it an ethereal spacey quality. The sound director did a great job at showing that sound cannot travel through space by having dead silence at parts.<br/><br/> The film has some obvious flaws but did a great job at telling the story from a perspective not seen before.<br/><br/>Go see it! From all I've read on Neil Armstrong, I learned a new thing or two about him."

They didn't overdo the character to appear more movie-y, nor did they understate the feel of involvement. <br/><br/>First Man manage to bring an immersive experience through its beautiful soundplay and well-written character<br/><br/>History is the story of people. And the director, Damien Chazelle has told this story with such intimacy that the audience do not feel distant.<br/><br/>First Man is not a movie about space exploration, or moon landing, no.

"TheFearmakers","1","3","11","4 January 2019"," The ""Flag Controversy"" Was Pre-Planned by the Filmmakers
","The fact there was no American flag planting seemed to have come from The Right, ever the villain, but it was actually a way of the filmmakers getting it out of the way before the film opened. Not that it helped, but audiences probably didn't understand why Left Wing Hollywood would want to make a movie about Neil Armstrong in the first place...<br/><br/>The entire concept made little to no sense to begin with... before the flag thing, and Ryan Gosling's quote about... whatever it is he said that strategically coincided with the other thing that gives Hollywood a chance to blame their scapegoat villains on this movie crashing... And it was strange (or not so strange actually) how quickly Gosling AND the Armstrong family had their defense all over the news: at almost the same exact time...<br/><br/>That aside, the film itself is a disaster. In trying to make the viewer feel they're ""spam in the can"" as stated in a great astronaut movie, The Right Stuff, there was simply no breathing room. Meanwhile, on the ground, the annoying shaky camera continued, but the acting was very cliche and performed, especially by Neil's annoying wife.<br/><br/>First Man was doomed to fail, and next time you see a movie that tells audiences ""This movie WILL fail,"" believe it or not, it's a ploy to work FOR the movie itself. When it does bomb, they can say, ""It wasn't as bad as we thought."" But in this case, like SOLO which took the same preemtive damage control approach, it was bad, and worse.<br/><br/>Funny thing... politics are usually involved. Lately, it's news that Holmes & Watson bombed. The media just adores that it did badly. But Vice, which made the same amount of money and didn't make the top five despite imdb promoting it to death, seems to have slipped under the radar. ""Nothing to look at... move along."""
"eden-rabatsch","8","3","11","14 October 2018"," First Man - traditional biopic with amazing last half hour
","So here is the problem, that's a bit negative, lets say issue. Chazelle has made two films: one is the biopic which runs for just under two hours and then one of the greatest half hours in the last decade as he blows through every stop sign, giving us the most cinematic moon landing thus rendered.<br/><br/>Gosling is very good as a really boring man: he has enough charisma to make that work which then allows Claire Foy to steal the entire film with every steely raise of her eyebrow. Her eyes must get paid extra as she does with one steely glance what the rest of the cast do in a three page monologue. The ensemble is nothing short of amazing with shoutouts to perennials like Kyle Chandler and Corey Stoll.<br/><br/>The structure is so throughline it is transported from the 50's. The pacing is glacial especially in the second act. Yet....yet every time Chazelle locks the viewer down in the most subjective astronaut scenes, the heart rate escalates. This is helped enormously by the score, especially sound editing - this is a righteously NOISY film, that puts you on top of a rocket with every sense.<br/><br/>The film is almost a love letter to a different type of America - a different type of heroic masculinity. One in which humility and expertise were admired and where a showboat might get you killed."
"CinePendejo","8","3","11","13 October 2018"," I mean, it aint't APOLLO 13, but it'll do
","I still can't believe I'm saying this, but Damien Chazelle did it again.<br/><br/>That's not to say I'll not one day get tired of his central thesis laid on his filmography at this point. The idea that nobody should ever criticize anyone's ambitions no matter how much of a physical/emotional toll it takes on them borders way too close to masochism. And while WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND stands as genuine classics in their own right, there's a waning sense that Chazelle takes his goals too much to heart, wishing that he'd take a breather for once.<br/><br/>So it's a refreshing change to see him showcase the bare basics of film craft with FIRST MAN, utilizing impressive special effects and cool 60s style stock lens without calling attention to itself. It pays a lot of detail to many of the mechanics of astrophysics, down to every strategic conversations and to each linger on rocket windows and altitude dials. You almost feel like you're there in the cockpit with the legendary astronaut yourself, experiencing both awe and panic at the same time.<br/><br/>At first I felt trouble with the characterization of Neil Armstrong. A emotionless stoic trying to risk his life to land on the moon in order to cope with the loss of his daughter but then inflicts damage upon other people in the process. It doesn't really gel at first since that's not how grief works and it sounds like yet another self-deprecating parable by Chazelle but it wraps up in unexpected ways. Once he finally lands on the moon does he realize how finite and small life on Earth really is, how the glory of human achievement regains the pride of a nation, and how that same achievement needs to make us more fulfilled and humble as human beings. It's fairly faint but the wonderful visuals accompany it perfectly. <br/><br/>There are some issues unaddressed, however. It does get repetitive at times and, while I do like how it gives Janet Armstrong and her family an agency, the movie does little for them other than ""make their scenes look like a Terrence Malick movie"". I also wanted some more comraderie, especially with co-pilot Buzz Aldrin. That would've been cool.<br/><br/>Aside from that, color me unsurprisingly satisfied. Ryan Gosling, Jason Clarke, Clair Foy, Kyle Chandler, and Corey Stoll did an amazing job with their performances, the filmmaking is top notch, and the overall concept of watching the moon landing on the big screen alone is worth it itself. <br/><br/>Houston, we have a winner."

What enables someone to go on a journey that may end in their own death?<br/><br/>This is not one for space nerds, though it's definitely the most realistic, human portrayals of space travel. The nationalist rhetoric is set aside not for political reasons, but for a different focus. In the greater scheme of things, we will remember the journey to the moon not as an American accomplishment, but as mankind's--and an individual's--step into the unknown. Here Armstrong is not portrayed as a jock, as many would like to imagine hi, but as the intensely private, potentially emotional recluse he showed himself to be during his lifetime due to nature and circumstance.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is beautiful.

","I just saw this movie tonight and it was enthralling. It really gives you, in addition to a great story, the sense of having been there with Neil Armstrong through the high-flying events of his life and the Apollo 11 mission to land on the moon. It's a really enjoyable movie. For reasons, quite invalid, there are a lot of people hating on it. People have been obsessing over the several scenes where there is shaking in the cockpit, which added verisimilitude cinematically. There is a line in another work - ""People are focusing more on what they do wrong than what they do right!"". Nothing was done wrong in this movie, and it was done right, but people are obsessing over certain things like - though the American flag is all over this movie, on the side of the Apollo 11 Saturn 5 Rocket, and 3 shots of it planted into the moon next to the lunar module, and dozens of people waving American flags - people are obsessing that the specific shot of it being put into the moon isn't in the movie. We all know how the flag got put in the moon! And the movie is elaborately explicit that this was an American mission. So, these peculiar, petty criticisms are irrational. It's the ""One giant leap for . . . "" moment we all are looking forward to. Why obsess over the flag planting, people? It's in the movie, anyhoo, right there. The movie really works well as an enjoyable, entertaining, exciting drama-biographic story of Neil Armstrong's path to going to the moon and his family/the people he worked with on the way at NASA. It's a great tribute to an American hero and also our nation's highest technological achievement. Go see it, if you like heroes or space or adventure, etc. Ignore the hate. This is a big movie, like Apollo 13 and deserves well to be seen on the big screen, where it is way way more fun, and I know my iPhone or tv would never do justice to the big scope of what you see here! : )"

","Damien Chazelle has created yet another masterpiece, only this time adding a new layer of emotional background and development to an otherwise well-known and reiterated story. I would like to try to be brief and avoid spoilers, therefore suffice it to say that, while yes, First Man is the story of a man, Neil Armstrong, and the way he made it to the moon over the previous years as well as the actual mission of Apollo 11, it is also a universal story that pretty much applies to all of mankind (to paraphrase his famous words).
A story that is universal in the way various perspectives are presented, in the way emotional (in)stability defines who you are, what you do, how you deal with your challenges, whether these are bringing up kids or actually landing a ship on the Moon. A story about grief, about expressing one's emotions, about shutting down and about healing and moving on.
At the end of the day, First Man is a point-of-view film. Even its camera angles highly emphasize this, escalating further and further as the film progresses, along with the emotional escalation that delivers jaw-dropping moments, both on Earth and in Space. Chazelle found a beautiful way to make technical aspects and choices a part of the narrative, that's not something you see every day. Can't wait for his next feature."

","This was an EXCELLENT film. Disclaimer: Not everyone will feel this way about the movie. This isn't a ""Hollywood"" movie about Neil Armstrong. This isn't Apollo 13, or even The Right Stuff. The director chose to make a film that puts the viewer there, watching the story and events unfold as they were. The cinematographer did a wonderful job of recreating the authentic look and feel of the 60's. Much of the film was shot almost ""home movie"" style adding to the experience. If you grew up in the time period, you will really appreciate this. If you were fascinated by the early space program, you will like this. If not, maybe not so much, as it's a little technical and plodding. Again, this is a film about the story and events, and about the man. You are watching the events happen. That being said, it did give some nice insight into Armstrong, and his family life, and some events that helped shape the man.

Then just 66 years after we learned to fly, we sent people on a nearly week long trip through space and a person walked on the moon. We did it six times. It was so difficult and costly we havent that we havent returned in almost 50 years. We've been doing this sort of thing since we walked on two legs. There were seas and continents to cross, mountains to climb, skies to travel and people like me think there is a Mars to visit and beyond.<br/><br/>Thats the spirit of this movie.

","I once hear a person say they would love to visit Australia, except that everything there could kill them. The same could be said for outer space. The only difference is Australia was meant as a joke.<br/><br/>This danger of space flight-and the fact that we, the audience, feel it so clearly-is just part of what makes First Man one of the best movies of 2018. Similar to The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 in content, but closer to Interstellar in tone and pacing, the film is a winning synthesis of top-notch acting and bold, skillful direction. In its weak points it echoes another Christopher Nolan film, Dunkirk, perhaps slowing its tempo and extending its silence a little too much. But like that film, these shortcomings make it different, and thus, memorable. Which, these days, is its own triumph.<br/><br/>Most of you know the story; many of you lived it. 1961 brings our first glimpse of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), testing a NASA plane as it climbs through the Earth's atmosphere into the lower reaches of space. Years pass. Friends are made, then-too often-lost at the hands of a crash or other malfunction.<br/><br/>First Man features three main flight sequences, and two of them are absolute nailbiters. The movie puts us at the visceral center of an era in which a handful of men volunteered to harness limited technology and primitive design to reach beyond the world they knew. They pushed the envelope of existence. We sense their fear, experience their heartbreak, and are left to wonder why they continue after enduring such sacrifice. But then, maybe we know the reasons.<br/><br/>Armstrong continues his rise through NASA as the decade progresses. The Gemini missions come and go, paving the way for Apollo. Soon the day nears when he'll begin a journey, and take a step, that no man ever has before. First Man accomplishes what every familiar, true story sets out to do: reveal to people the details they don't know and bring to life the headlines they do.<br/><br/>It all begins with simulating reality. To this end, director Damian Chazelle goes a step further than most by draping every shot in a grainy, time-period texture. From the Armstrongs' clapboard house to the sterilized halls of NASA, First Man is a movie about the 1960's that looks like it was filmed in the 1960's. This approach is effective and, next to the flash and gloss of most of today's releases, simply refreshing.<br/><br/>Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land), 33, has been called a wunderkind, and rightly so. But the label isn't so much due to his striking visuals or strong characters as it is his ability to make the audience feel. This is the hardest thing to do in movies. The right budget can buy brilliant special effects and pristine sound quality, but neither requires more than a surface response from those in the front row. How do you get them to care?<br/><br/>It helps to have an able cast. Gosling starred in La La Land, and it's fair to question whether inviting him back for First Man was more about comfort than quality. But it's difficult to imagine anyone else bringing more authenticity to the role. He imbues Armstrong with bravery, fear, anger, generosity-all the shades of a real human being. As his wife Janet, Clair Foy is equally strong in an equally meaty role. Their relationship is the beating heart of the film and just as compelling as every flight into space.<br/><br/>Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler and Cory Stoll lead a supporting crew so packed with talent that players like Shea Whigham, Ethan Embry and Brian d'Arcy James get mere seconds of screen time. Justin Hurwitz fills some of the void with a score that's separate parts tension, inspiration and emotion, but altogether original.<br/><br/>First Man spends just as much time on Earth as it does in space. It never forgets that any ship, no matter how fast, still needs a pilot. For all the miles it covers, the movie is a human story. That may well be its greatest achievement."

"Vivkon","10","2","6","17 October 2018"," Progress is not Linear
","Progress is not linear - this simple idea is represented in the movie First Man skillfully directed by Damien Chazelle. Everyone can find evidence of this thesis ""Progress is not linear"" in his/her own life - losing weight, growing children, stock value changes on the market, learning, extending the rights and other examples. The plot of this movie refers to several outstanding historical events in the 20th century, which were brought great hope for discoveries in space and traveling throughout the Galaxies. Unfortunately, this hope didn't become a regular practice in the beginning of the 21st century. Also, among the 12 US citizens who landed on the Moon, no women were there. Meanwhile, three things make this movie outstanding and create its own chapter in cinematic history. First, the movie articulates the exceptional achievements of the American nation. Second, it emphases the drama of astronauts' wives who struggled with their grief, fears and worries of their husbands' professional risks. Third, ""First man"" inspires a new generation around the world to keep learning Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) and believe in their own accomplishments. Technically, the movie doesn't have typical Sci-Fi or Marvel's Adventure visual effects or any elements making the characters courageous and heroic, although Hollywood stories are full of this when they shoot space stories. The film looks like a feature documentary with relatively simple camera shooting of main sets and scenes. In ""First Man"" the idea of ""simplicity is genius"" becomes apparent. Additionally, the musical score lifts the emotions more powerfully, than any visual effects. This movie is a personal success for those people who were involved in its creation."

He was understated, but conveyed the inner thoughts of Armstrong, which is no mean feat. The ending was a downer however, which is why I can't give this film 10 stars. I know the Neil and Jan Armstrong eventually divorced, but it was after 38 years of marriage. I really think she might have been a little happier to see him when he returned. In fact, seeing documentary footage, it's clear she was. I really think that ending, prevented the film from being more popular."

","Having just seen First Man, someone will be left full of spectacular images, eerie lunar panoramas, pompous music, but damn if it came to the slightest conclusion as to who truly was the man who stayed in history because he took that ""small step"".<br/><br/><br/><br/>Director Damien Sazel, claims to base the script on Armstrong's homonymous official biography. Obviously we have read different books, because in my copy there is another person who almost never appears on the screen. And for that Ryan Gosling is not responsible for delivering a flat acting, just as he was asked.<br/><br/>Yes, I admit I am a man who is almost obsessed with space programs, having read countless books and articles on the subject. And of course, such a film is aimed at the general public and not to 'geeks' like us where we count the buttons on the cockpit or we notice that in Gemini the space suit was actually the G4C but not the helmet. To finish with the technicalities, the space race was such a fascinating but also so well-documented effort, that you don't have to build emotion by putting astronauts to shout, brawl or invent crises where they didn't exist and shake your camera just an inch from their faces. Is it Hollywood, not a documentary, will anyone say? Ron Howard with Apollo 13 made an epic and fun movie, staying 100% close to reality. So, if you want, it can be done. Chasel didn't want to.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Armstrong's portrayal is of a cryptic character, completely given to his work that treats even his family in a clinical way. We understand that he lost his daughter to cancer and that makes him even more distant. Of course, in the movie, his daughter is closer to four so he can tell him heart-breaking things, while in fact she wasn't even two when she died. His wife is constantly angry and before the flight to the moon, she is furiously forcing him, to explain to his children that he may not return. Another lie. When you were a pilot's wife those things was discussed ten years ago. To fly experimental jet fighters in the 50s was infinitely more dangerous. At some point he is ejected by a lunar module simulator. With half his face scratched he returns home agitated to quarrel with his wife. In fact, he just bit his tongue on the landing and an hour later he was in his office, working. In the mission to the moon, in every word that comes out of his mouth, he sounds like he is a robot. In the original recordings, we hear a man who is humorous and cool and shows restrained enthusiasm. All those who worked with him described a hard working, kind, giving and very modest man."

","When a film is not engaging me, I try to look for elements that I can underscore in order to find something of interest, or something I can highlight.
For this film, I had a very hard time doing that, because I felt it offered very little. The story, while a good one, felt dragged out a bit. The acting was lacklustre. I like Ryan Gosling but he was expressionless throughout the whole film. I couldn't capture any sort of emotion through his performance. And since we get to experience everything through his eyes as he is the sole focus, it completely diminishes the film in regards to its overall quality, its narrative, its pace and its emotional impact on the viewers, which it's real close to being none.<br/><br/>The pace is too slow and unefficient, enough to make spectators repeatedly look at their watches, and so are the performances. They don't help at all. I'm sure we've all seen slow-paced films before but with such grand performances that could obviate that sense of tediousness.
I still think that La La Land is Chazelle's worst film, but First Man is second to that. He just wasn't able to recreate the success and unanimous praise he found with Whiplash.<br/><br/>If I'm giving this a 6 rating, it's because of its technical aspects, which to me is the only part of this film that truly stands out."

","Armstrong was simply not an interesting guy. Focussing an entire movie around his character WILL cause A problem:boredom. If one were to TRY to make such an introvert, flat character like Armstrong interesting one would need a much more subtle actor AND a more interesting screenplay. First Man is basically Gosling trying to do his thing, resulting in nothing much more than a barely acceptable (wooden) acting performance. Barely acceptable...<br/><br/>It looks reasonably pretty, but not in such a way that I would advice anyone to go see it. I constantly was reminded of seeing ""Gravity"", when I watched this movie. Because ""Gravity"" truly was IMPRESSIVE to look at, while this movie simply seems to piggyback on those same impressive space photography looks and failing at it. Trying to copy someone else's brilliant photography style often merely results in disappointment. Even the music score reminded me in parts of the same score in ""Gravity"".

It is too bad that the movie was made by people that are too young to understand and convey the times, the emotions or the reasons that the United States embarked on the space program with the goal of sending, landing and returning men to the moon and back.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is almost adequate in the role of Neil Armstrong. Unfortunately, the script is written to make Neil look like a moody, humorless soul who for years is on the brink of clinical depression. This was NOT an accurate portrayal of the real Neil Armstrong. He was a brilliant, brave, conservative, soft-spoken man with humility, wit and charm. His many interviews were usually filled with smiles and optimism but that is not the way he is portrayed in First Man.<br/><br/>The visual effects are generally good but they don't make up for a poor script that denies any sense of patriotism and the importance of the Apollo program in the Cold War with the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>The sound is very uneven in clarity and levels. Much of the music - especially during the lunar landing - is loud, awkward and unnecessary.<br/><br/>In all, not a very good film made by pretentious people who think they know how to tell a story.

"Abranth-d","9","1","2","19 July 2019"," Slow as a snail and yet wins the race somehow
","Here's my review of First man. So 'First man' is directed by Damien Chazelle known for Whiplash and La La land and I loved whiplash which made me look forward to this movie. The movie is a biopic of Neil Armstrong and before watching this I knew very little about him . Cause every other person whose biopic has been made is either a musicisan , an actor or a politician who had eccentric personalities of their own from Howard Hughes to Steve Jobs to Tommy Wiseau. Now Ryan gosling was great as Neil Armstrong and that's how I will remember him from now on. Claire foy as Janet Armstrong was really good too. This movie is a drama more than anything , it's not about mankinds first step , it's not about creating history , it's just about Neil Armstrong . This is a gorgeous , beautiful , amazing ( I've run out of synonymns for good looking ) movie. But despite that it's phasing is very slow , like super slow ! But there are some very intense as well as claustrophobic scenes and the only way to do them well was to do them slow. This movie is shot on film , so even while watching it on imax it has grains on it making it look like how it would be if the current era shot old movies. I thought that was pretty cool. Remember how in the dark Knight rises you couldn't understand a word out of Bane's mouth cause he was wearing a muzzle. In this movie there's a lot of stuff you can't hear over the scattered comms but that didn't really matter cause I wouldn't have understood the rocket science stuff anyway. There are also some scenes where a whole event is shown , like remember how in breaking bad season 2 they would show a whole breakfast table routine right from cutting the egg , adding pepper and eating it without cuts and we went along with it till we got to season 3 ? Well you have to sit through those scenes just like that to get to the good parts in this movie. There are some scenes where it's brilliant acting but no music to top it up . Like honestly I don't think I would've cried to musafa dying in lion king if it wasn't for the music. I don't understand why people only call movies set in the medieval era as epic cause I feel that anything inspiring is an epic and that's why First man is an Epic . In the end it was a great movie with phasing flaws and a lack of an emotional drive unlike whiplash and you'll have a great time unless you're Russian . I don't usually type this much but I felt if I hadn't people would have concluded this as a good / bad movie. But if you did read this much . Thank you . Much appreciated."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","2 June 2019"," Slow, responsible, and balanced but produces quite the emotional aspect too
","First Man is not the film for air-punching relief at the end of tense scenes of danger which have been preceded by tender scenes making us care about the people in those moments; this is not to say that on this basis alone that it is a better film than those that do these things, but it is certainly different. There is an emotional core to the film but mostly it is deliberately distant, cold, and balanced. The Armstrong of the film is all these things, and the film follows him in that way. There are no big moments to speak of - even the moon walk is reflective and silent.<br/><br/>This produces a film that engages by how consistent it is, and the feeling of accuracy and observation. It runs long but if you get the feel/pace early on then it doesn't feel it. Instead it offers more character in Armstrong, as hard as it is at times to like him, it is engaging for how he is. The downside of this approach is that the film can be boring if you aren't going with it or if you wanted it to be more like Apollo 13. While at times I wanted it to have at least some scenes like that, it worked well without them, and the impact of the opening scenes ripples through the final ones because of how restrained it all is.<br/><br/>Chazelle's direction gets this tone right, and produces a convincing performance from Gosling. It is an odd one because it seems so featureless but yet there is a lot there. He is well supported by a host of recognizable but not too recognizable faces, but it is Claire Foy who gives the film its heart, and pulls off the difficult job of having the human, emotional moments but yet not making them feel like they are breaking out into a different film.<br/><br/>First Man is slow and deliberate, but it works for what it sets out to do, and plays like a responsible, balanced, and even-handed bopic which manages to have more of an emotional impact due to how little of it is worn on the sleeve or shouted over the orchestra."

Shows incredibly well the development of the NASA space program, the dangers involved, the sacrifices made, the narrow margin for error and the courage and determination involved.<br/><br/>The space flight scenes are incredibly realistic, often putting you in Armstrong's shoes. Even though you know how it is going to end, you're still on the edge of your seat throughout these scenes. Very nerve-wracking, gritty and engaging.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Chazelle can't replicate this engagement in the Earth-bound scenes, especially the scenes showing Armstrong's home life. The domestic stuff is pretty dull. Some of this is deliberate. Chazelle wants to show Armstrong as cold and calculating and show how this is a positive and negative: what makes him a great astronaut makes him less perfect as a husband and father. It's also a counter-point to the sheer adrenaline rush that is his job.<br/><br/>However, the domestic stuff never leads to any great profundity and ultimately is largely filler.

","I now laugh when I reread some of the negative reviews - to summarize: it made me have motion sickness so I left, didn't develop the orher characters enough, too somber and brooding, didn't cover all of the events of Niel Armstrongs career, etc. Well, most of these individuals missed the point of the movie or don't understand this genre of storytelling. It is a first person account basically told through the eyes of the first person to walk on the moon. I found this refreshing and not your typical Hollywood approach of trying to fit too much, too thinly for such an epic sweeping story that covers decades and dozen of key figures. It could have been 3-3.5 hours long. Yes, it could have been a TV mini-series or two (or more) movies. I love that it was told through the eyes of one central figure. Told through the eyes of the man that all of the accumulated effort of thousands of people and billions of dollars spent to accomplish one goal before the Soviets and for humankind - having a human step foot on the moon for the first time. I cannot remember a cinematic experience that got me as close to experiencing what it was truly like to be there first hand, in the drivers seat if you will, or better put, insabely strapped into a coffin fixed atop a massive liquid fuel explosion. How any person would be brave enough to face this, be able to perform well while in the thick of it and want to do it again and again is beyond words (or sanity). With death and fear all around no wonder there was a dark cloud hanging over everyone. I am sure all of us have marvelled at what has been accomplished by the NASA space missions especially Apollo. The movie Apollo 13 was a very good story that I thought put me as close to being an Astronaut as i could get. I was wrong. So, go and see First Man. Go and let yourself become THE astronaut. THE first human that was there at the very top of a giant pyramid of people because many before had made the ultimate sacrifice to make possible one giant leap for mankind. i will never look at another manned space vehicle, past or present, or astronaut again the same way,"

First of all, we are immediately made to believe that the death of Armstong's daughter has something to do with the space program. I agree, it shows a human side of him, but to make it central to his desires and ambitions is pretty simplistic. That is forgivable, but what is lacking is a taut story that really grabs us. This is the space race. Yes, I know that many Americans wanted the money to go elsewhere. At some point, however, all thos issues are tossed aside. This could have been really well done with some better writing. I also had some trouble with Gosling playing Neil Armstrong.."
"classicsoncall","8","1","2","22 March 2019"," ""It'll be an adventure."" - Janet Armstrong to husband Neil Armstrong
","I had stayed away from this film due to the pre-release controversy over the omission of the American flag planting on the moon. The hint of a political agenda in movies like this are a downer for me, so it made me hesitant about watching the picture. Perhaps the controversy was overblown somewhat, although that aspect of the moon landing was important and if I had my way it would have been included. The thing is, while you're watching the landing unfold, it's not something you particularly miss, especially if you weren't around back in 1969, and aren't aware of the details of that first moon landing. And there are scenes in which the American flag is prominent, along with a French woman, I believe, interviewed after the fact, that praises and thanks America for accomplishing such an historic mission. So I appreciated that.<br/><br/>Historically, the film appears to capture the real angst about American space flight relative to it's cost in money and lives, and the personal toll it took on members of the NASA family during numerous test phases getting ready for Apollo 11. Without knowing about any of the personal details of men like Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, Mike Collins, or Ed White, the story unfolds credibly in a well represented chronology. I was rather incredulous however when Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) let Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) know he was selected to command the Apollo 11 mission in a bathroom.<br/><br/>Visually, the flight scenes and moon landing are noteworthy, and deserving of the Visual Effects Oscar the picture earned. On the flip side, that moon landing scene does exhibit the kind of realism that allows skeptics to say the whole thing was staged. I really can't get over how dense some people can be. Same thing with the Twin Towers conspiracy folks, but save that for another day. So all in all, the film, based on a remarkably true story, deserves a worthwhile viewing, even if the omission of the American flag on the moon is not based on a true story."

This film is so totally different I was completely stunned. It's an amazing achievement in all ways, understated, dirty, emotional, scary, brutal, even horrific. Captures what space travel must have been, and how absolutely mad it was to attempt it. Chazelle pulls off something unusual and delicate in among the mess of men playing astronauts, men doing really horrible, filthy, hard work because they believe in mankind, and the women who support them just as tough and adventurous rather than just mommies at home. I want to watch it again - terrifying beginning!"

","First Man doesn't do anything bad, but it takes few risks and feels like an overlong, by-the-numbers slog far more than it should. Chazelle employs slow takes and lots of close up, shaky shots to help put us in the mindset of an astronaut, but I don't think he succeeded in having the audience feel the tension and uncertainty. The launch scenes felt more simple and drawn out than tension raising, and didn't grip me at any point. The visuals, cinematography, and sound were all very good, Gosling was effective if very reserved, and Foy was great and got robbed of a supporting actress nomination. I would contrast First Man with Gravity and The Martian, which combine to form better versions of the elements First Man shoots for; Gravity in the impeccable space shot designs and visual effects, and The Martian in NASA mission proceedings. First Man didn't develop the personal connection either movie did, as while we respect Neil we are never closer than an arm's length to him. It's also much longer, slower moving, and outcomes are rarely ever in doubt and never culminate in exciting climactic sequences. I think the second half was better than the first, and it had some very good individual scenes (especially when Janet gets Neil to talk to the kids), but it felt much too predictable and free of intrigue to be enjoyable, whereas Gravity maintained uncertainty and tension throughout, and The Martian did it despite the outcome being obvious as it was in First Man. I remember watching the trailer months ago and feeling like it was the safest bet of 2018 - Chazelle only makes great movies, Gosling is very good, and it's an interesting topic. Like Vice, it ends up as a 6 star disappointment not because it's bad, but because it has so much potential that it has no business being as forgettable and mediocre as it is."

But after watching the First man, I must admit that I am pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>This film reveals us the making of the man Neil Armstrong. What it takes to be the first man to walk on moon? How much preparation and sacrifice goes in making history? Also what happens to the family members of such historical figures? This film is touches all these aspects.

","Thanks to extraordinary direction by Damien Chazelle and a series of strong performances, this dramatized version of the events leading up to Apollo 11's televised moon landing in 1969 manages to overcome some stiff dialogue and an inaccessible lead character. It's admirable that Chazelle makes an attempt to build a three-dimensional on-screen character for astronaut Neil Armstrong, who was the first person to walk on the moon, but it's a shame that Armstrong's extraordinary real-life accomplishments are far more interesting than he is as a character. Muted, self-centered and uncommunicative, he's not exactly a spark of life, and Ryan Gosling's understated performance doesn't manage to communicate much depth. Instead, it's up to a star-studded supporting cast to do the majority of the heavy lifting, in particular Claire Foy as his long-suffering wife, and an underused Patrick Fugit, who manages to make a strong impression despite limited dialogue and screentime. In the end the movie is a success thanks to Chazelle's confident and fluid direction, not to mention a memorable score by Justin Hurwitz, but it's held back from greatness by its cipher of a central character."

","This movie would have you believe Neil Armstrong never had a day of fun in his life. Sure, he may have been a quite and reserved man in real life, but this movie makes him out to be some brooding antisocial manic depressive. He's literally one step away from applying black nail polish, and listening to the Cure alone in his bedroom.<br/><br/>The effects are great, and really give the impression of what it must have been like on the moon. Other than that, you're better off watching 'Apollo 13' or 'The Right Stuff'. At least those movies don't treat space travel as a strictly somber affair."

","Interesting movie, perfect from a technical and aesthetical standpoint. Chazelle finally gives us new shots compared to the ones we have seen in the last 40 years about rockets and ships. The movie is good in the fact it chooses to tell more about a grief than a moon landing. Is good in that many things are told in a different way, such as the risks the astronauts were facing, the first-person shots, the cuts eliminating many obvious, well-known sequences. The ending is very good, and well-executed. The music is a masterpiece, one of the best themes ever heard, epic and tragic at the same time.<br/><br/>But, we all know how it went, and all these new takes and angles can't overcome it.

"bbretall-1","5","1","2","28 January 2019"," A dramatic slog
","Damien Chazelle managed to make the story of Neil Armstrong's moon mission boring. Unless you are curious about how to make a story of a great human achievement into a plodding, depressing 2:20 dramatic slog don't waste your time on this film.
It was a biopic that made Armstrong and his wife (played by Ryan Gosling & Claire Foy) appear to be a joyless automatons. The film focused on negative aspects of their lives and paint them as deeply troubled by the death of their young daughter in the first scenes of the film, an event which plagues then throughout the rest of the years chronicled in the film (1961-1969).
Armstrong is highly competent, but seems to have no happiness or joy even when achieving great things. Foy's portrayal of Janet Armstrong is wooden except when she's expressing negative emotion in the direction of her husband. Both are good actors, I can only imagine they are playing the characters as instructed by Chazelle, who focuses screen time on death, funerals, anti-NASA protests, and primarily negative aspects of the whole process of getting man to the moon.
It was tough, but wow, someone must have cracked a smile at some point during the 8 years chronicled in the film.
On top of this, they paint Buzz Aldrin as a jerk, which seems unfair and is not supported by any accounts I have ever seen of the man. Some of the only emotion we see from Gosling's Armstrong is when he's basically telling Aldrin to shut up after he makes some ultra insensitive remark.
Read an op-Ed on Space.com op-ed by someone who knew Neil (John Logsden).... He hits several of the same points that I felt about the movie which just seemed ""wrong"" in watching it.
A key quote:
""Here is how he (Frank Borman, commander of the Apollo 8 mission) described Neil Armstrong: ""Quiet, perceptive, thoroughly decent man . . . A little reserved, but when (you) get to know him, he has a very warm personality."" The key phrase there, to me, is ""get to know him."" This is the Armstrong I came to know. It's a shame viewers of the film won't get that chance. I worry that in the years to come many will remember the film's unflattering characterization of Neil Armstrong rather than the warm, engaging person he in reality was."""
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","2","26 January 2019"," Another dull biopic.
","Biopics are either a hit or a miss, occasionally being something fresh and new, while most of the time being a regurgitation of history. Damien Chazelle's (Whiplash, La La Land) First Man sadly fails to be something new, instead falling in line with other Hollywood true stories about an important historical figure.<br/><br/>Joining the same group as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr. Gandhi, Julia Child, and Steve Jobs, Neill Armstrong was naturally next in line for Hollywood to present his story. In what seems like too obvious and cliche of a title, First Man has its visually stunning moments, most notably when we actually get to see the moon, but drags out and is painfully dull throughout.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling gives a very underwhelming performance as Neill Armstrong, the astronaut himself. Armstrong, portrayed as a quiet, soft-spoken and determined man of science, isn't depicted in any interesting or engaging fashion, which could be due to Gosling's boring, nuance-less portrayal. Gosling simply doesn't have the charisma and talent to bring a historical figure to the screen. In his best performance in Drive, he barely speaks, yet is captivating throughout due to the reserved, mysterious character he portrays. In Blue Valentine, he shines as he falls apart from his wife due to his rich emotional and honest sketch of lost loved. With Neil Armstrong, he doesn't show any different or unexpected sides of the famous figure, instead revealing him to be what we already know him as- a really good astronaut.<br/><br/>First Man tries hard to be about more than just Neil Armstrong landing on the moon, but the harsh reality is the only intriguing scene is when we actually see Armstrong and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin land in the moon. The film tries to generate emotional appeal (largely relying on Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife) by revealing the struggle Armstrong's dangerous mission had on his family, yet the emotion and drama simply isn't there. The death of him and his wife Janet's daughter doesn't sink in or have a strong enough effect on the audience to make us feel for Armstrong's personal struggle. The minor dramatic tones are simply there to distract us from thinking the film is all about the moon landing.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle does a fine job making First Man visually appealing, the scene on the moon that is ever so brief is stunning, the musical score by Justin Hurwitz soothing, the production deisgn and cienmtogprhjy eye-catching at times. But what he fails to do is tell an interesting story that is foreign to us. First Man takes us into the personal life of Neil Armstrong, but it isn't compelling enough to make a movie out of."
"cruise01","8","1","2","24 January 2019"," An emotional journey with a stunning direction.
","First Man (4 out of 5 stars).<br/><br/>First Man delivers a spectacular journey through Neil Armstrong and the emotional journey that was driving him on heading to the moon. The direction really focused on Neil's perspective like when he was flying a rocket plane through the atmosphere. You did not see any other camera angle except the perspective on what he sees. Which is not much but from the cockpit windows. It did created a little claustrophobic and intense feeling. Ryan Gosling delivered an outstanding performance. Along with Claire Foy playing Janet, his wife. Damien Chazelle did deliver an emotional powerful direction.<br/><br/>The plot really dived into the emotional journey with Neil Armstrong, NASA test pilot. He was trying to be supportive to his sick daughter. Throughout the film, he was still trying to coop and grief for his daughter. He was always driven to be on the flight of Gemini 8. After a failed travel into space. NASA was in a hurry to reach the moon with the space race against the Russians. All leading up to Apollo 11 with Neil and two others reaching the moon.<br/><br/>The plot tried to keep itself into the emotional journey of Neil and dealing with family loss. The moment he walked on the moon and looking beyond the crater with tears running down his eyes. It was a powerful scene. It was not just about man first landing on the moon. It was the accomplishment and the struggle these characters did to get there.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy delivered a powerful performance. The direction from Damien Chazelle was great. He made some scenes feeling a little claustrophobic when Neil was in the cockpit. You would only see what he sees. You would not get the full view of space or of the planet but only a glimpse of the planet with shaky cameras to be realistic. Or dizzying space craft spins. The climatic scene with Apollo 11 landing on the moon. It was well shot. The music score Justin Hurwitz was fantastic. The scene of walking on the moon was beautifully done.<br/><br/>The film does have some long stretches of scenes with nothing going on or being slow moving. Otherwise, First Man is a good film. The visual effects and direction was great. The performances were good. And the plot delivered an emotional journey of Neil Armstrong."

","Spoiler warning.<br/><br/>I get what the director was going for here. A personal account of Neil Armstrong's perspective. But, this event was the first men on the moon. It deserved a much grander and exciting telling.<br/><br/>The movie made it seem like Neil was a very boring guy. I would have preferred to see him portrayed as unflappable.<br/><br/>There was almost no humor in the film. It would have been better to have more different emotional moments.<br/><br/>Music was sparse and often ineffective.<br/><br/>Very few external shots of the spaceships, etc. As noted they wanted to make this about Neil's perspective, but really? The greatest engineering achievement and adventure of all time and almost all is spent in a cramped, dark, capsule. Wasted opportunity. You need to see and feel the scale of this to appreciate what it was like to be in the capsule and that wasn't done at all. I wanted to see this movie on the big screen. But timing and poor reviews kept me from making it happen. I just watched it on TV and I'm not upset I missed it on the big screen because there weren't many big spectacle shots.<br/><br/>The best part of the movie was by far Gemini 8. It was tense and exciting, but still have been done better. Landing on the moon was just okay, when it should have been mind blowing. Being a space nerd I've read the accounts and seen other portrayals and it should have been portrayed as much more exciting and momentous than it was."
"itsbobr","7","1","2","23 January 2019"," A Very Somber Movie
","This is a true story<br/><br/>Astronaut Neil Armstrong's (Ryan Gosling) journey to become the first man to walk on the Moon is a very somber journey. I say this because the death of his young daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford) played heavily on his mind in everything he did. This is my take on the movie.<br/><br/>One would think that going to the Moon, there would be cause for celebration with excitement reigning every where. The Space Program has had its problems and setbacks. Many brave Astronauts died in the exercises practicing to go to the Moon. Armstrong did say something like: it's better that we fail down here and not up there.<br/><br/>Think about it. Going to the Moon is like achieving another Wonder of the World. This movie had Ryan Gosling play a very somber, quiet role because that was the way Neil Armstrong was and I still maintain that his daughter's death made him turn to his astronaut work and not so much to his family. His wife Janet (Claire Foy) had to really talk to him to get him to talk to his sons with the possibility of his not returning. He struggled with this talk.<br/><br/>When he was on the Moon he tossed Karen's bracelet into a crater. In his mind Karen will always be with him on the Moon or something like that. She was always on his mind.<br/><br/>Notables: Kyle Chandler as Deke Slayton, Dir of Flight Operations; Cory Stoll as Buzz Aldrin, who also walked on the Moon with Neil; Ethan Embrey as Mike Collins, the Astronaut who remained in the capsule above the Moon when Neil and Buzz walked on the Moon; Jason Clarke as Astronaut Ed White, who died in a fire before a launch; Shea Whigham as Gus Grissom who also died in that fire before a launch;<br/><br/>There are too many dark scenes when they didn't have to be; jumpy camera work that became annoying at times; too many shots of capsule dials; no one stood out as a leader in a venture that would change the world and not just the Space Program. Again, a very somber movie. Serious, yes, but very somber.<br/><br/>When Neil Armstrong returned from the Moon there were no scenes of being splashed down in the ocean and celebrations worldwide. A few interviews shown didn't really count in here.<br/><br/>When Janet visited Neil when he was quarantined, I got the feeling that she was gong to tell Neil she was going to divorce him. That was a very uncomfortable and somber scene too. I didn't see much love in that room.<br/><br/>This movie should have been a celebration after everyone's hard work, but that didn't happen. (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Humor: No. Language: One F-bomb by Janet

"peterdesilvey","6","1","2","13 January 2019"," It all comes Down to Bad Direction
","I realize they wanted to make it dramatic and try to cover stuff that other movies covering this topic have yet to do. That being said they focused minutes on scenes that could have taken seconds and thinks that could have shown the real drama of the moment have been compressed into mere seconds.<br/><br/>This director really shows that he has littler to no interest in the history of space and almost all interest in trying to impress the critics. Sadly the critics and the masses rarely agree. Now I am not going to lampoon the direction. It is a decent and emotional movie. The problem is there are two stories going on here. The personal life of Neil Armstrong and The Moon Landing. The Moon Landing scene was good the build up action scenes were not save a couple. Many scenes felt rushed or even sped up at times. That bugged me. There is little to no time to build anticipation. It falls flat.<br/><br/>The Dramatic scenes fall short as well. I understand that Neil was described as a recluse at times and not an outgoing person but wow. They have taken it to the next level here. Most of the movies he shows little to no depth. He could literally be replaced by a mannequin in some scenes because the director relies on emotional music and light blooms to show the emotion. For a man who has so much written about him and justifies a whole movie made of him, it is hard to believe by the way he is portrayed in the movie that anyone got enough out of him to write anything useful.<br/><br/>I could care less about the controversy. This is the result of a director coming off success that thought he had another award in the bag with this. Sadly he does not. That has been proven. This is a confused movie at best. Do they want to portray the climate of the 1960's racial tensions... Sure put it in the movie but how does it move the plot. It doesn't. It affects the story not one but. I get it, I'm a history buff but you dont have to throw this stuff in to appease people.<br/><br/>Make something exciting and watchable and inspire a generation of people who are excited and interested to go out and read books on everything having to do with the topic and era. For me that was Apollo 13, The generation before me had the right stuff. This generation has this confused mess."

","I dont truly believe that it's not possible to make the film an Amerivan Icon like Armstrong deserves unless you saw it yourself, that would be am idiotic thing to say, especially given the immense amount of movies that feature directors filming Schindler's List with so much effect! BUT<br/><br/>At the same age as this amazing director, I can feel the overwhelming difference immediately pour from what every American should feel when talking about Neil and the moon landing---and only patriotic reviews from people who were alive then have those feelings just by reading the review of a couple of people (that werent disrespectful).<br/><br/>It is the landmark of the 20th century! Theres tragedies, like the Titanic, great depression, holocaust, bomb dropped, pearl harbor, JFK, Martin Luther king, not to mention the wars---theres so much tragic events that are easily remembered and I think sometimes it can become a dark cloud covering that giant bright circle Lunar rock hanging in the sky. The fact that a human being---not a Robot, walked on that thing saying those famous words and stuck an AMERICAN flag on the moon----thats absolutely incredible and the best improbability in history that I can think of that an american conquered!<br/><br/>That's big stuff. From the director of Whiplash and La La Land, when I heard about the production underway, I thought 'what a great choice because he has a way of capturing human embodiment. Raw emotions.' But, the thing is music was always playing or it was a charming scene.<br/><br/>One gentlemen expressed it fine, saying the book portrayed Armstrong as an obsessive man for flight but the one I spent over two hours with was not the man I've done research on---an american hero but a man plagued by inner demons.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is actually an actor that I always say he did an outstanding job, but I found him miscast or in this case, perhaps casted as the version DC was looking for. Just a sad man. Gosling is best polishing his strengths when hes confident and in his comfort zone. Not having eyes carrying the weight of a burden all the time it seemed.<br/><br/>Overall, I suppose this is maybe too harsh, but I think the one and only man that could have caught this task is CLINT EASTWOOD 5 years ago among others. The review I read of that person reminded me that my mom was ten when he touched the rocky sand. The best generation imo got to see something today we're all about advanced tech and bots to Mars but havent ever been back to the moon. If I saw a moon landing, I would make the passionate movie I could. Yeah, I could watch it now and study it, but it doesnt represent all that we stood for then.<br/><br/>

But I am not sure what angle or tone were filmmakers up to; as in many of the biopic pictures, you can't explain everythin - either you go for the simple facts in historical order or you focus on a personal drama. The death of a child enters too soon and sets the mood that has little to do with the events that follow and gives a real trouble for Ghosling to find his ground in the events that follow.

","Neil Armstrong finally gets a biopic in Damien Chazelle's epic ""First Man."" Chazelle does justice with a practical, honorable, and accurate account of the Apollo 11 space mission to the Moon. However, the movie did not entertain with its thin characterizations, emotional detachment, suspenseless climax, and very boring family narrative.<br/><br/>""First Man"" features some thrilling space scenes which utilizes film stock and IMAX 70mm. If Chazelle decided to use digital and CGI all the special effects, then he would have been left with a POS movie. The space scenes employ shaky cam, and pitch perfect sound design. During the launches, it sounded like the space craft would break apart, adding to the intensity of the scene.
The score by ""La La Land"" composer Justin Hurwitz was jazzy, musical-like and at times searingly epic. I couldn't help but compare the score to another epic space movie ""Interstellar."" Justin Hurwitz's music was good but no where near the level of transcendent epicness of Hans Zimmer's score.<br/><br/>""First Man"" decided to do something different and focus half the movie on Neil Armstrong's family. The result was a bore-fest. The family drama dragged on and on and really killed the pacing. There was very little characterization for such a stellar cast. Some actors like Corey Stoll, and Kyle Chandler had nothing to do but recite boring exposition. Ryan Gosling's trademark is playing stoic and emotionally reserved men, offering for a perfect casting of a stoic Neil Armstrong. However, Gosling didn't employ that same emotional vulnerability that made him so tantalizing in ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" Everyone knows how the story of Neil Armstrong and the Moon ends. So it really isn't the movie's fault that the ending is predictable and suspenseless. With that said, the ending did not redeem what felt like 3 hours of soap opera family drama on the hallmark channel.<br/><br/>Stanley Kubrick did a better job directing the moon landing than Damien Chazelle. #MoonLandingFaked. Just kidding."

","We all know the story of ""First Man""... 1969 moon landing, Neil Armstrong, yada yada. It's an absolutely impressive story-after all, we flew to the freakin' moon! This is a massive feat of science and human accomplishment that truly needs to be celebrated, and what better way to do so with a stellar cast and a director of Whiplash fame!<br/><br/>The movie starts off with a kick-ass nailbiter of a scene that rivals ""Gravity"" in its suspense. They totally got the 60's clunky technology vibes right with an amazing sound design and visual effects so good that you never question the time you're in. Also, I like the overall idea of focusing on the human story behind all the politics, especially as Claire Foy's performance as Janet Armstrong was very powerful.<br/><br/>That said, I felt surprisingly unmoved by this pic. What did move me was the human accomplishment depicted by the movie, but not so much the movie itself. It's almost as the movie relies too much on the power of the source material. Story-wise, I felt that the movie hat some pacing issues and felt a little slow in the middle, and the final moon landing felt underwhelming.<br/><br/>I think one big issue is Ryan Gosling's emotional deadpan performance. It doesn't matter whether this does or does not reflect Neil Armstrong's real character: If a movie has a protagonist that is unemotional, then chances are that the audience doesn't feel as much either.<br/><br/>Another big issue I had with the movie was the whole backstory relating to the Armstrong's lost daughter and all that. This aspect of ""First Man"" reminded me quite a bit of ""Arrival"", and just as in that movie, this tragic backstory was supposed to somehow motivate or drive Neil Armstrong. However, this whole emotional dimension was mostly lost throughout the rest of the movie... and when it did come back, it felt contrived and somewhat cheesy.<br/><br/>All in all, a good movie with some great camerawork and some excellent acting by Claire Foy... however, in the end, this doesn't give justice to the epic scope of this amazing part of human history."

Full marks for effort though. Thanks for First Man. Love!"
"sharky_55","6","1","2","3 November 2018"," Nothing, honey. Your dad's going to the Moon.
","As with La La Land, Damien Chazelle's First Man is shot on celluloid, with rich film grain and colours and tones which seem to blend together. Shooting on film is an aesthetic in itself, visual nostalgia imprinted on the strips of emulsion. The roving, handheld camera works to mimic the look and feel of a dusty home video unearthed from a box of old tapes. This is considerably effective when Chazelle wants to capture the mood of a lazy summer afternoon as the kids chase each other around the backyard, or thrust the viewer into the shoes of Neil Armstrong being assaulted by a frenzy of camera flashes and microphones. It's riveting even when the camera locks down onto the astronauts in their tin capsules and refuses us the closure of cutting to a wide shot; we are strapped in there with them, resigned to the same fate of hoping thousands of calculations and scribbled numbers will bring success. There's nothing precise or mathematical about these scenes; it's pure, edge-of-your-flimsy-seat tension. But there's only so much shaking you can do, and in the domestic settings it just feels nauseous, and dampens the tension of the climax when we've already been shoved inside a metal container and shook vigorously for the last couple of missions.<br/><br/>Unlike La La Land, which was framed from head to toe to capture the full efforts of its choreographers, First Man forces the camera up close and personal, often not even allowing the whole head into the frame. While in some instances this can be effectively suffocating, it's much too frequent for a decade-long biopic with a runtime of 141 minutes. Where is the time for stillness, for the audience to take a breath? There's surprisingly little patience shown for a film of this length, with serene moments like a harp and theremin serenading their lonely ascent into space a rarity.<br/><br/>It's important for film criticism to avoid the territory where you're merely denouncing a film for not being something else. For First Man, taking on the monumental task of telling the intimate tale behind a mythological figure of modern America, meeting all expectations seems impossible. We want him to live up to the legend, and yet expect a personal, human story behind the glamour and fame. Chazelle doesn't oblige this paradox, wading through pre-release controversy about the omission of the planting of the American flag. This is a symbolic move of the clearest intentions; First Man isn't about America's political standoff against the Soviets. There's no customary shot of Houston exploding into cheers when Armstrong breaches that cosmic frontier. The film is for Elliot See, for Ed White, for Apollo missions 1-10, and for Karen Armstrong.<br/><br/>But all that is for naught when you consider Ryan Gosling's rendition of Neil Armstrong, who remains so highly strung throughout that we're never quite sure how to feel for him. While I'm not a fan of restricting 'good acting' to tremulous explosions in the vein of Michael Shannon or Daniel Day Lewis, someone really should tell Gosling he is allowed to act like a normal human being. His stoic shtick may have worked when he played a near-android in Lars and the Real Girl, or an actual android in Blade Runner 2049, but here he's entirely too tight, rendering an icon into a bundle of nerves and murmured lines. There's no need for his famous one-liner to be revelatory - it's not that kind of movie. But after two hours of the same monotone, it spills out like a mere afterthought, deflating the moment.<br/><br/>This wouldn't be a deal-breaker if it wasn't for Chazelle's re-positioning of the moon mission as the ultimate catharsis for Armstrong, looking to memorialise his late daughter. But partnered with Gosling's reservation, the effect is an emotional chasm between Armstrong and the rest of his family, who are little more than pawns in his resolute mission. Even as it gives Claire Foy a platform to be more than just a worried suburban housewife (she's remarkable considering what she is given to work with, and how all the grieving is strictly allocated to Gosling), it places too much emphasis on the landing to be life-changing at the expense of his other sons. And to think that the Armstrong's marriage lasted another 20 years, when here it is depicted at breaking point. To where could he possibly go next? This Neil Armstrong seems destined to remain behind an exhibit behind the quarantine glass."

"s-maniatopoulos","6","1","2","2 November 2018"," A disappointment
","It seems these days every great director wants to have a Kubrick moment. This usually translates to a space movie, and eventually to a couple of great cinematic moments of ultimate beauty, coupled with hallucinatory scenes where the viewer is lost in colors, visual effects and is meant to feel the ""grandeur of the last frontier"".
Unlike Nolan, Chazelle picks a different approach: in ""the first man"" he tries to tell the story of Neil Armstrong, whole combining it with his own 2001: A space Odyssey.
Though the movie is aptly shot, it is misdirected: it misses all the important moments of this man's life and accomplishments, replacing narrative cohesion with long takes, pace with artistic vision and, ultimately, life with art.
At the same time, the direction, music and editing, although undoubtedly the product of great artists, are also marked with bad choices: the overuse of the hand held camera drifts away from the goal of putting us ""in Armstrong's shoes"" and ends up not only destroying several scenes but also causing a certain dizziness. It also weakens the great cinematic moments of space travel, as the transition from constant camera movement to more camera movement seems only like natural progression.
Lastly, the closure ""mechanism"" chosen feels not only very mainstream but also somewhat unnecessary.
Overall, this is a long, somewhat slow, slightly incoherent, rather inconsistent movie that includes a few great moments and a few terrible ones.
But the great ones are real eye openers, so I would recommend that you watch it.
However, this is not as good as Chazelle's previous work.
It seems that good biopics have become a field of cinema where tv-quality direction and a straightforward script are overall more effective than the kind of cinema that Chazelle delivers.
I would rate it with a 7 because of the excellent performances, the wonderful music and those beautiful Kubrick moments.
However, 2.5 hours of hand held camera are a very poor choice, and equally poor was the omission to put this man's life in the proper historical, political and scientific context that he deserves."
"Anttell","5","1","2","1 November 2018"," Expected more
","Damien Chazelle's newest film explores ground outside the comfort zone set up by his previous two films. First Man is competently directed - it has some really nice shots, good score segments and many other well made elements. The script, written by Josh Singer (the Post, Spotlight), is unfortunately rather mundane: it takes a look at Neil Armstrong's personal and working life fairly evenly in a very unsurprising fashion - the screenplay is pretty middle of the road biopic-stuff. There's probably a great film waiting to be made about the subject, but this wasn't it for me. It's by no means a bad effort, just feels somewhat uninspired and would've needed a different approach to be something more.<br/><br/>Rating: 5/10"

"masonfisk","5","1","2","23 October 2018"," FIRST STORY THEN FIRST MAN...!
","A dramatic misfire from the reliable Damien Chazelle depicts our first successful mission to the moon from the standpoint of the first man to step on the moon, Neil Armstrong. Having the twin stars of astronaut cinema to contend with, namely The Right Stuff & Apollo 13, First Man needed a lot to bring to the table. Sharing the same faults w/42, the Jackie Robinson biopic, we have a film w/an unknown cipher in its center. Armstrong, along w/Robinson, was an intensely private person who rarely granted interviews, so making him the lead provides an inert, soulless arena where the audience can find no footing so w/o that, the film becomes a sort of documentary w/sprinkles of character trait dropped in like a clogged IV feed tube. Claire Foy comes off best as Armstrong's beleaguered spouse but perhaps focusing on Buzz Aldrin (played by Corey Stoll) would've done the trick since even to this day Aldrin remains one of the most vocal cheerleaders for NASA & space exploration."

","Do not worry about the spoilers, there are no tense moments or surprises in this dull film about a man who has little personality.<br/><br/>First off, any blather about the film being unpatriotic is nonsense. It was a movie about a man more than the event of the first man on the moon. The flag is seen clearly in a wide shot. Not showing the planting of the flag certainly falls into the space called artistic license. We were glad to see the picture of the flag. It was more appreciated than the untold number of shots of Armstrong's sun shield reflecting things we have no idea what they are. If there is anything left off of the 2+ hours Armstrong and Aldrin spend on the moon's surface is that they showed very little.<br/><br/>Neil Armstrong accomplished some amazing feats. He did things the normal person could never do because he was given the opportunity and in that opportunity he excelled to the point that he was chosen to be the one at the right time to lead Apollo 11 and be the first man to step onto the moon. But do not let this movie lead you to believe that he had many other significant firsts. His trip to the edge of space where he managed to recover and return was not intended and due to not following the test-flight plan. We will never know the reason Gemini 8 malfunctioned after a successful test-coupling of two vehicles in orbit. The biography and the movie that was based on the biography by James R. Hansen gentled any controversy from the investigation into why the capsule began to roll out of control. As in the X-15 incident, Armstrong did have his head about him and found a way to stop the roll...according to the story in the film.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling does a commendable job but that is about it. He had very few challenging scenes and many that might have been were simply shot with a shake 'n bake camera and not much can be seen and less understood what was happening. Gosling is a good actor, this was simply not a part that demanded a good actor. So many scenes of him thinking, staring, not talking, being distant, thoughtful, and just plain boring. I suppose if the real Armstrong was such then Gosling did a good job but why make a movie about someone like that. Oh, right, he first man to walk on the moon...hang the movie of a boring person on that.<br/><br/>Thankfully there was Kyle Chandler as Deke Slayton and Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin to bring some enjoyable humanity to their characters. Claire Foy was so much better as Queen Elizabeth than as Janet Armstrong.<br/><br/>Over all the story was oddly put together with major pieces missing or unresolved and the ending just plane sucked. It was one more ""how do we end this movie?""<br/><br/>We give 4 stars because the crowning piece showing the landing of the lunar module was wonderful. So well done, maybe that is how the first one happened too? If they can do it today, who is to say they didn't in 1969? No, I don't believe it but they did such a great job those who believe the Apollo was all faked.<br/><br/>There is one thing in the movie that was completely fake and probably added because somehow, they had to make Armstrong character human.<br/><br/>No matter where space travel may go in the future, Mars or beyond, NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong (1930-2012) forever has the place as the first human ever to set foot on solid ground outside of our atmosphere. Taking that ""one small step for a man"" onto the moon on July 20, 1969."
"mike-wadman","5","1","2","18 October 2018"," Good, but boring and depressive.
","I had really high hopes for First Man since there really hasn't been a good movie this summer since Mission Impossible. There is no argument that the movie is well done but I gave it a 5 for the following reasons:<br/><br/><ul><li>It was really boring. First Man has a very sullen, lugubrious tone throughout almost the entire film. There are definitely some happy moments but most of these are overshadowed by this overall depressive tone. I am not insensitive to bad things happening in people's lives - the film made me cry at times - but it was way too much and gave me the perception that First Man was more about Neil Armstrong's struggles than it was about the glorious event of going to the moon. Because this negativity is such a predominant theme of the movie it makes for long, drawn out, boring scenes with little dialogue.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>This is related to the first point above but Neil Armstrong is portrayed as a disturbed individual whose primary focus is the problems in his life. I'm no expert on Neil Armstrong but the film makes you believe that his character has on overarching preoccupation with his problems even to the point that you wonder how he can function as human being.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Lastly, I hope, plead and pray that film directors someday let go of the fad of bouncing the camera around while filming. I know they do it in the name of art but the vast majority of people greatly dislike it and get a headache while watching. I totally get it that astronauts being launched out of the earth's atmosphere makes for a shaky ride but this movie takes it a little too far and then doesn't stop with the bumpy camera while firmly planted on the earth. Just use Apollo 13 as a reference of what a good film should be.</li></ul><br/><br/>I will never watch it again and would encourage you to wait until it comes out on Netfilx.<br/><br/>My two cents."
"shawneofthedead","5","1","2","18 October 2018"," Shoots for the moon, and misses the heart.
","There's no denying that Damien Chazelle is one of the most interesting directors working today. His two most recent credits, which he wrote and directed, were breakout hits. You could practically sense Chazelle himself living and breathing in every frame of Whiplash and La La Land - two films that were, on the surface, quite different, but which married complex character work with intense musicality to quite remarkable effect. With First Man, he turns his hand to the prestige biopic: a rich historical drama inspired by the life and achievements of legendary astronaut Neil Armstrong. The final result is a strange beast: it mostly works well when shooting (quite literally) for the moon, but falls short at getting to the heart of its subject.<br/><br/>We first meet Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) in 1962. Already a renowned test pilot, he and his wife, Janet (Claire Foy) have created a picture-perfect nuclear family, with one son, Eric, and one daughter, Karen. But tragedy strikes: he's forced to watch, helpless, as his beloved little girl wastes away from an inoperable brain tumour. Although her premature death shakes Armstrong to the core, you would never know it: he returns to work almost immediately, and signs up for America's space programme. Instead of dealing with the oceans of grief within him, he channels his intense stoicism and iron discipline into his new mission: taking leave of the surface of the Earth.<br/><br/>On this count, the film is a marvel - both in technical terms, and as a resurrection of a relatively distant past. The 1969 moon landing has passed into legend and lore: it's a fact we learn from history books, its accompanying dangers and follies fading with the passage of time. First Man brings all of that context back to vivid, shuddering, blood-and-guts life, reminding us that we somehow catapulted a man to the moon without any of the computing technology that most of us carry around in our pockets nowadays.<br/><br/>This point is driven home as Armstrong and his compatriots - including Ed White (Jason Clarke) and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) - take turns being shot into space. Through close-ups tighter than Tom Hooper's and deliberately shaky camera-work, Chazelle invites us to join these men inside their spacecrafts: glorified tin buckets, held together by a dream and a prayer, that might as easily serve as their coffins as their shuttle to the stars. The human cost of the entire space-faring effort weighs heavily on the film and its title character, forcing Armstrong to grapple with loss every time a mission fails - occasionally, before it even begins.<br/><br/>All the emotional beats that land (and there are quite a few that don't) come courtesy of Chazelle's first-rate cast. Gosling has made a career out of playing grimly determined men, whose hearts are beating wildly beneath veneers of impenetrable impassivity. He's very good as Armstrong, though he's hamstrung by the very role he's playing. Foy makes the most of a rather underwritten part, unearthing genuine rage and heartbreak as Janet's life revolves around the constant possibility of her husband's death. <br/><br/>Less successful are First Man's attempts to give us a sense of who Neil Armstrong was. It admirably avoids transforming him into a cliché or a lie: this is no charmingly airbrushed portrait of a genial aw-shucks American hero. <br/><br/>What the film does do, unfortunately, is swing almost too far towards the opposite extreme. At every turn, Armstrong refuses human connection: rebuffing his wife, his friends, his living children, while stewing in his own angst. Josh Singer, who consulted with Armstrong's first wife and sons in writing the screenplay, stands by the version of the man we meet in the film: so pathologically reticent that he would rather risk his life travelling to the moon than spend one evening talking honestly with his family. <br/><br/>But therein lies the problem. Sure, Armstrong could have been hard and cold and emotionally inaccessible (at least at the time) to those closest to him. It still takes a conscious narrative decision, however, to make one particular interpretation of the man's inner turmoil the emotional pivot of the entire film. When this Armstrong stares at the moon (which he does a lot), the film practically yells at us that he longs to escape there. Making history is incidental; it's all about processing his grief.<br/><br/>It's also why the film's climax - a scene that should be filled with awe and wonder at the superhuman feat achieved by distinctly unsuper humans - undercuts itself. We barely get to experience the joy that should accompany this remarkable achievement, because Armstrong's face remains obscured by a reflective visor as he takes his first steps on the moon. We only get to see his face at a moment so nakedly sentimental that it will have you rushing online afterwards to find out how much of it is fact and how much fiction. (Spoiler alert: it's fiction, which Singer will argue is grounded in fact. But it's still fiction.)<br/><br/>In effect, First Man ends up trapping itself by its own ambition. It wants desperately to avoid painting Armstrong as a noble, flaw-free hero - but focuses so much on his personal misery that his accomplishments are devalued. The historic moon landing becomes part of the weight of one man's sorrow, bleeding it of the enormous scientific and cultural significance that Armstrong himself would have fiercely defended. If Armstrong wasn't a real person, it might have worked. But because he was, First Man's awkward blend of documentary and melodrama - as relentless as it is reductive - feels tone-deaf. It aims for the stars... but winds up crashing to the ground."

It's how I wound up a cadet at West Point which is where I was when Apollo 11 made its miraculous journey to the moon. I remember the excitement when we marched from our barracks in the middle of the night to go watch the landing. I remember the awe as we sat in the North Auditorium transfixed on the largest tv screen I'd ever seen as Neil Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface. Unfortunately there was very little of that excitement or awe in this movie. I don't know where the filmmakers went wrong, but I suspect it's because they failed to capture the context. In the world of 1969 landing on the moon was an extraordinary reality altering event. It was beyond our collective imagination.

At the very least all school children should be shown all the trials it took to get to the moon to inspire them to continue to push the space program farther."

"riander","7","1","2","14 October 2018"," Original take on the space race and moon landing.
","The movie focuses on the sad and negative aspects of astronaut Neil Armstrongs life. I can not remember a single happy/fun moment in the entire film. It also lacks any kind of triumphant moments. Even the moon landing, and time directly after, is portrayed as a sad moments for Neil Armstrong.
Most factual things in the movie are accurate as far as I know, but they are cherry picked to display the most sad moments during the programme and in Neils life.<br/><br/>This is very different from most other movies, and can be an interesting wath, as long as one is prepared to go away feeling a bit sad yourself.
However I am afraid that a 2+ hour long movie without a single positive moment can easily feel a bit dull, hence why I did not give it a higher score."

I still say if your looking for a drama about a wife dealing with a man who can't deal with a daughter death whule bits of man working for nasa who lands on te moon, go for ir, this is your movie, if your looking the HBO series from the late 90s from the earth to the moon, this isnt your film and that series does a much better job much of tells the story of NASA mission to the moon and all the apollo missions and it's more enjoyable to me."

","First Man, 2018 film starring Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Jason Clarke and Kyle Chandler. <br/><br/>Factual look at the times of the first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong and the years leading up to the historic step on the moon. We see the trials and tribulations he underwent in both home and work. July 20, 1969 he became the first human to stand on another celestial body, his name and actions will live in our history forever.<br/><br/>I do not normally go to theaters to watch new films. I have plenty to keep me busy until they arrive on streaming services or dvd but this one was on my must list. Now, they did use the shaky cam effect throughout which I am not a fan of but when I got beyond that I was riveted to the screen. I for one did not know that he was plagued by the loss of his young daughter, actually most people I guess were unaware as he kept it to himself. This film showed us the human behind the man, his faults, his troubles and his mistakes.<br/><br/>The film, I am told, is very factual and what you saw he pretty much went through. Actually, unlike Apollo 13, this film showed us the family side of this famous astronaut and to me that was a great touch. They stayed away from the technical side of things and focused on what the men went through, physically and emotionally. To me, all of these men from Apollo down to Mercury were absolute hero's and pioneers. Can you imagine taking a trip into space in a container filled with bulky, shaky and loud instruments. With a computer less powerful than today's smart phones? Man, they had guts, they saw the future vision better than any one else. They also knew that any time they went up the may not come back!<br/><br/>This film should be shown in schools as the history lessons it provide can't be learned from just reading a history book. If you are to see any movie in theaters this year it has to be this one. Everything you see actually happened and we go to know Neil in a way that, to me anyhow, made me more impressed with his life. Gosling played a very good part here, he doesn't say much but his emotions transferred through the screen to me and I felt for Armstrong. I did find a tear coming down when he had to bury his daughter, no man should have to go through that. I was also very much glued to the screen when they landed on the moon and got a further emotional charge when Neil stood near a crater by himself and made peace, finally, with his lost daughter.<br/><br/>This is a must see emotional film that everyone will love. Forget streaming services, when this comes out on BluRay I am getting it. To see this review and more visit movies.3brew.com"

"timmurphy-2","8","3","12","13 October 2018"," Definitely worth the hype
","The reality that the space program, as well as the men who went to space, were eternally ""on edge"" is very clearly presented in this film. For a film abouace travel and the quest for the moon, its surprisingly intimate. The film focuses on the Armstrong family, the small and isolated group of astronauts living and working together, and the closeness within the spacecrafts that took these flights. The highlights include the moon landing, which happens as fuel is being burned, and the Gemini 8 flight, which almost ended in disaster. Some say that Gosling as Armstrong comes across as too restrained. I disagree. At times, a subtle humor is shown. His pain at the deaths of his daughter and his colleagues is obvious. His almost total focus on his mission also comes across as selfish-to the point of rudeness toward friends and disengagement with his wife. Claire Foy is worthy, again, of award consideration for a pitch perfect portrayal of a strong minded partner. Jason Clarke also stands out. In short, this is an outstanding tribute to an era when commitment, sacrifice, intelligence, optimism and daring do characterized one of America and mandkind's greatest achievements."

#Moon landing scene brings goose bumps.<br/><br/>Movie was little bit slow during first hour because it deals with the situations from back to 60's but Neil's journey with Gemini 8 covers it up also.

","This is the best film not just of the year, but one of the best of the 21st century. Let's be clear from the start: This is not a film about Apollo 11. This is a film about Neil Armstrong, his personal life, and the events leading up to and including the Apollo 11 mission. This is an emotional, action-filled and incredibly dramatic retelling of one of the greatest feats man has ever accomplished. The acting is brilliant, especially from Gosling and Foy (Stoll is also very good as Aldrin), it is beautifully shot, the score is great, and the flying sequences are excellent. Anyone who doesn't like this film is either an idiot (who on earth cares that they didn't show the flag being put down-my God, America is still a great country without the shot of the flag being put in having to be shown!), or just plain stupid looking just for action. This is a great film."
"carbonyannick","10","2","7","15 December 2018"," A Masterpiece.
","A great film that doesn't show an untouchable hero, but a mourning husband and dad, who has lost his daughter. ""First Man"" didn't focus on America or the incredible work that has been done by the Americans. It focuses on the human Neil Armstrong, the ""First Man"". So don't hate the film for not showing how they sticked the American Flag into the Moon surface because that's not what this film is about.
It simply isn't a patriotic hymn to the American technology, but a biography of a special person who had the privilege to be the first person to walk on the moon.
And I think that this film truly is a great biography of Neil Armstrong.
Go watch it and if you're American, for one time acknowledge art as it is and don't criticize everything that doesn't suit you."
"calebsiler","10","2","7","19 October 2018"," A personal, moving film that lives up to it's potential.
","This is not your typical Hollywood space blockbuster. This is not Apollo 13 or Interstellar (though those are both great movies in their own right). It takes a little more patience to truly appreciate a movie like this, but boy is it worth it.<br/><br/>First Man is a triumph, in that Chazelle tells the story of Neil Armstrong in such a unique way. It's a visual experience no doubt, and everything comes together to create a special movie full of special moments. The camera is the star, and we are forced to see this story up close (quite literally) and personal.<br/><br/>Chazelle uses real, raw special effects, and sets the tone of each scene with dim, man-made lighting. He slowly peels back the story's layers, as we come to realize that this film is not about going to the moon, it's about Neil going to the moon. Ryan's Gosling and Claire Foy are exceptional as the Armstrongs, and show what the true price is for success.<br/><br/>I always say that artsy movies catch our eyes, but a good story catches our hearts. First Man manages to do both. It gives us a beautiful shot of the atmosphere of Earth.... and then quickly cuts to the grim face of Neil. We are constantly reminded that Neil is going through this experience with us.<br/><br/>The sub-plot about Neil's dead daughter is absolutely heart-wrenching, and we feel that burden pushing heavy at times. But it's the end of the movie where Neil finally comes to terms with this tragic event that nearly ruined his life. It's a single, masterful moment, and was the highlight of the move for me.<br/><br/>First Man is an instant classic.<br/><br/>Let's go through the checklist:<br/><br/>Story: 10/10

"CANpatbuck3664","8","2","7","18 October 2018"," A Pretty Good Movie About a Defining Moment in Human History
","My expectations of seeing First Man was that I was in for some heavy drama, learning not only about Neil Armstrong but about all the trials and tribulations that everyone had to go through to achieve success with the Apollo 11 mission. I did get that, and I'll talk more about that later but my favourite parts of the movie were actually the action scenes taking place during the test flights. If you get motion sickness or suffer from claustrophobia, they might be a little hard to take as they help illustrate how much danger these people were placing themselves in. There's a lot of shaky cam but it didn't detract from how impressively filmed those sequences were. I was holding my breath at several points and wincing and moving in my seat in other instances because it was so hard not to get caught up in them.<br/><br/>The most successful part of First Man had less to do with framing the achievement of getting to the moon or showing Neil Armstrong's perspective on the journey. The most effective part was how it showed these exemplary people as being human. We rarely get a movie that shows that being an astronaut isn't a lot of fun (Apollo 13 is the only other one I can think of off the top of my head that doesn't fall into the science fiction). The sacrifice that these men and women made are pretty incredible and, in this movie, we get a biopic that doesn't feature a generic arc that hits the same old beats. I appreciated that, and I wish more movies would approach these larger than life stories from that direction.<br/><br/>I talked about in the last paragraph how First Man succeeds in showing these people as heroic yet flawed people. This is great but there is a flip side to it. I respect Neil Armstrong (played here by Ryan Gosling) immensely, he achieved something few have and deserves as much credit he has gotten if not more. In this movie however, he doesn't always make for a compelling main character. He has suffered tragedy and I get that but so much of this movie is him looking sad off in the distance. We don't get to experience as much of his inner pain along with him because he internalizes it so much. I get that this may be an accurate portrayal of Neil and if so, I salute the creative team for showing that. But while I respected him, he wasn't always fun to watch or that compelling as the focus of the movie. Most of the supporting characters aren't given much screen time or character development (the exception being his wife Janet played by Claire Foy) so the movie rests on him as a character. This works in some scenes, but it causes the movie to drag pretty badly at other points.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling headlines the movie as Neil Armstrong and there was a lot of hype around his performance. I like him as an actor and while I'm happy he'll get some buzz for the big awards, I don't think this was his best work. He did a solid job, but I thought this character was firmly in his wheel house and played to his strengths as an actor. I would have liked to see him stretch a little more in this but that also could just be the character. Claire Foy also did decent work in this, she gets some nice moments where we get to see how much pressure Janet is under and how she struggles to cope with the possibility that her husband might not come back. I liked Jason Clarke as Ed White, he gets the most personal scenes with Gosling and they work well together. I felt for a lot of the supporting cast, we get some amazing character actors: Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Ciaran Hinds, Pablo Schreiber and Shea Wigham. They all get some time but not enough to really justify their inclusion. I especially wanted more time with Corey Stoll who was playing Buzz Aldrin, he was portrayed as a brash and confident character and I wanted a little more of his backstory.<br/><br/>I had heard opinions ranging from ""Oscar favourite"" to ""overrated and boring"" on First Man when I walked into the theatre. I got to see this with a friend and we walked away from the theatre shrugging our shoulders and muttering how it was pretty good. Considering the hype, it may have been a bit of a letdown but that doesn't take away from the fact its an amazing story that's captured well. This movie could have user another pass in editing however, it ran long and by the end I was getting antsy for First Man to wrap up. It doesn't always paint Neil Armstrong as a compelling protagonist at the centre of this story but you have to take the bad with the good. I don't think this will make a 2018 top ten list for me but if you're interested in seeing this, I would say you should catch it on the big screen to help get the true scope of what's being shown in this movie. I'd give this a 7.5/10 rounding up to an 8/10."

His wife struggles while taking care of his sons. Neil sees the deaths of his friends because of NASA's failures. You see Neil's human side.

Watching this movie had Interstellar, 2001 A Space Odyssey, and Apollo 13 moments. I liked one scene where his wife confronts Neil, and she has him explain what is going to happen when he doesn't come back from his mission to her sons.

But it can have slow scenes at times."
"kjproulx","8","2","7","14 October 2018"," Impressive in Scope, but a Little Light on the Drama
","When a story is brought to the big screen that practically every audience member already knows, it's hard to make a compelling film out of it. That being said, it's all about the execution and I believe First Man is definitely executed in the perfect way. After Whiplash and La La Land, director Damien Chazelle has been on every film lover's radar. While I personally don't believe this film is in the same league as his first two directorial achievements, it's definitely worth the praise it's been receiving. If you know this story already, you will learn very little from First Man, but if you're up to be swept up in a grand scope, then this one may just knock your socks off.<br/><br/>Following Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) as he deals with family issues and the loss of good friends, this troubled, yet eager young man will do whatever it takes to lend a hand to his employers in NASA. Eventually given the opportunity to pilot the Apollo rocket that plans to land the first humans on the Moon, First Man is all about the build-up and execution. When watching a movie like this, you pretty much know how everything will turn out for most of these characters, so that particular portion of the movie was definitely a downside. That being said, the Moon landing itself is worth the price of admission alone.<br/><br/>The way this crew captures the claustrophobia in the cockpit, down to the overall reveal of the Moon was absolutely breathtaking. I found myself sucked into this movie every time a pilot would fail at a trial run or actually accomplish what they've been setting out to achieve. Although not surprising, this movie is nothing short of fantastic when looking at the minute details of each and every aspect of filmmaking here. You truly feel as if you've followed these characters from their hardships, all the way up until they finally touch the Moon themselves. With that said, I feel the emotional core of this film could've been a little deeper.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy deliver stellar performances in their respective roles. In fact, I believe Foy could easily receive nominations at every single one of the awards shows this coming year, but I felt slightly let down in terms of development. This film spans quite a few years and there are many significant plot details that seem to either be given very little screen time or talked about as if it has already happened in the past or is currently happening off-screen, simply because the movie doesn't have time to slow down for them. At a hefty 141 minutes, you'd think these aspects would have time to be explored further, but I never felt the emotional impact that I think director Damien Chazelle had intended.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is riddled with things to love. From the terrific score, superb sound design, very solid performances from nearly everyone on-screen, and a climax that had me gasping for air (mainly due to the fact that this film needs to be seen in IMAX for the full effect), First Man deserves to be talked about as one of the better overall films of 2018. Although it probably won't crack my lists, I had a great time sitting in the theatre with this one. It does run a little long and it may bore some viewers throughout the second act, but I assure you that if you have patience with this one, the finale is more than worth the wait. In the end, I can confidently say, even with my nitpicks, that First Man is a great movie."

"beerstud-46805","8","2","7","12 October 2018"," Definitely not Apollo 13
","If you're looking for the patriotic, beat the Russians to the moon type of thriller, this is not your movie. This movie is a biopic that is solely focused on Neil Armstrong. Unlike the mostly upbeat tone of Apollo 13 that focuses heavily on the one mission and many technical aspects, First Man is all about Neil Armstrong. The moon is merely a backdrop for the story of one of America's most reluctant hero's. <br/><br/>The film explores the parallels between NASAs struggle to get to the moon and Armstrong's struggles to deal with his depression after the losses of his daughter, friends and fellow astronauts. The US was asking a lot of Armstrong while he was dealing with unspeakable tragedy in a world where he could never speak about his feelings. This makes for a compelling story of Armstrong, but not so much the Space Race. <br/><br/>I truly enjoyed this movie. The scoring and acting could have been better, but the cinematography was fantastic. The characters around Armstrong helped drive the story, but there is no doubt he was the main focus. I was caught off guard by the fact that there was very little focus of Collins and Aldrin. There was also no mention of the Mercury program, or even Apollo 8. <br/><br/>Some people were upset about the lack of patriotism on the moon, but it clearly didn't relate to the scene. Neil's time on the moon is depicted as a moment of clarity for himself and his family. He had time to reflect on his late daughter, and just like that, he was heading back to earth. <br/><br/>This was a great movie, even though it's not exactly what I was expecting. If I see it again, it will be on IMAX."
"ferguson-6","8","2","7","12 October 2018"," quietly heroic
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind."" Every junior high student learns that Neil Armstrong spoke those words when he became the first person to walk on the moon's surface in 1969. So while his words are etched into our minds and the televised visuals of the historic event are seared into our corneas, most of us know little of the man who is renowned as an American hero. Director Damien Chazelle (LA LA LAND, WHIPLASH) finds a way to personalize a man's story without sacrificing the corresponding grandiose theatre and immense danger. <br/><br/>Kicking off with one of the most intense cinematic sequences ever, the film puts us inside the LLRV (Lunar Landing Research Vehicle) with Armstrong in 1961 as he bounces off the atmosphere and rockets towards near certain death. This opening makes the statement that this is no ordinary man, and this is no ordinary movie ... and we are now prepared to hold on tight! Based on James R Hansen's book, the only biography Armstrong authorized, the script from Oscar winner Josh Singer (SPOTLIGHT) expertly balances the test pilot/astronaut portion with the character study/personality of the man. <br/><br/>Intensity is on display throughout - whether in a capsule or during family time.
Ryan Gosling stars as Neil Armstrong, and the story tracks him from 1961 through that famous moment in 1969. What we see is a man who was first an engineer, and then a pilot. A man whose intellect and nerve allowed him to be part of the second group of pilots selected for NASA's astronaut program in 1962. The first group was the Mercury Seven. He was also a man emotionally devastated by the death of his young daughter Karen (from a brain tumor) and the numerous deaths of friends and associates in the space program. The film clearly shows how he was impacted.<br/><br/>Proving true JFK's proclamation that the driving force wasn't that it was easy, but rather that it was quite hard (and dangerous), we glimpse some of the inner workings of NASA, and what becomes clear that the space program was high stakes gambling filled with huge risks - all for a space race against the Russians that was motivated by ego and national pride. Daily danger was part of the job, as was the claustrophobia that comes with sitting in tin can space capsules being monitored by computers far less powerful than the cell phone you are likely using to read this. Armstrong's claustrophobia somehow seemed less apparent during his flights than during press conferences or sitting at the kitchen table with his family - providing even more insight into the man.<br/><br/>Claire Foy (""The Crown"") plays Janet Armstrong, the strong-for-the-kids while suffering-in- (mostly) silence homemaker wife. Ms. Foy does a nice job of conveying the emotional turmoil that goes with being an astronaut's wife, and having no one to share the uncertainty and worry with. Jason Clarke plays Ed White, the first American to walk in space (Gemini 4) and Armstrong's neighbor and close friend. Olivia Hamilton plays his wife Janet, while Kyle Chandler plays Deke Slayton, and Corey Stoll offers up a not so complimentary portrayal of Buzz Aldrin. Other familiar faces in the cast include Shea Whigham as Gus Grissom, Christopher Abbott as Dave Scott, Pablo Schreiber as Jim Lovell (played by Tom Hanks in APOLLO 13), Ethan Embry, Ciaran Hinds, Patrick Fugit, Lukas Haas, Cory Michael Smith, Brian D'Arcy James, and Leon Bridges.<br/><br/>Meticulous attention to details of the era include kids that actually ask to go play outdoors (and aren't overly impressed with astronaut dads). The sound design and set designs are phenomenal and complement the outstanding cinematography of Linus Sandgren (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND). The abundance of close-ups allow for an intimacy that makes the awe-inspiring space sequences even more breath-taking. Actual historic space audio is used whenever possible, and director Chazelle doesn't shy away from showing us the ""other side"" of the space program: Gil Scott-Heron's ""Whitey's on the Moon"", writer Kurt Vonnegut publically questioning the program, and many citizens wondering why so much money is being spent on rockets while there were so many other areas (including Vietnam) in need of attention.<br/><br/>The humor is often quite sly, including a scene where his competitive applicants shrug off Armstrong as only a ""Civilian"", unaware of his remarkable service and record in the Korean War as a Navy Fighter Pilot. Gosling's quietly intense portrayal of Armstrong could be termed constrained, but it's quite fitting given his subject. Composer Justin Hurwitz (Oscar winner for LA LA LAND) delivers and unusual but fitting score, and we can't help but realize this would make a terrific trilogy bookended by THE RIGHT STUFF (1983) and APOLLO 13 (1995). Chazelle presents a fitting bio of a true American hero (and yes, we can see the flag on the moon), while also giving us a look at the harrowing process of putting folks into space. It's on us to decide if it's worth it, but leaves no doubt that President Kennedy was right ... it is hard."

","Cinematically this film really gets you and holds onto you with its breathtaking cinematography, visual effects, Chazelle's direction, and its performances. This film is about the moon landing, yes, but its mainly about Armstrong himself and his struggles through the time period in which the film is based. Foy's and Gosling's performances are the standouts of the film along with the incredible visual effects. Addressing the flag controversy, no the flag is not shown being assembled and physically put up, but YES it is shown on screen as both Armstrong and Aldrin leave the moon. A controversy that was needless and just plain ignorant of the point of the film. The film is about the man Neil Armstrong and about what the mankind gained the day of the moon landing. This film was fantastic! The cinematography, visual effects, direction, and performances keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its 141 minutes of run time."

","With Whiplash and La La Land under the belt, Chazelle takes us on the somewhat known journey of the story we know. Ryan Gosling is quite solid in his performance, but its Claire Foy who still can put a foot wrong in another exceptional display. Now granted if you get motion sickness you may get queasy as Chazelle tries to put the audience in the drivers seat. It does give you the sense of emotion and adrenaline of the missions both on and off the land. To bring up the egotistical and narcissism in some reviews here of not showing the American flag being placed, really who cares, you still see it there. We all know who went there. Seriously go and enjoy yourselves."
"jdoeski-38001","10","2","8","14 October 2018"," Beautifully shot and acted
","To be propelled into outer space on top of a 30 floor tall rocket, controlled by a computer with a tiny fraction of the power of my first smart phone takes real courage and skill. First Man shows the true magnitude of the challenges faced by NASA: pressure to catch up with the Russians, the difficulty of testing new concepts in a realistic scenario, the deaths of some of its best people, the hardship endured by the astronauts' families, opposition in government and in some of the population at large. The movie portrays Neil Armstrong as a true hero - well educated, highly professional and highly focused on his job - the strong silent type.<br/><br/>First Man clearly portrays the moon landing as a great American accomplishment, one that has brought cheers and admiration for the USA from hundreds of millions. The U-N-I-T-E-D S-T-A-T-E-S letters on the Saturn V cross slowly across the full screen as Apollo 11 lifts off. We see Armstrong's first step on the moon, and the American flag close to the base. As a Canadian, I am at a loss about the movie's critics - Marco Rubio and Donald Trump. No longer debating the relative size of their penises, they now have some common ground in their latest intellectual endeavor - criticizing a movie they have not seen for reasons they don't understand. They represent the clear antithesis to the strong silent type.<br/><br/>The movie is beautifully shot and acted. Many of the scenes are breathtaking. The portrayal of the sixties is perfect. I enjoyed it thoroughly and strongly recommend it."

"ksb77","8","2","8","13 October 2018"," Sublime
","First man is a far cry from typical Hollywood movies from this genre. Gone is the epic soundtrack replaced by raw sounds and the silence of space. Gone is the long sexy shots, gone the superhero trappings. This movie takes you on a journey to the moon from the perspective of Neil Armstrong. In the decades since the first moon walk we have been bombarded by images that have been sewn into the fabric of pop culture. MTV logo's,cheap posters and screen savers with Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. These romanticised views hide the incredible bravery, ingenuity, sacrifice and sheer horror of getting a man to the moon. First man shows us how it was, the impact upon colleagues, families and friends. This movie avoids the America is great rhetoric and instead focuses on the real challenges. The script is a slow burner and it's pacing may not be to everyone's expectations, this is not Apollo 13. It's takes its time to tell the human story. Extremely well directed and acted by the leads and support cast. Ryan Gosling delivers a thoughtful and introverted performance whilst Claire Foy counters this with an awesome performance as Mrs Armstrong. Portraying her fear and pessimism throughout every phase as she deals with the day to day realities of the risk to life. Go see it."

","I have never written a review for a film before, but i felt compelled to pass judgement a mere 20 minutes after the screening finished. The director is a visionary and any young inspiring filmmaker should take note, indeed some of the more established directors should too. Every shot and frame, every word and sound is there for a reason. He does not simply throw in a scene without the belief that it will add to the film and enhance the viewers enjoyment of the wonder unfolding in front of them.<br/><br/>Gosling an Foy are a joy throughout and often just a facial expression or cursory glance can say more than any words could. This film is a visual and audio masterpiece and Damien Chazelle is a name that will define cinema for many decades to come.<br/><br/>We should take in everything he has to offer as he slips the surly bonds of earth, because we are witnessing the next steps of cinematic greatness."
"gluonpaul","8","2","8","12 October 2018"," Stunning, moving biopic with a couple of quirks
","I have to say overall the movie was very moving and feels like a real love letter to a seminal character in what would have to be considered the most amazing thing we have ever done as a species.<br/><br/>The acting was reserved and powerfully moving. The story focuses on the real human element but without missing on the visceral experience of the build up to the moon landing and the landing itself.<br/><br/>There were a couple of quirks, namely that Gemini is and always has been pronounced Gem-in-eye not Gem-in-ee and it feels really strange every time that pronounce it incorrectly. That probably wont annoy most people but, well, it kind of irritated me. Also oddly the camera work was not stable through most of the film. It may have been a stylistic choice I am not sure but that seemed kind of odd. <br/><br/>Even so those are pretty minor gripes in an otherwise excellent movie, well worth your time to watch."
"lajoswinkler","9","2","8","12 October 2018"," High quality, immersive drama with historical background
","My personal opinion is that Gosling should get an Oscar for his role. He strongly embodied Armstrong's humble character and behaviour. His emotions are visible through his actions even though he hides them from plain sight and behaves like a humble introverted engineer.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call the film breathtaking because that word is prostituted nowdays and mostly describes something this film has taken a giant step away from. It's not a Hollywood blockbuster with DUUUUUUUNNNNNNNNNN sounds and seizure camera designed to hide disgustingly bad CGI.
Also, it doesn't show the physical grandeur of space. We've all seen those things and they've kind of became cliché.
This is a film where launches are shown from inside the cockpit, with rumbling and metal plate clacking, screeching. It's very immersive and semiclaustrophobic at times.
It has lots of peaceful moments that have deep meaning. It lets certain things to sink in.
It's not ""oh man, I'm on top of the world, I'm so awesome!"".
Far from that, and I'm so grateful to the team to make a film like this. Neil would be proud of it as his family says they are.<br/><br/>All those annoying political squealings about ""the flag not being shown"" are blatant LIES, as expected.
The very moment of placing the flag was not shown, and the flag itself was visible, both small flags throughout the movie and the one on the Moon.
But that's not even important and would detract the viewer from the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>This is not a film about political power or ""us Americans"" or even ""us humans"".
This is a VERY personal film about Neil and his coping with the loss of his daughter and colleagues, but the accent is on the daughter Karen.
If the squealers thought this was a film about ""great USA conquering of the Moon"", they don't need to watch it because it's not. It's a film which does a great job showing how one man reached a pinnacle of his career while grieving.
Lunar EVA scene is not long as I expected it to be. There are hardly any technicalities shoved in our faces because the way it was filmed tells a story about a man. There's no ""explaining things to the audience by characters speaking things they normally wouldn't"". If you know what certain thing is/does, you'll recognize it.
While Aldrin is jumping around (he's portrayed as a kind of goofball without many social breaks), Neil is standing there, his face not shown. We see a gold plated visor staring into desolation of lunar surface which is the metaphor for a man hiding his feelings, confronted with nothingness which is actually his feelings looking back at him. In a brief moment of personal goodbye to his late daughter, he lifts the visor and we can see him crying. Very powerful, subtle storytelling.<br/><br/>Neil's wife Janet (played by Foy) is, contrary to same lying squealers, NOT portrayed as ""typical hysterical woman who takes a dump on man's accomplishment"". At the contrary, her role and performance are very realistic. She's not unreasonable and ungrateful like certain film wives have been portrayed over the decades.<br/><br/>Now something on the subject of special effects.
Film photography is such that, at first, I had a feeling it's made to resemble Neil's memories, but the effect stays throughout the movie. It's the grain and just slighly weird white balance that looks close to the high quality color film rolls. And there's some camera movements that reproduce manual mechanism of old cameras which I always liked.<br/><br/>Scenes on the Moon are different. They're pristine, they resemble the quality of Apollo film magazines taken by Hasselblad cameras. The Sun is blindingly white place in the perfectly black sky.
Scenes in orbit, especially during Agena mission of Gemini, resemble color films of the time.<br/><br/>The silence of vacuum is respected nearly 100% of the time. Great deal of scenes in orbit are taken with the vantage point of camera on the hull of the ships, just like in Interstellar. Also, models seem to be real objects, very much like in Interstellar, which is very nice.<br/><br/>If you want to watch a quality drama with historical backbone, go ahead, you won't be disappointed."

"orlando-somera","9","2","9","14 October 2018"," A moving tribute to a brave man and country
","As someone old enough to know what was going on back when Armstrong walked the moon, I found this movie a gentle correction of what I thought I knew about the Apollo program. The sheer guts it took to mount one of the giant Saturn rockets is made palpable as is the ordeal waiting was for the families on the ground. It really was our finest hour and the director is right to close in on the way it was experienced by the first man on the moon, his friends and his family. Claire Foy as his wife is so vividly captured that I could imagine she was my wife too. That's quite a trick especially as my wife told me Foy's performance made the movie more real for her too.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's performance is harder to talk about. Armstrong was not that easy to know despite all the attention he'd garnered after his Apollo mission. He was not that forthcoming. I thought I'd kept reasonable track of events in our space program but it quickly became clear I had missed some relatively important parts of the story. Gosling takes us through the events without imposing any kind of heroic attitude on him. And you do feel Armstrong was probably one those silent guys who was serious and unusually gifted. And that's as close as anyone will ever get.<br/><br/>I found this film moving and artful. It annoyed me that the camera shook early on, but that pretty much stopped fairly soon except for scenes within the rocket which was appropriate because in real life there was terrible vibration."

","Reaching to the stars, traveling through the final frontier, and making contact with the unknown is what the science fiction authors are all about. To think that the dream was realized years ago is a feat many still to this day question. Tonight, my review is about the adventure to the stars and the men who led the way. Wrapping up my revies this week, tonight yours truly analyzes the largely advertised, potentially award winning, biography about Neal Armstrong entitled: <br/><br/>Movie: First Man (2018)<br/><br/>Director:
 Damien Chazelle
Writers:
 Josh Singer (screenplay by), James R. Hansen (based on the book by) 
Stars:
 Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Jason Clarke<br/><br/>
LIKES: <br/><br/>The Acting: A big role like this requires big talent and Gosling has stepped up to the new psychologically heavy, portrayal of the man who journeyed to the stars. His depth portrayal of the role is top notch, a balance of a dramatized role that feels realistic and very reflective of the psyche of space travel. Claire Foy on the other hand drops into a very regal and strong role, expressing the other side of the coin as the wife of an astronaut. Their chemistry works together, and the focus on each one leads to amazing performances that makes for endearing characters. <br/><br/>The Immersive Experience: You want to feel like you are blasting off into space? You've got it! You want to feel like you are being strained by an overwhelming array of G Force? You've got it. You want? Okay I think you get it. First Man's team did their best to get you strapped into the space exploration experience and did a fine job in my opinion. One will feel like they are experiencing this first hand, with a screen that rattles, sound effects that dropped you into the heart of the mission, and a number of technical terms to further enroll you in the experience. <br/><br/>The Setting: I'm a sucker for movies successfully taking you back in time. First Man takes us back into the time period of the 60s, bringing the cars, looks, houses, and hairstyles to really bring you into the decade of exploration. First Man keeps all the themes rolling and adds that extra bit of magic by introducing a gritty filter to help you achieve the effects of watching the events through the new reels of yore. This may not seem super cool or necessary, but that extra nostalgia helps pull the experience to new heights so nice work there. <br/><br/>Unique Approach: First Man decides to go a little more abstract in its presentation than the normal historical documentary. A realistic portrayal with minimal magic, First Man is always about taking an event and then having you reflect on it. The result is a psychological trial of experiencing the stress of this field of research, that helps with experiencing the historical prowess of this space travel. While this approach will not be for everyone, it gets points for making an effort to be unique and artistic while also to the point. <br/><br/>The Portrayal of Struggle: I agree with my fellow audience members that First Man did a fantastic job expressing the difficulties of getting this mission off the ground. From the failures of the testing modules, the setbacks of equipment burning out, and to the very stresses of the rocket itself, all of it is nicely detailed in this movie. You'll not be subjected to montages or magical findings, but instead get the bare facts to provide the full on knowledge of the issues this program faced. <br/><br/>
DISLIKES: <br/><br/>Other characters: It's not that the other characters are bad, it's the fact that they aren't utilized as well as I wanted. Much of Armstrong's group, with the exception of the wife, are only fragments of the story overall. I wanted to see more interactions with them, get their input and contributions to the story, instead of the dram filled moping they chose to focus on. Why they did this I don't know, but I believe the abstract approach has much to do with this. <br/><br/>The Heavy Jargon: I mentioned earlier how the movie immerses you and sadly it does this a little too well. The special effects drown out a lot of meaningful conversation in this movie, reducing the lines to mumbling, incoherent rants that aren't easy to follow. Even for what you can hear, the movie relies very heavily on jargon and technical lingo, which if you don't subscribe to physics or rocket science may not be the most interesting thing to listen to. <br/><br/>Mindset vs Program: The abstract direction taken in this movie works for getting into the head of the characters, and you'll get plenty of shots of Gosling trapped in his mind, moping in a teary-eyed mess as he relives his experiences. It's beautiful artistically, but it's not the most entertaining as I came to see more of the design to get to the moon. Like Hidden Figures I wanted character development and integration than psychological reflection that a book is better at hitting. Regardless, this approach didn't quite work in terms of my expectations or entertainment value<br/><br/>Dragging Pace: The biggest thing for me... is this movie is slow at times. It has to do with how long it takes for us to get into the meat of the program, only to be then be dogged down by more personal life components than the exciting tests you want to see. As such, this constant up and down presentation that didn't quite work for me and had me fighting sleep at times. <br/><br/>The VERDICT: <br/><br/> First Man is different from what I expected. It's unique presentation is going to be the make or break for modern audiences and whether or not they will enjoy this movie. Those looking for a realistic, well-acted, artistic, immersive approach will enjoy the historical representation of this movie. However, if you wanted that Hollywood magic, entertainment, and more like a story presentation, than this film is not going to be your cup of tea. First Man is certainly a piece of work, but it all depends on the type of experience you want. Worth a trip to the theater? I think so for the effects and the food for thought, but otherwise hold out until next week when blockbusters return. <br/><br/>

Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0"

","A frank, pull-no-punches look at the personal and professional life of the failed test pilot and famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong. His is a tale of grand success and global recognition, of course, but also one of frequent, intense tribulation. From routine near-death experiences at the office to a mortally sick young daughter at home, Neil's life seems like a constant source of tension and immense emotional pressure. A quiet, reserved man, he internalizes most of that pain, but it's still evident. Ryan Gosling does a remarkable job at conveying this inner trauma, roiling behind a stoney poker face and a collected physical presence, and the film backs him up by presenting several situations in which that strict sense of cool personal composition literally saves his life. First Man spends a lot of time gazing inwardly, but that's balanced by a series of riveting, high-pressure scenes inside the cockpit. These are utterly insane; barely-contained chaos set to the tune of a constant, deafening roar, all kept in check via a series of well-timed switch flips and a whole lot of white-knuckled prayers. Space movies need never want for great action scenes, particularly when they're inspecting this particular age of DIY floundering, and this one provides yet another impressive step forward in that department. An excellent balance of humanity, practical science and death-defying physical risk-taking."

Everyone in the production - in front of the camera and behind - should be embarrassed with this soporific retelling of the first manned moon landing. I remember the event well and Neil Armstrong was not a block of wood as presented by Ryan Gosling. Gosling doesn't get all the blame - after all, there was a director on the set, calling the shots.
I've seen better depictions of paint drying. I was beginning to think their budget was cut because the camera lingered in dark closeups for interminable amounts of time.
Oh yes, it must be said, that this was an American mission that took years of effort and our taxes - to accomplish successfully. So, why were there no shots of the American flag planted on the moon? Would it have offended viewers so much that they wouldn't have watched? Not likely. More likely - the lousy production.
This was a waste of time, money and the opportunity to inspire future generations. And that's much worse than leaving out a shot of the American flag on the moon.

","Directed by Damien Chazelle. Starring Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy, Kyle Chandler, Ciarán Hinds, Jason Clarke, Corey Stoll, Shea Whigham, Christopher Abbott, Lukas Haas, Patrick Fugit, Olivia Hamilton, Gavin Warren. (PG-13)<br/><br/>Visually striking but curiously earthbound biopic/historical drama focusing on Neil Armstrong (Gosling) and NASA's efforts to put him on the moon during the 1960s. Film's brushstrokes are often painted in a detached, procedural fashion, aiming more for docudrama authenticity than stirring melodrama. While this pursuit seems appropriate given the enigmatic character of its hero, it misses out on opportunities to find the music and poetry in such a colossal endeavor, only occasionally finding its beating heart and expressive imagination. Nevertheless, the technical achievement on display cannot be overlooked (especially the sensational X-15 test pilot and lunar landing sequences) and the script and performances are solid across the board; Foy, as Armstrong's wife, Janet, stands out among the reliable cast. Could have been a nice companion piece to ""The Right Stuff"" (which focused on the Mercury program, while this one involved the Gemini and Apollo missions), but can't compete with the earlier masterpiece in scope, meaning, or entertainment value; still worth a look, though, especially to those interested in the space race.<br/><br/>74/100"

","...there's just no way in getting around it. By rights no film about space expiration should ever be anything other than spectacular. This begins with a stellar opening scene and the story arc flows pretty well from there. True it's a bit by the numbers, with a solid dose of Hollywood tropes, but it's gripping and fun. Much more Apollo 13, than 2001, it's a biopic with the drama ramped up and stylised for a mass audience. Ryan Gosling does what he does best, zero emotion and to the film's credit, it's dirtier, more raw than the aforementioned Tom Hanks yeehaw America is great advert. It's not super in depth, but the loss of life in the space program is front and centre and this does give it a more realistic edge. The best thing though is the sound design. Not to take anything away from the lovingly recreated grim reality of 60s space travel, but there's a subtlety in the sound work that lifts this just that bit higher."

"gradyharp","7","1","3","17 March 2019"," 'It'll be an adventure'
","One of the most memorable quotes in the past hundred years is the familiar 'That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind' - the words we all heard when Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969. James' R. Hansen's book has been adapted for the screen by Josh Singer and the film is directed by Damien Chazelle (La La Land, Whiplash).<br/><br/>The film covers the years 1961 - 1969 in the life of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling), beginning with Armstrong's trials as a pilot and proceeds through his training for the Gemini mission and the famous moon landing. Along the way the psyche of the astronaut is explored by revealing his interactions with his wife Janet (Claire Foy) and terminally ill daughter Karen (Lucy Stafford), his friend and fellow astronaut Ed White (Jason Clarke) and his wife Pat (Olivia Hamilton) whose lives alter Neil's perception of his mission. Nods are given to Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll), Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and other very small cameos.<br/><br/>Much of the film is very loud, with all the harrowing tension that accompanies the launching and flight of spacecraft extended to near the breaking point. The facts are there but what is missing is a storyline that allows the audience to accompany Armstrong's historic mission. It is a noisy adventure with rather flat performances by the main characters, but it does encourage recall of that momentous day in 1969 with reality."

Now talking about the movie, I feel it could have explored the dynamics between Armstrong & Aldrin since both were risking it together. It appeared as if NASA had put two strangers (actually three) into the cockpit which really wouldn't be the case. The humane side of Armstrong has been depicted well by Gosling & given that the movie is about ""First Man"", it is going to be biased about Neil anyway. Even though I watched Gravity (which seemed too gimmicky & an unnecessary Clooney), this is a better watch."

"AhmedSpielberg99","8","1","3","5 March 2019"," Maybe not Out of This World, but it's Stellar!
","Damien Chazelle has designed claustrophobic atmosphere to externally replicate the melancholy that surrounds our grief-stricken protagonist and his family. Moreover, the contrast between the omen of failure that permeates almost every scene and Armstrong's commitment to achieve his goal added up something quite special to the movie.<br/><br/>Besides being devastated and heartbroken, we often see that Armstrong is incapable of communicating or expressing his feelings to his dearest ones. And there are few actors nowadays who can portray such an introvert character dealing with repressed emotions, depression and anxiety. Actually there might be no one who is up for this task, except for one guy; the inimitable awesome Canadian, Ryan Gosling, who is able to express any character's feelings with the slightest and simplest facial expressions. Claire Foy is almost equally brilliant. And it weren't for her and Gosling, it would be extremely difficult for me to feel any tension and sorrow at certain moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the movie suffers a great deal on the dramatic level, despite all the feels Chazelle and the two leads have succeeded to convey. First and foremost, the documentary-like structure of the movie hindered the experience of watching it so badly. The movie contains of chapters that don't always even seem to be connected to each other. Sometimes the movie simply jumps from an event to another, and then tries to convince us that it's all related by showing how our protagonist is traumatized by a certain tragic incident. That leads us to my second issue, which is this very tragic incident. Despite the fact it plays a major part in the story and not only for the sake of emotional manipulation, this tragedy that the movie leans upon solely as a motivation for the protagonist, as well as an integral part of the dramatic aspect, is clichÃ©d, unconvincing, surprisingly weak, and utilized quite poorly. It's a miracle that it worked very well at the end as well as everything else in the awe-inspiring, breathtaking, gorgeous-looking, extremely intense and immensely satisfying final act that followed a thrilling climax.<br/><br/>First Man is one of those biopics where you know what is about to happen, but can't help but get caught up in the rising suspense of its breathtaking scenes. The movie should have been nominated from the Academy in many other categories, including best Cinematography, and, of course, Best Actor and Actress in Leading Roles for Gosling and Foy, respectively. I would be lying if I said that I didn't find it a bit disappointing, but it's only so because I expected better, or rather to be permanently engaged throughout its running-time, from one of my all-time favorite filmmakers.<br/><br/>(8/10)"

","""First Man"" is incredible. The main complaint I see is that ""It's boring"" and ""They made space exploration boring"" and those people were probably expecting this movie to be something like Star Wars. First Man is a very slow movie that the average viewer may not be able to sit through. Ryan Gosling's acting is excellent and conveys a very realistic character in Neil Armstrong, who this movie is completely about. This movie isn't about the NASA mission or how we got to the moon; it's about Neil and it's all from his perspective. We see Neil's tragedies, his accomplishments. The music is incredible when it does play since a lot of the movie is quiet (for good reason). The moon landing scene is spectacular and you feel so much for Neil Armstrong and you feel like you are on the moon yourself. The main thing this movie suffers I believe (and it's a nitpick) is the characterization of Buzz Aldrin, who feels like an extra with occasional lines in the movie. He jokes about things that aren't funny in the movie and he becomes kind of unlikable, which I'm not sure if the real Buzz Aldrin was like that, but you don't care about him very much, which isn't good since he was the second man on the moon. As a movie that focuses on Neil Armstrong and his feelings alone; it's excellent. It's slow which is nice since it makes it so much more of an experience, rather than a quick action blockbuster. This movie is incredible and if you think it's boring then it's just not a movie for you; it doesn't mean it's bad, it's out of this world."

","There are a lot of comments about the movie being boring, and I agree that if you were looking for a space movie as exciting as Apollo 13, then this movie falls way short. However, if you are anticipating a factual, historically accurate portrayal of one of the most monumental moments in history, then this movie is for you.
I was able to walk away from this movie pleased. This movie gives a personal, in depth look into the first man to walk on the moon, about his life leading up to the lunar landing. It's raw, emotional, and doesn't use the usual Hollywood drama to make it more exciting. It would have been easy to recreate the lunar landing in a grandiose way for the audience, but much harder to portray the life of the most famous astronaut to ever live, and this film accomplished that."

According to Jim Lovell, the commander of Apollo 13, they even had something of a new-car smell. In the movie, however LEM interior (even before landing on moon surface) has Millenium Falcon feel - tou can exactly see that some switches look like used/old or dirty. Huge mistake. Someone from studio had mixed facts, astronauts reported that LEM looked dirty after lunar landing due the fact that after moonwalking they took some dirt from moon soil into LEM on their spacesuits."

I think what alot of people are getting wrong about this was the fact it wasnt made to be crazy action movie or so, since it is biography.<br/><br/>
I think Neil was too robotic in the movie, felt bit like Spock from Star Trek.

","This film isn't bad but it isn't anywhere near as good as The Right Stuff. For me, the film drags on too much about Neil's ""personal life"" (yawn). The director had a wealth of space and technical story lines to follow but a large bulk of this film deals with Neil and his wife (Zzz). I found that part of film slow, boring and a tad pointless. To cap it off, the film then only spends about 5 minutes dealing the moon landing. Regarding the flag issue, as a Brit who was born in 1971, I generally would have liked to have seen the moment the flag was planted. It's a part of history I didn't see live and it doesn't bother me that American's planted it. It's an iconic moment in human history so to not see it was a strange call to make. To sum up, I enjoyed the film; however, it was just a bit slow and dull in places. 6.5/10 does it for me."

The massive scope of the project to put a man on the moon is barely hinted at, all you see is an attempt at a personal story and it still feels empty, you just see a man brood, as if mystery were enough. The lack of depth extends to the mission portions as well, lots of close up of faces, lots of quick cuts, but no clever illustration of what problems he faced and how he was solving them, you see quick cuts, his face, and random disorientation. Its the shortcut of a story teller who doesn't know how to tell a story and that pretty much sums up the movie.<br/><br/>There are so many missed opportunities, in one scene Neil is in a class learning about his mission, but they show and say almost nothing. Simply showing the physics equations would have told the audience this was no ordinary man, he was aeronautical engineer who could understand such things. These are rudimentary techniques in story telling on film which is why its so perplexing.<br/><br/>Just look at the first scene with the x15, compare it to the first scene of ""When we left the earth: The NASA Missions"" which covered the very same flight and compare the impact, this films version just pales in comparison to a documentary's edit from a decade ago. ""Neil Armstrong X15 - When we left earth."" on youtube contains the clip. That 1 minute segment evokes more emotion and understanding than this film does over 2 hours.

He was modest and quiet, not a showman, so this is not a super fast full of explosions movie, it's a character movie. The story has its faults, sometimes the movie suffers from the pace of the story, it feels like something it's missing, but not the flag bull***t, something about the context of the story itself.

The movie is bound to win a lot of awards in the technical categories and I hope Justin Horowitz and Linus Sandgren are awarded. They have managed to replicate their La La Land work in this film too.

First Man succeeds in ways that other space exploration films normally don't go for, emotional consequence.

Most of the film takes place on earth with the family and friends. This, and the beautiful 16mm handheld camerawork help to create a spectacle and one of the best biopics I've seen.

","Being a pilot, I'm a sucker for any aviation/space related movie. The opening scene was great and it went downhill from there. This movie picks up where the Right Stuff leaves off, but fails to deliver the same perspective. From the Earth to the Moon, does a way better job of portraying Apollo 11. I thought Neil Armstrong's portrayal was bland and melancholy. Maybe that was true to life, but if that's so, why not tell us more about Buzz Aldrin who more interesting colorful character and contributed far more to the space program than almost anyone."

"joemhoward","8","1","3","11 November 2018"," It is a portrait of a man haunted by death...

It's never syrupy, though the controversial bracelet scene is a pure stab at your heart<br/><br/>People came into this movie with preconceptions of what should be on screen. We got a sort-of biographical movie about a man who wanted to complete his mission and who was never happy in the spotlight, with a troubled heartbreaking family past and a troubled family present. This was never about jingoism, nor not even about heroism. It was about the nuts and bolts of life and how we cope it situations. I personally loved this movie. It portrayed Armstrong at the most dramatic moments of his life, and tied them back to the most debilitating, heartbreaking one of all.<br/><br/>But I guess, some of you don't get that"
"PotassiumMan","9","1","3","10 November 2018"," Neil Armstrong biopic with one of Gosling's best performances to date
","Damien Chazelle goes into biopic territory with this compelling film about the man who first set foot on the Moon in 1969. Although it doesn't always offer the most incisive telling of his story, it gives us a good sense of how Armstrong went from a back-up astronaut, whose professional skill was the subject of much disagreement among his superiors to one of the central players in America's race with reach the Moon in the 1960's.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is not always known for roles that are too serious. But his trademark irony and youthful foibles are jettisoned in favor of something a bit more stolid and deliberate- and he excels here. My only complaint would be that he eclipses everyone else, including Claire Foy as his devoted wife, Corey Stoll as Buzz Aldrin and Jason Clarke as the astronaut Ed White who died in the Apollo 1 pre-launch test.<br/><br/>The sequences of space travel and the landing of the Moon can be quite jittery and unstable, but it does bring to the big screen the nerve-racking experience of space exploration and how much of a risk it was for those who undertook it. If you are susceptible to motion sickness, like my friend who watched it with me, it's a good idea to prepare for this film. The early part of the film also uses 35mm as a way of recapturing the era it takes place in. History buffs and space film aficionados will find a lot to enjoy here as Chazelle brings everything to life. Gladly recommended."
"Alexander_Blanchett","8","1","3","9 November 2018"," Strong biopic
","An interesting lesson in history. That's what it actually really is. Somehow like those history movies you saw at school. Oh dont get me wrong.. some of them were good. This is definitely a good film but it is not an outstanding film. I've waited many years for a Neil Armstrong biopic and always wondered why there was never one. Now I know, I guess his life was not too spectacular. But there were conflicts. Lots of them. Damien Chazzelle understood to portray many of those great but ignored some others or at least underestimated them.
The acting was fantastic tho. Ryan Gosling gives one of his absolutely finest performances. He understood his character perfectly. The magic of his performance lies in the fact that also in his silent moments he was perfectly able to express the inner conflict of his character. You always had the impression you feel what Armstrong was feeling. Kudos to this very subtle performance by Gosling. Also Claire Foy was fantastic. She had many moments that just asked for overacting but she was in perfect control of those. A very touching performance and not just another grieving wife performance. Glad she managed the turn from a fantastic TV actress to a phenomenal cinema presence. The supporting guys were also good. Most notable Cory Stoll and Jason Clarke.
The cinematography was spectacularily unspectacular. The score was beautiful however and I liked that it wasnt just one tune through the whole thing but many different ones, always fitting the situations. A very versatile composition. Sound and Editing were top notch. The screenplay was fine enough , I guess just a little bit dry at times. All in all a good biopic of a true icon. Worth to see for sure."

"Sjors_v_Z","8","1","3","6 November 2018"," A very solid biopic
","The best thing about this film is the acting, terrific performances were given by both Claire Foy and Ryan Gosling. There are also very few flaws in the supporting cast.
The soundtrack by Justin Hurwitz is very solid and in some cases even outstanding. The music does in a way remind me of some of Interstellar's epic moments, although, as I admire that film greatly, it isn't on the same level. Some parts of the first half of the movie can admittedly be a bit slow but once it pickes up the pace it becomes very enjoyable. This applies especially for a few shocking scenes that did quite suprise me. However, since this is a biopic, the story never took on a direction that was very unanticipated and although that is unavoidable, it brought the movie down a bit. This is overall just a good movie with a solid story and some moments that stand out, but in the end it doesn't do anything revolutionairy"

Especially when we first step on the moon with Neil (not really a spoiler).<br/><br/>At times this felt like it was Tarkovsky-esque with it's lingering shots that show more than just an image but a meditation of what can be; of where we can go. There are some flaws but. and I don't say this lightly, but if you can look past some of the gratuitously shaky 16mm shots of Gosling's face, you've got this generations 2001.<br/><br/>Strong film.

","I am of that age. I was a 10 year old when my Dad woke me up to watch, along with hundreds of millions of other Earthlings, the live televised broadcast of Neil Armstrong taking the first steps on the Moon. This movie brought back all the wonder and glory, brilliance and sacrifice of the US space program during the 1960s. Yes, the way too shaky, nauseating ""cinema verite"" literally forced me to look away just when I wanted most to take in those dramatic expressions and honest, personal moments that made the portrayals of the central characters believable and poignant. Nevertheless, the power and terror of the death defying flight scenes brought home the epic heroism, discipline, courage and fortitude of Neil Armstrong. The Moon landing was outstanding, thrilling but not failing to make it absolutely real that the two astronauts were just seconds away from their doom before touchdown. The Moon walk scene was awe inspiring and emotional, reproducing essential moments but leaving room to experience the stillness and literal otherworldliness of the moment.
See this movie, feel a bit of that extraordinary greatness, literally a unique accomplishment for all time, and be awestruck by the people who achieved it."

","This film is a must see. Ryan Gosling is a perfect fit for the role. I expected this film to be very Hollywood-ey, but I was very wrong. This is a very honest and emotional synopsis of the life of Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>Neil was a man who was surrounded by death all throughout his life, and he narrowly escapes death many times. This film focuses in on the emotions and moral difficulties he has. For example, pushing away his family as he is about to leave, the death of his daughter, ect.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is an amazing fit for the role, and perfectly portrays Armstrong as a slightly withdrawn man, who is a born leader and highly determined. Don't think anyone could've played him better.<br/><br/>Overall, must see film."
"fsgregs2","2","1","3","30 October 2018"," Neil Armstrong could not have been this bad!
","This movie title is ""First Man"", so presumably, it is supposed to be a biographical sketch about the guy who first walked on the moon. It is based in fact, on a biographical book about Armstrong. Given that, hopefully, the theoretical reason that director Damien Chazelle, actor Ryan Gosling and their production team chose to make the movie, was because Neil Armstrong was such an interesting, likable character and his story so compelling that a big audience would want to see it and learn more about him.<br/><br/>If that was their goal, they failed miserably. The movie they made depicts Neil Armstrong to be ... so unlikable, so obtusely stoic, so mindbogglingly unemotional and boring, that no one in the audience gives a damn about watching him. Ryan Gosling played Armstrong with such a blaze' lack of emotion that in the entire movie, I don't think he smiled even once. He did not raise his voice. He did not get excited. His voice, his persona, his behavior during all the crazy excitement of spacecraft launches, testing, saying goodbye to his family, landing and walking on the moon for God's sake, was as emotional as a toad, and that is saying a lot. All the camera kept doing, was zooming into closeups of his inexpressive, boring, almost zombie-like face. If the plot of the movie was to depict Neil Armstrong as a mindless but intelligent robot with no emotion chip at all, then it would have worked. The movie was NOT about that!<br/><br/>Frankly, as I watched scene after scene play out, I just keep thinking ... who cares about this guy? Why would anyone spend millions of dollars to bring us a biography of such a one-dimensional, boring, lackadaisical, even dis-likable character? If this was the real Neil Armstrong, then its no wonder his wife finally divorced him. If not, which there is evidence he was not, then Chazelle and Gosling really did him and their movie audience a big disservice.<br/><br/>What is sad is that this is good fodder for the Oscars. Character biopics are supposed to be good ""best picture"" or ""best actor"" material. Sadly, Ryan Gosling had such an easy role here (don't smile, yell or show any emotion ... just stare into the distance for two hours worth of scenes), that if he is nominated in 2019, it will be a real tragedy. Neither he nor his director deserve it.<br/><br/>First Man has a few good points. The sound effects made the movie watchable. It should get an Oscar for sound effects. In some scenes, you get the clear impression that these men were put into metal boxes with a few switches and controls, and thrown into space with a good possibility that the whole thing would crash and burn. NASA was that primitive in those days. However, as a Biography of the man who first landed on the moon, either it sucked, or that man was someone you would not really care if you ever came to know!"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","1","3","30 October 2018"," A Gosling that you just have to see; and such regal poise in Foy's Janet Armstrong
","The success of this biopic, against the usual setback (that is, no element of suspense), should be credited to all: writing (Josh Singer - ""Spotlight, ""The post""), directing (Damien Chazelle - ""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"") and acting, particularly acting.<br/><br/>The movie starts with two brief defining sequences. With no preliminaries, it serves notice that if you are claustrophobic, continue watching at your own risk. It puts you in Neil Armstrong's position, literally, looking out from his face mask to the rocking, dizzy surroundings of instrument penal and switches, as well as getting glimpses of the vast open of nothingness outside, wondering if this is the last thing you see. At the completely polarized, heartbreaking opposite, you will the see him cradling toddler daughter Karen who is dying of cancer.<br/><br/>While the last hour of this 140-minute movie is absolutely riveting, it runs a tad too long in establishing the familiar historical environment, down to using 78 RPM records, and then the song ""500 Miles"". Interesting though it is to observe people still using pen and paper to write notes, even in the cockpit! At about mid-point, it picks up momentum with the cliff-hanger (despite the no-surprise innate setback, thanks to good direction and audio background) of the malfunctioning ""Gemini 8"" sequence.<br/><br/>If I were to pick the most defining scene, it will have to be saying goodbye at home before heading out to the climactic finale of the moon landing mission. Stop for a second to consider the scenario: it is a journey not one single individual being had ever experienced since the dawn of humanity when they stood erect, leaving their identity of apes behind. How do you say goodbye to your family before such a journey to the moon?<br/><br/>Neil busies himself packing, to kill time as well as to numb his emotion, but Janet's insists that he say goodbye to the two boys (around 8, 9 maybe). To prepare them for the fact that he might never come home, she says, a job only he can do. ""I'm done with it"" she adds emphatically. The entire family sits around the kitchen table as the boys ask a couple of simple questions which lead to some technical talk from the father. Then, dead air. When Neil prompts for any more questions, one of the boys finally asks if he might not come back, a possibility he acknowledges. Janet seems satisfied and with a ""that's it"" look, and sends the boys to bed. One of the boys hugs him. The other holds out a small hand to shake.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed watching Ryan Gosling, since ""The Believer"" (2001), and always seen him as a charismatic, powerful actor. As taciturn Neil Armstrong, Gosling once again demonstrates his acting talent.<br/><br/>I would normally not use ""regal"" to describe Janet Armstrong who clearly has the stuff needed to be an astronaut's wife. Claire Foy however makes its fit, in the aforementioned scene. As well, during a crisis when she is right in NASA and refuses to leave, she confronts the backroom team with ""You're a bunch of boys making models out of basla wood. You don't have anything under control"".<br/><br/>There is a strong support cast including Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll and Ciaran Hinds, just to name the better-known ones. When Oscar nominations are announced sometime in January 2019, ""First Man"" will most certainly be included, although in what categories will be anybody's guesses."
"mikesuley","10","1","3","28 October 2018"," A Masterpiece.

","First Man Review:<br/><br/>First Man stars Ryan Gosling as Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, and the events leading up to it. I was super excited for this movie because Damien Chazelle has directed two of my favorite movies of all time: Whiplash and La La Land. I watched it for the first time this past Thursday and I liked it, but I had some issues with it. I just watched it again last tonight and just loved it! What I loved about this story is that it's more about him and his family rather than the mission in movies like Apollo 13. It's also a slow paced movie, which I like those kinds of movies too. It makes it feel more like this is real life happening right now. There were only a few spots where it was a little too slow. It's also a bit of a long movie but I didn't mind it. I thought it was cool that it created so much suspense even though we knew what was going to happen. Critics are really loving this movie but people seem to think it's just ok. I can only assume that they were expecting a film with more action and faster paced (I'll put down critic and audience scores below). The performances were amazing. Claire Foy is an amazing actress and her portrayal of Janet Armstrong was some of her best work. Some may think Ryan Gosling was monotone and boring in it but it can clearly be seen that he's been through a lot. The story includes the plot that their daughter, Karen, died at a very young age. I never knew about this and that's one of the things I loved about the film. It showed more to the story rather if it were just about the mission. But Neil was going through so much and he was very depressed. The mission took a toll on him. The story, as I was mentioning, showed us new things. People think Buzz Aldrin was an amazing person but he really wasn't. There's a scene where the family is all sitting down and they have to discuss that Neil may not come back that was really scene. There's something that happens on the moon in the scene and I don't know if it was true, but if it was it was one of the most beautiful moments in the movie. I found the astronaut training to be interesting. The last moments of the film where amazing. There's was no talking but there was so much to be said. The film has a lot of silent moments that I felt helped. The score by Justin Hurwitz was amazing as usual. He won his Oscars for La La Land in the categories of Best Original Score and Best Original Song (City of Stars). The score had a lot of calm moments, which I loved. During the intense moments had great music. There was one part during the Gemini 8 mission where it sounded like a symphony and it was beautiful. The the best part of the score was when they were on the moon. Damien Chazelle did amazing with his directing. He is my favorite directing as of now. He's a great writer and a wonderful director. He's won one Oscar, nominated for two others, and won two Golden Globes. He knows how to write well and puts that writing to the screen beautifully. I liked the editing for the film, although there was one spot towards the beginning where it was a little awkward. The cinematography was great. Linus Sandgren won his Oscar for La La Land and I can see him gagging nominated for this one. There were four shots on Earth just of the moon that I loved. They weren't really focused or anything but they were beautiful. This isn't a space film like Gravity where people were hyped for the special effects. They are good but they didn't need to be anything amazing. There was only one part where it was not that great but it only lasted for 10 seconds. This is a great film that seems to be overlooked with the big releases of late. Over the weekend it only made 16 million and I expected it to make more after all of the anticipation but I guess not. Definitely see this movie. It's great and you won't be disappointed! (Also the talk about the scene with the American flag not being on the moon is false. It's there if you look)<br/><br/>My Grade: A-<br/><br/>Rotten Tomatoes: 88% (certified fresh)

","If you're going into First Man wanting to see a cool story about the Apollo 11 moon landing, you will be disappointed in this film.
This is a brilliant, almost documentary style film about the life of Neil Armstrong. He experienced a lot of tragedy, which evolved him into a quiet man who chooses to keep his emotions bottled up, rather than opening up with friends and/or family.
Ryan Gosling displays this with subtle acting in his dialog and emotions and the outcome is incredible to see.
Gosling's terrific performance, along with Chazelle's remarkable eye behind the camera (as expected), makes for a very good film that you can expect to see nominated this Oscar season."
"Troy_Campbell","9","1","3","27 October 2018"," Emotionally powerful with breathtaking set pieces.
","You know how this story ends. Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) takes one small step for man, and one giant leap for mankind. The destination is not what's important here though, it's the journey. And what one hell of a journey. Coming off back-to-back critical darlings Whiplash and La La Land, filmmaker Damien Chazelle launches into biopic territory for his most mainstream movie yet. There may not be drumming solos and musical numbers, but Chazelle looks as comfortable as ever. His take on the story homes in on the domestic turmoil surrounding Armstrong's unwavering ambition; the sacrifices made, by both himself and wife Janet (Claire Foy), in the pursuit of something arguably more important than any one individual. Foy and Gosling are engrossing together on screen, his compartmentalised pain clashing against her unwillingness to let him slip away quietly. It's emotionally ferocious, and awards beckon for both actors. Chazelle doesn't let his stars do all the heavy lifting though, the flight sequences are visceral, claustrophobic and nerve-shreddingly intense. Whether it's a lunar flight test, a rocket lift-off or a pod landing, each sequence of flight is completely immersive. Composer Justin Hurwtiz and the sound design team deserve huge kudos; the powerful score combines superbly with the tension-building sound effects to really put the icing on the cake. It's testament to Chazelle's immense talent that the entire climactic sequence, all 30 minutes of it, is suspenseful, poignant and breathtaking, despite the outcome being known in advance. Biopic storytelling done right, First Man elevates above genre clichÃ©s to deliver a riveting domestic drama amongst a back drop of stunning space set-pieces."

","I was born in 1970, the year after the Apollo 11 moon landing. As a child I was crazy about astronomy; I spent countless hours reading books about the solar system, outer space and the Saturn V rocket, and wondering what it must have been like to fly to the moon. This film answers that question perfectly.<br/><br/>First Man is the story of a huge technical feat, but it is first and foremost a human drama. There is the private drama of Neil Armstrong's own family tragedy, the drama of lives lost and obstacles overcome in the years that preceded Apollo 11, and finally, the monumental drama of the mission itself. All of this is depicted with great sensitivity, artistry and humanity. And as the Apollo 11 flight lifts off, you're there in the cockpit with Armstrong and his two copilots; you experience not only the exhilaration of their achievement but also the fear that must surely have been their constant companion.<br/><br/>For me, this film is a masterpiece. I honestly can't imagine the story of Neil Armstrong and the Apollo 11 mission being told better."
"Quinoa1984","8","1","3","24 October 2018"," conventional in some ways, but its deep well of feeling and experimentation resonates
","Who knew what the astronaut dramatization needed was the aesthetic from Saving Private Ryan? (Or Man of Steel came to mind too, and here it is far more effective viscerally and emotionally, and apt as it is, you know, real people who have lived and suffered and triumphed)<br/><br/>Every time Damien Chazelle and company have one of the space sequences, from the opening to the Gemini 8 sequence, to the horror of the Apollo 1 test, it occurred to me that this is less the Right Stuff and more a hardcore war movie: these men are as much soldiers as they are scientists, and so the feel of the thing makes sense. If you're facing death and have an acceptance of it (not to mention in Neil/Jane's case, after the worst has already happened), that should ask of the storyteller something more than locked-down cameras. This is to outer space what Black Swan is to dance - there's largely horror to what happens and, if we're lucky, some awe, though not so much.<br/><br/>This resonates and the filmmakers use a mix of 16mm and 35mm photography to achieve the kind of intimacy that could grow old fast, and we've seen this style before, but, what can I say except I responded to Chazelle and Lundgren's closeups, the way they would keep some shots steadier than others to keep the pace off our guard, Gosling channels convincingly how men of engineering (and men often were in general) from that generation, and it's Claire Foy's time to win like 700 awards for this performance.<br/><br/>This is the kind of Oscar bait Im happy to watch, and I'm anticipating this will get best picture for reason to do and not do with the film in and of itself (in a sense this would win because Right Stuff, which is greater and more artistically ambitious, lost). And, man, seeing this in IMAX really does make a difference and feels a part of the whole thing (and unlike Nolan and Dunkirk, it doesn't change at random moments, it's IMAX on the moon and that's it). It's a gripping tension between conventional (the script) and experimental/loose (Chazelle).<br/><br/>...I might've liked Buzz Aldrin to come off as more than just an a-hole though (and Lukas Haas gets the short shrift as Mike Collins, who is barely even named that out loud). 8.5/10"
"kevin c","9","1","3","21 October 2018"," Out of this world
","Movie afternoon with Iris.<br/><br/>First Man is all about understated heroism. It's affecting precisely because Armstrong (played with quiet intensity by Gosling) doesn't feel the continual need to big himself up. This is no Apollo 13, and the study of grief and ongoing loss very affecting.<br/><br/>Claire Foy gives an exceptional performance as Armstrong's wife, Janet, the one always left behind and trying to hold the family together. Cliche maybe, but she brings the role to life. The backdrop of Vietnam, Civil Rights and the Cold War are also expertly woven in.<br/><br/>The testing phase is exhausting, frustrating and very dangerous. The sound of rattling blots and claustrophobia is terrifying. Music is almost as important to First Man as it was to Chazelle's La La Land. The score is both haunting and majestic.<br/><br/>We all know Armstrong made it to the moon, taking ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"". But it still generates buckets of suspense. Chazelle throws in footage of JFK's ""we choose to go to the moon"" and like that, this is inspiring intelligent film-making."
"ThomasDrufke","6","1","3","21 October 2018"," Disappointing
","Coming off of one of the most colorful and exuberant films of the last decade with La La Land, Damien Chazelle made a grim, colorless, and just plain dull film with First Man. It's not that the trailers ever wowed me or got me super excited, but I was certainly looking forward to seeing his follow up to one of my favorite films of all time. And heck, he even brought La La Land alum Ryan Gosling along with him. The problem with First Man has nothing to do with the whole American Flag controversy that people are complaining about, nor the tone really. It's more so the fact that this script is without life or energy. It trudges along from an amazing visual sequence to the next and the pacing is just tough to get through. It's also unfortunate that the characters are not likable at all and I found it difficult to connect to Gosling's performance as Neil Armstrong. I admittedly learned a lot and the story is undeniably fascinating, but I definitely could have used a more broad scope to the movie, instead of just Armstrong and the U.S. I get that's not the story they were telling, but I felt there was something missing.<br/><br/>6.6/10"

"timeblackmore","7","1","3","20 October 2018"," A Well Meaning Film With Some Controversial Creative Decisions
","There are two creative decisions I want to talk about with respect to this movie. The first of which I thought was mostly effective, yet slightly off-putting, and the second was mostly ineffective.<br/><br/>The first is that due to the large timeline these events took place over and complexity of the true story, Damien Chazelle chose the death of Neil's Daughter to be the emotional core of the story. This allowed him to bring together many seemingly unrelated events in a somewhat coherent way without sacrificing historical accuracy. This emotional framework also provided a way to filter other interesting events in Neil's life as there were just too many. The only off-putting effect of this, was the story would jump abruptly feeling somewhat disjointed. However, I do think this is preferable to altering history, changing people's roles, and performing other modifications to create a compelling narrative.<br/><br/>The unfortunate creative choice by Damien Chazelle, was to try and put the audience in the astronauts shoes. I should note that this this is actually an effective technique if performed correctly, as it was during some scenes like the first person view during the first step on the moon. Where I personally think it failed was the shaky cam during the high intensity scenes. I think Damien thought this was a good idea as it simultaneously put the audience in Neil's shoes and allowed the scenes themselves to be shot at a lesser cost. This certainly alleviated the need for zero g shots and outside spaceship shots. The problem however, is that while it did communicate the intensity of the situations, it did not communicative effectively the competency of the astronauts nor what was actually happening. Many of these scenes had the audience inwardly thinking, ""Oh, that dial is increasing, that isn't good, right?"" or ""Oh, Neil flipped a switch, I think everything is okay again?"". Compare this to other effective shaky cam scenes in other movies like Saving Private Ryan. In that movie on the beach, while the camera was shaking, the main character still had a very clear objective and the audience was aware of exactly what was happening. I think it would have been much better to clearly see what the astronauts were actually doing even if we do not understand it to demonstrate their competency. If my memory serves me correctly, they actually did this a bit with the final decent to the moon which I thought was shot very well. There are a couple other ways these scenes could be approached but what they did certainly was not the most effective.<br/><br/>In the end, I am still very glad that I went. I really appreciated the beautiful set recreations, getting an insight into astronaut training, and also learning about the pain that this influential person went through. I think in a few thousand years, his will be one of the few names that will be remembered, so I do think learning about this event is important. As a bonus, the conclusion was excellent."
"youssefmourad","9","1","3","19 October 2018"," Damien Chazelle is cinema's long lost son who once left to seek perfection and never came back.
","Chazelle's 'First Man' is an absolute cinematic masterpiece that can be labeled as 'Oscar Material'<br/><br/>First of all.. Acting :
Ryan Gosling nailed it as Neil Armstrong, I haven't seen Ryan this good so far.. He impersonated NEIL so well and showed all his sides so well that sometimes I felt I see the real Armstrong in front of me.
Claire Foy, what can I say? I saw her in' The Crown' TV series and she was great,.. But this! Breathtakingly outstanding performance as Jane Armstrong and she must be expecting some respectable awards for this role.
Great Displays from the rest of the acting cast specially Jason Clarke.. A big 'Chapeau' for the casting crew.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Academy award winner- Linus Sandgren
When I saw Sandgren's work in LA LA Land, I thought that's is the best work that he can ever do, and actually he won an Oscar for it, but today after I watched First Man he changed my mind, this guy still has a lot to offer.<br/><br/>A great thank you for Art Directing, Sound Mixing, Screenplay and special Thanks for the Editor.<br/><br/>Directing :
Today I can proudly say, Damien Chazelle is the legitimate heir to The cinematic directing Throne.
Damien's Rythm, Vision, Control, Sense were above everything.
You can see Damien's talent in every shot in the movie, also he was the reason this movie wasn't just a space travel movie, it was a leap inside human beings and how can life affects them whether here.. Or on the Moon.

"DFagundes","8","1","3","19 October 2018"," A very realistic approach to a biopic drama
","Damien Chazelle departs from the music-driven narratives of his previous films to a more sober, cold and contemplative work in First Man. In his storytelling, however, he keeps the focus on his characters and tries his best to convey their feelings through the performances of his actors. Claire Foy and Ryan Gosling really give their upmost performances to enhance the drama and convey their characters' feelings, anguishes and internal struggles. The final product is beautiful and well crafted, but somehow cold and disappointing. You feel like you should have been given more by the script, and even though you are invested in the characters (thanks to amazing direction and performances), the emotional peaks are not that high for the character arcs. To a certain extent, that was the best they could make out of a sad story involving a very introspective and cold lead man who doesn't have too many conflicting decisions to make. From that perspective, Gosling is perfect as Neil Armstrong. He really incorporates this introspective man who is in deep pain due to all the losses in his life, and through these moments has a difficult time dealing with his family, who supports him all the way through. These conflicts are as realistic as it gets, without glossing over and dramatizing too much, and you have to respect the film for that.
The editing and the camera work are also factors that help to create that atmosphere of loss and grief that filled his personal life, and are big technical achievements in this film. The way it was filmed give us the impression that we are there with those people, with all the documentary-like camera work, the close-ups, and the organic acting.
What the film lacks on dramatic and emotional impact relating to his personal struggles, it has enough to spare on the grandiosity of the moon landing experience. The film keeps its realistic approach when Armstrong goes to work, and what we see is the best picture of what NASA, the Gemini and Apollo missions should have been like back then. Its realism surpasses any other major film about space travel or science fiction, and for being so true to the facts and so aware of itself, it provides for a much deeper and meaningful impact when compared to those other films. The feeling we get whenever he's inside a spacecraft, everything shaking and loud, the claustrophobic sensations, are all very immersive, scary and deliver a great deal of adrenaline and suspense. The feeling of the moon landing is at the same time contemplative and sublime. The sound and the images during that scene put us in the head of Armstrong, and we get to experience what he went through in a very realistic way, and all that provides for a huge emotional climax.
During the plot development, we really get the perspective that anything could go wrong in any moment. All the events the story told before the moon landing were events of failure that gave us the impression that what they were doing was really dangerous and could really go wrong. This perspective on the risks and the amateurishness of all these programs was something new added by this film when compared to all others, that usually romanticize this part, adding difficulties just for plot development, and not really exploring the reality of it. That actually contributed to the overall experience, as we get to feel the horror of a loss, and the fear of something that is being achieved for the first time in history.
The film stands as a masterpiece of realistic depiction of an event, but not so much an emotional depiction of the character and his struggles, as the story wasn't able to feed us as much as necessary for us to care deeply about him."
"LloydBayer","9","1","3","19 October 2018"," First Man is an intimate account of how far one man went for the rest of mankind.
","The year 2019 will mark 50 years since an American astronaut landed and walked on the moon. In Hollywood fashion, it's only fair that a film celebrates this event as a glorious and patriotic anniversary. First Man is not that film. Neither is it a full-fledged biopic as the title seems to suggest.<br/><br/>If Whiplash, followed by La La Land were astounding films about the burning desire to go above and beyond the ordinary, returning director Damien Chazelle put's everything he's got into making First Man a poignant yet important story on what is probably the single most dangerous mission in the history of mankind. Yet until now, it hasn't seemed that way because junior school history books barely talked about the event without earmarking it as a historic date. Which is why Chazelle, along with scriptwriter Josh Singer (Spotlight and The Post) is audaciously tasked with not only gathering every detail that went into the Apollo 11 mission but also the brilliant yet impenetrable psyche of mission commander Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>Following the development of the space programme through the 1960s, much of Armstrong's story is told from a first-person perspective. His personal tragedy early in the film along with his real life repute as an introvert sets the tone of the film. There was nothing stopping Universal Pictures, including Executive Producer Steven Spielberg, from throwing in an extra 100 million bucks to make this film an action packed white-knuckle crowd pleaser. Instead, the entire film feels like a modest presentation of one of the most applauded events that contributed towards the modern space age. Through Ryan Gosling's deadpan eyes, Armstrong is a recluse and never the hero history says he is. In retrospect to the eventual moon landing, the space programme in this film is marred with failure after disastrous failure with funerals of fellow astronauts as the only punctuation. But all through Armstrong's progression from flight engineer to test pilot to eventually being strapped into a Saturn V Rocket aimed at the moon, we are also shown what he was as an ordinary civilian. His sorrow and self-doubt, coupled with remarkable calm and restraint, escalate into a vicious circle with each setback. Yet caught between the political pressure of the tax payer's dollar and his personal will to succeed, the film's most powerful moments are the sacrifices he makes as a father and a husband. Gosling gets this right in equal measure as Armstrong the man, the astronaut and the icon he would become.<br/><br/>Equally decisive is Armstrong's wife Janet (The Crown's Claire Foy) who in two limited but explosive scenes jumps the que for a Supporting Actress nomination. Whether Foy gets it isn't nearly as important as her conviction in portraying the anguish of a wife whose picture-perfect family is under constant threat by her husband's employer. This is a highly relatable predicament for millions of home-alone mothers whose waking nightmare is seeing their spouse return in a casket from a job they loved more. Such was the dwindling expectation from the mission that one moving scene even has a NASA representative pen a generalised obituary to the would-be widows of the few remaining astronauts. All the courage, sacrifice and tragedy are supplemented by a large assembly of supporting roles whose teamwork and on-screen camaraderie builds a formidable launch pad (no pun intended) for the best and most rewarding segment - the lunar landing.<br/><br/>Both technically and visually, First Man is almost flawless and deserves to be seen on the largest cinema screen available. Just like Armstrong, Chazelle also applies a lot of restraint in not only limiting exposition to a trickle, but also employing just the right amount of visual effects to tell the story. But even the little in this film instantly puts to shame the overuse of lavish visual and sound effects in big sci-fi titles like Gravity or Mission to Mars. Watching a group of suited up astronauts stuffed into a steel bucket held together with nuts and bolts is not only a claustrophobic experience for the viewer, watching that tiny capsule rattle and roll and hurtle at a speed of more than a thousand feet a second can be exhilarating and immersive. That's more than enough for the billions on Earth who can only dream of taking that flight of fantasy towards another world. First Man does that in a very intimate and down-to-earth way, when everything about this film is about a giant leap from the earth to the moon and beyond."
"ErolEsen-Personal","10","1","3","19 October 2018"," Stunningly Inspiring!
","First thing I had to do when I got home after the movie is check if Neil Armstrong really left something behind on the moon. No one knows. But it is true that Armstrong had veered from the mission script only once: he alone went to the edge of a nearby crater, and then came back to work.<br/><br/>The entire movie is intellectually, physically, and emotionally stunning. Very highly recommended!"
"MOscarbradley","9","1","3","18 October 2018"," Chazelle could be heading for his second Oscar
","In the opening moments of Damien Chazelle's new movie ""First Man"" we encounter Neil Armstrong on the periphery of space in a rocket that isn't doing what it's supposed to be doing. It's a terrific scene, genuinelly frightening, (even if we know Mr Armstrong is going to come out of it in one piece), shot up close and personal and superbly edited and directed by young Chazelle, (he's the youngest person ever to win the Oscar for Best Director). That's just the beginning of this brilliant film about the Gemini and Appolo Missions that saw Neil Armstrong become the first man to walk on the moon and there are several other heart-stopping moments to follow. This is the most authentic looking of all the manned space mission movies to date and Chazelle films it as if it were a documentary, which isn't to say he ignores the human side.<br/><br/>Armstrong is played by that most taciturn of actors, Ryan Gosling, and here the silences, the 'meaningful' stares really work for him. A lot of the time Chazelle chooses to shoot him in close-up and in Gosling's face we can read everything the man is feeling. He is matched by the much more pragmatic performance of Claire Foy as his wife. There is also not a jot of sentimentality on display despite there being every opportunity to milk it, (early on Armstrong's young daughter dies, several of his colleagues are killed and then, of course, there is the triumphalism of the ending). Instead Chazelle gives us a level-headed view of those years, even going so far as to paint Buzz Aldrin as a somewhat vain individual and including, at one stage, the protest number 'Whitney on the Moon'. The quietude of the ending is also deeply affecting and if Chazelle were to win his second Oscar for this I certainly won't be complaining."
"brankovranjkovic","8","1","3","18 October 2018"," First Man - The film focuses on the sacrifices and emotional cost to his family life and much less about the process behind getting to the moon.
","Tense exciting documentary drama, based on actual events.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays Neil Armstrong who was initially a test pilot, a man in pain following the loss of his young daughter to a brain tumour, he is obviously struggling with this. Neil Armstrong was a very quiet, private man but with drive and focus.<br/><br/>He successfully applies to NASA.<br/><br/>The film focuses on the sacrifices and emotional cost to his family life and much less about the process behind getting to the moon. There is a constant sense that the training astronauts were in real danger, there is a constantly sense that the mission could fail with no way back alive.<br/><br/>Of course we all know the mission outcome, at the end see the lunar surface and hear the iconic ""1 small step for man, 1 giant leap for mankind""<br/><br/>A very nice touch was seeing Neil drop his daughter's bead bracelet into the 'blackness' of a deep crater and in doing so his final closure. A well-made emotional biopic."
"dani-04658","7","1","3","18 October 2018"," It's not what I expected
","It's not what I expected. The action in the movie is developing too slowly. Visually, it is almost perfect, but the script and weak play of some actors alter it. I was expecting him to be in the battle for the Oscars, but even if he was nominated he would not be a real contender."
"cardsrock","8","1","3","18 October 2018"," Focuses on the very real human sacrifice
","Damien Chazelle's first two films are some of the best this decade, so to say I was looking forward to his third film is an understatement. While First Man is a well-crafted and acted film, it doesn't quite measure up to his previous films and other films that tackle similar subject matter. It's a bit long and slow to start, but the family drama on display is compelling and offers an unique perspective on the effects of the space race. A somber tone is present throughout, which creates an odd atmosphere for such a tremendous achievement, but it helps sell the particular story this movie is trying to tell. The sequences in flight and space are quite gripping as well."

"ilustra-neuropixel","7","1","3","17 October 2018"," Humanisation of the first extraterrestrial human
","Whiplash meant the discovery of a new very talented filmmaker and ... what a talent. 
Then La la land happened. Having Whiplash in his filmography, I thought... ""gush, what a great musical will emerge from this one"" and it did. But then the Oscar's came and... ""gush, what a shame"". A shame not for the fact that ""La la land"" did not win but for the entire Oscar thing and what it means. And it means a lot for many people. Moonlight was a great winner. Well... Damian had that face that says ""this is not happening"" as in a trauma thing. And indeed it would've been a trauma for anyone. A complete nightmare. Even so, I think the guys did manage to act as normal as possible. 
And now ""First man"" - Neil as a human. An extraterrestrial human. A lot of moments where feelings are trying to come to life but very few manage to reach a certain degree of life. And having children dying in a story would make anyone have some feelings - Damian thought of this. Of course. But I am talking about the other ones, not the obvious ones. And with this Nail fails to make me follow him in his trying to get on the moon. I was astonished by the amount of information that should've come to me as a viewer (to help me remain with the story)... did not do that in the end. In this regards, I felt that Damian is trying to defend a lie that he (himself) didn't find the strength to believe in. Or couldn't find it. I have a feeling many scenes were cut at the editing table. 
If the president of America can talk about an important moment in the movie and not realizing that he is not doing any favor for the movie then I can talk about it here as well: the flag moment. Or the absence of it. Having saying things about not having the strength to believe in a lie... the flag proves it clearly that... Damian couldn't defend himself from looking ridiculous in front of the people that understand what a possible truth means, if he would've inserted the moment. And there are many people like this out there - Americans or non-Americans. The presence of the absence of a moment like this made him credible in his trying to truly be sincere to his way of saying a story - the documentary style that he chose for the movie. But they made it clear when asked by the media what is the directorial reason behind the absence of a moment like it and the answer was more than reasonable - ""Armstrong did not say '....a giant leap for America'"" He said indeed humanity. And humanity it was indeed: the entire world was watching the way America was becoming great! 
So what is about this movie about the ""First man"" on the moon? Felt like I am watching lots of documentary stile shots, where a man doesn't have to try to look human at all because he is human by default. It's not the fact that I can't believe in the movie out of disrespect of what America became with Trump in office (and I am not saying Trump who is a Republican, I am saying Trump as someone who doesn't have the slightest idea how much harm he can do saying stuff that can hurt people and make people lose hope), I am not saying it from the angle of a reasonable human being that finds hard to believe we never been to the moon (it's not my job to question the reason of such a big lie[tho, the republicans that will read this will find hard to believe me not because they CAN'T but because they don't WANT)... I am saying it from the angle of a man who thinks Damian lost his genius, having as proof everything that happends on the screen, because of a moment like the Oscar moment. Not because he didn't win. But because the moment happened. That very wrong moment of two old people that couldn't understand how to read a piece of paper. 
Great acting, would've expect more from Hollywood in terms of music (especially for the fact that Spielberg is executive for this one), wanna-be-strong script. I am giving 7 stats out of respect for Damian.
I will continue to follow this great filmmaker in search of all the great emotions he brought doing Whiplash and of course... La la land. This means I will buy next time a cinema ticket as well. And yes. I went to see this movie in the cinema out of respect for Damian and his previous work."

","Loved this movie. From the nail-biting opening test flight sequence to the triumphant denouement, I was enthralled.

The film was long but felt short. The photography was breathtaking. The flight sequences tense and believable. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy were amazing together.

","This movie was worthy in the extreme and functioned well as a near perfect documentary of the years leading up to the moon landing and the moment of history making. <br/><br/>As a dramatic movie is was, in my opinion, lacking on several fronts. Famously reclusive or perhaps in reality mundane there was little presented of Armstrong's inner thoughts or his personal life. Ryan Gosling had little to work with and maintained a minimalist style that was practically a blank portrayal. Clare Foy was totally under-utilised and just irritated the viewer every time she appeared on the screen. <br/><br/>I accept that rocket science and space exploration are serious subjects but this movie was unrelenting and ultimately it became a documentary piece and needs to be judged as such."

Watching the scenes on the moon, with total silence falling across the cinema as the vacuum of space shut out all sound, I was brought back to times like my first viewing of Star Wars; sat on the edge of my seat, grinning.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling does do the Ryan Gosling thing, where he plays the main character and has the smallest amount of dialogue. However, he is certainly one of my all time favourite actors thanks in part to Blade Runner. Claire Foy is also brilliant, and a strong impression as my first time seeing her in a film. <br/><br/>The visuals. This was when I started grinning, right from the first few scenes. I am a strong believer that shaky cam is just confusing and stupid, I much prefer long, unbroken shots. But, the opening few minutes have a really creative use of shaky cam, and the thing that jumped out the most to me was the actual look of the film. There's film grain! It greatly enhanced the experience, and I loved it. <br/><br/>And finally, the highlight for me: Sound design. Oh. My. God. The score, hints of 2001 and dashes of John Williams. Damien Chazelle has impressed me twice with his scores (I haven't yet seen La La Land, but I have 4 songs from the Whiplash OST on my playlist). Not just the score, but the use of silence.

It shows the dedication of those involved, and leads us through the 1960s, never letting us forget that winning the Space Race was not a foregone conclusion, and that good men died along the way trying to make it happen.<br/><br/>The space scenes are shot from an angle we haven't seen before, and yes, it does provide a bit of claustrophobia and vertigo, all the more if you are watching on an IMAX.<br/><br/>The film is also moody and introspective, and one of the big questions is whether the moon landing was worth it.

"darkreignn","10","1","3","15 October 2018"," A fantastic, emotional character study
","""First Man"" is, without a doubt, one of my favorite movies of the year. From the opening scene I was instantly riveted, and Ryan Gosling's nuanced, subtle, emotional performance had me glued to my seat for the entire over two hour runtime.<br/><br/>Once again, Chazelle proves that he is a master behind the camera. The entire film has a very handheld, documentary look, complete with film grain to add to the retro realism the movie wants to give off. I've read online that some people found the constant use of close-ups and shaky camera distracting, but I found that it enhanced to the grittiness and aesthetic of the film; it truly felt like I was watching a documentary at parts, and since this movie was fundamentally a character study of Neil Armstrong, I thought that the stylistic directing approach worked. That being said, I can totally understand where the criticisms are coming from; there are some scenes where the camera is shaking so violently that I wouldn't be surprised if the cameraman was going through cardiac arrest during filming. But, these overly spastic and violent shakes usually only occured during the ""rocket"" scenes, for lack of a better word, and it added tenfold to the intensity and claustrophobia that a real astronaut would feel - they can't get out of the rocket, and so, neither can we.<br/><br/>This film has also gained controversy for the very un-Hollywood portrayal of the entire Apollo mission. Now, what do I mean by that? ""First Man,"" as I mentioned previously, is in no way, shape, or form a ""feel-good"" movie. In fact, it's downright depressing. Instead of portraying this mission as something that was incredible for America and exciting for Neil Armstrong, the film shows the mission through the lens of Neil's emotional state, which happens to be depressed, if not borderline suicidal.<br/><br/>You see, the film opens with a tragedy that happens to Neil. One of our first looks at this man is him holding his head, crying. It's rough stuff, and it's tough not to cry with him. And throughout the film, whenever Neil goes, tragedy seems to follow. So it's no surprise that Ryan Gosling plays him in such a stoic, quiet, sad way. I've read reviews that demonized this performance for being too stoic, but my response to that is this: would you expect a man who has had tragedy after tragedy happen to him, to be happy? Neil is not happy, and Ryan Gosling's performance makes that evident. Neil buries himself in his work, trying to distract himself from the pain, even knowing that death is a very real possibility should things go wrong. It's a very down-to-earth take on this American hero, and it's very interesting.<br/><br/>That being said, this movie is incredibly long. Luckily, about every half-hour or so there are exceedingly exciting scenes of rocket lift-offs or astronaut training, but that doesn't necessarily keep the movie from being very slow. Look, no matter what, there is no denying this movie is slow, but I never found it to be boring, thanks to the amazing performances and beautifully euphoric musical score. Seriously, the music in this movie is just gorgeous, and coupled with the directing, it is really a sight to behold.<br/><br/>""First Man"" is a fantastic film. Strong, emotional performances, gorgeous music, beautiful directing, and one of the most inspiring stories known to mankind, just portrayed in a way that we've never seen before.

"ckhan25","6","1","3","15 October 2018"," Good movie...wrong actors
","First man, the biopic of Neil Amstrong. It was a good movie, the space scenes were stunning but nothing groundbreaking. The story mainly focuses on the personal life of Neil Armstrong. The movie wants to show you things from his perspective.<br/><br/>The movie had its moments, on the whole could have been shorter, it spends too much time focusing on Ryan Gosling staring into space.<br/><br/>This brings me on nicely to the actors, i am not a fan of Ryan Gosling, he has the same impression on his face no matter what role he plays, Clare Foy was strictly ok. This film would have been much better if it had better actors in the lead roles. <br/><br/>Conclusion, worth a watch."
"ucjtskl","7","1","3","14 October 2018"," Very Watchable Movie - Shame about the rushed ending
","First Man held my attention from start to finish - always a good sign - but the final scenes from leaving the moon to isolation periods were rushed, and hugely disappointing - putting two men on the moon was one thing - getting them back quite another - a missed opportunity to make the film an all around great watch.<br/><br/>One might instead want to argue that the movie was about Neil Armstrong the person. This makes for a difficult topic because reports have it that Armstrong was chosen to be first man on the moon because of his introversion and lacking in external ego which makes for a challenging script - but raises interesting questions - the choice of Buzz Aldrin as partner was influenced by Neil Armstrong 
Jim Lovell - why was this - what was their relationship? The movie places more focus on the Apollo 1 astronaughts and Mrs Armstrong so we never really get to find out much about the relationships across the three folk riding Apollo 11 - shame."
"staffordgorsalitz","Null","1","3","12 October 2018"," To boldly go where no man had gone before
","Well after being inspired by the NASA exhibit yesterday what better way to reinforce the experience by catching the biopic on Neil Armstrong and his mission to the moon. We thought it best to catch the picture on IMAX to immerse ourselves in the experience. <br/><br/>This is more of a character driven drama that focuses on the sacrifices made by those that dared to venture beyond our earthly realms and go where no man had gone before. The story begins in 1961 with Armstrongs acceptance into the Gemini program and culminates with him ultimately stepping on the moon. What transpires between those two points is what grounds the entire film. We see a young astronaut who detaches himself from his emotions after the loss of his daughter to cancer, his inability to share his emotions with his wife or children, and his single focused mindset on the missions at hand. Ironically from my perspective, it is these qualities that likely allowed him to achieve the success that he did. He was a solitary man, with a solitary focus, and had a distaste for the fame and attention that would follow him through his career. The character side of the story was balanced nicely with the frailties of the tin cans these brave souls were placed in. You truly experience the cramped and extremely fragile nature of the capsules the astronauts endured. The sets were accurate for the time period and certainly brought back memories of my childhood when I watched that landing on our old RCA black and white television in Glamorgan.<br/><br/>Gosling was good as he consistently is but the true star in my estimation was Claire Foy playing Janet Armstrong. She beautifully displayed what every spouse endures on every mission and struggles to balance her devotion to her husband with the conflict of his detachment. <br/><br/>This film was a nice departure from the influx of superhero movies that seem to dominate the screens these days and remind us what real life heroism is all about and the costs that come with it."

","Damien has boldly gone where... to be honest quite a bit of people have gone before. But he brings such gravitas to the events that unfold prior to the part of the story that most filmmakers focus on, one could even say that First Man is the BEST Apollo mission movie ever made. Hurwitz hasn't outdone himself like with is effort in La La Land (which was perfect), but his droning score can take many light-hearted turns in unexpectedly tranquil situations... adding brevity to certain scenes. The little dialogue that there is in this film is performed by everyone very well, however Ryan Gostling sometimes feels detached from everything else. Almost as if he is about to leave world. There are some moments where I was saying to myself ""there is no way Neil was this cold in this particular emotional situation in real life"".His performance is brilliant but It felt too dramatic for me. But that is such a minor flaw that holds this film from pure greatness. The visuals are stunning, I only noticed one vfx shot even though I'm sure there were tons. The vfx complement the cinematography in a satisfying way, and the film grain effect gave an authentic feel about the time period. Damien is definitely one of the best directors working at the moment and at such a young age I am intensely eager to see more of his work."

","I will get this out of the way: I do not believe America landed on the moon. This movie only reinforces my conclusion about this. The moon hoaxer crowd makes a lot of great arguments about this. Also, since the Apollo missions in the early seventies, no other country or private space entity has ever gone to the moon. That's a bit suspicious.<br/><br/>The movie is a great watch. It does come off as propaganda at times, but it tells the story and does it to the point. I won't say the acting was outstanding because it really wasn't. The directing and cinematography were; it's what I've come to expect from Damian Chazelle. <br/><br/>One egregious omission was leaving out the planting of the US flag on the moon. That was just ridiculous. You have a movie here that could be shown in schools everywhere and they ruined it by omitting that scene. What were they thinking? That's pretty historical. I could see a lot of history teachers refusing to show this movie because of that and it's a shame. It's history.

While seamlessly blending in the sobering reality of his life as a husband and father, his career is not shown as glossy perfection but in brutal honesty which is brilliantly echoed by the cinematography, editing and production quality.

Ryan Gosling perfectly fit the bill of an emotionally charged and tensed person Neil, who mourns deaths and yet didn't stopped in achieving his dreams.

"jordanf451","8","1","4","17 February 2019"," A subtle, slowly and beautifully crafted cinematic jewel
","I wonder if there will ever come the time when finally the reviews of art cinema, or author cinema, art house or whatever defines high quality movies get separated from the average Hollywood entertainment. It is absolutely ridiculous that IMDB and other sites use the same rating system to evaluate such different cultural products. Wouldn't this separation solve, for instance. the problem with the fake reviews and the misleading subjective opinions that place the last superhero movie above a Bergman classic, for instance?<br/><br/>Anyways, talking about First Man, here we have something that leaves the average movie goers frustrated. What a disappointment for those folks who can not appreciate the subtleness of the human soul and the aesthetical beauty that comes with the slow exposition of emotions, sensations and feelings. The slow dance that First man resembles will definitely put millions asleep. Instead of focusing on the external aspects of that historical moment that brought the United States (and mankind) to the moon the movie goes to the backstage and illuminates the darkest rooms, exposing the subtle and harrowing drama of the people closely involved in the events. I would even say that the dramatic role of Neil's wife is as significant as that of the protagonist in carrying the emotional load of the story.<br/><br/>This is not new. We have seen this writing strategy before, and again, we've seen the final product thrown to the flames by the disappointed mob of spectators. Remember Last Days, by Gus Van Sant? That masterpiece has 5.8 points on IMDB. Had Van Sant made First Man it would probably be even more obscure, more silent, slower, and people would trash it mercilessly.<br/><br/>So, if you are in the mood for a popcorn spectacle on a boring night skip this. Looking for a wonderful cinematic experience? First Man will satisfy your needs. And don't forget to express your appreciation to the fantastic group of actors, writers, the director and every one who participated in the making of this jewel, even if it is anonymously, subtly, silently, in the deepest and darkest room of your soul."
"leftistcritic","8","1","4","4 February 2019"," A powerful movie which had unnecessary criticism
","While I have watched dramas about space travel like 2001 and Interstellar, along with ones about the space race like Hidden Figures and The Right Stuff, but this movie is in a league of its own. It shows the trauma Neil Armstrong and his family experienced with the death of his daughter in the early 1960s, along with the death of fellow astronauts over the years. It also shows a space program enshrined in NASA which was in shambles, with all sorts of problems. I also liked the inclusion of criticism of the space program, although including Gil-Scott Heron's ""Whitey on the Moon"" leads to historical inaccuracy as the song came out in 1970, not 1968. Additionally, while this film is a powerful drama, it really only focuses on white people, specifically white men for the most part, with women, apart from Neil's wife, pushed to the sidelines, which leads to problems. Still, I would say this film is still good, despite the absurd criticism of U$ flag not being the focus of the film."

I don't think 'First Man' is lower than 'La La Land'. If it is not better, It's not lower. And what a Great interpretation. A Poetic interpretation of Neil Armstrong's life. At the end, I loved this.

","I just watched First Man on a 60 ft tall IMAX screen with insanely great sound. But I would have loved this film had I watched it on my phone. First Man isn't a hero-worship tribute that relies heavily on rocket ship emphasis, it's quite an understated character study punctuated by moments of edge-of-your-seat tension.<br/><br/>I was possessed by the story for every moment of the film, my mind never wandered, my butt never got sore as happens during so many movies. I was taken inside the protagonists life and given a look at 60s Space Race through his eyes. And not a Hollywood sanitized version, First Man depicts a NASA that's a bit grittier than the publicity photos suggest.<br/><br/>Had I not read so many books about the early NASA missions since I watched Niel Armstrongs first steps in 1969 I may not have appreciated this film as much. But being familiar with the events depicted I was delighted to witness those events recreated. The launch sequences are not done using the usual cliches and with the IMAX sound I felt like I'd just been blasted off the planet.<br/><br/>I can't say enough good things about this film and would highly recommend it to anyone who's a spaceflight history enthusiast or who likes a movie that explores a character with a bit of depth. As other reviewers have said, First Man is no Right Stuff but that's a plus, where the Right Stuff blew me away, First Man moved me and touched something inside me like few films do."

","July 20, 1969, the day the first man walked on the moon. It's a historical date and it's about time they make a decent movie about this memorable day. To me First Man was entertaining from the beginning till the end. No fancy sci-fi gadgets, but more raw images where you get the sensation that alot could go wrong. Neil Armstrong, played beautifully by Ryan Gosling, was a devoted man to his career, maybe not as much to his family, but then again the life of an astronaut can't be that simple as for example the life of a postman. I thought it was a pretty good resumé of the day-to-day life of Neil Armstrong, with not only his first steps on the moon but also of previous incidents in the sky. Those events were nicely shot as they gave the audience that feeling that anything could go wrong anytime now. It's a long movie, but it's never boring, and I think they could have made it even longer as this was one event nobody will ever forget about."

I found the descent to the moon to be one of the most dramatic and emotionally charged movie sequences I have experienced. I couldn't help but be completely awestruck by this depiction of one of the greatest moments in human history. The character study of Neil Armstrong prior to this helps put you in the tension of the moment. This may be as close as we will ever get to knowing what might have been running through his head as he landed on the moon. First Man is a ""warts and all"" depiction of the mission to land men on the moon. Imperfect human beings using crude technology to get to the moon, and then back home to Earth.

",". . . that Universal's ""House of Horror"" has ever made (and I've seen most of them, from the silent HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA right through weeks of DRACVLA, FRANKENSTEIN, MUMMY, WOLF MAN, INVISIBLE MAN, and CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON flicks). Every moment of FIRST MAN is fraught with Terror, from the opening scene of ""Neil's"" X-15 bouncing into Outer Space to the closing pathos of he and his wife unable to articulate a thought in the vast emptiness of their moon-visitor Quarantine Room. (""Ripley"" enjoys a picnic during ALIEN compared to Mrs. Armstrong's suffering throughout FIRST MOON.) The ominous hollow clanking and grinding noises of U.S. rocket ships both BEFORE and after launch sound like the TITANIC breaking in half, and the fact that something always goes wrong--often with deadly results--every time an American astronaut goes to work no doubt prompted Real Life SIRENS OF TITAN author Kurt Vonnegut to demand that the U.S. Space Program cease and desist (in a clip from a TV interview) included during FIRST MAN.

"Victorhgm643","9","1","4","27 October 2018"," Perfect synchronized Directing, Sound and Cinematography makes First Man one of the best biopics of this decade
","For me, Chazelle's First Man could have gone anywhere in the drama spectrum and yet the young director surprised me with his choices. To be honest, choice (maybe sacrifice) is a very important word in this movie. Like I said, It could have gone for some sort of easy emotional drama, just using Neil's life as a background for cheap feelings and/or unnecessary heavy scenes. As the movie progresses, we can easily notice that is not what happens. The tone in every scene is dictated by Chazelle's choices of how this story should be told with his crew and by the choice to deconstruct and humanize the legend, even if it means a slower pace, instead of just showing what he did. The movie succeeds in making us try to feel like he felt.<br/><br/>Let's begin with Cinematography. It's the second time Damien Chazelle and Sandgren are working together and I can presume they are already pretty comfortable with each other's job (as if they didn't won an oscar for La La Land). The shaky documental camera style might be the reason for some nausea problems for some people, but it wasn't for me. It just added more depth to the mystery of Neil's personality and his special moments, also highlighted by the vintage/homemade look the film acquired by shooting in film. There is only one time in the movie that this type of camera is not used, for a specific good reason, with great response from the choice.<br/><br/>When it comes to Chazelle, Justin Hurwitz is a veteran: four movies Damien directed, four of them Justin scored. Ah, also won an Oscar for La La Land too, but who didn't right? First Man is scored with 3 or 4 motifs, some wich combined during the scenes to create more depth to each look and thought. I think maybe there is one of them out of tone (not tune) with the movie, but I could understand why that moment required a different piece of music, that's ok. Some eerie sounds used in the right time to punctuate the strangeness of the unkonw, the elevation of the orchestra to increase the tension/emotion of the scenes and voilà. See you in february Mr. Hurwitz, I hope.<br/><br/>However, if a movie about Neil Armstrong didn't have a good convincing Neil Armstrong..Know what? Nevermind. Ryan Gosling was an absolute monster as the main protagonist. Reserved, quiet, determined and mysterious just as the real astronaut, Gosling delivers maybe the best performance of his career, aware of every little detail of the scene and very sensitive to the eyes of the camera. Claire Foy does not stay behind and evens the game in every scene she could. She is persistent through the movie and a more attentive moviegoer should be able to decode her looks and personal arc by the end of the movie. And that look, God that look.<br/><br/>First Man is a lesson of how good (conscious) teamwork can bring great rewards, and I'm not just talking about the space race. Directing, Cinematography, Score and Cast were in perfect harmony in every frame. Expect to see this film to win some technical Oscars, like Sound Mixing, Sound Editing, Editing itself and be nominated to many other: Actor, Supporting Actress, Director, Original Score, Cinematography and Best Picture. Really, they deserve it. I can't tell if they will win or not, like Neil couldn't say if he was going to come back. But if a movie could make me really feel the extraordinary beautiful oddness (really, I've never felt something like this) of being the first to step on the moon, even for a fraction of a second, God they deserve a chance to try."

","Ryan Gosling brings massive intensity as Neil Armstrong in Damien Chazelle's First Man.<br/><br/>Leaving the Hollywood musical scene, Chazelle reaches for the stars in this biopic, bringing all his cinematic talent from La La Land (2016) into a space epic.<br/><br/>Pilot Neil Armstrong (Gosling), desperate to escape the grief of his daughter, joins the NASA, for the Gemini missions and eventually Apollo 11, striving to touch the surface of the moon. While ruthless to make the giant leap for mankind, Armstrong struggles to keep himself together and tender to his wife (Claire Foy) and children.<br/><br/>Astonishing to think that only at the age of 33 Damien Chazelle has already written himself in film history and he continues to do so with First Man. Although I said it was a ""space epic"", what Chazelle is more interested in is the relationship between Neil and Janet, as the earthbound strains and anxieties make Neil want to escape his grief. As well as being a an exhilarating journey to the moon, Chazelle's creation is more of a character drama than a space epic.<br/><br/>Its Gosling and Foy's chemistry at the very heart of the film, struggling to let go of the past, but afraid to show any emotion of it, Gosling's Armstrong is silent and isolated, fixed on his mission. A role which has felt comfortable for Gosling, but in moving quiet passion he is a man finding it hard to breath but continuing to hold his breathe. Armstrong's emotional comptonization is shown rarely but when it is revealed in heart-breaking motion, from the interaction with his children, to his moments of solitude.<br/><br/>This is mainly seen through the eyes his wife Janet who releases the feelings for both of them. Foy stunningly shows how she tries to support her husband's mission but in she clearly hides the fear of losing her husband. Foy's performance brings us closer to the disturbing shock and danger of the mission and how much it cost. It's in the show and not tell that makes Foy's performance outstanding.<br/><br/>In frequent close ups and shaky cam, First Man puts us right in the middle of the action, bringing to life history itself. Chazelle's collaboration with cinematographer Linus Sandgren has brought him great favour again, from opening right in a test flight leaving you clenched and breathless from the start. With another previous collaborator Justin Hurwitz the brilliant creator of the heavenly score for La La Land, Hurwitz gives us an glorious and atmospheric soundtrack. From the gentle yet powerfully moving harps to the lonely nostalgic sound of the thermion, Hurwitz score carries the emotional intensity, thrill ride, and silent wonder of space all together.<br/><br/>It is here we also find an acquainted operatic display, as First Man echoes similar space epics, From 2001 (1968) to even Interstellar (2014). In the several overwhelming test flights to the ultimate climax we are met with stellar sound design, culminating the loud launches and crashes with unexpected silence is almost entrancing. Chazelle combines cinematic practice with emotional drive to create one inspiring work, again another example of how beautiful blockbuster cinema can be<br/><br/>Pay no attention to the ridiculous controversy brought by some very annoying Americans, First Man is astonishingly sharp and beautiful, one of the most impressive films of the year. Chazelle reminds us of this great accomplishment in human history, that we may neglect from time to time, I know I do, but powers it with a fantastic character story."

","GRADE: B+<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br/><br/>IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that is dazzling in its visuals but lacking in real emotional drama.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Damien Chazelle's masterful yet emotionally inert film, First Man, tells the saga of Neil Armstrong and the Apollo space program. Technically, the film is so well crafted and detail driven, but the personal backstory of Armstrong's marriage and family life is never really given equal treatment. So the overall impact delivers more to be admired than exulted.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling play this American hero as an introverted loner unable to express any remorse or compassion to those he loves. He hides his feelings and pent-up rage frequently like those stereotypical 60's men did to shield themselves from any direct interaction. This is a fine approach, and Mr. Gosling has his solitary moments to shine. The actor is more than up to the task of filling in the gaps in his character.<br/><br/>His wife, Janet, is very well played by Claire Foy but her character too is intense and aloof. With a literate screenplay by Josh Singer, both characters, as written, are so uptight and guarded that moviegoers are kept at an emotional distance. While one can relate to the stress and sadness in their marriage, their scenes together never mesh as effectively as they should.<br/><br/>Yet it is the sequences of outer space exploration that have a rare beauty that continually impress in their execution. The film achieves high marks with its talented artisans' contributions: Linus Sandgren's photography efficiently contrasts the claustrophobic space within the capsules with its hand-held camerawork and the panoramic vistas of outer space and the moon's terrain. Visually, the film has powerful imagery throughout that is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's iconic 2001 and, more recently, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity and its CGI artistry. The film editing by Tom Cross creates the tension and suspense with his many close-ups and kinetic fast cuts. Nathan Crowley's production design that has all of the period details and more. The music score by Justin Hurwitz is selective in its blending of quieter lyrical sounds with more bombastic fanfare. Kudos to all!<br/><br/>Mr. Chazelle's direction, especially in his lengthy re-enactment of the moon landing, is skillfully rendered. He has truly researched his subject of space exploration but seems more involved in depicting the historic aspects of the Apollo program and showing all of that visual splendor. In doing so, he sacrifices the smaller story of a common man whose dreams became a reality at a very high cost.<br/><br/>First Man celebrates our early space explorers and the risks they took to achieve greatness. This film never reaches that zenith, but it remains grandiose filmmaking that sets the bar high. Even if it doesn't shoot the moon, it comes very close."

","This movie is more about the life and personality of Neil Armstrong as written by James Hanson in his novel, ""First Man"". It is not necessarily about Apollo 11 though it plays heavily in the movie. I found Ryan Goslin's portrail of Armstrong very good though he is not trying to copy him exactly, but to give the audience an idea of what he was about. Janet, played by Claire Foy, was probably closer to what Janet was like, but at times I could hear her English accent slipping through. The novel was the only authorized biography of Armstrong ever, so his children, as well as other family members, were interviewed and consulted on the book and movie. Armstrong died in 2012, so obviously he was not involved in the production of the movie. I give the movie high ratings for the producer's willingness to stick to the book though the movie only covers a portion of Armstrong's life. This is what we get because there will be no better book or movie about this interesting man and the first human to walk on another planet."
"amirmustafaa","10","1","4","15 October 2018"," One of the Most Tense and Realistic Space Movies Ever Made
","First Man manages to do something incredible. We know Neil Armstrong landed on the moon safely and came back, but this movie still manages to be incredibly tense, and it keeps the audience fearful of if it's actually going to work even though we know it is. This big reason this movie has this effect is because it strives for realism in every scene. The way the camera shakes, and the way the sound in this movie portrays being in a rocket makes the audience feel as if they're actually traveling to space as well, hoping not to crash or burn up. This movie also has a brilliant performance from Ryan Gosling, and i also liked the way it was shot. Most of the movie has a retro and gritty look to it as if was actually filmed in the 60's, and the scenes on the moon take full advantage of IMAX, giving us some truly breathtaking shots.<br/><br/>I must caution people people that this is NOT a crowd-pleaser. This is not some epic and fast paced crowd-pleasing movie about some cool guy going to space. This is a serious and ultra realistic film about a serious and stoic guy risking his life to go to the moon while also dealing with a lot of personal trauma. If that doesn't sound like something you would like, then this movie is not for you."

"paulijcalderon","7","1","4","15 October 2018"," In space you can't escape to hear an audience member snore. Even if it's a good film
","Talk about an inpatient crowd at the cinema. I heard snoring, people moving around, feet stomping on the floor and even saw some walk-outs. The guy on the row in front of me kept re-arranging how he was sitting. He was either unsure whether to put his feet up on the chair infront of him or to tap his fingers constantly as if he was listening to music the entire time. It's annoying to see crowds like this, especially when you get a slower moving dramatic film. Regardless of the distractions, I liked ""First Man"". A complaint I've seen is that the plot gets un-engaging by the middle act. And I can see what they are talking about, but it didn't bother me. It's a realistic approach. Ryan Gosling as Armstrong will of course be a quieter performance. He's got subtlety. Sadness is seen in his eyes and whenever Armstrong would show more emotion it landed a bigger mark in the story.<br/><br/>It doesn't move very fast. Chazelle decides to spend a lot of time with the characters on the ground. They're at a house, conversing calmly and then occasionally you go back to Nasa's space research. So that's the aspect I can see not working so well on repeat viewings. People will probably wanna fast-forward to a training scene with the ships. It's shot on film which I adored. Although I would have preferred to skip the documentary like camerawork. It got shaky in a way that's not my taste. All the pictures in space or in the ships are stellar though. Claire Foy is here too and I remember that she was brilliant in ""Unsane"". I was hoping to not get distracted and see too many elements of her character from that film. But I ended up being surprised as she delivered a different performance to Gosling. They balance each other out. He keeps the emotions hidden, while she puts them front and center. The stand-out aspect is when she insists that Armstrong has to talk to their sons before he leaves to space. It's a difficult situation which makes you think. What would you say? Anything can go wrong considering it's a mission that's never been done before.<br/><br/>Landing on the Moon was a giant leap for all of mankind, and this story makes you understand the hardships that go into achieving such a goal. It's a drama that tells the story of this man. The Nasa and Moon landing plots are integral, but remember that it's gonna be from the point of view of this character. Not a thrilling ride into space, but a nice film about one guy's journey which left a place in history. Not bad. Loved the opening scene which was riveting and the actual landing sequence makes you hold your breath. The biggest negative is that as soon as there's no sound in space, I only hear the snoring man (from two rows back) louder and clearer. If you wanna sleep, why do would you go to the cinema and disturb others?"

There was one objective on his mind the Moon. Second, the space odyssey drama was not as exciting as most think, most astronauts knew each other and NASA was in its infancy with space exploration. There were accidents on Earth and in Space, but the astronauts who survived added their input on how to fix problems as they arose. Space and going to the moon was not as easy as most make it appear, it was tough, very, very tough.

","Let's face it, Damien Chazelle is probably one of the best directors going around today. Add the fact that he is still really young as well as a filmmaker. Whiplash is absolutely excellent, and La La Land was an incredible musical. Thus naturally, First Man was a really anticipated film for me and add to that the fact that Ryan Gosling would be portraying Neil Armstrong. This just seemed like it would be an amazing feature, so naturally I wanted to catch this one in IMAX. I think the film is good technically, for its performances and content, and for the portrayal of the moon landing. However, the films length and pacing were problematic for me.<br/><br/>The film is about the life of Neil Armstrong, the famed astronaut who became the first man to land on the moon in 1969. The film covers other preceding portions of Armstrong's life, including the loss of his young daughter, his relationship with his family, his early work and training with NASA, his general mindset and personality, and all the events going on leading up to his eventual moon landing. The film also stars Claire Foy as his wife, Kyle Chandler, and Jason Clarke.<br/><br/>I felt like the pacing and length of the film were the real problems with the film. its a good film technically and hardly puts a foot wrong but its a slow build and takes its time to get to the Moon landing. Gosling plays his usual quiet natured sulky lead, I'm not sure if this was an accurate portrayal of how Armstrong was but I had no problem with it. The performances were good otherwise. The leads may not get end of the year nominations or wins but I think they did a very respectful job in their roles. I expect the film to get its technical nominations as its sound design and cinematography are as good as can be.<br/><br/>The film has all the ingredients to make it great but doesn't connect with me quite like Chazelle's other works in Whiplash and La La Land. It doesn't have that emotional connectivity like those works did, much like Neil's emotional block with his wife and kids. Its worth a watch to see the incredible moon landing experience and learn about the life about an American pioneer otherwise. Its a film that's steeped in tragedy and loss and great wonder and achievement.<br/><br/>7.5/10"

","'First Man (2018)' all feels markedly real, with the flight sequences in particular being utterly visceral, nail-bitingly tense and yet incredibly intimate. Our perspective is nearly always the same as the protagonist's, right down to several gripping - and often insanely shaky - POV shots. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the flick eventually gets to the moon and, when it does, it all feels suitably majestic - operatic, even. This memorable finale is only ever-so-slightly dampened by the fact that the rocket trip to get there feels quite short and isn't treated with the same intensity as the ones that came before it. Still, the differing style makes for an almost transcendent scene that takes a very personal approach. It also doesn't necessarily need to be suspenseful, anyway, considering that we all know how it turns out. This is something that the piece understands remarkably well, putting its emphasis much more on the 'how' and 'why' rather than the 'what'; it's very much about the journey, internal and external, rather than the destination. The picture does feel a little long but it does have a lot to get through and it's bigger issue, perhaps, is the fact that it sort of floats through its ten year period, skipping out large chunks at a moment's notice. This does make it sort of difficult to care, at least on a deep level, about any of the characters except our lead. Even then, he's usually stoic and puts both us and everyone else at a bit of a distance. The feature is very much a character study, though, and it does a decent job at giving us an insight into the man behind the mission. The focus is always on the way that the events depicted effect him and those closest to him, ultimately making for a much more intimate film than you might expect. It's this that gives it its heart, which is constantly present through the surprisingly restrained - and all the more effective for it - spectacle. 7/10"
"coasterdude44","8","1","4","14 October 2018"," The Place Between Wonder and Fear
","First Man is an excellent example of how cinematography and camerawork used the right way can put you straight into the mind of another person to where you can completely understand and feel exactly what type of emotion the character is feeling and what is going through their head at any moment without saying a single word, at least that's what I took away from this film and the Apollo mission sequences. At first, I thought Ryan Gosling at firs was a strange casting choice by the film to play Neil Armstrong, but he was great in the movie and I don't really think any current actor on 2018 could have done any better acting wise in the role than what he did. During the NASA and spaceflight segments, there was just something about him that was able to convey so much emotion from just his eyes and body language that could tell that he was scared, tense yet excited and able to withstand any sense of danger or problem that was thrown at him in a deadly scenario which I don't think I've seen before. There was a very ruthless nature to his character with this blend of wonder and fear which is what drives him. I don't really know that much about Neil Armstrong and what he was like as a person, but Gosling's performance during the docking and moon landing sequence really did give me a deeper insight into just what he must have been feeling and experiencing and that. I thought he could have done better in the non-NASA segments dialogue wise, but I can't really think of how or what he could have done to pull that off, there were no huge problems with his performance or part in the film, so I really can't complain.
I really did like the feeling of claustrophobia in how the mission sequences were shot that really does give you a very first-person experience of what it was like to be piloting in those capsules and the sound design really did enhance that experience. Just the way the film is directed really likes to put you in that emotional place between wonder and fear, followed by the feeling awe and achievement which is really it's biggest strength and does it very well which is the most important thing I took away from it. The soundtrack was also great and fit the atmosphere of the film very well. First Man isn't perfect, but it is breathtaking for what it is and is one of the best, if not the best I've seen this year. Damien Chazelle once again did a fantastic job directing wise and I hope it wins some Oscars."

","Performances across the board are all brilliant, in particular Gosling and Foy. One scene in particular towards the end including them was one of the best in the film. The cinematography throughout the whole film is amazing, essentially being fully handheld and it worked entirely for the film especially for the space shuttle sequences. The score is also magnificent, giving off this sense of beauty and awe surrounding the space scenes in particular. The entire last third of this movie, when Neil is preparing for the moon landing, is transfixing. This entire sequence is breathtaking, from a director standpoint to a cinematography standpoint. Some of the best scenes this whole year. The conflict within NASA about the complications, dangers and precautions of the moon landing were most definitely the bright spots in the occasionally dull screenplay.<br/><br/>'First Man' is a very slow movie, which isn't always a bad thing, but in this case I think it was a hinderance on the overall flow of the film. Moments and scenes could often be meandering, boring or a bit tedious. Much like the 2016 film 'Sully', 'First Man' feels like it is in search of movie built off one event; the moon landing, which is the entire last third. Or in Sully's case, the plane crash. Although First Man is a much better directed, acted, filmed and written film, those parallels are there. It's a film about Neil Armstrong's life leading up to the moon landing. While interesting, it never seemed to reach the emotional heights Chazelle was going for. <br/><br/>Personally, I felt rather distant from Armstrong as a character. The emotional beats he went through, although sad, didn't help me engage with him as a person, therefore leaving the theatre disconnected from him. The emotional core is at the start of the film and is extremely sad, and is payed off at the end. Unfortunately, this emotional core didn't enhance the secluded, quiet nature of Neil as a character. This is a major flaw, because the entire film is about Neil Armstrong and his life leading up to the first step on the moon. It is a subjective thing, and will work for some and not for others. <br/><br/>'First Man' is directed marvellously by Chazelle. The cinematography is incredible, in particular the flying sequences which felt extremely realistic. The score is wonderful, the performances are great, and the last third is magnificent. It is at times boring, dull or tedious, but never all at once, as I was mostly intrigued by the events leading to the moon landing. Neil Armstrong as a character was distant from feeling any investment in him. 'First Man' is still, at its best, an awe-inspiring journey to the first steps on the moon. <br/><br/>'First Man' - 77%"

","I was engrossed with the Apollo missions and followed them avidly and closely (yes, I'm that old). So imagine my surprise to discover Neal Armstrong suffered from serious mental health issues during his entire tenure at NASA. The movie portrays him as suffering from severe depression over the loss of his daughter, and as having a marriage that could best be described as dysfunctional. Yet despite what we've been told for the last 55 or so years, NASA apparently not only knew of these problems, they totally ignored them. Having had a career in the Air Force I can comfortably say no pilot would have been allowed to fly with the mental health signals Armstrong was portrayed as blatantly exhibiting in this movie. How could NASA have possibly hidden such a monumental and dangerous issue as this for so long? Or could it be that Hollywood isn't depicting historical events and actions in an accurate and ethical manner? The movie isn't 100% gloom and doom. I caught Ryan Gosling almost cracking a smile on at least two occasions, and there was even a shot of sunshine once, but it was partially obscured by smoke. I've never understood the fascination some in Hollywood have with making movies that are dark, gloomy and depressing. Movies are supposed to be entertaining, and while historical events are often difficult to depict in their entirety in movies, they should at least make an effort to be somewhat historically accurate. This movie misses on both counts."

","A frank, pull-no-punches look at the personal and professional life of the failed test pilot and famed astronaut, Neil Armstrong. His is a tale of grand success and global recognition, of course, but also one of frequent, intense tribulation. From routine near-death experiences at the office to a mortally sick young daughter at home, Neil's life seems like a constant source of tension and immense emotional pressure. A quiet, reserved man, he internalizes most of that pain, but it's still evident. Ryan Gosling does a remarkable job at conveying this inner trauma, roiling behind a stoney poker face and a collected physical presence, and the film backs him up by presenting several situations in which that strict sense of cool personal composition literally saves his life.<br/><br/>First Man spends a lot of time gazing inwardly, but that's balanced by a series of riveting, high-pressure scenes inside the cockpit. These are utterly insane; barely-contained chaos set to the tune of a constant, deafening roar, all kept in check via a series of well-timed switch flips and a whole lot of white-knuckled prayers. Space movies need never want for great action scenes, particularly when they're inspecting this particular age of DIY floundering, and this one provides yet another impressive step forward in that department. An excellent balance of humanity, practical science and death-defying physical risk-taking."

","When I find myself analyzing a film on it's first watch through - scrutinizing every detail: the good and the not so good... that is not a good sign. There are few people as easy to immerse into a movie than myself, as long as a movie is entertaining.<br/><br/>Here we have an amazing subject, who lived a very singular, heroic life - and we the audience get to spend 1/2 this movie in domestic situations? Often without the main character present? How dumb is that?<br/><br/>I know I should never want something from a film, specifically - so that when it does not deliver, I may ignore a movies actual merit. But come on! This isn't rocket science! Well... it is literally, but figuratively? Tell an exciting story about an exciting guy! When did he become a pilot? How many aircraft did he fly? How many times did he cheat death? How about actually focusing on his greatest achievement... the title of the film... and show how he was the tip of the spear, a main player in this technological expanse of our nation!<br/><br/>This movie comes off thinking an audience member would be more interested when Armstrong met his wife?!? How dumb is that?<br/><br/>If Neil Armstrong was so stoic, calculated and... dull - perhaps taking such a literal/grounded approach to his character was a mistake! But I learned something? Really? This must be one of the worst arguments for a feature length motion picture - if a film doesn't entertain, any unloading of information is irrelevant.<br/><br/>From a production standpoint, this isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. The special effects crew should be really pleased with their work (in about 5% of the movie, when you can actually see what is going on). The effects have a retro look that fits the style of the film, yet a clarity and resolution that is quite beautiful to behold. So... lets put the camera 2 inches from the characters face in the most intense sequences that could utilized for wonderful special effects... How dumb is that? Yea, as a viewer, I want to look at a shaking helmet for 10 strait minutes instead of seeing exterior views of an intense event. Actually? I don't.<br/><br/>It's funny, thinking back - this movie actually makes me angrier now than when I was watching it. First Man is well made, and I was kinda into it, like I said, fully analyzing everything when viewing, instead of being lost in the experience, like any good director would prefer. Now? I'm just amazed by a series of choices the film makers made to hold this project back: script emphasizing domestic life, action sequences highlighted by incomprehensible close ups and clattering noise, and portraying the hero as a stoic, math head. I left this film, somehow caring less about these events than more - I had to do some reading and watching of interviews on youtube to rekindle my fascination and interest in the man. And that is pathetic. In this way, for me - this movie is a disgrace.<br/><br/>Well made movie that made a lot of baffling choices: 4/10 - actually? I enjoyed this film less that that."

","From seeing the trailer for this movie about two months before its release, I had good feelings about and was very excited to see it, it is one of those real-life stories you always wanted to see re-enacted on the big screen, directed by Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land). Basically in 1961, Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is a NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) test pilot who inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere flying the X-15 rocket plane. He does manage to land the plane in the Mojave Desert, but he is grounded after his colleagues express concern his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction. His two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Karen (Lucy Brooke Stafford) has a brain tumour and is undergoing treatment, Neil is desperate to save her and logs her symptoms and tries to find other treatments, but she dies from her illness. Neil is grief-stricken but applies for Project Gemini and is accepted to NASA Astronaut Group 2. Alongside other astronaut families, Armstrong, his wife Janet (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Claire Foy) and their son Rick (Gavin Warren and Luke Winters) move to Houston. Armstrong begins training and befriends fellow test pilot Elliot See (Patrick Fugit) and test pilot and engineer Ed White (Jason Clarke). Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler) describes to the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the Soviet Union have achieved every milestone in the Space Race ahead of the United States. During the training, Neil and Janet have a second son, Mark Armstrong (Connor Colton Blodgett). The family has settled in Houston by 1965, and Armstrong is waiting to be selected for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first extravehicular activity (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be commander of Gemini 8, with David Scott (Christopher Abbott) as pilot. Prior to the mission, See and Charles Bassett are killed in a T-38 crash. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on Gemini 8, and dock with the Agena target vehicle, but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins spinning rapidly. Armstrong nearly blacks out but manages to activate the RCS thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong faces initial criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault, White later reveals that Armstrong has been selected for the Apollo 1 mission along with Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham) and Roger Chaffee (Cory Michael Smith). On January 27, 1967, during a plugs-out test, a fire breaks out in the Apollo 1 and kills the crew, Neil hears the news whilst at the White House representing NASA. The following year, Armstrong is nearly killed ejecting from the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle. He is selected to command Apollo 11, and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Neil about the possibility that he will not survive the flight and insists that he explain the risks of the mission to their children. After telling them about the risks he faces during the mission, Neil says goodbye to his family and departs. Apollo 11 successfully launches, with Armstrong commanding, Michael ""Mike"" Collins (Lucas Haas) as command module pilot, and Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) as lunar module pilot. There are no issues during the flight, the craft arrives at the Moon on the fourth day out. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the Lunar Module and begin the landing attempt, but Aldrin realises the landing site is full of large boulders, forcing Armstrong to take manual control to land. The lunar module successfully lands with minimal fuel remaining. Armstrong steps out onto the lunar surface and speaking to NASA declares the immortal words, ""It's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."" With tears in his eyes, he looks at the Moon surface, the galaxy of stars, and the beauty of the Earth, and holding Karen's bracelet, he drops into Little West crater. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in quarantine, to begin months of tests for infections and other factors, there Armstrong and Janet share a quiet moment of reflection. Also starring CiarÃ¡n Hinds as Bob Gilruth, Olivia Hamilton as Pat White, Pablo Schreiber as Jim Lovell, Ethan Embry as Pete Conrad, Brian d'Arcy James as Joe Walker, Kris Swanberg as Marilyn See, J.D. Evermore as Chris Kraft and Leon Bridges as Gil Scott-Heron. Gosling is a good lookalike of the real Armstrong and gives a terrific performance as the family man and the astronaut going on the historical space journey, Foy is also fantastic as his concerned but loyal wife, many of the supporting cast playing recognisable real-name characters are great as well. It is the simple story of how Armstrong started out as a tester pilot and went on to become the first man to walk on the Moon, it works well as both an insight into the dangerous but history-making mission, and also an insight into how those close to Armstrong are affected by what must be done, the Moon landing itself, from the moment the door opens to silence and on the lunar surface, is a beautiful scene, with fantastic music, including the use of the Theremin, by Justin Hurwitz, Chazelle has created an unforgettable cinematic splendour, a must see biographical drama. It won the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Sound Editing, Best Production Design and Best Sound Mixing, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Editing, Best Cinematography, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Sound and Best Production Design, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Justin Hurwitz. Very good!"

","Having attended the Spacefest panel, watched the interviews on TV and online l and speaking with friends who were involved, I was prepared to enjoy this movie. I had done my research and was confident I knew what to expect. Not quite.<br/><br/>I LOVED THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>This was NOT a movie about space exploration or Apollo 11. 
Let me say this again. 
This was NOT a movie about Apollo 11 or the early space program. <br/><br/>This was a movie about how the people who participated in that era dealt with the danger, dealt with the pressure of doing your job so well that you wouldn't die. The viewer was transported back in time to the 1960's. It felt very familiar.<br/><br/>The movie is based upon the ONLY authorized biography of Neil Armstrong by James R. Hansen published 13 years ago. Jim Hansen earned the trust of Armstrong and was granted access to friends and family and hours upon hours of interviews with the First Man himself. Lesser books were published around that same time and will be remembered only for trying to latch onto Hansen's coattails. Other than that they will be forgotten.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle earned the trust of Armstrong's family and took great care to get every detail as accurate as possible. It showed. Ever since he walked in the Moon people have tried to get to know Armstrong, to understand what made him ""tick."" This movie is the last best chance to do that. <br/><br/>It presents a brief period of time between 1961 when he worked as a NASA test pilot in the X-15 program through Project Gemini to Apollo 11 in 1969. Chazelle shot the movie in both 16mm and 70mm IMAX for the appropriate scenes. <br/><br/>Joe Engle, the last surviving X-15 astronaut was consulted to make sure the scenes were authentic. Al Worden consulted to ensure the same attention to detail about Apollo. Thank you to both men.<br/><br/>One small spoiler: Tranquility Base is breathtaking!<br/><br/>After the Venice Film Festival screening a controversy erupted because the film omitted the scene of planting the American Flag on the Moon. The filmmakers were accused of advancing some kind of left-wing revisionist history. This is utter BS!<br/><br/>None of the 2 hour moonwalk is depicted as we remember watching it on television. No setting up of the science experiments, no phone call from Nixon. But the Stars and Stripes are shown in all their glory on the lunar surface. Anyone leaving the theater thinking this was an unpatriotic movie was not paying attention.<br/><br/>But what was shown at the end of the moonwalk is more poignant, more beautiful. The only thing is we are left wondering is if it really happened because it is a private expression from a private man that was never publicized. It is so beautiful you are left hoping it did happen.<br/><br/>I did enjoy looking for friends that were in the film. My favorite cameo was that of artist Chris Calle portraying his father Paul Calle who was present the morning of launch. He even used his Dads sketch pad. I hope Chris releases a book: ""Art from First Man."" I also very much enjoyed seeing the work of Ryan Nagata who recreated the X-15 pressure suit, the ""Snoopy"" caps and so on. Amazing work.<br/><br/>Honestly my only criticism of the movie is a selfish one. It's just over two hours long but is paced well. I was left wanting more. But again, this isn't a movie about the space program. <br/><br/>Before he died Gene Cernan authorized a wonderful documentary, ""The Last Man on the Moon."" I called it a thank you gift to the American people. ""First Man"" is a last gift from Neil Armstrong. Like Cernan he lets us peek behind the curtain created by NASA and LIFE Magazine. On their terms we get the real story answering the often asked question, ""what was it like?""<br/><br/>I expect this film to win numerous awards next spring. I hope Chazelle releases a Directors Cut BluRay with a lot more footage. I'll buy it the day it's released."

"mr_bickle_the_pickle","8","1","5","15 October 2018"," One small step for Damien Chazelle, One giant leap for audiences...
","This movie was so good, one of my favourites of the year. Even though you know what will happen (since this is history and all) that doesnt stop there from being tension. Damien Chazelle expertly decides to employ ""shakey cam"" for these Nasa and space scenes. And its effective. It feels violent, it makes you feel sick and claustrophobic and gives you a good idea just the kind of the crap these men had to go through just in the name of science and progression. The only thing that bothered me (and one of my nitpicks) is that Damien also uses handheld during a lot of the more quieter home scenes. When you're sitting down in a kitchen having a conversation the camera wobbling about was more distracting than anything. My guess is that he wanted it to feel like you were there or maybe even have a documentary feel to it,l but again I felt it distracting in those scenes. And its not like its a small portion of film. I'd say the film is pretty evenly split between nasa/space related scenes and scenes taking place at home. It was moving and even had me questioning towards the middle of the film ""Why did they do this again? Was it worth it?"" and of course you're reminded when Neil finally lands on the moon ""Oh, yeah this is why"". <br/><br/>I think it would be criminal for Damien to not be nominated for Best Director. The way the film is shot (minus some of that shaky cam) is beautiful and makes you feel part of the action, and he gets some great performances out of his actors. Ryan Gosling is amazing. He's a little more understated but I think that makes sense with his character. Claire was really good too and my guess for a scene they will choose if she does get nominated for Best Supporting Actress will be the scene where she tells Neil ""You better sit down those boys and tell them you might not be coming home"". Such a great scene and I wanted to be like ""You tell him sister"" in my theater. I think its also noteworthy to mention that the score is fantastic and one of the first ones that I actively noticed and paid attention to this year, so I hope that gets some acknowledgement this awards season. <br/><br/>Another nitpick I had though is that this film takes places over about a decade and I felt like they didnt do much to try and age these characters. They looked the same. I think they may have changed Neil's hair slightly towards the end, but otherwise they looked like they hadnt aged a day. Also, they made Buzz out to be a real a-hole in this. I dont know, maybe he was but it rubbed me the wrong way.<br/><br/>But overall I would recommend this film. Its beautiful but also feels gritty and raw."
"bgleslie","10","1","5","15 October 2018"," Ignore bad reviews (especially if you're an Apollo enthusiast)
","This is just my opinion as someone who is an avid fan of Apollo (and all spaceflight). Some of these bad reviews confuse me. Shaky camera? I have to assume they're referring to Armstrong's POV shots during flight of X-15, Gemini 8 and, of course, Apollo 11 because I didn't really notice any other ""shaking camera"" scenes. If there were, it didn't register. So, that said, I'm wondering what the beef is because getting into Earth's orbit or leaving it in a rocket requires getting to speeds of 17,500 mph (orbit) and 25,020 mph (breaking orbit to go to the moon). Riding those rockets has been described as ""the shake of your life"" So, the ""shakiness"" is absolutely realistic and the movie staff spent hours with pilots, engineers, and astronauts researching what was needed to produce the effect of ""being there "". It seems silly to me that this is being hailed as bad directing. 
The movie is slow, but far from boring. It's not an exciting epic about a mission malfunction (Apollo 13) and is thus more nuanced. Neil Armstrong was known for having ice in his veins and the movie definitely captures this. 
The scene for Apollo 11's liftoff was fantastic and a great tribute to the power and majesty of the enormous Saturn 5. This monster registered on seismographs up in the Northeast, shaked buildings anywhere near the area, and even blew windows out (before they figured out how to suppress the sound waves sith water) when it launched, and this movie captures that awesome power. The scenes leading to the landing were very well done and accurately portrayed (from a scientific perspective). 
The only criticism I have is that it ended with Apollo 11 and didn't cover his life afterwards."
"gcsman","8","1","5","14 October 2018"," First Man is first rate
","There are two sequences that form the linchpins of this movie, and both happen in the second half. The first of these, predictably, is the Apollo 11 launch sequence that after years of preparation at last sent Armstrong, Aldrin, and Collins on their way to the Moon. It's magnificent. The screen gives this sequence the full treatment it deserves, combining closeups from the gantry tower with horizon-to-horizon views of the vehicle climbing into the sky, all punctuated and emphasized by a majestic score from Justin Hurwitz (who also scored Whiplash and La La Land, though I didn't know him by name till now). And the Saturn V multistage rocket that was built for the Apollo lunar missions really was a monster (there's one on view nicely laid out end-to-end at the Cape Canaveral visitor center that is jaw-droppingly awesome. It takes a long, long time to walk from one end to the other.) It's only now, half a century later, that a new generation of launch vehicles of similar power are finally being built again.<br/><br/>The second sequence, again predictably, is the descent to the Lunar surface, which is likely the closest this historic mission came to disaster. The last part of it is played out almost in real time and includes segments of the actual footage from the spider-like Apollo 11 lander, during which Armstrong took manual control to locate a workable landing site and touch down JUST before the fuel ran out. This is for real; the nominal site turned out to have too many large boulders for safety, which the astronauts could see once they got close, and yes indeed they were that close to running on fumes.<br/><br/>First Man fits nicely alongside other first-rate movies about the real history of space flight including Apollo 13 (1995) and The Right Stuff (1983) -- and also the documentaries Mercury 13 (2018) and In The Shadow Of The Moon (2007). These all have a completely different feel to them than even the best and most realistic science-fiction movies about space (like Interstellar, Gravity, The Martian). You can't go wrong with a film about real history that shows what humans are really capable of.<br/><br/>So why do I give this ""only"" a rating of 8? Mostly some nagging stylistic concerns with Damien Chazelle's direction. First, Neil Armstrong's story jumps from his beginnings as an X-15 pilot and engineer, to his crucial stint in the Gemini program, and then on into Apollo, but they are shown through a series of vignette scenes rather than a continuous thread. I guess this is just me, but I'm happier with the linear, connected storytelling that Ron Howard used in Apollo 13. Second though, it's Chazelle's decision to use extreme closeups over and over again. Sometimes it works very well indeed, such as the Lunar landing sequence where Armstrong's eyes display a laser-like concentration and focus beyond what most people would even be capable of, let alone under that kind of pressure. It's a great bit of acting by Ryan Gosling and it's done with nothing more than the eyes. Speaking of which, Claire Foy (playing Jan Armstrong) has wonderful, wonderful eyes -- so this stylistic device suits her very well indeed. But a lot of the time this approach generates a sort of claustrophobic feel that would be relieved by an occasional outside wider-angle shot at least to put the scene in context. (And yes I know part of the point was to get across exactly that feel inside a tiny Gemini or Apollo capsule, but why always look BACK at their faces?)<br/><br/>Gosling and Foy are excellent, and also I liked the supporting roles played by Kyle Chandler (as Deke Slayton) and Ciaran Hinds (as Bob Gilruth). The settings for 1950's and 1960's USA life and living are meticulously done. Kudos especially for the music score which is among the best I've heard in any movie; it does what the scene calls for, by turns graceful, rhythmic, powerful, or even just silent -- whatever's needed. The lunar landscape is shown in all its bleak, alien glory with a few scenes that do nothing more (or less) than pan across it silently. Most importantly, entirely without dialog we get the feeling of what it must have been like for someone, one human being, to be the first to set foot on an entirely different world that has been sitting entirely undisturbed for the last 4 billion years.<br/><br/>All this aside though, the true theme of the film is obviously meant to be a character study of Neil Armstrong. It's well known that he was both an introvert and a very, very good astronaut who had built a record of something you could call extreme competence. He always had the right insight, said the right thing, made the right decisions under pressure -- all of which came into play during Apollo 11. But after the Apollo program was over he avoided publicity and moved to a quiet life as a professor of aerospace engineering at U.Cincinnati and remained something of an enigma right to his death in 2012. Did he actually leave on the moon that tiny bracelet of his daughter who died tragically at age 2? No one yet knows but it was a reasonable guess on the writers' part, and it rather effectively ties together an essential part of his story arc. I don't know how realistically the relationship between Neil and Jan is portrayed, but I suspect that some of it is a bit speculative.<br/><br/>But go and see it for those two central sequences. They alone are worth the price of admission."

"iyergokul_9","8","1","5","14 October 2018"," Riveting and a resilient character study that ultimately delivers
","The man walks on the Moon. The man walking on the Moon. Man does a Moon-walk. <br/><br/>Take a moment and think about those phrases. Soon the weight they carry will start to set in. The man, after thousands of years, thriving and evolving on the land we call Earth, has taken a leap forward and reached out successfully to another celestial object, the prominent presence for countless nights gone by and to further come, the Moon. First Man tells the tale that has great significance on us, humans, and our unquenchable thirst to travel beyond our home, but more than anything, it is a character study on one common man, the pre-mission life story of Neil shedding light on how the greatest space venture of all time in human history was not quite the smooth sailing, and the demons lurking in the backyard had to be faced before the baby steps on Moon was to be realized. <br/><br/>Played by Ryan Gosling, the biopic is a slow burner that if follows the routine event-by-event procedure, does so with sections of precursors skillfully mixed in that keeps the narrative of the movie going along. It is almost done to near perfection that once the curtains are about to be drawn out, there is an immense feeling of satisfaction and a tinge of awe raining down. This is something that Director Damien Chazelle has masterfully knit together and highly merges with the stoic performance by Ryan Gosling which is splendidly supported by his wife played by Claire Foy, never shy of highlighting the prevailing gospels. There is a major emphasis put on the programs preceding the mission, all which bring forth setbacks and further challenges, and a bulk of the movie ponders over whether the dream can actually be realized and showcases the personal challenges for Neil and his family. The social commentary, public perspectives and the usage of old clips are kept minimal and in little abundance but enough to infuse the sense of a real life drama but props to the level-heading acting of the cast that brilliantly pulls through.<br/><br/>The two space-faring contemporaries at the time at the height of their competition with subsequent ventures that would change the whole world. But this look at American programs from the Gemini to the Apollo missions are realized from the perspective of the astronomers and not how the world viewed it as. The stern defiance to the eye-popping visuals and the grandiose appeal a space drama expects to have, Damien Chazelle instead gives us a riveting realism of human wishful requirement demanding to break-through, not completely reliant on a sense of patriotism.<br/><br/>That is not to say that the film isn't patriotic enough, the height of competition between the Astronauts and the Cosmonauts definitely is a quench of thirst and the fuel to the engine, but more than that, First Man is about hard work. Getting to the Moon was hard, Director Chazelle makes this gripping piece hard to digest alike. But the fruit, when reaped, is a gift, and when the curtains are about to be drawn on the climax, First Man blows it up. A set of masterful music communicating the monumental first steps, the sporadic visual of the alien surrounding and finally the glimpse of us from afar. The excellent cinematography and the visions of Director Chazelle crafts a beautiful climax. Infused with moments of silence with imagery that convey the message better than anything. A momentary dive into something new and when it snaps, we're back to the reality. I felt like this was such a masterful execution that is at the height of the movie and is the fruit to the audience that is awaiting it. Damien Chazelle makes sure not to delve too deep and when the dream is realized, there is a great feeling of triumph. <br/><br/>""One small step for a man, one giant leap for Mankind."" First Man delivers to that noteworthy remark and is a look back on one of the important and earmarked missions for humanity to voyage deep into space."

None. Really ""shaky cam"" and bizarre close-ups on eyes, noses, mouths to simulate participation in Apollo project?"

","Its not enough to make a movie that is true to where the story takes place in the history of time. It also has to capture the viewer. This is absolutely not the case here. You get a lot of fragments and small clips with men smoking cigarets, talking and discussing things, numbers being mentioned and spacecraft expressions being said out loud - things that you dont understand unless you are a spacecraft ingenier. There are clips with a child and a woman in various situations at home while daddy is up in space - all made to look like a documentary - which is all fine - if only it would capture the viewer. But it just dont. Instead it seperates the viewer from the story beeing told making it boring to be frank - which is quite impressiv in a way when you think of the fact that this is a movie about one of the biggest achievements in mankind - The first man on the moon"

"lauren0531","9","0","1","3 May 2020"," Biopic of Neil; Not Intended to be like Apollo 13
","To set, I loved the movie, ""Apollo 13,"" which was interesting and edge of your seat action packed. I really liked the movie, ""Martian,"" which was fun and quickly paced. I ""just"" liked the movie, ""Gravity,"" which was slower, but incredibly well made. Apollo 13 is one of those movies I can watch over and over. Martian I can re-watch a half a dozen times or so on a Sunday to kill time. Gravity is a 1-2 time watch for me. The pace of ""First Man"" sits with Gravity, moves like Martian, but ignites the same feelings as Apollo 13. It's not re-watchable over and over. Yet, I found this movie, that I watched solely for Ryan Gosling and because of my mild interest in space movies, as intense as Apollo 13 and as well made as all of the other 3, or even better.<br/><br/>To be clear, this movie is based on a book whose author was led by Neil Armstrong himself. It was further directed with the help and input of Neil's children and family. It's accurate. It's not a movie about ""landing on the moon."" It's a movie about Neil.<br/><br/>The complaints in other reviews are what I find to be the best parts of the film. The super close up camera work, the sometimes jiggly, where we can't see anything that they themselves didn't see in flight, are things that make this movie believable and genuinely authentic.<br/><br/>A lot of the excerpts in the film are REAL recordings of reporters-it is authentic in every single way. It's a little slow in parts, and the acting makes Neil seem boring. But the acting is incredible and again, genuine."

"EricSu","8","0","1","9 April 2020"," It's the same director after 85. They've landed on the moon. We're still on the earth!
","So far, the first man on the moon has won the prize. It was shortlisted for the main competition unit of the 75th Venice Film Festival<br/><br/>At the same time, she won the nomination of best female partner for the 76th Golden Globe Award and the 72nd British Film Academy Award. Up to now, the film has been shortlisted for the 91st Oscar for best original score and best visual effect.<br/><br/>
The director of this film is Damien chazeley, a young director. I didn't pay much attention to his personal information before. When I knew he was born in 1985, I was shocked because his ""blowout drummer"" and ""city of love"" are excellent works. It's sad to see the ""Moon"" shot by others and the ""Earth"" shot by our post-80s directors at the same time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The film focuses on the life of the legendary American astronaut Neil Armstrong, focusing on his process of becoming the first man to land the moon in human history from 1961 to 1969. It also shows the unimaginable national and individual sacrifice of human beings in the most dangerous journey of space exploration in history.<br/><br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of the article, from the subjective perspective of commander Gao, commander Gao made a forced landing in the desert during the test flight, followed by the death of commander Gao's little daughter, and the whole family fell into grief. Commander Gao wanted to change this situation and resolutely chose NASA's Twin Star program under the situation of being grounded by the original unit. This was to prepare for the Apollo program of landing on the moon. After a series of near death training, his companion Elliott crashed while driving the trainer. Shortly after that, he and his colleagues boarded the Gemini 8 and completed the docking in space for the first time. This is also the first step of the moon landing plan. After the docking, when everyone was immersed in the exultation, there was a problem with the spacecraft. The near death training was put to use. The spacecraft was rolling in space at the speed of one circle per second. The colleague had fainted Gao Si After a series of investigations, the organization finally confirmed that this was not caused by the man-made operation error of commander Gao, but by the mechanical failure. Commander Gao and his colleagues formally joined the Apollo moon landing program. Later, commander Gao attended the White House banquet on behalf of the astronauts. At the same time, his colleagues were carrying out a test of the cabin of the spacecraft. As a result, three of his colleagues were burned alive. Commander Gao survived, but he was burdened with the unfinished business pressure of his colleagues. Later, when testing the lunar lander, the aircraft could not land safely. Commander Gao used the seat ejection + parachute to retrieve a life. Soon after, commander Gao is about to enter Apollo 11. His wife is under great pressure due to the uncertain future. Of course, it is clear that commander Gao's Armstrong has successfully leapt out of the human stride on the moon. After returning to the earth, commander Gao's wife sees commander Gao in the isolation room.<br/><br/>The whole story seems to tell a story about how a hero was tempered. But looking at the details of the film and the language of the camera, the director satirized the absurdity of the image game between the United States and the Soviet Union during the arms and space race, the lives of dozens of astronauts, and the huge expenditure on lunar exploration that led to the government's financial tension and people's March, all at the cost of catching up with the Soviet Union to land on the moon in advance.<br/><br/>The absurdity of this image game is reflected in many parts of the film. For example, in the 41st minute of the film, commander Gao and his colleagues walked into Gemini 8, and a row of staff stood on both sides of the spacecraft, like waiting for the experimental results of the mouse. All they wanted was to get the results and improve the spacecraft.<br/><br/>When the two men just entered the spaceship, the staff called out who had the Swiss Army knife when fastening the safety belt. The buckle of the original safety belt was stuck by a foreign object. It can be seen that there is no doubt that the reason behind the rough and crude equipment - to catch up with the schedule.<br/><br/>The spaceship was closed by the crew, which was also shot from the subjective perspective of the astronauts, like the feeling of being covered with a coffin, oppressive and helpless. Commander Gao, who was about to take off, saw a bird passing through the triangle glass. The next scene is even more joking. There is a fly in the capsule which should be so rigorous and scientific.<br/><br/>Later, the director used a series of parallelism lenses, including the internal angles of the cabin, the squeaking sound between screws and seams, which made people think that the rough construction of the spaceship is likely to break up. While commander Gao's life and death are uncertain, commander Gao's family has arranged publicity and shooting.<br/><br/>In the film, one hour and 18 minutes later, when three colleagues were in the Apollo module for plug-in test, an astronaut and the staff were talking by radio, and the quality of the conversation was poor. The astronaut ironically said that if we can't hear the conversation in the three buildings, how to make the earth moon conversation.<br/><br/>Then there was the electric wire fire in the cabin. The whole cabin was full of oxygen. The director used an external lens to show how tragic the accident was caused by the staff's mistake. There were two doors in the experimental cabin. The outer iron door was deformed by the explosion, and the people inside could imagine it.<br/><br/>As commander Gao was about to leave his wife and drive to NASA for the Apollo landing, NASA executives were preparing a speech on the failure of the landing. I think that's why I gave 8 points for this film. Some ethnic groups are different. They can't let you put the problems you encounter in the behavior of a big country on the screen. Twists and turns? Nothing! Everything is going well!
When commander Gao went into space with Apollo and was about to land on the moon, alarm 1201 sounded. Commander Gao twice asked the ground headquarters for the meaning of alarm 1201, and twice he got the same answer: checking! And the third time I asked for help, the ground headquarters replied that it was OK! This reminds me of the style of the Russian fighting nation.<br/><br/>In the whole story, the director also expresses such a concept in the film. Human life and death is just the death of a certain role in other people's world, and there will be new roles to replace it. Yes, it is very sad. After the death of commander Gao's daughter, he and his wife gave birth to a new life, and she slept in the bed of the deceased daughter. Even more so under the national ideology, the death of commander Gao's colleagues will soon bring new colleagues to the top, and people will only remember the man who finally completed the moon landing."

","Could have indeed. Really wanted to like this.<br/><br/>It's a very strange film. Some of the sequences are very well done however, I will give it that. The moon landing felt a little disjointed, and as usual with films of this nature they are always strapped in seconds before launch.<br/><br/>Buzz Aldrin seemed portrayed as a complete dunderhead, bizarrely. Micheal Collins, was he even mentioned? For a brief second or two.<br/><br/>While I never met Neil Armstrong, the interviews i have seen of him around the moon landing and later in life - he doesnt come across as the depressing monotone character portrayed in the film. However I have also read the family thinks it was a good portrayal, so who am I to argue. The rest of the Astronauts are also seemingly portrayed as, well, one dimensional couldnt care less figures. It was hard to like anyone apparently.<br/><br/>Even the spacecraft are seemingly falling apart, dirty, almost 'starwars like' in interior appearance and make the oddest noises whilst in roll program and pitch manoeuvres. If this is actually the case I apologise, I was under the impression especially the command module and lunar module were built in clean environments and not reused in any way, to actually get this worn rag tag look. Very odd.<br/><br/>Still think Apollo 13 did it better."

","This could have been a great film, but it was far from that.<br/><br/>This is another in the modern Hollywood vein of making a film/dramatisation of famous real-life events, this situation/story was a cracking one, the life of Neil Armstrong leading up to him walking on the moon. But instead the Director Damien Chazelle destroyed any chance of a good film !!<br/><br/>The main problem was the close-up and ultra-close-up filming, I have seen this elsewhere in movies and on TV, IT DOES NOT WORK!, all it does is annoy me because you don't get to see much, you need a wider viewpoint from the camera. The editing was also rubbish, it was poorly made.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Ryan Gosling, having seen some of his early efforts, however I have to admit it was great acting from him, he played the part of the quiet spoken Neil Armstrong well, too well, I know NA was not a blabbermouth but he did speak more than Ryan portrayed him, but that is my only quibble with the part, other than that it was great. The other actors also did a fine job, I would be interested in hearing what they thought about what their work turned into ?.<br/><br/>I have read other reviews of this movie and most of them refer to how boring it was, I don't think it was that boring (some people just have the attention span of a Gnat), however it did seem to drag on for a while in parts (mostly just annoying with the camera work), apart from the annoying ultra close-ups the flying/space scenes were good but the family scenes were a bit lacking, they needed more dialogue, I am sure that NA spoke to his wife a whole lot more than in this film.<br/><br/>If you want to see a good movie of a similar vein, Apollo 13 with Tom Hanks is the one, not this one, only watch this if you are doing an History major at college.<br/><br/>I gave it a 4 out of 10, but only for the acting and true story, if the acting was also poor it would of got a 2 from me. Ryan Gosling gets a 9 for his acting, Damien Chazelle a Zero out of 10 for his direction.

Generally speaking however the training and build up to the mission is marvellous with space flight trials and the NASA based training programme all captured on film in such a jaw dropping fashion of beauty, pushing the limits of current cinema technology.

This movie shows the determination and focus needed to not only go to the moon almost did not happen and i think it was 8 people died in those preceding years, but Amstrong still had faith and it might not have been possible without Armstrong. At every stage one small fault could stop this achievement. The people who say it did not happen can't explain why every step taken was tried and tested. The major hurdle to overcome was docking in space and this was achieved. ""They went to the moon and found earth"". The movie was snubbed at oscars for best picture and slatted because it did not show Amstrong planting the American flag but does have the flag on spacesuits. I would have liked to see the flag being planted on surface but we all know thats the original film and this movies is more about Amstronge and he had 10 minutes by himself on the surface and this movie was about his time it does not focus on the story of the other astronauts too much. The movie was a great story and for that alone should have been included in best picture.

","On July 20, 1969, the history of the human race changed forever when Neil Armstrong became the first human being to set foot on the Moon, making ""one small step for man...one giant leap for Mankind"". What not too many people outside of the American space program may have known about, however, was the psychological strain that Armstrong's astronaut training and his ascension into immortality has on him and his family. This was detailed in the best-selling 2005 biography ""First Man"" by James Hansen, which received that year's American Astronautical Society's prize for Astronautical literature. And in 2018, that book was turned into an incredible historical drama on the same name.<br/><br/>The film follows Armstrong, portrayed by Ryan Gosling (who had starred in the Oscar-winning 2016 film LA LA LAND), during his first years as part of NASA's astronaut corps, as America races not only to catch up with the dreaded Soviet Union in putting human beings into space (after the humiliations of seeing the Soviets beat them with a pair of Sputnik satellites and Yuri Gagarin) but also to meet President John F. Kennedy's stated goal of launching a man to the Moon and bringing him safely back to the Earth before the end of the 1960s. The race to the Moon means he has to be quite psychologically detached from almost all considerations, including what would otherwise pass for a ""normal"" relationship with his wife (Claire Foy), and still have it in the back of his mind that his chosen line of work puts him and others in NASA's manned space lineup in extreme danger during these missions. This is borne out when his flight on Gemini 8 in the spring of 1966 goes almost fatally awry, followed by the loss of his three fellow astronauts Gus Grissom (Shea Whigham), Roger Chaffee (Cory Michael Smith) and Ed White (Jason Clarke) in the horrible Apollo 1 flash fire on the launch pad on January 27, 1967. And then there is, of course, the media asking questions whether such risks are worth expending billions of dollars on (even as billions more are at the same time being spent in Vietnam on a war that is increasingly splitting the country apart). And in the final days before Gosling makes that trip to Kennedy Space Center to embark on Apollo 11, he has a confrontation with Foy about the possibility that he won't be coming back. The family strain is exceptionally palpable by this time. Nevertheless, the mission happens; and the rest, as they say, is history.<br/><br/>While the Apollo 11 flight is likely the most examined case of human technological might in history, FIRST MAN, due to the combination of director Damien Chazelle (who directed LA LA LAND and WHIPLASH) and screenwriter Josh Singer (who co-wrote the screenplays for SPOTLIGHT and THE POST), makes for a hugely interesting film. What is strikingly unusual about the film is the fact that much of what is done is played out in a low-key and arguably cold, detached way. Such an approach, in an age where overemphatic acting and hyperbolic action scenes remain the rage in Hollywood, was one thing that seemed to turn off many viewers to this movie, even though it worked quite well for director Stanley Kubrick and his 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, which FIRST MAN pays homage to. But anyone who read Hansen's book will know that such detached behavior among the astronaut corps was part-and-parcel for that time. Like Kubrick, Chazelle also knows a thing or two about how to make real the incredible silence one finds in space. And while some ""uber-patriots"" severely slammed FIRST MAN for never showing the U.S. flag being planted by Armstrong and Aldrin on the Moon, the truth of the matter was that the Apollo 11 mission wasn't just strictly an American endeavor, but the ultimate Human endeavor as well.<br/><br/>Justin Hurwitz, who provided the Oscar-winning score for LA LA LAND, provides another great music score (with the occasional ""2001"" references); and FIRST MAN rightly won an Oscar for its realistic special effects work. Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is also spot-on, regardless of how detached one might say he is, as are Foy, Kyle Chandler, and Ciaran Hinds. And even if the approach it takes might turn off those who want a lot more of heat, sound, and fury, FIRST MAN should rank up there with films like APOLLO 13 and THE RIGHT STUFF in terms of depicting not only America but all of humanity itself at its absolute best."

","First Man tells the inside story about the astronauts from the 1960s who were battling to defeat the Russians in the race to space. The focus is on Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling - LaLa Land), the first man to walk on the moon. Along the way you learn about his wife (Claire Foy - Girl in the Spiders Web) and their complex, strained marriage. Most revealing are all the details you learn about his family and the stress and strain they faced.<br/><br/>Gosling delivers a stellar performance as Armstrong, who is revealed as a quiet, humble, gracious man. He carries the weight of multiple tragedies on his shoulders. You learn that he's lost family, and friends, but somehow, space calls to him. He is revealed as a try pioneer who wants to go where no one has gone before. And this guy was REAL, not like Matt Damon in Martian. Which makes his story even more compelling.<br/><br/>The director does a terrific job of weaving in key incidents that led to decisions that caused things to happened that affected the entire Gemini and Apollo program. Finally, the focus was definitely on the first step on the moon, but also the journey to get there.<br/><br/>This film delivers real lifelike feelings throughout. These space ships were using computers that nowadays are antiques. You feel the ships shaking, You hear the groans and creaks of metal being stressed. You hear buzzers going off with warnings. You are there. If you watch the Special Features, you learn that the film is very realistic because instead of a green screen, they used a new, huge LED screen with images of the moon. This gave the actors and stage people the ability to see their surroundings and deliver a more real experience. It works!!! I really hope this LED technology advances movies to become more realistic, which benefits everyone.<br/><br/>Great acting by Claire Foy as Mrs Armstrong. She delivers the perfect portrayal of a 1960s wife of an astronaut who at any time could lose her husband. Other excellent supporting cast roles too. The landing reveals something that I did not know, and you will be surprised too. It reveals how much Armstrong loved his family, and how he felt about a greater power. Gosling should have been at least nominated for Best Actor - again - he was terrific.<br/><br/>First Man is an excellent film that stands right up there with The Right Stuff and Apollo 13 as superior space films. See it - you'll love it. Enjoy"

","I had high hopes for this film...I mean, who wouldn't? A movie about the first human being to walk on the moon's surface? Instead of the thrill of perhaps the most momentous event in history, we are treated to a brooding, fearful, almost regrettable version of the tale.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, first and foremost, this was an American event done in the name of the human race. Regardless of your politics, I think we can all agree that the American flag being planted on the moon's surface should at least have been recognized in the film given the historical significance it had at the time.<br/><br/>As to historical accuracy, the scene where Armstrong drops his daughter's bracelet into a crater makes one wonder if it really happened. While the records show that Armstrong wandered off by himself for a 10-minute period, they do not indicate what he did during that time. From a practical standpoint, one cannot help but wonder how an astronaut, with those extremely bulky gloves on, would be able to retrieve the tiny bracelet of a two-year old girl from a pocket on a spacesuit? I am not saying that it didn't happen as the film shows, however, I think when one looks at it objectively, the event is probably more Hollywood than history.<br/><br/>Secondly, as we watch Armstrong go through the training and selection process, we get the sense that he really didn't care about the program...that it was just a job. While that may have been the case in real life (I didn't know Neil Armstrong personally, so I'm afraid I can't say with certainty one way or the other), it makes for a pretty poor movie. If the main character is acting as if he's not interested in being there, we as the audience can't help but wonder why WE are there as well. As to Gossling's brooding portrayal of Armstrong, we see it is in direct contrast that with all the images taken during and after the mission itself of a smiling Armstrong and fellow crew. Which is the truth? I can't say for certain, but I'll go with the mission photos and tone of the speeches Armstrong made instead of the Hollywood portrayal.<br/><br/>On the other end of the spectrum, and the reason I gave the film as many stars as I did, was it's ability during the mission scenes to draw a viewer in to the action. The creaking and groaning of the rocket as fuel was pumped in and the ignition sequence was initiated had us strapped in alongside Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin. The stuck thruster sequence in the Gemini 8 scene had us on edge, despite knowing that the outcome would be positive. If you choose to watch this movie, those scenes will allow us to ""experience"" the hazards of spaceflight those pioneers braved.<br/><br/>In summary, don't expect this film to be historically accurate. Should you choose to watch it yourself, enjoy the spaceflight sequences where your surround sound system can envelope you in the action."

","First of all I would like to say that I can't understand most of the ratings of other users published here. It seems that many of you have become mentally dull due to the usual blockbusters from Hollywood, which are full of successive action scenes and dull ""dialogues"".<br/><br/>I read here an Rating of a user, which I do not name now consciously, who complained among other things about the camera work. I quote ""...were shot in a way to make them resemble shaky-handed home-video footage"".<br/><br/>I think there are some clear problems with the understanding of film production here. I know a nice saying: ""if you have no idea, you shouldn't bother your people with your unknowledge"" - I personally can only say that the camera work was very well done and in such a way it was able to put the viewer right ""into the middle of the action.""<br/><br/>It must also be said that films are also a form of art. And art can make use of artistic freedom. This in turn means that this form of art also means that you find an interpretation of the artist which corresponds to what he wanted to achieve as a result.<br/><br/>To sum up, I can only say that Ryan Gosling has added his personal and known touch here. Anyone who has seen his films will understand what I mean. He usually has a certain calmness and coolness, for some it seems emotionless. But even a few words can say a lot, just as good pictures!<br/><br/>In my opinion, those who rate a good movie badly simply have no understanding for this form of art and should rather watch talk shows, go drinking canned beer and don't bother others with his ""stupidity"".<br/><br/>PS: I am not a native speaker, so please excuse any grammatical mistakes."
"jmalmsten","8","0","2","2 March 2019"," One heck of a movie.
","I remember seeing the trailers, being dismayed that the first actual movie about the moon landing was looking to be a mess of grainy shakycam. So I put off seeing it in the cinema. Ultimately it was too late and I had to wait for home video. And while I do have a decent home cinema system, I do kind of regret not seeing it on a giant venue.<br/><br/>The camera is shaky. Yes. And I am very hard to convince that a shaky camera is necessary. But. Honestly. It fit. I did get the sense of the claustrophobic experience inside those tiny capsules. Only having a tiny window to see anything. When things get out of control the camerawork is still readable. And the sound matches the visuals.<br/><br/>I have recently seen a similar attempt from Russian filmmakers to try to portray Gagarin on film. That was one misguided effort of propagandistic drivel. I mean. He probably was a great guy. But the film was dreary and formulaic... I feared that this film about Armstrong would fall into that same trap. But no. There was actual competence in the writing here.<br/><br/>And the scenes on the moon itself. Somewhat short. But at least they opened up the framing, let it be steady, and bumped the stock from grainy 16mm to glorious 70 mm horizontal IMAX.<br/><br/>One thing I do wish is that more of the film did depict details of the actual flight and mission. But then again... I'd probably prefer a complete recreation spanning 10 * hour long pretty uneventful episodes of a HBO show. Chronicling one day of mission time each episode or something like that. This is a one night movie and I am very happy with what I did get to see."

"skmjamestitchmarsh","10","0","3","27 February 2019"," A Monumental Moment in History Truned into a Monumental Moment in Cinema
","First Man is a perfectly crafted masterpiece that offers the ultimate cinematic experience. The film does an excellent job at portraying the perils and exhilaration of spaceflight. First Man accounts the space races of the '60s in the eyes of the emotionally damaged hero, Neil Armstrong and it does an exceptional job of laying out the real costs of making it to the moon. Chazelle has an obsession with men who are obsessed. He loves to dissect what makes greatness and the sacrifices that people make to achieve that greatness, which is something that really shines through in this film.<br/><br/>First Man is truly breathtaking and powerful. The film has a lot of handheld camera work which gives it the feeling of a homemade documentary of Neil's life. The beauty of this technique is especially apparent during the small personal moments with Neil's family. This automatically escalates the already intense flight sequences because the audience is now thinking about Armstrong's family just as he would have been during those sequences. All of this, combined with the absolutely beautiful shots of the spacecraft (especially the takeoff of Apollo 11) and the moon, make this film my favourite cinematographic experience of all time.<br/><br/>The lunar sequence is perfect. The moment the camera leaves the landing module and switches to the IMAX format left me instantly in awe. I felt so taken aback during it because, for at least a minute, the movie was purely in silence, (as well as the audience) and for a moment, just a small moment, I really felt like I was on the Moon, and as I was on the verge of tears the fantastic score kicks in. The film is phenomenal at simulating the grandness of space, as well as the emptiness, the loneliness and tranquillity of being on the moon. It really puts into perspective how little we are in this massive, infinite universe. The personal moment we get with Neil was one of the most emotional moments I have ever experienced in film and left me in tears. This was and always will be one of my favourite IMAX experiences.<br/><br/>The score fits the movie perfectly, you can hear the ambition, the anxiety and the emotional toll that is taken on the characters. The passion that Justin Hurwitz had working on this score just stands out in every track. It had me on the verge of tears just listening to it on my Train ride home.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling delivers a career-best performance. I completely believed that Neil Armstrong felt the way that Gosling portrays. His performance has very little dialogue but is extremely powerful. He shows Neil's suppression of emotion incredibly well and subtly shows them throughout the film, just as I now believe Neil did. This really emphasises how good of an actor he really is. After all, it is much harder to do an emotionally subtle performance than it is to do a loud one.<br/><br/>This film represents an important, inspiring time in our history and just as landing on the moon was a huge achievement for mankind which had a massive impact on the rest of history, this movie was a huge achievement for film and will surely leave a solid footprint for future films. It definitely had an extraordinarily bold impact on me."

Camera work is superb, the so criticized shaky camera works in this accidental journey to be the first man, depicting the struggles, deaths and personal hurdles... from his point of view, not flashy headlines.

I didn't expect any sort of masterpiece, but I did like the scene where the people protest to the tune of Gil Scott-Heron's ""Whitey on the Moon"" (about the lack of attention paid to people in the inner city). I guess the fact that the USSR sent the first satellite (Sputnik), first man (Yuri Gagarin), first woman (Valentina Tereshkova) and first dog (Laika) into space, but the US reached the moon first, it all balances out.

","I'm torn. What do you say about a well made, well directed, and well acted movie that bored the tar out of you? That was bad? It WASN'T bad! That it was unrealistic? But.....it WASN'T unrealistic! What one has when it is rendered down to the basic elements is that if a person is interested in the spacerace or into Ryan Gosling, it's a good one to see. Gosling never seems to disappoint and here is yet another example. He makes it look effortless, and he is so handsome again I just want to hire a Batman villain to invent something to swap faces with him! Let's see you mop up at the box office with MY face Gosling! I digress. Claire Foy nails the understated calm of her screen persona as does really the rest of the cast. The special effects were on point, and i will say that a couple of the action scenes, for example the opening one, were truly riveting. There's another scene wherein Armstrong and another astronaut (I wont say who) are in trouble and need a solution, and I had to pinch myself lest I start believing I was there in person! But this is where I start struggling to dish out accolades. Not because there are no more deserved, but because despite all the above I found myself fast-forwarding. I didn't get invested in this movie like I did in Apollo 13, the movie to which everyone on earth to a person knew that this movie would be compared. Or Damon's movie the Martian, where the leading man's vulnerability and believable self deprecating humor were so endearing. So that's I guess why this one isn't resonating as the others did, and I don't think anyone can really blame anyone for that. As I said before: you've really got to be ""into"" the subject matter because despite getting good grades in direction, plot, screenplay, cinematography, and acting, it just lacked that extra something. And that's why I opened with the question that I did."
"xmdbx","5","0","1","7 February 2019"," One Small Step (Back) For Chazelle
","I feel like this film is supposed to be trying to say something but I just can't tell what that is or if it is even trying at all. It is a different perspective of the ""man"" from the legendary ""one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind"". It takes a look at the dark side of the story of Neil Armstrong and tells the stories of his misfortunes. It does this, I think, poorly. If the movie's only goal was to tell the story of the First Man then, sure, it did a fine job but I find it hard to believe that this was supposed to simply be a dramatized documentary. There are frequent dramatic moments throughout the film that occurred in real life but left me feeling nothing. I can't remember a single moment when I felt like I was feeling any emotion other than mild frustration. Chazelle just isn't in his element. I don't think it was the musical aspect of his previous two films that brought out the quality in them. They had much better acting, more daring shots and less bad special effects. Ryan Gosling isn't close to as good as he was in La La Land. It's like he was told to act as melancholic and mysterious as possible while just quoting Armstrong. There isn't anything about his character, or any character for that matter, that I admired. I get the appeal of making a movie about one of the most important men in history and I get the appeal in trying to make something original but it seems that Chazelle's charm was lost in his ambition."

","La verdad es que la película no está mal. No es apasionante, pero no está mal. Eso si durante toda la película tengo la sensación de que necesito que el plano me muestre más y nunca lo hace. Por el contrario en algunos momentos me llega a marear, no creo que sea la forma de narrar una película. Este bastante mal dirigido, ya que no tiene momentos emotivos, no realza nada, no le da fuerza a ningún momento. Es bastante plana en ese aspecto.<br/><br/>Ryan, imagino que el director le querría así de plano, pero a mí, es un personaje que no me atrae nada. El resto de actores están en su sitio, sin sobresalir ninguno, pero sin hacerlo mal.<br/><br/>La iluminación te deja que te metas en la película. Este bastante bien, seguro que es mejor que algunas otras incluso que las nominadas a la iluminación.<br/><br/>No me gusta como lo hace el director. ¿Quién no quiere ver ese momento de pisar la luna más especial? No consigue transmitir la fuerza de ese momento, ni de ningún otro. Consigue marear mucho en muchos momentos con la cámara. Hace planos demasiado cerrados y a mí al menos, me produce cansancio donde no debería hacerlo.<br/><br/>Lo que está muy bien logrado es toda la parte visual, realmente parece que estas en una nave en el espacio. Parece que estas en la luna. Es lo mejor de la película.<br/><br/>Pero creo que después de todo, después de los Òscar, la olvidaremos todos.<br/><br/>The truth is that the movie is not bad. It's not exciting, but it's not bad. That if during the whole movie I have the feeling that I need the plane to show me more and never do it. On the contrary in some moments I get dizzy, I do not think that is the way to tell a movie. This quite badly directed, since it does not have emotional moments, it does not enhance anything, it does not give strength to any moment. It is quite flat in that aspect.<br/><br/>Ryan, I guess the director would love him that way, but to me, he's a character that does not appeal to me. The rest of the actors are in their place, without excelling any, but without doing it badly.<br/><br/>The lighting lets you get into the movie. This pretty well, it sure is better than some others even that the nominated to the lighting.<br/><br/>I do not like how the director does it. Who does not want to see that moment of stepping on the most special moon? It does not manage to transmit the force of that moment, nor of any other. Get a lot of dizzy in many moments with the camera. It makes plans too closed and to me at least, I feel tired where I should not do it.<br/><br/>What is very well achieved is the whole visual part, it really seems that you are in a spaceship. It seems you are on the moon. It is the best of the movie.<br/><br/>But I think that after all, after the ,scar, we will forget all"

","I've seen a review entitled ""Continuously shaky camera work and up close camera positioning hinder this film"".<br/><br/>I know that being in the space capsule blasting off for the moon must be shaky. I know that's the way I'd feel if it was the first time in human history it was ever done.
And none of the other camera work, the human story of getting to that blasting off point, is shaky. So I'm not in agreement with this view.
I found the movie a fine work of uplifting popular cinema. I believe we all can agree it was not intended or produced as an art film, as was ""At Eternity's Gate"" ... (which to my sense, was very shaky and I could say ""Continuously shaky camera work and up close camera positioning hinder this film"").
I will suggest that all my friends and people in general see the movie to enjoy the story of singular people (each was there in that time, and dedicated to doing the task at hand) who helped make a very large task happen.
We are at a point in the history of humanity where huge undertakings, such as going to the moon for the first time, are possible. This is a very good representation of that effort, and the human dedication, and family bonds, that were involved.
So storys are told of those who have gone before us.
So movies can inspire us to dedicate ourselves to the task at hand.
So movies can show us that we need to keep loving those who give up our time and help when we go into the military, and do what we are ordered to do.<br/><br/>The music, the photography, the sets, the acting, cutting and direction are all well done and make a heroic story both heroic, and personally poignant.

"nishantbhalara009","8","0","1","28 January 2019"," Review - First Man(2018): A biography made from the perfect mix of discipline and emotion
","First man is the biography of the year directed by Damien Chazelle with works like Whiplash, La la land and writing credit for 10 cloverfield lane all very appraised and talked about. Chazelle casts Ryan Gosling, whom he has worked with on la la land as well. He is a great actor but one reason to get the role I believe is his near resemblance to Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon.
The starcast is full of familiar faces: Ryan Gosling, Claire Foy as Neil's wife, Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Shea Whigham and others. The scrren play is written by Josh Singer who has The Post and Spotlight amongst his past scripts, the screenplay is based on the biography by James R. Hansen by the same name. Even though I was personally willing to overlook this masterpiece, looking at the names above there was a very slim chance of a miss.
The acting is wonderful and no additions on that. But the visuals are just aww!, just get the opening scene it is amazing. There are pretty good low light scenes- many digital but some natural I expect(it doesn't make a difference if you cant tell the difference). Linus Sandgren, the cinematographer is already an Oscar winner for La la land and he might have another on his lap with the First Man. The VFX and the cinematography are very intertwined and friendly with each other i.e. the CGI visuals are not only great as they are very realistic but the frame is very exploring with CGI to enhance them in more artsy terms, like something a person who sees the natural beauty with his own eyes would describe.
The storyline is commentable as it does not shy away from the human part of the life and the mundane part of the life. Not your usual biography where the great personality is given the heavy inspirational undertone through and through or where it is all about the country and make it overly patriotic. No, this is about the first man, he was not just an astronaut and had a life away from NASA. Thus, the plot is equal parts science-history and drama that is seamlessly connected by good editing.
In conclusion, this is one of the finest works out in the year 2018. Please do watch it if you were overlooking it like me, it is not just another biography.
Like if you do so and comment your suggestions."

","I've read many reviews complaining about there being too many close-ups. If the space vehicles were the same size as the Starship Enterprise, the same people would be criticising the film for it's lack of realism. Gemini and Apollo were called ""capsules"" for a reason. Close-ups were the only option, unless the director was expected to shoot the movie through the windows!<br/><br/>Also on the point of accuracy. I see the dirty condition of the cockpits were highlighted as ""Goofs"". The Director used the real Gemini and Apollo capsules for realism. No cleaning was allowed as you would be effectively causing destruction to an historical artefact!<br/><br/>I agree there some accuracy and timeline errors, but they were so minor that only hardcore space race fans would have picked up on (and I am one!)

","Ryan Gosling, a pretty sure bet for an Oscar nomination for director and his movie for cinematography, editing, and sound. Ryan has elevated the art of film-making with large close ups, a fusion of documentary style photography along with an authentic loud crisp sound design. He has borrowed some of the class elements of photography, sound, and music from Stanley Kubrick's sci fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). There are also some film techniques that lifted the sci fi space epic Interstellar (2014) directed by Christopher Nolan to another realm of true authentic realism. And more intriguing his Ryan's decision to use a naturalistic approach to his directing reminiscent of Lars von Trier's sci fi drama Melancholia (2011). The only weaknesses in this movie were perhaps the inevitable and unavoidable difficulty of providing sufficient background explanations and allowances for the sudden transitions occurring with gaps as years are necessarily skipped. The density and storyline was probably more than enough for a television event covering four or seven six hours worth of material, but the little screen would have been too dimunitive for the amazing impact of the big screen display of this epic historical event."

Lacking the ability to communicate with his family and friends. Chazelle nails it again and is becoming Hollywood's new Go To director.

I grew up during the 60's as a young boy and like all of us from that era was fascinated by Apollo and the whole space program. This film filled in holes for me and told of a man who suffered much loss and tragedy throughout the period. I am glad I watched it and I would suggest anyone who loved Apollo to not miss this film. The crap about the flag not being shown enough is just that crap, and misses the whole point of the film. The director even said he didn't want that to a controversy but again it misses the point of the film. If you are looking for some fast paced film with lots of action then it wouldn't be a movie about Neil Armstrong he wasn't like that in real life.

","The movie isn't really about accurate biographical portrail of Neil Armstrong during the Appollo program.

As an audience we get to feel the emotional turnmoil that was brewing inside Neil Armstrong during this period of his life, knowing full well that you could die at any moment (even during the training) yet having the courage go on.<br/><br/>Most of the criticisms I have read of the movie are, really, symptomatic of the society we live in at the moment, where people wants to be spoon fed positivity, spoon fed happiness, spoon fed fun and not wanting to ever face up to the struggles that are present in life.<br/><br/>Despite it's slow pace it's gripping from the start to the finish.

"chnutscher","5","0","2","17 January 2019"," Mediocre. Even space adepts will be disappointed.
","Mediocre. Even space adepts will be disappointed.<br/><br/>My guess is, this movie fails from minute 1 due to the premise of this movie. In fact, it was primarily the NASA that landed on the moon finally, and Armstrong was ""just"" one of its employees. No doubt an able, self-controlled man best suiting for the ""job"", who took many risks in his NASA career, but there were several others who did succeed, as all NASA missions and the following Apollo missions proved.<br/><br/>So the attempt of the movie to make out an extraordinary ""first man"" of Armstrong in the positive as well the negative way somehow goes to fiction. I found the movie over-pathetic in long parts, overdramatizing (and over-audioedited) the dangerous experiences of Armstrong. Seeing the movie, you easily can mistake Armstrongs life as one unique depression. Foy as his wife completes this, as she apparently took her worst ""annus horribilis"" as queen over to this movie as solemn, undercooled wife. As far we know of Armstrong, as restraint he was, he DID smile occasionally in interviews etc., something you will not find in the movie. I think also the side story of his child that died is overly emphasized in the movie. Hard to understand how the successful career of Armstrong leaves you so depressed in this movie, as would he literally have ""sacrificed"" himself with his hole life alone for this ""holy"" mission, pathetic! This hole movie looks like a gross misreprentation, I doubt Armstrong would have signed for the script.<br/><br/>As for the CGI of the space flights, they are OK but not that brilliant. Space adepts will easily overlook weaknesses of the script, if the technical portrayal excels, but also this is not very convincig here IMO. Not to speak from the sound editing which I found awful with the exaggerated background sounds.<br/><br/>My guess is, the overly high rating here in fact honors ""the important mission"", but not the movie itself, and the filmmmakers maybe counted on that."

","First Man<br/><br/>The best thing about being the first man on the moon is finally getting to take a dump in peace.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this drama doesn't depict any astronauts popping squats in craters.<br/><br/>Following the death of his daughter, test pilot Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) joins NASA's mission to put a man on the moon before the Russians.

"benjaminwg","7","0","1","14 January 2019"," Pretty good. Regardless of the execution, it tries to know and humanize a private man.
","Some of the family scenes felt a little too much like a Terrence Malick movie. Arguably the family stuff and the wife (the proverbial woman behind the man) are given too much screen time in general for a movie about space travel. These were professionals that compartmentalize in order to focus. I can sort of see the filmmakers' viewpoint that the family knew some aspects of him more than maybe his colleagues, particularly for someone this private, and since he's the protagonist here that should be a primary source, but it feels forced and weird.<br/><br/>I liked how they did more POVs & close-ups in the craft and from within the craft and fewer gods-eye-views. That's a big pet peeve of mine of lamely providing prospectives no one had and they did it well here; also makes it more suitably claustrophobic and violent.<br/><br/>I didn't like how brooding they made Armstrong and how Aldrin almost seemed to have a social disorder. The former was more smiley and affable in footage I've seen though he was clearly shy and not the most comfortable in the spotlight, and Aldrin's personality seems exaggerated here to act as an obvious character contrast.<br/><br/>Liked the dangerous, uncertain, mysterious, spooky tone it had compared to the boys choir romanticized shlock of Apollo 13. Might improve rewatchability if you can get past the morose Armstrong and excessive focus on family. The film's overall somberness does sort of lend itself I guess to the being-close-to-certain-death aspect that permeates it, like hanging out in an ER for a night.<br/><br/>Launch times still too short and still not fully showing trajectory, but are more accurate in this than prior movies like showing vibrating eyeballs. The Gemini 8 scene has a little homage early to the film Contact, which also brought to mind some similarities elsewhere in First Man to Interstellar. The Gemini 8 boarding and launch scene alone will probably get this nominated for Best Sound this year.<br/><br/>I would have liked to see some of the living, shaving, pooping, whatever everyday annoying stuff of life in a tin can for a couple days on transit to the moon... constant mind-numbing checklists, cleaning sweat off stuff, complaining about the smell, etc. They're just, boom, all the way to the moon and getting ready for landing. Could have also been an opportunity for the Armstrong and Aldrin thing to have more of an arc beyond just the awe-inspiring and hairy landing."

From the death of his little girl Karen to the loss of his trusted fellow Ed. This is not really a tear jerker. Rather it has been shot in a documentary style giving the viewers a touch of realism.And that is what makes this movie so special. Ryan Gosling as the mourned father first and an astronaut second is just splendid and may end up in winning an Oscar.Claire Foy as Janet is superb. And so are the rest of the cast. Overall a timeless classic which requires little bit of patience of the viewer as the young director Damien Chazelle of La La Land and Whiplash fame takes time to build his characters.And the product he delivers is superb.

Yes, the strong silent type, but more than that, as explained in the film, the man knew what REAL responsibility felt like, and he didn't crumble, not one inch. He was as likely as not to be going to his death on the mission. but he was an engineer, no maverick, yet when push came to shove, the guy just did what had to be done, whatever the cost."

"gilstrapv","8","0","1","29 December 2018"," Reveals enigmatic character of Armstrong
","As a Navy pilot in the Korean War and then a civilian test pilot, death surrounded Neil Armstrong. The deaths of comrades in crashes or enemies on the ground was part of his job. But when death came for his little girl, he took it harder than any other loss in his life. In the biographical movie, ""First Man,"" about Neil Armstrong as the first human to walk on the moon, we get a glimpse of this sorrow and many other aspects of the very private man at the focal point of the greatest moment in human history - the Apollo 11 Moon Landing.
If the moon landing was occurring now rather than 50 years ago, perhaps a more extraverted individual would be chosen, someone adept at social media as well as steely eyed control and piloting. Much speculation along these lines is going into the Mars goal. What kind of people do we need to be our pioneers to Mars? Maybe the charismatic Captain Kirk type, or his female counterpart, will lead the Mars mission. Fifty years ago, we needed a Mr. Spock, with the methodical, scientific and engineering intellect to get the job done. We needed Neil Armstrong. The first moon landing was hairy. On their final descent, multiple program alarms blared in the Lunar Module and fuel was running out. Every nerve in Mission Control was on edge as the rest of the planet watched TV and held their collective breath. Had the astronauts come all this way to abort for safe return? Armstrong had proven time and again his ability to save the crew of a faltering craft. The mission was a success. It was relationships that eluded him.
From the beginning of the movie, the audience is exposed to shaky camera shots depicting test flights gone awry. It becomes an interactive experience with the continued discomfort. The viewer is ready for the ride to stop, but the point is - this was Armstrong's experience and he did not get to step off from the aircraft into safety. Perhaps director Damien Chazelle (""Whiplash,"" ""La La Land"") pushed the concept too far because I verged on nausea in a Gemini flight sequence when the capsule spun out of control. Be ready with some Dramamine if you don't have a strong stomach. Our nation's pioneering test pilots and astronauts were tough individuals, able to endure physical hardships and life threatening hazards as part of their everyday jobs.
Ryan Gosling -- the cool, suave driver or creative musician of previous roles -- disappears into the persona of Armstrong, the determined, self-contained engineer and pilot. But Gosling's portrayal gives a sense that a lot is going on under the surface. He doesn't suffer fools easily and calls out future mission partner Buzz Aldrin for a snap judgement on the cause of a fatal jet crash. The first two men on the moon apparently weren't best buddies. The moon in all its phases is almost a character in itself. Each shot of Armstrong gazing up at it seems to increase his soul-deep determination to get there. No waxing romantic for him. Armstrong's wife, portrayed by Clare Foy of The Crown TV series, needed all her imperial strength to break through Armstrong's frosty containment and force a family discussion of the mission. On the lighter side, she reveals Armstrong's love of musicals and even his original production of a musical in college. The man she fell in love with was very different from the one who went to the moon. Their relationship might have been a mission casualty. That question is left unanswered.
A little over a year before President Kennedy was assassinated, he aimed America at a moon landing by the end of the decade. With his death, the moonshot became a sacred obligation to a visionary president. Plus, we needed to beat the Russians in the space race. A successful moon landing would do it. It was a rare time of the government having the political and economic will to achieve a spectacularly hard technical and symbolic mission. In the summer of 1969, the end of the decade had arrived. The combined hopes and heartaches of a nation settled on the Apollo 11 crew, and especially its commander, Neil Armstrong. In the press conferences leading up to the mission, he took exception to negative and emotional questions from reporters. Aldrin smoothed things over. The two men complemented each other in abilities for the mission.
""First Man"" is based on a book with the same title written by James R. Hansen. As the only authorized biography of Armstrong, who talked with the writer for 50 hours of interviews, we can trust this portrait as accurate and well worth the time. Given his aversion to reporters, Hansen's work has even more importance. It is a rare opportunity to see behind the metal of the aircraft door into the cockpit and the story of the enigmatic man at the focal point of humankind's greatest achievement."

"tobydale","9","0","1","27 December 2018"," The inner journey to being the first...
","Just got home from watching First Man.<br/><br/>I'll disclose straight away that I am a HUGE student of manned space flight. I've seen the Apollo 11 capsule and Neil Armstrong's X-15 hanging from the roof of the Smithsonian in Washington. I've visited Cape Kennedy 3 times and done all the tours. I have read many of the astronauts' books, including Andrew Chaikin's outstanding ""A Man on the Moon"". Obviously, I am also a huge fan of the HBO series ""From the Earth to the Moon"". On top of all that - as a 10-year-old, I sat and watched completely gripped as Armstrong made the famous first step. I admit though, that I hadn't read ""First Man"".<br/><br/>So, what about this film? Well, it's not about going to the moon, although you could see it like that if you wanted to. So - what is it about? Now we get to the thought-provoking part; it's not clear.... I think it's about what the inner journey for Neil Armstrong might have been like. A lot of this is left up to us as we see what he experienced, and how he dealt with it.<br/><br/>Looking at the film, it's obvious that there is something quite de-humanising about everything surrounding space flight. Astronauts rely completely on machines; machines are our way into space, machines dominate every aspect - right down to enabling us to breathe. We are strapped into this machine - and it goes...<br/><br/>The space flight and launch sequences are brilliant. You and I are never going to experience being inside a Gemini capsule during launch - but First Man takes you as close as we are going to get. These rockets are scary and dangerous and it takes special qualities to fly in them.<br/><br/>Then there is an aspect to the film which is on another level again; and this is that, perhaps, for Armstrong, the whole personal journey of going to the moon, and being first was for him an unreal and out of body experience. After all - what can possibly prepare you to ride one of the most powerful and sophisticated machines ever built to another world? The answer is nothing can.<br/><br/>Armstrong in the film realises this. He is in a ground-braking and extremely dangerous line of work! The film shows this well. Test pilot, astronaut - Armstrong is very good at what he does. His role in saving Gemini 8 from disaster is shown. Had that mission ended in death for himself and Dave Scott, the whole history of the exploration of space might have turned out very differently, i.e. the Russians might have gotten to the moon first. In fact, he is so good, that he is the one chosen to solve the final problem and overcome the fraught challenge of flying that first moon landing.<br/><br/>Also, there is the personal dimension. Armstrong is a family man - but his line of work brings him close to death on many occasions. This is not lost on Jan, his wife. Her portrayal, by Claire Foy is excellent and believable. She tries to be supportive, but it is impossible for her too. Because the business of going to the moon is so difficult, so technically challenging and dangerous, so reliant on machines that could fail - the Apollo astronauts themselves all thought that they had a one in three chance of dying on a mission. All the wives and partners knew this too, particularly after the Apollo 1 catastrophe - which wasn't even in space.<br/><br/>OK. So, what about the film??? Well.... I liked it - but then I have deep knowledge of this subject and am always happy to watch films or shows about space. If I step back though, I can see why and how this movie might leave a lot of people cold. Why? Well, because Armstrong is shown rather dehumanized and abstracted from everything he is so profoundly absorbed with. A lot of viewers may not like the Armstrong of this movie - but I suspect that this portrayal is quite near to life. He is not shown here as some gung-ho all-American hero. Far from it. He is almost machine-like in his application to what is required to solve the problems and deal with the inherently dangerous business of going to the moon. He displays few emotions. It is unclear whether he is trying to protect himself or the people around him though this behaviour. Either way, Gosling's Armstrong does not grab you as someone you would enjoy going to the moon with. Sure - you'd get there safely - but after 10 days in space with him, you wouldn't know him any better. Armstrong would be in the Lunar Module with you - but he would be on his own inner journey.<br/><br/>Essentially, First Man is about just that; Armstrong IS the one who has been chosen to do these things first. Why? Because he has been identified as having the qualities required to carry it off. Once chosen, he has to find a way to deal with the enormity of the technical challenge of the first landing AND the personal challenges of keeping his real life together in the face of huge danger. First Man is a film about how one particular person handled the inner journey required. The viewer is left to reflect on it."

I was bored most of the time and fell asleep twice.
The scene that made me angry was when he meets his wife upon return. She was angry when he left, and she was happy while she was leaving house to meet him again, but when they saw each other, there was no emotions at all. He was gone for several days, not years.

","Since our childhood, the solar system portrayed has its objects in a way that is 'not to scale'.

Well this is where the accuracy of 'to scale' matters. Guess what the distance between Earth and the moon is. The answer is 30 times the diameter of Earth. Now just imagine the 'to scale' picture of other bodies. With such nature the foremost option that occurs to mind to carry out lunar mission is carry fuel. Taking into mind this option and overcoming the risks, first landing on moon was carried out. The movie gives account of that.<br/><br/>In future however it would be nice to see achieving such feats with solar or nuclear fuel. Once we dint have airplanes to travel.

","First Man is a powerful study of the humanity associated with the first astronauts, in particular Neil Armstrong. Ryan Gosling achieves something akin to an actors pinacle digging deep into the role of Neil Armstrong. By choosing to only show the seriousness and sacrifice Gosling gives a powerful restraint that makes the viewer feel Armstrong's dogged determination through his pain and uncertainty born out of tragedy and great sacrifice. Armstrong is the whole American can-do ethic against costly odds and this movie nails that important drive.<br/><br/>Most movies we've witnessed about space travel thrive on bombast. How refreshing it is to see the the sheer humanity of those who were willing to give it all presented naked and unadorned. Through the lens of Armstrong's unmatched accomplishment you will tangibly feel both the pride and pain of one of mankind's undisputed finest hours. I can hardly give a higher recommendation. I was a nine year old when this happened. I proudly wore a official Apolo 11 Nasa patch on my jacket at school for the next year. Yet I really had not pondered the human cost so deeply until I saw First Man. You should definitely see it few movies capture man's fragility and strength so stunningly."

This movie has some exiting landings, but that is about it. Actors are decent, but they cannot really show their best emotional finesses, because of the damn shaky-cam use. Script is not very exiting, it makes Neil Armstrong look like a boring man.

","I remember ( as a fourteen year old) the moon landing as an extraordinary occasion where the world held its breath. Neil Armstrong almost certainly had to be focussed, driven and probably a bit anti-social in order to get onto the moon program in the first place,but to portray him, as this director does, to be a dull guy who could certainly do with some continued grief therapy is a big error. If I had wanted to see a film concentrating on a psycho analysis of such a person this film would serve me well. However as a bio pic of one of the great icons of the 20th century, it fails completely. Even if it is a true portrayal which I doubt, it did not need this treatment.

","Poor Ryan ... I admit that the first time I saw him, he passed me by unnoticed, although not the movie. I have always remembered Craig Gillespie's «Lars and the Real Girl», but now I realized that the man acted so well, that he is diluted in the story, as an integral part of the story of the country boy who falls in love with a doll. It was Nicolas Winding Refn who pointed me to Gosling as if saying, ""Look at this Canadian, he's a very good actor."" Then we had to put up with his dancing, singing, whining, whistling, directing movies (the most notable ""Lost River"", if you did not see it, you blinked) and committing sacrilege with «Blade Runner»... That is fame. Ryan Gosling is a face and body for mega-products, as good as Colin Farrell or Tom Hardy. However, did Little Ryan make his homework and read «First Man» script well? It seems he did not, but well... he wanted to be king, he has to throw kisses! You'd better be more cautious than he was, and look the other way. «First Man» is a bad, dull, overlong and propaganda illustration of NASA official reports, that were adorned (with no good results) with technical data, a big dose of Biopic 101, a bit of fairy tale and too much domestic/jingoist melodrama. So the ""first moon landing"" or whatever that was, ceases to be a polemical issue and becomes a compilation of close-ups of shoes, sand and stairs against dark landscapes: of course, this meant that the filmmakers could not even think of using the controversial film that some people say Stanley Kubrick did. Look, I am going to give you a little advice: better watch Georges Mélies' «Le voyage dans la Lune». It is shorter and more fun. But, of course, Ryan's fans are fools, so we go to see him and we find this mammoth of shuddering metal, stunned sounds, allusions to the Cold War and a 141-minute lament for a lovely child that died in the first 10 minutes.

Kudos to Gosling and Foy for reliving their characters.<br/><br/>I'll always be on call to watch the next release from Chazelle because I know it'll be good and worth every penny."

"AnishMisra","9","0","1","17 November 2018"," First Man Review
","First Man is a film directed by Damien Chazelle. I remember this film being announced 2 years ago and I have waited a long time for this. SO naturally this film was one of the most anticipated of this year's. In addition to that I wanted to see what the combo of Damien and Ryan had for me. After the film ended, the film lover in me was over-joyed.<br/><br/>Plot: Follows Neil Armstrong and the years leading up to the Apollo 11 mission to the moon in 1969.<br/><br/>Story and direction: The main hero of the film is the script by Josh Singer and director Damien Chazelle. Singer who has some great films to his credit (SPOTLIGHT, THE POST) has written an emotional and thrilling story. This went on to show that how well the director understood what the writer wanted to say on the screen. The film has its moments of thrill and emotions. And never for a single moment those went overboard, there was a balance between the two. Also, I did love the way Damien has used practical effects instead of VFX (an age where VFX is used in almost 90% films). I remember in every scene involving spacecrafts I was terrified for the safety of those in it (although I still knew the results in some scenes). The emotions depicted are so apt and correct that I could very well connect to the pain these characters are experiencing. The score by Justin Hurwitz is another plus point. I especially liked the track titled 'The Landing' (Yes, I did look up the name after watching the movie). I did like the way hand-held cameras were used to film the scenes. But on the other hand, I hated the way there were too many close-up shots instead of wide angle (barring the spacecraft scenes).<br/><br/>Acting: There are two people that stood out for me: Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy. Ryan Gosling has come a far way and has shown he can do variety of roles. As Neil Armstrong, he nailed it. It's for the first time I am seeing Claire Foy in something and I was gobsmacked. Be it emotional or happiness, she just plays the role with ease. Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler and Corey Stroll provide good support.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the scene where Janet confronts Neil just before he is about to leave for Apollo 11. I would not like to spoil much but the scene was full of emotions and I was just fully into the scene. I literally had goosebumps watching the scene.<br/><br/>Verdict: It is quite sad that a beautiful film like this is not doing well in the box office for some very stupid reasons. I felt the film was great and left the cinema happy and satisfied. I look forward to see what Damien has more to offer us.<br/><br/>I am going with a 9/10."
"criticwithnoname","7","0","1","11 November 2018"," A perfectly serviceable narrative. Nothing more.
","As a life long space enthusiast, I was looking forward to this movie because I had always wanted to see the historic Apollo 11 landing done justice on the silver screen. The details surrounding the actual history of that mission are ripe for cinematic drama. As hinted by the film's promotional materials, no one knew what was going to happen. Several critical points in the mission went wrong which were only resolved by snap decisions and brilliant thinking.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Damien Chazelle decides to take a different approach with the material. After an extremely effective opening scene involving Armstrong as a test pilot, Chazelle shifts the narrative away from the technical details of NASA (ala Apollo 13) and focuses on Armstrong's family life. While this narrative is illuminating into Armstrong as an historical figure and film character, it detracts from the film's goal as the proported cinematic account of the first moon landing.<br/><br/>When the mission does take place, its details are, once again, glossed over for sentimentality. Perhaps the biggest flaw in the depiction of the landing is the egregious lack of key points and problems faced by the crew which could have delivered deep emotion and, more importantly, strong suspense. This does NOT include the controversial omission of the astronauts planting the American flag, however. I recommend reading the first chapters of Buzz Aldrin's memoir, Magnificent Desolation since revealing all the omitted mission points would expose too many spoilers.<br/><br/>All in all, Chazelle tries to have it both ways. He wants a compelling character study of Neil Armstrong and he wants an account of the Apollo 11 mission. In the end the two narratives neutralize each other into a perfectly suitable but forgettable story."
"proud_luddite","7","0","1","11 November 2018"," Good mainly for the domestic scenes
","Based on the book by James Hansen: the life of astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) is highlighted from 1961 - 1969 culminating in the famous landing on the moon in the Apollo 11 mission.<br/><br/>""First Man"" succeeds in mixing Armstrong's well-known work-life with his family and social life. Its greatest credit can be given to its recall of the 1960s in look and feel. Much detail is placed in the sets including such forgotten objects as bean-bag ashtrays (during an era of rampant smoking) and the unique designs of hospital bracelets. Most importantly, the era is excellently re-captured in its portrayal of the widely accepted stoicism and emotional restraint despite occasional lapses of emotion that follow tragedies. As Armstrong's wife Janet, Claire Foy is superb in a scene of the night before the great mission.<br/><br/>The film would have been better if the aircraft scenes were at least as good as the family/friendship scenes. Many people are familiar with the saying ""it's not rocket science"". In ""First Man"", a lot of real rocket science talk tends to dumbfound the average viewer. Also, some aircraft scenes were too internal and stagnant to be exciting which is a disappointment as director Damien Chazelle did such brilliant work on ""La La Land"" a couple of years ago. The well-known climactic moment (no spoiler-alerts needed here) seemed less momentous than it ought to have been. But luckily, it ends in a beautiful moment that comes full circle from a major event earlier in the film."

","I have had a life long interest in the Apollo space programme so to start with I would have to say this is not particularly accurate. In an attempt to make an intense film they have overdone the sound/visual effects with respect to the rocket launches. Gemini was known as the ""bucking bronco"" but watch the film (Gemini 8 launch) and any rocket suffering that much vibration would have disintegrated. The flight of the x15 is the same with Neil staring wide eyed and saying nothing, just breathing heavily in fear. The guy was a test pilot and on a test flight !! - he wouldn't have stopped talking as that was his job to report on the systems of the aircraft etc. As for flying experimental aircraft whilst scared witless, He is a test pilot for god's sake !!. The ""family"" of astronauts is touched on but again all too intense and I agree with one user who said it was all a bit sombre and miserable. Lots of silent pauses and acting with a ""look"". However saying that I enjoyed the film as an action film with some powerful launch sequences as seen through the eyes of Neil. I know I said not very accurate but good cinema !! Well worth a watch but don't look for technical errors cause you will fill your notebook."

Plus, there were too many extreme close-ups, especially of Claire Foy, and the movie dragged in spots.

"statuskuo","8","0","1","2 November 2018"," An Achievement That Is Beyond Chazelle's Years
","Little is known of astronaut Neil Armstrong's personal life. He was a very introverted person whom we almost could assume suffered from Asperger's. A quiet savant who probably wasn't that much fun at parties. This is why the accomplishment of his life far outweighs the ending that we've all seen. The first man to ever step on the moon. Conspiratorial nutjobs out there claim it never happened, so be it. The other nutjobs think that not including the planting of the flag was a deal breaker. Guess what? The flag is on the moon in the film as is MANY instances where American flags are flown around. Universal wasn't going to allow patriotism to not go unnoticed from one of the most patriotic men in America.
That said, the true accomplishment is to make someone so milquetoast into someone who is ridiculously interesting. A lot of inner turmoil exists on Ryan Gosling's face, which has now been a running gag for a lot of critics. He never emotes. And you get that here too. But, it makes sense for him as Armstrong as you can tell, he wasn't an emotional person. Much has also been seen of Armstrong as an arms length guy which belies his accomplishments. It may be that ""The Right Stuff"" was the quintessential astronauts movie, this is the ultimate astronaut film.
I HIGHLY recommend this film, in that it puts you into the seat of these guys who are about to have the equivalent of an atom bomb explode underneath them. EVERYTHING about this film drives the essence of the time and the claustrophobia one feels inside. Tight quarters where you hear every creak and groan of a metal beast thrusting into the sky. It is a visceral experience that you feel more than you can comprehend. Without being a simulator, I suspect this is pretty accurate. The turmoil that Armstrong does feel at the loss of his daughter...you sense it. And there are many moments when you feel it really hit the inside of your heart. A man who tries desperately to feel so little feels so much. An awesome achievement from someone so young as director Damien Chazelle. He is in the same league as Spielberg or Abrams."

","This film won't be for everyone, but it's brilliantly constructed and delivered. The acting is nearly flawless, with the exception of Foy and Stoll. Both those actors really keep this production from actually being PERFECT. That being said, the flow and momentum of the film ensure you will never once glance at your watch wondering how long it's been since the start. The cinematography is beautiful, and the score is ethereal. Gosling shines in the role of the century, literally: Armstrong was a mystery to the masses, long after the moon landing, and Gosling delivers a moving performance that is so much the effort of physical presence. The supporting cast is mostly excellent, with the above exceptions. Familiar faces pop up as familiar names, and that makes the focus on Armstrong less obvious. This is a sentimental film, but more so in an individual way rather than a societal way. It's hard to imagine anyone under the age of 40 not liking this film, but it may not have the same resonance for a Millennial or a Gen Z viewer. Oh, and by the way, THEY LAND ON THE MOON AT THE END.

","Having just seen this film for the second time, I feel that I can fully justify my rating. Very few films have gripped me in the way that 'First Man' has. In my opinion the film balances and contextualises the personal and human side expertly with the more technical and scientific elements that make the story of the achievements and hardships of the initial tests and eventual moon landing so extraordinary and compelling.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy are superb throughout, providing dedicated and emotional performances that are all the more impressive considering how much screen time is dedicated to them. It's well worth mentioning and applauding Justin Hurwitz for the accompanying soundtrack which adds hugely to the experience and could not compliment better the visuals on screen. I think it's also important to point out that the film did well to avoid the cliches and overstatement that occur so often in films of this type.<br/><br/>I am not a space buff, but this film has inspired me to learn, read and engage more with the subject in the past two weeks than in the whole of my life to that point.

","I've scanned over many of the reviews written here in the imdb, and find it
hard to understand some of the criticism. Page after page re: camera shaking, and the seriousness of the crew. First of all, with regard to the seriousness, these people were flying to, landing on, walking on, and returning from the moon for the first time in global history. Not the time to be bouncing off the walls with excitement and joy of a teenage girl at a slumber party. This was serious business, which might have caused these astronauts their lives. Additionally, the makers of the film weren't interested in making a movie with lots of modern style computer animation and sound effects. An attempt was made to make the picture using methods that might have been utilized back THEN. And they did just exactly that. The film was very consistent with the way it would have been portrayed in those days. Furthermore, since events in those days didn't rely heavily on politically correct ideals, I'm sure many of the reviewers didn't care for the portrayal of so many white, male, heterosexual gentiles in the picture; people who in those times tended to be stoic. Sorry folks, but that's the way things were in those days. We can't always be trendy, stylish, hip, cool, or chic in making these films. Gotta stick to the way things really were at the time."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","0","2","30 October 2018"," Comparable to Apollo 13.
","First Man is what space biopics try to be and then some. It's about the Apollo 11 landing that indeed did happen, thanks to miscellaneous third-party sources proving it really occurred (like the BBC, The Soviet Union's government, the ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation), and everywhere else who received the broadcast live in 1969 outside The States). This film's truly an incredible film about space and the untapped wonders we're still yet to tap into: it also shows how the fragility of life must be balanced with scientific progress, as was the case with the many trials and errors NASA had along the way. Apollo 13 tells a story of aviation in the stars, and how human fragility has helped define certain moments of historical space exploration and how we've overcome our own problems, be it personal ones or overarching ones.<br/><br/>First Man shows that space is still very much a cinematic wonder to explore, and I want more up-and-coming directors like Damien Chazelle to explore the galaxy even more. I love these biopics: this one has all the emotional, historical and cinematic honesty of Apollo 13, and that's one of my all-time favourite movies.<br/><br/>First Man gets 5/5 stars."

","Man is a creature of the earth. He first found his wings in 1903, leaving the grounds shackles near Kitty Hawk. And only 63 years later, he left his home and set his feet on virgin soil. First Man details the 8 years leading up to Neil Armstrong's historic steps on the moon. The plot prefers the emotional aspects of Armstrong's life, centering on the crater left in his life after his daughter Karen died. Writer Josh Singer uses these poignant moments to peel back Armstrong who was generally stoic during his life. The greater majority of the film is shot without any tripod or stabilizing device, just as unsteady as NASA during the space race.<br/><br/>Some might say Ryan Gosling is statuesque in his portrayal of Armstrong. But history remembers a media unfriendly astronaut who maintained calmness under pressure, far from a dramatic character. To offset Goslings stillness, Claire Foy is a hurricane. She is the looking glass into Armstrong's soul, mirroring his torment in her words and action. First Man departs from the static progression of the eight years leading to Apollo 11's touchdown. The editing conveys the time exponentially. It speeds towards the finale and only pauses to let you savor mankind's accomplishment.<br/><br/>Be wary not to miss First Man's the theatrical run. The film's potent sound and visuals, pioneered by the same artists who championed Interstellar, are best enjoyed in theatre. A living room TV will not live up to the challenge."

","Cinematic wunderkind Damien Chazelle - best known for writing and directing ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" - is back with his true magnum opus, an overview of how the man first stepped on the Moon.<br/><br/>We follow the development of the American space program from 1962 through 1969.<br/><br/>The central character is astronaut Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) who has to balance his desire of perilous journey to unknown with being a family man.<br/><br/>""First Man"" is based on a real events - both story-wise and in technical sense. Everything has been recreated as realistically as possible, using the old technology and filming with handycams, so the audience can directly relate to astronauts' experiences on both intellectual and physiological level.<br/><br/>This means the viewer gets to live through the same chaotic, claustrophobic and disorientedness-inducing conditions that were the part and parcel of real job. And judging from the cinema seat, it feels amazingly authentic.<br/><br/>Scenes like these form a major part of the movie, which is quite long at its 141 minutes, turning it into more than average exhaustive viewing - probably even more so IMAX.<br/><br/>Near the end, by the time they really reach the Moon, I must admit I was already a bit worn down by all this visually shaky and messy directing style that Chazelle has chosen. I'd had my fill of the technical stuff and was longing for a chance to explore more the human side of the story.<br/><br/>As Armstrong turns out to have been a rather closely guarded individual with no desire to be a star or American hero, we don't get to learn much about him.<br/><br/>Which is positive in a way, because there's room for many other people who need to be on the screen (played by Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Corey Stoll, Pablo Schreiber, CiarÃ¡n Hinds, Patrick Fugit et al).<br/><br/>Gosling has always been good with characters of private, secluded nature, so there's not much new to tell about his another exemplary performance. He's charismatic as always.<br/><br/>The second most important performance belongs to Claire Foy as Armstrong's wife. Although her amount of screen time is moderate, she's the one that seems to impress the critics the most, leading already speculations about Oscars.<br/><br/>I agree that astronaut's fiery and strong-willed wife is a perfect Supporting Actress award material, and Foy is very good at what she does here. But personally I didn't find her part so essential as to get really excited about it.<br/><br/>It's not her fault. The story never concentrates that much on characters' inner lives anyway, so ""First Man"" is really not an actors' movie first.<br/><br/>Still, I would like to have seen more of Armstrong's colleague astronaut Buzz Aldrin (Corey Stoll) whose readiness to always speak out ""what everybody is thinking anyway"" adds some spicy bits of intrigue to space mission's everyday life.<br/><br/>This is the unused chance to add some depth even without delving into anybody's heads and personal lives, but sadly the authors have not deemed it necessary.<br/><br/>""First Man"" is a impressive movie but the technical side is more important than the human one here, which makes it difficult for me to love.<br/><br/>All this shaky physically tormenting chaos on the screen does get a bit monotonous before the end. So be warned, if you are going to see it mostly just to see Gosling, or because you loved ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land""."

From the opening sequence right thru to the end, what makes this film special is it's attention to the first person while the CGI supports that storyline without dwarfing it. Like Coopers Star is Born, the scenes don't feel rushed. If a character close up needs some extra hanging screen time it was allowed. At over two hours I am sure there was pressure to cut the length and the editing suite and director deserve cudos for standing their ground. Watching the movie you never feel like it's slow going or trite. Neil Armstrong is presented as a classic Fifties Dad and working man. the character carries with him a heroic legacy that Ryan Gosling simple steps past to give us an intensely human portrayal of the man, his struggles and the costs to his family as a whole. It feels like it comes from a better time, a celebration - albeit controversial one - of the American ideal. Even though the Russia vs United States race for space supremacy is included in the film, it's portrayed from the first astronauts perspective. The impact of a soviets first space walk or orbit and how that re-jockeyed the astronaut rotation to see Neil eventually touch the moons surface. I hope that's not a spoiler. There are hints of that pilot bravado echoed from The Right Stuff, these space pioneers and risk takers were all motivated to do the job at their very best. They knew they carried the hopes of a nation. They all kept the nasty internal stuff at bay and delivered to a public tired of bad newsreels a higher loftier goal that rallied a nation then beaten down by questionable wars and volatile politics. Politics were left out of this tightly well written and directed film. The small set details are authentic as were the awesome wardrobe choices. Red ball caps were popular at the time which unfortunately now carry some of the current political brand sovereignty, Norman Rockwell would approve but given today's editing tech it might have been nice to recolour that now iconic cap out of the film. The capsules were great, without looking into it further they look to be the real thing, like they were loaned out by the Smithsonian for filming. The only drawback is they look a little tired for their time, showing a wear or tatter that at the time would have been the opposite. Although primitive in nature, the technology would have been pristinely clean. Perhaps the decision to use more dirtied equipment was to exaggerate the simplicity of the mechanical contraptions that these brave men strapped themselves into. This would have been the pinnacle of our technology at the time and the films big creaking steel submarine passage like capsule doors and murky cabins feel out of place. It would have been super clean and although simple, would have felt new. Neil's homes party line double ring was a nice touch. When some of the summers blockbusters rely heavily on CGI and extreme fight sequences it's refreshing to have sat thru a couple great fall yarns that were knit with care."

","(Originally published on the Impacting Culture blog)<br/><br/>""We need to fail. We need to fail down here so we don't fail up there."" - Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) to Manned Spaceflight Center director Bob Gilruth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and Astronaut Office chief Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler)<br/><br/>Potential spoilers below<br/><br/>The bio found at the bottom of each of my reviews here on the Impacting Culture blog begins with how I ""once aspired to become an astronaut"". I became passionate about the Space Race in the '60s and early '70s ever since that one fateful week in my sixth grade science class, when my teacher screened director Ron Howard's 1995 space docudrama Apollo 13. While I have since deviated from that career path, my interest in the Space Race remains strong and has even spilled into my current occupation as a cinephile and film critic. Movies like the aforementioned Apollo 13, Interstellar, The Right Stuff, and Gravity perfectly fuse sports genre-esque stakes and catharsis with technological might and ample amounts of existential reflection.<br/><br/>As for dramatizing the historical race to Moon in particular, one should look no further than the 1998 HBO miniseries From the Earth to the Moon. It was this work of media and Tony Goldwyn's aloof yet easygoing portrayal of astronaut Neil Armstrong - specifically in parts of episode 1 and all of episode 6 - that dwelled in my mind as I approached First Man. Scripted by Spotlight writer Josh Singer and serving as director Damien Chazelle's follow-up to his beloved 2016 musical La La Land, First Man seeks to deliver an intimate portrait of a job-focused hero whose name has gone down in history. The result is less an Apollo 13 or Right Stuff and more of an Interstellar-deeply-felt, yet frigid to the point of leaving one at a conflicted loss, both for the intriguing character motivations and for the astonishing technical crafts on display.<br/><br/>First Man tracks the story of Neil Armstrong (Ryan Gosling, holding close to his work in Blade Runner 2049) from his days as a retired Navy pilot turned X-15 test pilot in late 1961 to the quarantine period following his (spoiler alert) successful command of the watershed Apollo 11 mission in mid-1969. Such is an overwhelming amount to cover in 141 minutes and First Man is mostly successful with regards to following Armstrong, the astronaut and father. Singer, Chazelle, and Gosling elect to portray Armstrong from the start in light of one key traumatic moment - the death of his two-year-old daughter Karen from a brain tumor in early 1962. ""I think it would be unreasonable to assume that it wouldn't have some effect,"" says Armstrong when the subject is brought up months later during his astronaut recruitment interview with Manned Spaceflight Center director Bob Gilruth (CiarÃ¡n Hinds) and Astronaut Office chief Deke Slayton (Kyle Chandler).<br/><br/>In all honesty, this story decision has left me feeling mixed. Perhaps that is due to how little I knew of this early tragedy in Armstrong's time as a husband and father. This tragedy, furthermore, played no factor in Tony Goldwyn's turn in From the Earth to the Moon, so I began asking myself whether either of these works handled this element appropriately. In First Man's case, Karen's sickness and eventual death gets an all-too-brisk treatment that, arguably to a contrived degree, hangs over not just Neil's next eight years, but those of his dutiful and resilient wife Janet (Claire Foy).<br/><br/>Yes, the loss of such a young child and of any child bears a heavy weight on every parent. Cinematic works from Don't Look Now, In America, Rabbit Hole, and even the aforementioned Gravity and Interstellar testify to that struggle. First Man argues that Karen's death pushed Neil Armstrong to close himself off to everyone and everything except the mission at hand. Accordingly, the celestial wonder, assisted by Paul Lambert's crisp visual effects and Justin Hurwitz's delicate and heart-pumping score, gets isolated to just the breathtaking Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 sequences. (Both match, if not slightly surpass due to the score and updated visual effects, their dramatizations in From the Earth to the Moon.)<br/><br/>The astronaut camaraderie, and thus the overall human element, gets dampened as well. Promoting the balance between a sturdy family life and an astronaut career has good intentions. Yet all I have concluded from learning about this era is that this job turned most of its then-mostly men into terrible fathers, just as much - if not more - as any military service. Some die (Patrick Fugit as Elliot See and Jason Clarke as Ed White, for example), while the majority of others end up becoming distant to their loved ones to the point of divorce. (Unmentioned by the film, Neil and Janet's marriage would sadly end in divorce in 1994.) First Man plays up the psychological weight of Karen's death to a point beyond a grounding recommendation, despite Armstrong's cool attitude during training and missions that is largely absent in this biographical drama. Equally flight ground-worthy is Corey Stoll's take on Apollo 11 Lunar Module Pilot Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin as an irritating know-it-all. Such an attitude was only hinted at and far overshadowed by the aspiration to become the ""first man"" in Bryan Cranston's more reasonable portrayal in From the Earth to the Moon. Perhaps these, along with the paltry time spent with Apollo 11 Command Module Pilot Mike Collins (Lukas Haas), only emphasize for some the ease of working with the mission-focused Neil Armstrong.<br/><br/>First Man is not as relentless and lasting as Whiplash or La La Land. As expected for his debut of directing another writer's screenplay, Chazelle's touch gives off that slight detachment of a director-for-hire. Still, First Man is far from the misfire Chazelle ought to watch out for at this stage in his career. Chazelle, Singer, Gosling, and co., much like Neil Armstrong, intend on continuing the success of their careers. First Man is merely one of the many small steps they have taken and will continue to take in their lifelong and individual endeavors.<br/><br/>(Parental Note: First Man has been rated PG-13 by the MPAA ""for some thematic content involving peril, and brief strong language"". It has also been rated 12A by the BBFC for ""infrequent strong language"" and ""moderate threat"", and rated A-III (Adults) by the Catholic News Service for containing ""brief scatological material, a few profanities and milder oaths, as well as a single rough and a handful of crude terms."")<br/><br/>R.N.B."

But this movie proves that these stories can still be compelling. And maybe even more personal than ever before. This isn't just another space film. It is the story of Neil Armstrong specifically - his drive, his losses, his relationships. There may have been space movies that are more majestic or thrilling, but the stakes have never felt this high. From the very first moment, you see everything through that personal lens: the shaky fear, the quiet desperation, the nervous anticipation. Chazelle knows how to tell a story. This plot may be super familiar, but I have never hung on each moment like I did this time. I couldn't help but care, even though I knew exactly what was coming next.

"gortx","Null","0","1","26 October 2018"," Fine, inward looking NASA epic about Armstrong & Moon Landing
","FIRST MAN - I am a child of the space race who grew up watching the Jetsons, drinking Tang (because the astronauts did!) and having posters of the Astronauts (including Neil A. Armstrong) on my walls. I give FIRST MAN a titan sized thumbs up for authenticity and accuracy (a few quibbles).<br/><br/>There is no question that the NASA moon program of the 60s and early 70s was one of the greatest explorations of human history, crowned with the successful landing of Apollo 11 nearly 50 years ago. As the Lunar Module pilot and, of course, the first man to walk on the moon, Armstrong has always been at the center of attention. But, as FIRST MAN ably displays, that is NOT where Armstrong wanted that focus to be. He was mission driven and not one to bask in the glory. Anything but. (One of the reasons Armstrong has long been such a hero is that he never cashed in on his fame)<br/><br/>Armstrong's insular ways presented Screenwriter Josh Singer (SPOTLIGHT) and Director Damien Chazelle (LA LA LAND) with a daunting task: How to capture one of mankind's greatest feats through the lens of such a quiet man? To their credit, the filmmakers approached the challenge head on. Rather than add all kinds of external details (no matter how accurately) and colorful side characters, the film focuses like a laser on Armstrong (Ryan Gosling) and his wife (a strong Claire Foy). There are other characters, of course, but, they never take away from Armstrong and his family. Indeed, the taciturn Armstrong is portrayed as so 'ordinary' that he could just as well have remained a behind-the-scenes engineer if it weren't for his extraordinary pilot skills.<br/><br/>Gosling is often a wiry actor, but, he jettisons all that for his intense, yet internalized, performance here. No matter how vast the scale of Armstrong's two missions in space, the film never really wavers from being from the Armstrongs' point of view.* Even while on the moon, there are times you forget Buzz Aldrin is there on the lunar surface with him**. Armstrong's skills, attitude and level-headedness are what made him an ideal candidate to be a commander of an Apollo mission within NASA (although it must be noted that when Armstrong was tapped for Apollo 11, there wasn't a guarantee it would be the FIRST moon-landing flight - the film fudges that).<br/><br/>The technical aspects here are well handled including the special effects and Linus Sandgren's cinematography (a combination of 16mm, 35mm & 65mm film), and a joy to see on as big a screen as possible (although the jiggly hand-held nature of the camera operation might be cause to sit a bit further back). The supporting cast are fine, even if they are given little room for well-rounded performances. The one quibble is Justin Hurwitz' score. It zings and soars at times, in almost complete opposition to the somber tone of the rest of the film, which points out one of the conundrum's of FIRST MAN: While it's laudable that the movie is so intimately rendered, there are times it borders on the lugubrious. Yes, by all accounts, Armstrong was an intensely quiet man, but, in his public interviews his pride in his accomplishments were palpable, and there were twinkles in his eyes. He even smiled. Nobody but the fools who demanded more literal 'flag-waving' (usually not having seen the film), should have expected huge displays of emotion from Armstrong, but, a little more personality wouldn't have hurt. While the Just The Facts Mam screenplay is well executed, a few more colorful insights and details would also have fleshed it out***<br/><br/>FIRST MAN is a solid entry into the space filmography. It doesn't have the balls out zing of THE RIGHT STUFF, nor the emotional pull of an APOLLO 13, but, it works nicely as an intimate tale all its own. On that score, I believe Neil Armstrong would be proud to be the center of attention - if only for a couple of hours on screen.<br/><br/>*Making the brief anti-Apollo program montage (featuring Gil Scott Heron's ""Whitey on the moon' song) stick out even more. It's not that such a protest isn't worth discussing, but, that it literally comes from nowhere in the context of the rest of the 141 minutes<br/><br/>** Aldrin is well known for his cantankerous behavior, but, even so, is portrayed a bit too heavy-handily here. The denouement of Armstrong's walk is one of the film's few exaggerations. It almost certainly didn't occur that way.<br/><br/>*** The Agena spacecraft Armstrong docked with on Gemini 8 was nicknamed 'The Angry Alligator' by one of the astronauts, for example. The Zero G Force training unit was dubbed 'The Vomit Comet'. Etc."

","I was born two years before the Apollo 11 mission and was very influenced by the achievements of everyone involved in the race to the moon. Neil Armstrong was my childhood hero.<br/><br/>I have read an awful lot on both the American and Russian Space missions of the era, both factual accounts and novels that draw from that exciting period of human exploration; including the book First Man. The achievements of both sides were fantastic. I would say the most fascinating period of technological advancement in the history of man.<br/><br/>So onto the film. How can any account of this period be so dull and poorly presented?<br/><br/>Neil Armstrong was a very understated man, he didn't have the same character as some of the others involved, Ryan Gosling's performance is probably very close to the actual man and I applaud that in the film. I understand that the accounts of the space flights were supposed to be shot from Neil's point of view, but for anyone not familiar with the real story behind the film they could be excused for thinking that the Apollo missions were really laborious events. The launch scenes portrayed the event in a way to lead the viewer to believe that the astronauts were simply shaken as hard as possible in capsules laden with instrumentation that they could not refer to because they were just being shaken. I wasn't there to experience it and have never believed that reality was serene as portrayed in Apollo 13, but really?<br/><br/>To me this was simply a self indulgent film that really adds very little to the historical account. Which is so extremely sad, given the accomplishments of the moon shot programme and all the people involved. Although I do appreciate that this film was strictly about Neil Armstrong and so the focus was quite rightly on him.<br/><br/>I appreciate that I was probably looking for something more from this film than it was intended to offer, but my belief is that a young person watching it would take away none of the excitement, achievement and pure wonder that the Apollo programme actually was.<br/><br/>For me Neil Armstrong will always be a hero, I just wish that I hadn't seen this film.<br/><br/>To sum up the film in my eyes: Quiet understated family man sadly loses a child, seeks new challenges, is shaken very seriously in several space rockets, excels in a quiet way, goes to the moon as mission commander and subsequently is the first man to step on the moon. The end."
"alvesmarceloalves-73751","8","0","1","25 October 2018"," The insane travel to the moon
","Many films have already been made about the conquest of space. But I do not think that very few can portray with such acuity this insane challenge towards the unknown as Damien Chazelle in ""The First Man.""<br/><br/>The new director's work, best known for the sensational ""Whiplash"" (2014), which won the Oscar for best director for ""La La Land"" (2016), ""The First Man"" is a biopic. He was supposed to tell the story of Neil Armstrong (lived by a contained Ryan Gosling, almost cornered by the challenge of going to the Moon), but that is the background of an even bigger story that is the challenge of getting where no man has ever been until then.<br/><br/>Chazelle brought an impressive realism to the space race experience. It took to the screen the annoyance that is to fly a rocket. The uncertainty of those machines in full sixties, little more than six decades after man learned to fly. It took the fear, made sure to rub in our faces how insane and challenging it was until then to be an astronaut. And maybe it's even today.<br/><br/>And he exposes this in the nauseating scenes of the machines shaking horrors. In the isolation and solitude of being in orbit. In the tension and uncertainty of the revolution. On the difficulty of setting such difficult calculations for a normal human to understand. An error is nothing short of fatal. Everything to arrive at that moment when there is a ""small step for a man, but a great leap for humanity"".<br/><br/>In his movie, the Moon is always on the prowl. There, from above, being observed, studied, admired, contemplated. And challenging those modern adventurers. With each failure it seems more distant. With every little triumph, it comes closer. Some frames also highlight the double face of Earth's natural satellite. The dark and light side on the face of a Neil Armstrong worried about the future, on the face of his son when he asks if he can not return. The Moon may have been (and perhaps continues to be) as big a challenge as that of the caravels heading into the unknown in the 15th and 16th centuries.<br/><br/>To emphasize all this, Chazelle reduces the soundtrack to the minimum possible. If ""Whiplash"" was a film all punctuated by the track, and ""La La Land"" was a musical of remarkable songs, ""The First Man"" exalts the solitary silence of the journey beyond the Earth punctuated only by epic songs composed by Justin Hurwitz - the same as ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" - to dramatize the most remarkable moments. Especially the departure of Apollo 11 from Houston and landing on the Moon.<br/><br/>""The First Man"" is a beautiful film. It is not very verbal and sometimes has erratic dialogues. Something very different from the previous works of screenwriter Josh Singer, Oscar winner for ""Spotligh"" (2015) and who also wrote ""The Post"" (2017). The final scene of Neil Armstrong reuniting his wife (the great Claire Foy, Queen Elizabeth in the first two seasons of ""The Crown"") is of a singular beauty. Nothing is said in those final minutes. It is as if the silence of space and the uncertainties remain until the return to Earth. But at the same time much is said in that exchange of looks and small gestures through the glass. Scenes like this are worth the film too."

","Biopic of Neil Armstrong from the early Gemini projects to the historic space flight in 1969.<br/><br/>The story focusses pretty much exclusively on Armstrong and his wife. He, who never recovered from the death of his only daughter is insular and stubborn and determined, despite the risks to get into space. His wife in turn has to live with his moods and the very real prospect of him not returning. Both Gosling and Foy and very good and should get nods at awards time if there is any justice. The real thrill of the movie though is through the space sequences, which demonstrate perhaps for the first time how terrifying and uncertain these mission were. Oddly enough this applies to earlier tests etc in the film more so than the final Apollo 11 mission, but given the outcome is so well known this is not surprising and filmed accordingly."

"brianracing","10","0","1","24 October 2018"," Love, love, loved this movie!
","I have never left a review on IMDB before or any other website for that matter in relation to a movie I have seen, but felt compelled to do so here especially in view of the amount of negative reviews I have read.
From the moment the movie started I was captivated. I'm not going to talk about cinematography or editing or anything else like that, I'm just going to speak about the way it made me feel.
Dark, moody, gloomy? Yes it had these overtones and why shouldn't it? Can you imagine being this guy with the space program in its infancy, watching rocket after rocket being tested for manned spaceflight keel over, collapse, spin and explode again and again, whilst you watch from the sidelines with a multitude of emotions running through your veins, but needing to keep it together because if you can't then you have no business being an astronaut?
The explosion after a fire that kills astronauts Virgil ""Gus"" Grissom and Ed White in their command module during preflight testing no less, would be enough to make most people think again.
This movie allows you to see this whole process through the eyes of the man that might just be the most famous astronaut that ever lived, the first man on the moon. The seats on my local bus look better than the seat he sat in to travel to another body in our solar system, this was danger like you wouldn't believe and this movie captures the reality of that beautifully. There are truly somber moments during the movie where real people have to consider possible outcomes and ponder the consequences of those possible outcomes.
For those that claim the movie was unpatriotic, think again, acts of patriotism are witnessed again and again through the bravery and sacrifice that Armstrong and others like him made for the NASA program. They put it all on the line and then some, do we really need someone to stick a flag in some dirt, is that what the definition of patriotism is?
If your purely looking for an action movie this isn't a movie for you, but if you really want to get close to feeling how he must have felt and actually learn something then its a must!<br/><br/>Oh and the soundtrack is amazing!"

","I hardly make any comments about movies. But I could not hold myself (and hold my tears in some moments).<br/><br/>I have, at least, some points to stress:<br/><br/>1) The silence and the sound - It is a good moment to reflect on the lyrics of the Simon/Garfunkel song: ""The sound of silence"". Chazelle knows how to work with the silence. The silence echos inside of you, alternately, with huge impacting sounds.<br/><br/>2) First minutes - First scenes have no (or few) dialogs. However, you are already immersed in the film.<br/><br/>3) The Director - Damien Chazelle showed, once more, that it doesn't matter the movie genre...HeÂ´ll be there doing his best...And we know what ""his best"" means. Shots and scenes being capable of embracing the audience during the whole film. He also knows what Art means. Art comes from the capacity of finding the simplicity.<br/><br/>4) CoudnÂ´t stand up - It is the kind of film that it is not easy to leave the room (for any reason). Despite of the fact of having a slow pace, it is a smooth pace, but involving the audience; it seems you are part of the story.<br/><br/>5) Not a heroic movie - Normally, I am not a fan of over-the-top/patriotic movies. But it is not. As far as I can remember, there is, at least, 1 scene I would avoid: French woman saying that she knew the America would succeed.<br/><br/>6) The shots - several shots deserve comments. The empty bed without the sheets, the pillow (and, mainly, the child), the moon surface appearing for the first time, the child bracelet falling into the moon darkness (reminding the diamond collar on Titanic, although with another message) and so on.<br/><br/>7) The protagonist - I am not a big fan of Ryan Gosling, but I cannot deny he fits perfectly in this role. He is not a hero (neither was Armstrong in real life), nor empathetic. More important: it seems he does not want to be. When he is asked about the mission, he just says, repeatedly: I am pleased...<br/><br/>8) The Final scene - It, again, fitted smoothly...After all, the movie is not about the US, neither the moon, but the human being. The couple hands trying to touch each other with a window between them. It means a lot.<br/><br/>9) Interesting - He was chosen to command the Apollo 11 while inside a restroom in a straightforward and sharp dialog.<br/><br/>10) The Score - the bottom line: Surely that is too crazy for words. The score also fitted perfectly in each scene, following (synchronized) the sadness, the fear, the emotional coldness, the happiness, the silence, the pace...in other words, the movie waves....<br/><br/>11) Finally - it is a Masterpiece!<br/><br/>PS.: I was in an IMAX Theatre. It DOES make a difference in this movie. Size DOES matter.<br/><br/>PS. 2: In my opinion, 7.7 (the current IMDB user grade) does not represent what the movie deserves. Well, people are different. There is no right or wrong..."
"scb_coldsteel","8","0","1","24 October 2018"," A well acted film with a unique perspective
","So I saw The First Man at the theater. I had mixed feelings initially about seeing this movie. I love Ryan Gosling, but I've been very torn with the director Damien Chazelle. Overall the movie was about what I expected. A well acted film with an interesting story, but with a few glaring issues that made it ultimately forgettable.<br/><br/>The story of course covers the Apollo landing and Neil Armstrongs first steps on the moon. Instead of focusing on the actual moon landing though the movie shows the slow build up to the launch and human tole that was lost. The film also goes deeply into the emotional conflicts felt by Neil Armstrong and his family.<br/><br/>The best aspect of the film was easily the film's presentation of the many failures and losses that led to the Apollo landing. You really got a feel for just how difficult it was for the early astronauts and their families. This is not the kind of film that defies these men, but really paints them as human beings pushed to the limit to achieve their goals.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed seeing the backstory of Neil Armstrong that really paints him as a tragic hero. The movie did a good job capturing the emotional trauma he had to endure, but also showed just how his trauma impacted his relationship with his family.<br/><br/>Acting wise the movie was outstanding. Ryan Gosling perfectly embodied the stoic and withdrawn Neil Armstrong. He really brought the character to life and made him a relatable figure. The film is also filled with a wide supporting cast of actors who all do a good job with the material.<br/><br/>Now as far as the criticism of the film I was very underwhelmed with the actual scenes involving space. I kept comparing the movie to Apollo 13 and felt it really could not hold a candle to that movie. The film was also overly long and could have benefited from cutting out a few unnecessary subplots. While the director seemed to intentionally limit the scope and grandeur of the movie, it really took away from the overall impact of the movie. I was almost bored with the anticlimactic voyage to the moon. At times it seemed the film also wanted to throw elements of social commentary into the story, but this really only slowed down the plots advance.<br/><br/>The First Man was far from a bad movie. It was exceptionally well acted and told a unique perspective on a iconic part of American history. Unfortunately the movie had some pacing issues and a few too many subplots. I can't help but think in the hands of a more experienced director this could have been one of the best films of the year. A 8 out of 10."

","We were all anxious to see Damien Chazelle's new feature, which now runs from his comfort zone and makes a film with no relation to music. First we can say that ""The First Man"" is a record film all dramatized and with some poetic liberties, Damien did not write the gross script of the film, only made slight changes, and this is noticeable, since its script is not playful and extremely doable with the real events, which ends up leaving the film often monotonous, but it is important to remember that it is not an adventure or a fiction, the story though incredible, is boring in between, but even with these adversities the film has a lot of quality. Damien tells the story of Neil Armstrong, the first man to step on the moon, a story that has been told before in the cinema, but never as pure as now, in the free spaces, Damien ends up trying to humanize the film and create dramas, precisely , to be a movie, in the purest act of the word, this even works in some points, in others not, because they are 2 main nuclei of drama, Neil with his fear and losses and Neil with his family, the second nucleus does not work. The film tries to discuss some morals, about loss and contemplation, but everything is thrown and suffocated by the prime objective of the movie that is to tell about the going of the man to the moon. Ryan Gosling can not express anything when his dramatic side is required and ends up not helping Damien to explore another dramatic strand in the film, as Claire Foy, who also has a dramatic core in the film, ultimately catches up with the viewer, pillar of support of the film, more for its performance than for the script. Technically, Damien gives a show apart, mainly in the use of the cameras, aspect that had already been highly praised in his previous works, the scenes inside the ships are stifling, claustrophobic, beautiful, tense and full of adrenaline, mainly by the use of his the film is always directed at shoulder height, with many mid-plane scenes, gray photography, the artistic direction of the film is really great, which ends up often compensating for the slow pace of the movie that uncomfortable, slow pace that is due to the script and assemblies that confuse and misconceive their acts to the viewer. Another relevant point is the sound of the film, great mixing and editing of sweeping sound, strong competitors to the oscar, since we speak of sound, the film trail has the face of Damien, extremely playful and little epic, works well with the attempt to humanization of the film, however, could have a hint of the epic factor, alias, we are exploring another planet -Satellite in this case. ""The First Man"" is a great movie, which ends up having low points in the performance and at its own pace, but it is a great reconstruction of Apollo 11, an incredible story with its most important points well recorded and a very high level technique."
"Voyage2-2","7","0","1","23 October 2018"," Understated with some elements missing from the recipe
","This movie was very polarizing, judging from the reviews, both here and on the outside. The reasons are both simple and complicated. Criticism of the movie has become well known. And, it is true, there is no actual scene of planting of the American flag on the lunar surface. The overall tone of the movie, to be fair, is a very understated feel of this American achievement. For the political Left, very, very little social change was displayed in the movie, of the turbulent 60's, with only one brief TV scene of the escalating Vietnam War. But, it could be argued, none of these things were the focus. Rather, our race to the moon and the personal story of Neil Armstrong. Accepting that, these criticisms were well, well overdone. It was a good movie, but fell short of great.<br/><br/>It lacks the emotional and patriotic surge of the failed mission of Apollo 13 (1995), the uplifting cheering moments and humor of The Martian (2015). The cinematography bothered many, it was OK for me. The director's style was a put off to others, it has a feel like Whiplash (2014), in a strange way to me. But, one area I really fault the film was a poor script. Scriptwriter Josh Singer was praised for his work in 'The Post' (Ok by me) and 'Spotlight' (fantastic in my view), so he was capable enough. But, if this was to quietly celebrate the engineers rather than male bravado, where were the science discussions, dialogue and characters ? Sure, vehicles which blew up or failed were reasons it took us a decade to get up there, but give me some of the why. This would have also been a good time to develop characters with the principal players and for some humor. Even in earnest movies, this lacked almost all sense of anything but a very occasional chuckle.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling under acted and understated Armstrong to the extent it might be seen as the opposite reciprocal to say, what some critics said of Al Pacino's 'over acting' intensity of the 70's and 80's. It fell flat and uncomfortable for some. Corey Stoll's Buzz Aldrin was flippant and unlikable, how true to form it was, I don't know. Claire Foy's Janet Armstrong took a progressively uptight and disagreeable tone. In the last third of the movie pushed it to a bit anti-climatic. Perhaps a wink to modern feminist bravado.<br/><br/>The movie lacks good scoring, both original and period music (outside a radical 60's song, 'Whity going to the moon'). No 'interludes' to walk you through events/ideas and time. While this is a certain style of movie making, the disadvantage is you don't get the economy of storytelling quickly and the movie tends to drag.<br/><br/>It's sad, but the unfounded harsh criticism this movie brought will give those who've never seen it, an impression it is tainted with more anti-American flavor, which Hollywood has cranked out in the previous decade. It is not. It's also not escapist entertainment, which is why it drew the over 40 crowd...not the target of most movie makers and theaters. However, it may not bring the praise from such generations on the high end, who remember the events first hand. This was more than just going out to bring home the milk, 'matter of fact,' which is what younger generations might be left thinking.<br/><br/>It is all together fitting that Neil Armstrong belonged to the so-called 'Silent Generation' (circa 1925-early 1940's). NASA was founded by GI Generation folk (1900-1925), heros of WWII becoming civil left brain leaning problem solving engineers. It was Armstrong and his peers who humanized the Moon Landing ('...giant leap for Mankind'). Much could be said about the social changes back on Earth. Not so much 1960's college students, but Silent Generational leaders such at Dr. King (together with Armstrong, considered great heros of their generation)."
"PyroSikTh","9","0","1","23 October 2018"," An Experience both Beautiful and Intense
","The movie opens with a dodgy flight test in an X-15. Armstrong is just a civilian pilot/engineer with a young family at home, and we're immediately thrust into a tight, claustrophobic cockpit with him as he breaches the atmosphere and struggles coming back down. It's simply impossible to describe with words how intense this opening scene is. It's largely devoid of musical soundtrack, instead filled with the rattling and creaking of the aircraft, and all camera angles are strictly from the viewpoint of the cockpit, and the limited visibility gained from within. The controls don't work, and his bouncing off the atmosphere has set him for an inescapable trajectory away from Earth. Strictly speaking there should be no tension here, as we know Armstrong comes out the other end just fine, and yet Chazelle manages to paint a scene so frightening and claustrophobic that the tension plays itself.<br/><br/>After this visceral opening we get the fundamental emotional backbone to the whole film, introducing us to Armstrong's adorable yet terminally ill daughter. We've only seen this guy struggle in a high-atmosphere aircraft and come back to a family he obviously loves so much, and yet already you find yourself invested in this guy and his family tragedy. Nobody told me this was going to be a weepy movie! I didn't bring tissues! The death of Armstrong's daughter weighs heavily on him the entire movie. He withdraws emotionally, turning cold and distant, and every funeral after every failed mission reminds him of his daughter, and at the end we get the most beautiful payoff on the surface of the moon itself.<br/><br/>Compounding this tragedy is the permeating threat of death and failure. The movie highlights a number of failed missions that resulted in Armstrong's friends dying around him, including the Apollo 1 mission. Every failure is not only reinforced as a necessity in Armstrong's dialogue, but also builds up how insanely dangerous this ambition truly was. Any mission could fail for any reason, and before you know it kids have lost their fathers, wives have lost their husbands, and the toll this takes on the families - and Armstrong himself - builds with each failure as well. Every mission enjoys the fruits of increased threat thanks to everything that came before.<br/><br/>One of these failures is one of Armstrong's himself; the Gemini VIII mission, which was a test run for docking with the mothership after the landing. As I mentioned with the opening sequence, everyone knows that Armstrong makes it out alive, and yet the sequence is absolutely not lacking in tension. Again this is thanks to the claustrophobic nature of the filming, which puts the whole perspective on Armstrong. The endless, uncontrollable spinning, the dizziness and lack of coordination, the fighting off unconsciousness set by the increasing G-force, and just not knowing, in that moment, what's caused the problem and how to solve it, with only mere seconds to sort it all out before it's too late. It was really intense!<br/><br/>The actual moon landing itself is done really well as well. You might think at this point in time that the novelty of standing on the moon has faded in the public imagination, yet First Man puts you firmly back into the mindset of how monumental this event was for the history of mankind. Once the Apollo reaches the moons orbit, the close-up shots of it from the peaky little windows are tantalising, and the landing itself is drawn out with every little detail and off-the-cuff problem solving, with a ticking clock in the fuel gauge adding even more tension to another scene that strictly shouldn't have any. But it doesn't stop with the landing. Armstrong starts to climb down the ladder and stops on the landers feet, just inches away from a whole new world. It really starts to sink in that this is completely uncharted territory. No-one has ever been anywhere like this. It's completely alien. That first step we all wait for is imminent and the ramifications of it are so unimaginably huge. Chazelle manages to craft the scene so expertly that it makes the act of exploration and discovery so much more meaningful than any sci-fi film could hope to achieve.<br/><br/>On a more technical basis, the whole movie is made a grand success by it's soundtrack and sound design. The rattling and shaking of the pods is enough to set anxiety in anyone, and the rare cutaways to the external spacecraft are bathed in absolute silence, befitting the vacuum of space. The soundtrack is simply perfect as well, utilising alien and spacey sounds and synths (including Armstrong's personal favourite, the Theremin) to create music so atmospheric and ethereal, yet so unreal and pioneering. It builds up the emotional ramifications of everything; the significance for both mankind and Armstrong personally. And yet it also knows precisely when to cut out entirely and let the action speak for itself.<br/><br/>Likewise the film is a feast visually. The movie is done almost purely from Armstrong's perspective, and every camera shot is used to reinforce this. I mentioned it above, but I'll mention it again; the viewpoints of the missions are primarily from inside the cockpits. There's almost no external footage of the spacecraft, and the few we get are either so close that we still feel like we're put in the thick of the action, or so monumental and beautiful, like the Apollo 11 launch as it reaches the clouds, and the Earth it's leaving behind.<br/><br/>First Man was a truly incredible experience. This is not a generic movie about the moon landing. This is a look at the life of Neil Armstrong in the years building up to it It's about his sacrifices and triumphs, his struggles both intellectually and emotionally, that all culminates in that iconic moment. Once the credits rolled my cinema screening was left in a stunned silence. No-one moved from their seats for a good couple of minutes. The sheer power and intensity of this movie was just so much to take in. Absolutely beautiful from the get-go, I give it a fantastic 9/10."
"nevil-nathani1991","6","0","1","23 October 2018"," OK movie

"gerald-koh99","9","0","1","23 October 2018"," Sombre but refreshing look at an American hero
","This is a movie which is not presented as a fun, space adventure, but as a solemn and harrowing look at Neil Armstrong personally during his period as an astronaut for NASA throughout the 1960s. Slow-paced and serious in tone, this style isn't for everyone, which is understandable, but I found this to be a masterfully crafted film which goes beyond a standard biopic and utilising an interesting angle to examine its main protagonist. The film really does go slow, sometimes to a fault as some scenes drag on a bit too much, but not as to make the entire film boring or monotonous. And we get a view of Neil Armstrong as a very stoic, often emotionless man. You may feel that this character is a bit personally detached from the audience, but it actually creates a real look at Armstrong's personality. And this is why much of this film is dedicated to displaying his family life, as how his personality and duties as an astronaut (especially by the time the Apollo 11 mission comes round the corner) influence the relationship with his family. The dynamic between Neil and his wife Jane is arguably the best element of this film's narrative, as her qualms resulting from Neil's busyness reveals so much about the one theme Chazelle loves to focus on in his films: the troubling side-effects of single-mindedly pursuing an ambition. The performances by Ryan Gosling and especially Claire Foy are fantastic: some of my favourite scenes were when Foy's character took centre stage. And the camerawork, while admittedly making me feel a bit dizzy during the spaceship sequences, adds a sense of authenticity to the whole film. And the space sequences are gorgeous too! This movie is worth the try at least and quite unique for its genre."
"smokedsalmoned-28058","9","0","1","23 October 2018"," Great movie about an unusual man
","Some folks though the director spent too much time on Ryans face, that Ryan was stiff, but if they don't know Armstrong through documentaries or counterparts, he was a brilliant but odd man who did not seek the limelight who was focused and driven. Ryan does spot on Armstrong in this and should be considered for an oscar.
As for the movie it was focused on the FIRST MAN and what he had to overcome personally as well as fate wise to become the guy in that capsule to land on the moon and it is an emotional ride despite his coolness.
As to the flag controversy - you do see it on the moon next to the lander and patches on the uniforms, you just dont see them planting the flag.
One of the best performances of the year and a stirring view of the risks, achievement (for US and mankind)."
"robertslw","9","0","1","23 October 2018"," ""First Man"" is an out of this world experience
","Damien Chazelle's ""First Man"" opens on a dark, cramped cockpit shaking viciously while piloted by Ryan Gosling's Neil Armstrong. His eyes are filled with fear and panic until the cockpit is suddenly illuminated by the sunlight reflecting off the Earth's horizon in the upper echelons of the atmosphere. Relief, followed by astonishment, washes over his face as he hovers in the vast beauty of space. He then begins to plummet and the fear returns.<br/><br/>All of this terror, beauty and astonishment carries throughout the rest of the film. These feelings soon lead to an unforgettable, visceral and dazzling experience.<br/><br/>The eight years of trials and tribulations Armstrong had to endure before the Apollo 11 mission that made him an American hero is the fulcrum of ""First Man."" While this characterizes the basic synopsis, there is so much more to the film regarding the man inside the spacesuit.<br/><br/>Armstrong's complexity is mesmerizing. All the insecurities, fears and determination he experienced is felt through Gosling's stoic performance. His subtle changes of demeanor throughout the film with every loss he experiences add a sense of weight and suspense to an outcome everyone is aware of.<br/><br/>Gosling's moments of vulnerability are incredibly believable as well. His quivering lip and fight to hold back tears in moments of distress help show why Armstrong is considered a hero today - he was just a man who had to overcome many obstacles.<br/><br/>He did not overcome these obstacles alone, however. His wife, Janet Armstrong, is masterfully portrayed by Claire Foy. She brings a fiery intensity which encapsulates Janet's concerns for their family while also trying to support all his endeavors to the best of her ability. Scenes of her nervously sitting hunched over the radio during the Gemini 8 and Apollo 11 missions while also tending to the children's needs gives the audience an authentic look at how important she truly was to her family.<br/><br/>While all these performances help depict the scale of this arduous journey, the directorial work by the Academy Award-winning Chazelle puts you directly in Armstrong's shoes. When Gosling approaches the Gemini 8 shuttle, the corridor shakes and hanging lights sway, ramping up the intensity and puting the viewer in his perspective, experiencing his fear.<br/><br/>Chazelle's constant implementation of close-up shots also allows the audience to notice every expression the actors bring, creating a deeper connection to this true story.<br/><br/>A cornerstone of this film, of course, is the interstellar aspects - specifically outer space and the moon. Created using using computer-generated imagery, these aspects made for some breathtaking moments. The vast empty space surrounding the shuttle in certain scenes brings a strange beauty to the serene void confirming why Armstrong and many others were allured by the mission. The recreation of the moon is incredibly realistic as well, making the scenes on the lunar surface feel tangible.<br/><br/>All of these emotionally impactful scenes are supported by a beautiful score that at times seemed whimsical, and at others suspenseful. This makes the danger of the journey feel incredibly real while making the payoffs feel magical.<br/><br/>""First Man"" combines a variety of filmmaking aspects to create one of the greatest depictions of Armstrong and his mindset during his times at NASA while also creating an unforgettable experience that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen possible."

","I am the type of guy who likes movies of this kind to show man's great accomplishments in the past in as real and life like a setting as can be accomplished. ""First Man"" is up there with the best i have seen. The special effects are outstanding from the start. The opening scene when he breached the earths atmosphere is jaw dropping, the rest of the movie just kept it coming. I loved the moon scene when he cast his daughters bracelet into the canyon. I learned so much from the movie and about the journey and the obstacles Nasa had to overcome. Also, I felt a real understanding of what it was like to be in Neal Armstrong's shoes. I was moved by the quiet and reserved kind of character he was with a steely resolve to fulfil his destiny. Without doubt, the success of the Apollo missions relied heavily on these test pilots' character, their ingenuity and their strength of resolve. This was what it was like to be part of the greatest show on earth. How things really were on a razor edge all the time and how truly remarkable a feat this was. Amazing the way, we have many reviews here around the 1 mark, It shows me how polarised people have become when a great work like this can have so many low scores. Its a bit like giving ""War and Piece"" a 1 score just because you prefer Sci-fi books."

Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - First Man. This Biopic, which explores the life and the mind of one of history's most famous explorers, namely Neil Armstrong, first man to set foot on the moon, is one of the most intrepid and valiant films I have seen for some time. I have, for many years, had a fascination with space and the race to do everything first and have eagerly devoured any new film which covers the events of those exciting, nerve wracking, explorative times. Hollywood in true fashion either sensationalises, or dumbs down the actual events and although that doesn't necessarily make for a bad film, I'm always left with a feeling of unreality. First Man outshines all of those. This film delves into the depths of the men who had the courage and insanity to make those first forays into space, especially after setbacks which saw their fellow astronauts lose their lives, and the general public beginning to question whether their tax dollar might be better spent on something else. It seems only the determination to beat the Russians to the moon kept the space program alive, and to be honest I'm glad it did. This film was unusual in its portrayal of events, we were given gritty, shaky footage from inside the capsule, none of the grand scenes of the surrounding countryside with the camera swooping into a shot of a pristine rocket sitting on a launch pad. We were shown close ups of astronauts scared for their lives, sweat dripping down their faces, incapable of speaking and the relief they must have felt when each part of the mission succeeded. We also got a glimpse of the pressure felt by the families, and especially the children who even at their young ages must have feared for the return of their fathers. I loved this film and although there were many parts where there was no dialogue, no sound and sometimes no picture as we travelled through the depths of space, it spoke volumes to the audience. I hope we get more of this style of film in the future."
"garyprosser1","8","0","1","22 October 2018"," An extraordinary, ordinary man.
","Trotted off to the pictures tonight to see this, the new biopic of Neil Armstrong, and came away very impressed.<br/><br/>First Man documents Neil's life and career, starting with his role as a test pilot in 1961 and culminating on July 20th 1969 when he and Buzz Aldrin became the first and second men to take that small step (and giant leap) onto the Moon.<br/><br/>Potential spoilers ahead (but you surely know the story):<br/><br/>It's a story we all know so well but while First Man spares no expense or detail in documenting the missions undertaken by Armstrong and his fellow astronauts, its primary goal is to show the character of Armstrong the human being, the everyday pressures felt by him, his wife and his family and the place of Space exploration in a society that was undergoing seismic changes.<br/><br/>Armstrong was, by all accounts, a very straight-laced, emotionally muted and methodical person. It is these characteristics that got him to where he did and Ryan Gosling, an actor who often plays characters that live within themselves (Drive springs to mind), is perfect here. Opposite him, Claire Foy continues to bolster her impressive CV, laying bare for all to see the pressures of being an astronaut's wife. Dealing with personal turmoil, she can't escape in the way that her husband can, isolated and trapped as she is while he uses his work as an escape.<br/><br/>The film is slow-paced because it's not primarily an action film, it is an account of ordinary, real life people who happen to be doing extraordinary things, bankrolled by the richest government on Earth, in pursuit of a slain President's vision. When First Man does pursue the actual test flights and missions, however, it truly shines.<br/><br/>The sense of claustrophobia, peril and stress is palpable for the viewer as we remain in the cockpit/capsule for the duration. When it hits the fan, there is no music, no outside shots of the craft; it all takes place inside the module in order to convey just how dangerous a situation the astronauts placed themselves in time and again. This wasn't Hollywood; this was real and the film is excellent at conveying that and if you needed any more convincing of the costs involved, there are plenty of funerals to hammer the point home.<br/><br/>All of which culminates in the Moon landing, the reason Armstrong is one of the most famous and revered men in history, and the highlight of the film. After a typically tense and challenging descent (Foy's observation that NASA are ""boys building things from Balsa wood"" rings true throughout), Houston hears that ""the Eagle has landed"" and Armstrong and Aldrin set foot on the Moon.<br/><br/>Here, Damien Chazelle does everything right; as the door opens, there are no great swells of triumphant music, no whoops and cheers. There's nothing but silence. Intense, complete silence like one would indeed experience in a world with no atmosphere. It's very powerful to hear nothing as you gaze out onto a cold, grey, untouched alien world and the entire Moon scene had me utterly transfixed.<br/><br/>I've gone on long enough now but I would highly recommend First Man. I've read reviews slating it for being slow paced (it's a biopic of an extraordinary and yet ordinary man) and also for being nauseating to watch in the truest sense (you will feel like you've been through a washing machine spin cycle at times but that is what it was like onboard when stuff went wrong). It won't be for everyone but I loved it and I left the cinema feeling like I better knew one of history's great heroes and the team behind him.<br/><br/>If nothing else, the scene on the Moon is cinema at its absolute best.<br/><br/>8/10."

This is the story of Neil Armstrong the first man who put his foot on the moon. We can also realize that astronauts have also private lives, a wife and kids. In this case Armstrongs' wife is not very happy with her husband's space tasks being always afraid that it could turn out badly. But this movie is rather good and the technical details of the space flights are realistic indeed and almost documentary like."

I want to tell the so called acclaimed director a basic thing from the point of view of an average cinema goer. We go to movies to WATCH it. not to HEAR it. In this movie there is nothing to watch except shakkkkkking camera and unncessary zoooooom in and zzoooom outs. When we watch the picture, we will understand it and then we will connect to the movie. If there is nothing to watch except a shaky camera how can we connect to the movie ? ( if you want to shoot with a hand held camera with shaky picture, why do you need a professional photographer ? you could have done it yourself). The screenplay is not so interesting. I dont think Niel Armstrong family members would be happy after watching this movie. Unfortunately I paid a good amount of money to watch it on IMAX. Waste of my money and most importantly, my time. I felt motion sickness after watching this movie. My eyes are still rolling up and down even after the movie. Thanks to the worst photography. I never imagined an acclaimed director and photographer would produce this much of worst movie. Thanks man. I have taken a decision, that I will never watch another movie from you and from the photography director.<br/><br/>I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!"

This is how it would have been. Years leading up to 15 minutes of terror. It really gets your mind in the same state as the characters.<br/><br/>There are a few scenes of them floating in the spacecraft that you really wonder how in the world they had the cameraman floating in the limited space, and how fluid it was. Mind blowing.<br/><br/>I liked how they used some of the original nasa footage here and there to give it a bit more realism.<br/><br/>The only things I didn't like was the shaking of the camera in some scenes (realistic or not, it was a bit jarring in IMAX), and there were a few CG scenes that could have taken a bit more polish.<br/><br/>EVERY SCIENCE CLASS SHOULD HAVE TO SHOW THIS TO THEIR STUDENTS!"
"beardsmore","7","0","1","22 October 2018"," Beautifully shot with some stellar performances, the only thing that lets 'First Man' down is a few pacing issues
","Silence is the first thing that sticks out at me when thinking about 'First Man'. The emotion silence conveys whether during the space scenes or the interactions on Earth, is felt every second. The performances from Gosling and Foy add to this, the sense of dread and the risks associated with the launching of Apollo 11 and it's predecessors is made clear. Although we know they are eventually successful, we still hold our breath in suspense throughout. Gosling's portrayal of Neil Armstrong as a man desperate to succeed despite his personal tragedies resonates, it gives a much deeper look into an aspect of his life that the general audience would have no idea about. It is however, the passage of time that lets this film down slightly. As the 8 or so year period is covered, there are times when certain scenes are much longer than they need to be, as a result the film seems to drag in places. Then at the other end of the spectrum, there are some events and relationships which are brushed over, I would have liked to have seen the family dynamic explored further, as well as the character of Buzz Aldrin. Overall though, 'First Man' boasts exceptional cinematography and packs an emotional punch, succeeding in shining a new light on the life of a hero."
"raphaellecat","10","0","2","22 October 2018"," a giant leap...
","From a story of a promising young drummer trying to achieve greatness, to a bold contemporary musical harking back to the golden age, and now a journey to the moon, Damien Chazelle has brought us innovative projects that have struck a cord in the film industry, and his latest feature, First Man, is a giant leap forward, no pun intended.<br/><br/>This is a story the world knows all too well about the man who takes the first steps on the moon. Neil Armstrong has become an icon ever since that pivotal moment in human history, but this personal look at his life is what leads the audience into a dramatic journey most, I'm sure, weren't quite expecting.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's thoughtfully internalised portrayal of Armstrong further solidifies his place amongst the greatest's of screen performers, this being his best work to date in my humble opinion. The subtleties and nuances his eyes alone express give simultaneously so little and so much that the movies emotional core lies with Ryan's performance. The loss, the sacrifice and the greatness, Neil Armstrong is no mundane character and Ryan Gosling peels away the platitudes of layers this man holds on his journey to that historic walk. Accompanying Gosling is the equally impressive Claire Foy, who doesn't lose herself in this male centred world, instead heightening the already elevated drama and feeding the emotionality of a final scene that is sure to have a few tears.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle expertly handles some of the more suspenseful sequences with incredible ingenuity. One of which serves as a claustrophobic nightmare where the entirety of the scene is shot in the astronauts cockpit, giving you a first person perspective of a launch that will immerse you in the most frightening way. Combined with a cacophony of sounds meticulously engineered and jaw-dropping shots, First Man is a technical marvel that will leave you emotionally strained and visually bewildered."

He was an exceptional engineer, pilot, always dedicated to his aims and the rhythm of the movie and the way the story is narrated, based on the editing and on the cuts, focuses on those key points of the life of Armstrong and how he progressed.<br/><br/>In an era, that the rivalry between USA and Russia was tremendous, and the way that both wanted to excel and pioneer on the technological research and development, specifically on space exploration, is cleverly presented by the directing and the editing.

","This movie may not meet your expectations if you're expecting to see a rip roaring, feel good movie along the lines of ""The Right Stuff"" or ""Space Cowboys."" This movie is a tightly focused look at the psychology and the psychological costs of being an astronaut. In particular, being Neil Armstrong. As an engineer myself (but hardly an astronaut), I think Ryan Gosling captures the quiet introspection of the engineering (enginurd) type. He can focus his mind on trying to solve problems whether its his young daughter's brain tumor, finding a missing Agena docking target in orbit, or finding a safe place to land on the moon as the fuel runs dangerously low. Solving problems is the essence of engineering and Gosling captured this essence in a bottle. Claire Foy sheds every shred of British to become the quietly suffering astronaut's wife Jan, who is constantly left behind to deal with the home front as her husband flies into the skies, into space, and ultimately to the moon. This movie focuses almost entirely on these two people, their relationship, and their kids. The rest of the cast is there to support, from a considerable distance.<br/><br/>You should know that my wife did not care for this movie. There are long scenes of being shaken (in a simulator, on the Lunar Lander Research Vehicle, in a Gemini Capsule, in an Apollo Capsule, and in the Lunar Module). There are long looks at the lunar landscape reminiscent of the glacial pace of Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" The movie tried her patience. For me, I've been mentally entangled with the space program starting with the earliest days of the Mercury 7 astronaut team. I watched every launch on black and white TV. Even without seeing them in the movie, I know that Redstone and Atlas boosted Mercury, Titan boosted Gemini, and two Saturns boosted Apollo. If you're that type of person, then ""First Man"" is your type of movie. Otherwise, go watch ""The Right Stuff."""

But perhaps the most important death is that of Armstrong's daughter Karen, he hasn't grieved properly at his and his families loss, doesn't talk about her. But she is always present in his mind. This affects his relationship with his wife Janet (Claire Foy), son Rick and the other astronauts. The frail human Armstrong is revealed as well ad the test pilot, engineer and astronaut. The toll on his family and the families of other astronauts is also explored. While it is very much a film about Armstrong, the fact that it was an effort involving thousand of people is acknowledged.<br/><br/>Opening in 1961, Armstrong goes to 140,000 feet in an X-15 jet, but bounces off the atmosphere on re-entry and barely regains control. Another two astronauts die in a plane crash. There are problems with Armstrong's Gemini mission and contact is lost for a time. This incident causes Janet to forcefully confront NASA officials about how the astronaut's families are denied information. Three more astronauts are killed in the Apollo One fire and Armstrong is injured testing a mock up of the lunar landing module. Janet confronts neil and demands that he talk to their sons about the possibility that he might not return from the moon mission.<br/><br/>We are also constantly reminded of the lack of computers which we take for granted.

No, instead, it was a way for this shy and introvert engineer to deal with the insurmountable grief of his daughter's death.

","This movie is a intense portrait of Armstrong, his family, close friends and colleagues. The difficulties an introvert astronaut as Armstrong was has to deal with. The cinematography is breathtaking and the colors of the (Imax) Kodak 35mm and 16mm film really do help intensify the feeling of the 60's. The constant use of (extreme) close-ups makes the viewer almost claustrophobic, and reflects the feeling of sitting in a spaceshuttle and/or being really drawn into work and emotions. The lighting and art-direction was also really well done. This movie is about the emotional storyline of Armstrong and not an average patriotic blockbuster or informative documentary. I read people comparing it to the simple and utterly unrealistic movie like 'The Martian'. Where so much happened in the first 5 minutes of screentime a complete movie could have been made out of it. I wouldn't even dare using these two movies in the same sentence. 'First Man' is a really great movie that done things right up to the very detail."

"MistaJ","8","0","1","20 October 2018"," Great acting and directing, albeit a tad formulaic.
","First man is an impressive film overall- the directing and acting is top notch. Claire Foy gives one of the most emotionally complex performances I've seen in a long time, even with a type of character we've seen done before (the worried wife of the astronaut). Many of the scenes that take place on earth are filmed with the same sense of wonder that you are meant to feel during the space sequences- something I really appreciated. The wonder and importance of spending time with your family is emphasized as much as the need to explore space and complete the mission- which was really the central conflict for Neil, portrayed very tenderly and intimately by Gosling. All that considered however, the plot (and I know with it being a true story they can't alter much, and they shouldn't) unfortunately feels routine, something we've seen in other space movies before, such as Apollo 13. The lead character is training and going to space, things go wrong and the stakes are raised, a bunch of guys are hunched over computers at NASA, and there's a worried wife at home. I do appreciate the perspective Chazelle decided to take, focusing on Neil's inner struggle to honor the sacrifices people have made to get to the moon, while at the same time taking his children and wife into account and wanting to be there for them. It was just the bones of the plot surrounding the inner struggle of the characters that unfortunately made the film feels formulaic. But see it by all means and form your own options! Claire Foy's Performance alone is worth the admission price."
"Critomaton","7","0","1","20 October 2018"," IMDb closed its boards, but Gosling's on the moon.
","Alternate review title: It's a good thing Neil Armstrong happened to land on the moon, otherwise a biopic about him would apparently be really, really boring.<br/><br/>Motivated by its theatrical trailer (and some of the positive reviews here on IMDb), I saw First Man the weekend it opened, and I enjoyed it overall. Until I went back and read some of the more negative reviews and realized I agreed with those too!<br/><br/>Where to start? Well, first things first. This movie is nowhere near as entertaining or uplifting (or even informative) as either The Right Stuff or Apollo 13.<br/><br/>On the other hand, First Man does a serviceable job of filling the gap between those two films, neither one of which addresses the zenith (so far) of the space program, which was of course the first moon landing. So, an inferior movie about a superior topic can still be emotionally powerful and thought-provoking.<br/><br/>The moon landing sequence is very well done, as is the opening sequence featuring Neil's foray into the stratosphere. In between, there are a lot of unnecessarily shaky home-movie-style family micro-dramas of slight interest (except for one very touching story arc that links the opening and closing of the film).<br/><br/>Apart from the segment on the Gemini program (I not only learned its purpose but also its correct pronunciation: GEM-ih-nee, not GEM-ih-nye!), First Man gives very short shrift to the space program and the other astronauts. It even goes so far as to make Buzz Aldrin seem like a jerk. At least Monty Python respected Buzz.<br/><br/>That's why you have to keep reminding yourself - apparently this is a movie primarily about Neil Armstrong and his familial relationships (or lack thereof); it is not a movie about the moon landing.<br/><br/>The trouble is, if Ryan Gosling's performance is accurate, then Neil is a rather introverted, stoic, and emotionally detached person.<br/><br/>As for the in-capsule sequences, we get it Mr. Chazelle - it was claustrophic, loud, and shaky, with poor visibility. But some of the blastoff scenes felt as if we were getting a first-person view not from the mission commander through his space helmet, but from a passenger looking through the viewfinder of a first-generation Sony HandyCam. Was it really that bad? If so, then kudos for the realism, I guess...<br/><br/>OK, what about the flag flap? You know, the manufactured outrage about the lack of a scene showing the planting of the United States flag on the moon.<br/><br/>Although the U.S. flag was barely shown at all on the moon (i.e., the complainers are technically correct), this flap still seems like much ado about nothing, for several reasons:<br/><br/>1. As noted, many aspects of the space program were rushed or completely ignored in this movie, so what's one more?<br/><br/>2. There were numerous other scenes in the film clearly intended to evoke pro-U.S., patriotic feelings - many of them featuring the U.S. flag. These worked on me, and if they were added in post-production due to the controversy, then I guess it was useful after all. There is also a social commentary scene (alluded to by my review title), apparently included as a reasonable counterpoint to all the space-hype.<br/><br/>3. It's not too surprising that a U.S. flag planting would be cut/omitted to increase the international appeal of this film. After all, the only thing more distinctly American than the right to disrespect the flag is the right to maximize one's profit.<br/><br/>4. Last, and most importantly, the movie was about Neil Armstrong setting foot on the moon and - with one major dramatic exception - not at all about what he did after he got there. That dramatic exception is a powerful scene (no spoiler) that kind of makes the whole movie, especially since the focus is on Neil's relationship with his family.<br/><br/>Focusing on anything else that Armstrong did on the moon - even planting the flag - would have completely robbed that scene of its emotional impact. I hope this scene depicts an actual event; if added only for dramatic effect, it would ruin my impression of the film and filmmaker.<br/><br/>All in all, First Man is a decent, if flawed, film with some unforgettable scenes that are a bit too few and far between. It doesn't really seem Oscar-worthy, except maybe for the score, which was especially powerful during the touchdown on the moon. It's definitely worth a view at the theater, but probably not worth an IMAX upcharge."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>I always struggle to analyze films based on real-life events, especially in this case. Man landing on the Moon is not just a story that most people know, it's something that EVERYONE knows, which can be an instant flaw to a movie. If everyone knows the story, then predictability is a guaranteed factor, and any scene involving tension or suspense loses its impact since everyone knows how it ends. I mean, this is still a spoiler-free review, but ... Is it really?!<br/><br/>So, Damien Chazelle didn't have an easy job. How can you convey that feeling of concern for the character if the audience already knows that he/she is going to be okay? How can you make your viewers stay captivated for more than two hours when the story has its beginning, middle and ending pretty well-defined in their minds? How can you make a film about one of the most important and meaningful moments in humankind's history without it being a total letdown?<br/><br/>Well, thanks to the incredible dedication of Chazelle and the thoughtful screenplay by Josh Singer, First Man is a success and most likely the best movie in history to depict the Moon landing and everything that it required to achieve it. The biggest surprise of this experience (because it is, indeed, a cinematic experience) is that I didn't feel bored, even though I do think the film is too long. Singer's character scripts are extremely well-written, giving each and everyone one of them a defining personality.<br/><br/>Every secondary character is important, and that is one of the reasons I truly enjoyed First Man. It offered me a new perspective on how the Moon landing was planned and what did it need to go through. A lot of people only associate the Moon landing to Neil Armstrong, and that's it. This movie goes through Gemini, the project that allowed Apollo to start, every astronaut involved that unfortunately died just trying to perform some tests ... It is an in-depth look at not only Armstrong's life but everyone around him.<br/><br/>However, he is, in fact, the star of the show. Being able to learn more about his tragic past (which I didn't know before the film), how he had to deal with so many deaths, how he had to tell his kids that he might not ever return, his marriage, his bravery and calm under stressful situations... I know it's a movie, but knowing that Ryan Gosling and the crew talked with the real Neil about him and everything else, it really feels like First Man depicts what truly happened, even if it overdramatizes here and there.<br/><br/>The cast is unbelievably amazing. Jason Clarke is great as Ed White, one of Neil's closest friends. Claire Foy is absolutely astonishing as Neil's wife, Janet, and she might be looking at an Oscar nomination. However, the one that carries this entire thing and who is undoubtedly getting a nomination is Ryan Gosling. Gosh, this guy really knows how to pick his films. Wonderful performance, filled with emotional moments and remarkably tense dialogues which he perfectly nailed. It's not exactly his career-best performance but, so far, it's one of the year's best.<br/><br/>Technically, it couldn't reach my expectations better. Naturally, I expected a gorgeous-looking movie with Damien Chazelle proving that he knows his craft and that's what I got. The filmmaking in display is indisputably spectacular. From the brilliant decision to film the claustrophobic interior of the rockets to the small detail in the camera movement resembling the difficulty in focusing the lenses back in the day (that grainy resolution), almost everything is seamless. An excellent editing, an artistic cinematography by the well-known Linus Sandgren and an epic score by Justin Hurwitz, elevate the film in a significant way.<br/><br/>It isn't a flawless one, and it's majorly due to its runtime. Almost every issue that I have is partially related to the movie's length because if it was a bit shorter, then these issues would feel like nitpicks. The shaky-cam used to provide a realistic feeling inside the spaceflight's modules gets excessive and exhausting. The story lacks a quicker pace in the second act since there are gaps where nothing happens. Finally, even though everyone knows how things finish, the ending feels a bit abrupt. I think some scenes weren't that necessary and the time that they could have used in its conclusion, they didn't.<br/><br/>All in all, First Man is yet another Damien Chazelle's success. Technically astounding, this film offers a new perspective on how the Moon landing was performed and mainly what did it demand to get there. Lives were lost, and these tragic moments of his life shaped Neil Armstrong's personality. Ryan Gosling incorporates Neil in an emotionally brilliant way, saving him a likely Oscar nomination. Claire Foy also delivers an award-winning performance. It isn't a perfect movie primarily due to its excessive length which raises some of its other issues. Nevertheless, that epic Justin Hurwitz's score during the Apollo 11 launch and the astonishing Linus Sandgren's cinematography in the Moon are going to be kept in my memory forever."
"bLuR-7","8","0","1","19 October 2018"," A dizzying technical achievement!

The sequences inside the space capsule are surprisingly immersive, with every thud and shudder feeling of viscerally well-earned. Gosling is perfectly cast as the taciturn Armstrong, whose stoic demeanour belies a familial tragedy that plunges him and his wife into a black hope of grief.

","Almost a Review of First Man<br/><br/>When the movie Gravity came out a few years ago, interesting conversations were had about what sort of movie it was. It was about spaceships doing spaceship things, which would generally make it science fiction, but all the spaceships were real, and science fiction uses involves made up things.* I looked forward to seeing that trend grow - the idea that space was just another place that a movie could be set.<br/><br/>Exhibit A: First Man.<br/><br/>As apparently must be mentioned in any discussion of First Man, this movie is not The Right Stuff or Apollo 13.<br/><br/>Those were space movies. This is a movie set partially in space.<br/><br/>Specifically, it's a family drama - an intimate and personal portrait of a family; a family in which the dad has a rather unusual day job. A day job which involves the movie being set partially in space. Because everyone works somewhere, and sometimes that work involves travel.<br/><br/>I came out of watching First Man the first time, and immediately starting discussing it with the person I watched it with. My immediate reaction - I'm still processing. Honestly, that was still largely true a week later when I saw it again.<br/><br/>I'd had this sense that First Man wasn't going to be what a lot of people thought it was going to be, but it wasn't anything I thought it would be, either.<br/><br/>The story of the Armstrongs unfolds in a way that is deeply personal and unflinching; the story it tells and the way it is told mesh deftly - every intricacy of how the movie is shot tells its story.<br/><br/>I'll admit I have mixed feelings about the subject - Having had the opportunity to meet and talk with Apollo astronauts, to get to know them as people, I made the decision that I wanted Neil Armstrong to stay larger than life for me, more legend than human. The Neil Armstrong in this movie is very human; but while it's largely exhaustive in its pursuit of accuracy, there are a few moments of speculation that shift it back into the status of legend, growing and changing in each retelling.<br/><br/>The result of my processing is this - I really like the movie for what it is; a well-made biopic of a fascinating man, and the vanguard of the era of movies that just happen to be set in space.<br/><br/>And for space just happening to the setting, the space part is done as well as, if not better than, any movie before it. The space scenes here aren't sexy or glamorous; they're realistic in a way I don't think I've seen before, and all the more powerful for it. I strongly suspect this movie captures what it was like to actually ride in these vehicles in a way that's never been done before.<br/><br/>I almost hate to acknowledge it, but even just this week I've had people bring up the flag-planting controversy, and I've seen speculation it hurt the box office. Yes, it's true that you see the flag on the moon without seeing the frankly anticlimactic moment its planted, but that's missing the point. The sad irony is that unfair criticism are keeping people from watching what is almost certainly one of this year's movies that most celebrates America.<br/><br/>With the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 now less than a year away, First Man makes a half-century old story fresh enough to inspire in a new era of exploration.<br/><br/>*Of course, the orbital mechanics in Gravity were science that was fiction, but I'm actually on the side of the filmmakers on that one."

","This movie was very interesting to me as I knew very little about the moon landing and Neil Armstrong's life prior to this. I found the performances great especially from Claire foy and Ryan. Could he potential Oscars but I think he a star is born leads beat them sadly I think. The cinematography was brilliant especially in the space scenes. One issue I have with this film, although not really, is that the quality was not great and a bit fuzzy, I recognise this was for affect and to get the 60s feel more, and in some aspects i liked it. But I kinda wanted a very clear picture at times. In addition to this, I feel some sequences and things were dragged out a little too long, and could have been shortened. I felt the movie was a bit too long. I also like how this is not just some pushing of agenda, telling us this is all true. Although I do believe it is all true and man did walk on the moon, it doesn't really rely on that and need you to believe it. It's just a nice story (with the small chance it's not true) of a man and a portion of his life that led to him making history. This is a great film for all ages, although one use of the F word, and some darker themes about death etc but I think this is suitable for young teens and that and teach them about such a huge milestone in human history, although not their typical action/superhero movie i still believe they'll find it interesting as I did. Recommend this highly"

"octagonproplex","7","0","1","18 October 2018"," The humane story, rather than ""The Human Story"".
","Curb your expectations accordingly.<br/><br/>Before I dissect my minute qualms, let me preface now that ""First Man"" is a quality movie - and that said - I'm not going to concentrate on any of its virtues here. Because I do have some rather glaring reservations;<br/><br/>Aside from the always welcome addition of Kyle Chandler, I kinda feel most of the film is miscast. Ryan Gosling is one of his generations finest leading actors, but here he is quite blank and doesn't remind me of the real Neil Armstrong at all. In fact, none of the astronaut characterizations seemed like their true-life counterparts. Although I am hard pressed to site better replacements, so perhaps it's more a fault in the writing and direction of those characters.<br/><br/>Another element I take issue with is the constant roaming hand-held camera stuff - especially in the Armstrong home. It was a distractingly curious choice at times, because it gives the actual cameraman a very intrusive participating presence in some of those intimate scenes (for me at least) - echoing the worst tendencies of recent Terrence Malick. Damien Chazelle apparently wanted to underplay everything, yet he overplayed the verite camera work trying so desperately to feel authentic yet calling attention to its artifice through its behind the lens searching, probing, and lurking.<br/><br/>The music score had interesting instrumentations and some impactful moments of tenseness, but to my mind was all too often too subdued and simply tonal wallpaper - and there was never any sense of idealism, which just seems disingenuous as representetive of a story about driven people inspired to do audaciously bold things. It's very obvious they deliberately chose to eschew trumpets and drumlines to avoid the cliche - to once again underplay the events - but I think it's at the cost of undermining the significance of such a momentous accomplishment and undercutting the aspirational emotions involved by being a little too revisionist toward the true stirring spirit of that literally flag-planting era (which was certainly jingoistic in propulsion).<br/><br/>I understand Chazelle is intentionally demystfying the iconism which has become mythicly cliche, and that's a smart place to start from, but at some point in telling a story it will demand when it wants to be fetishized for the purpose of granting perspective on the broader impact. Here we're never really treated to a cinematic rendering of just how profoundly the nation and the world was affected by placing our own footprints onto that big glowing orb in the night sky that has beguiled and beckoned mankind's oneiric romanticisms for our entire tenure as conscious entities on this earth. So even though I appreciated the intimate subtext it told within the pretext, in the respect of the wider context ""First Man"" fell short for me.<br/><br/>""Apollo 13"" is still the best film about a NASA mission. I prefer HBO's excellent mini-series ""From The Earth To The Moon"" as well. ""The Right Stuff"" is also superior.<br/><br/>""First Man"" is worth a watch, but not likely a rewatch any time soon."

","The acting and cinematography were both well done. This film was less about an intriguing storyline and more about the state of mind of the legendary astronaut Neil Armstrong. The dialogue in the film was subdued and it was more about the emotions of the characters. All in all a pretty great film with strong performances by Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy as well as the supporting cast. Another great aspect of the film is that it makes you appreciate what risks and sacrifices some folks made for the purpose of space exploration and discovery - which was inspiring to see!"
"ishallnottellalie","9","0","1","18 October 2018"," A film that will linger and stay with you
","You know you saw a good movie when it left you with a genuine emotion afterwards. This is the case with this one. Neil Armstrong personal story is beautifully intertwined with historical facts regarding the Moon landing program and has tense moments that would convey the characters as super-men that belong to an old forgotten era where humankind dared to dream big.
This is not a movie for everyone, not a fast paced movie with over the top action scenes for quick gratification while munching on popcorn. This film is the movie Drive in respect to Fast & Furious. No wonder the only other two people in the movie theatre left in the middle of the film.
The only thing that keeps this film to be exquisite is the shaky camera that was overused. And I underline overused because in some scenes it was appropriate. The actress that played Neil's wife was top notch and a good selection.
Ryan Gosling was perfect for the role with his cool demeanor and taciturn approach.<br/><br/>I don't know what the scandal with the flag was about but the movie I saw had the american flag implanted in the Moon which it should have for historical accuracy. The movie goes forward and has a scene where a black man has a commentary along the lines ""we blacks are starving and the white man goes to the Moon"" which in the paradigm of the movie and common sense, such a statement would be considered moronic. So this movie is daring in this respect to say the least.<br/><br/>This movie left me with a sense of sadness, admiration and hope.
The music was proper, original, almost respectful for the events unfolding on the screen.
This was for me a rare occasion where I will rewatch it soon in the cinema for a complete visual and auditory experience"
"acgatti","9","0","2","18 October 2018"," Movie about a man...not about technology or superiority.
","First Man is a stunning film. And, in my estimation, a misunderstood film. Controversy rose prior to its release because the planting of the American flag was not showcased in the film. I myself was putout by this omission even before having seen it. Now I have seen film. I must say that it made sense. Yes, perhaps the main underlying reason for omitting the raising of the flag might be to cater to the international market. The director is the only one who can provide that clarification and insight. But, it doesn't matter. The film is not about American Exceptionalism. It is unequivocally about one man: Neil Armstrong. From this context, it makes sense. Neil Armstrong was an extremely introspective man. The film painfully captures this. Painfully? Yes, painful in the sense that his laconic demeanor was frustrating to withstand and understand. It made it difficult to connect to the man at an emotional level. Still, his sacrifices and ordeals made one feel empathy for him. His travels into space were claustrophobic: Cramped spaces with ominous bangs and noises all around. The film did an outstanding job capturing the fear: I was frightened...and I was comfortably seated in my seat and knew he was going to be okay. Neal managed his fear in the cockpit as he dealt with his family: He was terse throughout. First Man is not about technology. It is not about patriotism. It is about a man, an exceptional man. A man that stood on the shoulders of thousands to reach the surface of the moon, and was lucky, very lucky to climb back down."

"RforFilm","9","0","1","17 October 2018"," First Man puts you in that pilots seat for a small step, but a giant leap of a great movie
","If there's anything that my father loves talking about is spaceflight and the Apollo missions to the moon. Given his age, he lived through the sixties as a child and saw astronauts like Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin as idols that were able to push the frontier and visit the moon. Most people know that the whole point to get to the moon was to simply do it before the Soviets would have. Of course they never made it, but it was still such an accomplishment to be able to get people to the moon and back. <br/><br/>Now we've had movies about this before, though the most well known is the Ron Howard film, Apollo 13. In an essence, I can see that story being more attractive as it was, to quote NASA, ""A successful failure"". Apollo 11 was a mission that went right from the beginning to the end. Like a lot of great innovations, most people don't know the work and struggle it took to reach them. In the case of space, the pressure was greater as they were working to beat the Soviet Union to the moon. First Man details the accounts of NASA's working to reach the moon and Neil Armstrong's perspective. <br/><br/>NASA test pilot Neil Armstrong (played by Ryan Gosling) is reserved, but hard working as he is willing to push boundaries to achieve scientific achievement. He is just as willing to do everything to try and save his sick daughter, but fails as she dies from a brain tumor. This makes him more willing to dive into his work, not wanting much sympathy from his colleagues. In the process he applies and makes it as an astronaut in the Project Gemini program, causing he and his family to relocate to Houston, Texas where the other astronauts live. With the support of his wife Janet, he provides whatever help he can to get NASA further.<br/><br/>He's assigned to Gemini 8, where they are hoping to make the possibility of docking work. The mission is a success and even manages to stop their ship from spinning when trying to make it home. This gives NASA lead way to start the Apollo program where his friend Ed White is assigned. Unfortunately, the launch fails as a fire kills all members of Apollo 1. For the new Apollo 11 mission, Armstrong is selected to command it along with Buzz Aldrin (Played by Corey Stoll) and Jim Lovell (played by Pablo Schreiber).<br/><br/>Director Damien Chazelle (Whiplash, La La Land) is clearly passionate about this era, because First Man takes a part of history and takes it's audience on a thrilling adventure. Movies like The Right Stuff, Apollo 13 and Hidden Figures may have been great representations of NASA's accomplishments, but First Man does add an element not present before; gritty reality. While the previous movies list did show how hard things were, the cinematography really puts us within the perspectives of these astronauts, showing how tight and how little visibility they had when piloting these rockets and machines. It reminds me of a horror movie because being a pioneer can be scary; space is unpredictable and it was amazing that it was done given their conditions. <br/><br/>Many of the camera angles are done from a first person perspective, giving us the audience Neil Armstrong's uncertain road ahead of him. We know he made it, but the movie does a great job of making us forget about that. My favorite has to be his walk through the NASA halls before he's strapped in for his Gemini mission. I felt that same sweat dripping from my neck that I'm sure astronauts still have today. 
I should mention Ryan Gosling and his performance. In short, it's also great. You get an immediate sense that Neil Armstrong is such a stoic and humble individual that his personality could have easily come off as boring. Ryan Gosling can often do that, but you get a sense that he's just as passionate about his job as the other astronauts. Armstrong was simply more reserved and movies rarely portray these types of people. I myself am typically reserved and hope this movie shows that we have passion; like Armstrong, were just selective about who can witness our vulnerability. <br/><br/>I'll give this ten Apollo pictures out ten. First Man is without a doubt one of the best movies of 2018. It's fascinating, thrilling, thought provoking, and showcases another side of history that even when we succeed, we always need to be ready to fail so that we learn from it and not repeat those mistakes. The Apollo missions have always seemed like a million in one odds-type success stories. First Man was a story with those odds and pulled a happy success. Take the launch and see this movie."
"aarneai","9","0","2","17 October 2018"," It's Fantastic
","Breathtaking. That's probably the best way to describe the last third of this film. But it's not just the last third that's good. The entire film is very, very good. With First Man as well as Damian Chazelle's last two films, he's quickly becoming my favourite director and deservedly so.<br/><br/>Let's start by talking about the aforementioned last third. It is one of the most intense experiences I have ever had while watching a movie. Hell, it's one of the most intense experiences I've ever had. Everything from the music to the way it was filmed just puts you right on the edge of your seat. Even though you know what happens, it's just so incredibly well made that you can't help but feel anxious. And without spoiling anything once they land on the moon the change in tone and feeling is just beautiful. And then there is the ending which is, like everything else, just so beautifully made.<br/><br/>Then let's talk about the first two thirds. First Man is certainly more of a biopic of Neil Armstrong than it is a movie about the moon landing. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you but I certainly found it to work very well. Gosling's portrayal of Armstrong is excellent and other performances shine just as brightly. However, it almost feels like the last third is a completely different movie. In fact, everything before it could've been a documentary about Armstrong before he landed on the moon.<br/><br/>I actually find it quite hard to write about this film. It's without a doubt one of the best films of the year and if I wasn't such a big Marvel fan, this would certainly my favourite film of the year so far. I can't think of anything that could've been improved or done differently. I highly, highly recommend seeing First Man even if you don't care about the subject. It really is that good."

"Cineanalyst","9","0","1","17 October 2018"," Visceral
","I'm a sucker for a good space movie. ClichÃ© as it may be, they're awe inspiring and the stuff that stirs the imagination. That always traces back to the Apollo 11 Moon landing, and no cinematic reenactment, regardless of IMAX high-resolution, will ever capture the magic of the grainy images of the actual event broadcast on televisions around the world. To the credit of the makers of ""First Man,"" this wasn't their primary mission. The use of TV here is interesting, though; rather than trying to recapture that event, these clips add context--the sort that one might've thought would've averted some of the ridiculous controversies thrust upon the movie--to what is a narrowly-focused biopic of Neil Armstrong. The wonder still derives from the Moon, including the self-reflexive reveal of the camera that captured those first steps, but following the first man to walk on it through selected moments culminating with that astronomical body foster a visceral portrait of the man and his subjective experience on the lunar surface. ""First Man"" features the giant leap for mankind, but its focus is on the one small step for a man.<br/><br/>Say what you will about Ryan Gosling's career repetition of long takes of his seemingly blank gazes, from ""Drive"" (2001) to ""Blade Runner 2049"" (2017), but he's perfectly cast as Armstrong, perhaps history's most famous introvert. Understated by default, when his Armstrong does display overt emotion, it's all the more effective because of this. The rest of the cast is fine, too, including Kyle Chandler's drawing the Moon shot on a chalkboard reminding me he was the coach in the TV version of ""Friday Night Lights."" This is so focused on Neil, however, that the only other vital part here is his wife, Janet, as played by Claire Foy, who marks the right balance between expressing what her husband won't, or compelling him to, and without being reduced to a stereotypically tempestuous housewife. There's a reason this movie ends where it does, not in outer space.<br/><br/>This inner look at Neil also filters and limits depictions of NASA's achievements through his experiences. From the tragedy of the death of his daughter to his ultimate lunar triumph is why those parts of his work that are selected between are the near-death ones (and, indeed, deadly for some of his fellow astronauts) and those that were failures or qualified successes. Even when not tumbling in rattling aircraft and rocket ships through the sky and space, the scenes on Earth tend to be captured by a shaking camera. Only on the Moon does the style, like Neil, find some reprieve. It's a wonderful sequence and quite a feat--managing to be the most insightful of the character while he says nothing and his face is hidden by the helmet visor and when the scenery in IMAX is the most overpowering.<br/><br/>The character-driven focus within the monumental historical event, however, seems to be the cause of some laughable, if not depressing, sociopolitical objections to the movie. The flag dispute is especially unfortunate, including the current President of the United States rebuking a movie he hasn't seen--and for what? To capitalize on an imaginary controversy over a movie that celebrates a defining achievement in American history? For those who wanted a critique of current politics in a historical biopic (yes, some do--Kate Gardner's review, e.g.), there it is: look at President Trump's comments and compare them to the speech in the movie by President Kennedy. The flag being planted on the Moon isn't shown because this film isn't chiefly about the American achievement, although it's there--inescapable even had the filmmakers wanted to avoid it, which they obviously didn't. There are flags, allusions to Cold War geopolitics, JFK and more. Regardless of what the Canadian lead actor says, it's not about the human achievement, either, although that's there, too, including TV reactions from around the globe, plus the ""one giant leap.""<br/><br/>Conversely, critic Richard Brody calls it ""an accidental right-wing fetish object."" Much of this line of criticism is borne from the protagonist's personality and the role of TV here. The ""lack of expression"" that Brody calls ""a character flaw,"" a lack of ""consciousness"" and a detachment from humanity and what critic Matt Zoller Seitz calls ""a tragedy of American machismo"" and ""emotional constipation"" restate the usual attacks of supposed coldness, repression and lack of emotion leveled against introverts, as if quiet reflection and even a cry in private, as opposed to airing one's emotions publicly, were a vice. More to the point, Gardner criticizes the movie as ""a tale of the exceptional white man,"" and plenty of others have questioned the movie's lack of gender and racial diversity--often citing the prior NASA movie ""Hidden Figures"" (2016). Never mind that the focus isn't on people behind the scenes, even the likes of Wernher von Braun absent, and that the Houston control center is downplayed, especially compared to a film such as ""Apollo 13"" (1995), with their input coming in as babble while the camera focuses on Neil and crew hurtling through space. Of course, there was segregation and institutional racism in the 1960s, too, and such context is TV's role here.<br/><br/>From ""Whitey on the Moon"" to coverage of the Vietnam War, one may interpret the juxtaposition within the film how they wish, but I think it's as much as anything to placate and avoid offense (failing in Brody's case), as well as appearing too unbound from the world, for what is intended as a mainstream, all-pleasing product. Anymore focus on ancillary and contextual aspects surrounding Neil's life would've detracted from the inward examination of the man, just as further depictions of his outward accomplishments would've been irrelevant to the picture's purpose. Moreover, I find it more intriguing how the use of TV here inverts its historical role of presenting the Moon to us earthlings by, instead, doing the opposite for Earth in a film focused in space. I also want to see ""First Man"" again to examine the style, how its camerawork and look may do for space movies what ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998) did for war ones, whether it is, indeed, too darkly-lit, and just for the pure exhilaration of the scenes from Armstrong bouncing off the atmosphere to walking on the Moon."

The unsteady shaky cinamaphotography does work when they are punch through the atmosphere but doesn't belong in the scenes on the ground.

","First Man is an incredibly special film and an excellent viewing experience that I highly recommend, particularly if you can see it in IMAX. What's impressive about Damien Chazelle is that he has shown great aptitude at directing incredibly different types of movies. La La Land and First Man have markedly different tones and visuals, each to its own benefit, and it's a clear indication of Chazelle's capabilities. Unlike La La Land which was a portrayal of fulfilling dreams, First Man is a much more humble, grounded, and human story. It isn't about the triumph of successfully landing a man on the moon, it's a very personal story about the man who sacrificed a lot in his single-minded pursuit to make his daughter proud and serve his country. However, that isn't to say that they don't do justice for the story of the Apollo missions, they do, they just don't glamorize the missions and portray them as something they weren't. Chazelle shows us what the missions were surely like, overwhelming, heart-pounding, and harrowing. He uses sound design and gritty visuals in combination excellently to portray how easily the moon landing could have failed. The way he brings it to the screen is unbelievably visceral and completely thrilling, giving the audience a very unique experience compared to most other movies about space travel. In general, all of the technical aspects of this movie were terrific, especially the sound mixing/edit and cinematograpy. The moon landing sequence and following shots on the moon are absolutely gripping, and in IMAX, blew my mind. However First Man isn't just a well written, well directed, and technically stunning film, it's also expertly acted. Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy both give it their all and add immense depth to each of their characters. Given that it could be a tight year at the Academy Awards, I hope that there's room for both Gosling and Foy in the best actor and best support actress categories, because they are certainly worthy of nomination. Over all, I strongly recommend seeing First Man on the biggest screen you can, it's an experience you won't forget!"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","1","17 October 2018"," Has some interesting themes, but lacks drama.
","Whether this movie was trying to prove a specific point about exploration and human achievement, I don't know. What I do know is that after watching it, I'm starting to think that going to the moon was not such a good idea. It doesn't entirely shy away from suggesting to the audience the impracticality of the lunar missions. Everyone in the theater had one or two moments where only they laughed at something that was said that emphasized some slightly absurd aspect of the mission. And basically, the only real reason that it gives for continuing the mission was ""we can't let the Russians keep showing us up"". That may not be completely historically accurate, but I doubt it's that far from the truth.<br/><br/>Having seen Damien Chazelle's two most famous movies, ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"", I was expecting that we might get more of a story about self-destruction than inspiring accomplishments. While there is some focus on the emotional stresses placed on Neil Armstrong in his lunar mission, there is more attention given to the danger that all of the astronauts are put in throughout the missions. I think this was done to add to the drama of whether Neil would come back safely and to give weight to his decision to stick with the space voyages. Still, there is only so much drama that can be generated in a story that we already know the ending to. This kind of became a problem throughout the movie, because there were several scenes, especially toward the end, that were elongated to make them seem more dramatic but ended up taking me out of the movie.<br/><br/>As might be expected, this is a much different movie than Damien Chazelle's previous two projects, but I thought he did a pretty good job on directing the space-travel scenes. I sensed that he took a lot of influence from ""Interstellar"", especially in the Gemini docking sequence. The opening sequence was pretty intense and engaging and set the tone well for the movie. Also, I would warn all people who have epilepsy or feel sick from disorienting, shaky, and spinning camerawork: this movie has a lot of that. <br/><br/>The dialogue scenes were done quite well, though less noticeably so. There were a few pacing issues that I had with the script, but the individual scenes were written very well. I doubt that Josh Singer will get much award recognition for his work on the script, but I would be trust him to deliver a good script based on his work here. Despite that, there were a lot of scenes that I thought moved way to slowly, which made the movie as a whole drag a bit.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Claire Foy could get nominations for their performances. Gosling was always a welcome presence, and Foy did very well in her role, even if her performance felt a little like Oscar bait. There was a fair amount of individual attention given to Foy's character, Janet Armstrong. 
As I left the theater and discussed the movie with the four people I went with, it seemed that none of us felt like it had been a waste of time, but neither had it wowed any of us in any regard. I would still recommend seeing it, maybe not in theaters, but it will make you think some big thoughts. By this I don't mean that it will leave you feeling empowered to defy the odds or anything like that. If anything it might make you want to take that voice telling you to quit a little more seriously. But it might give you some new ideas about some major world issues."

","Going into a film like this one there are some preconceived notions about the film that most people would have and I definitely had. The main one being that majority if not all of the film would be dedicated to the moon landing and nothing else. Its pretty obviously notion to have but I couldn't have been more wrong and for the right reasons. If anything the moon landing takes a back seat and the film primarily focuses on telling a story of Neil Armstrong's life. You know what I am so glad that it did that and not focus on the moon landing because the story of his life is fascinating.<br/><br/>Damien Chazelle deserves a huge amount of credit for making this film because not only does it telling an fascinating story but is also visually stunning when the film eventually gets into space. The gamble of making a film that is a character study that takes its time and pays off big time towards the last 45 to 30 minutes. Chazelle easily could have skipped over so much of the background of Armstrong for a multitude of reasons. However I am so glad that he didn't and he let the film breathe and take its time in setting up the characters and the story. Brilliant story telling and directing from start to finish. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling is on a roll, the guy just doesn't put out half decent work its always stellar acting and once again in probably one of his best performances so far. He shows such an array of emotions in Neil at various moment within the story that are extremely powerful. The part I love the most about the performance is the quiet awkwardness and motivation in the man, its best shown when he is sitting down with his children explaining to them that he may not come back. He is telling them as if his was in a board meeting at NASA and not at home with his children. Another demonstration is during the press conference when he says he'd rather take more fuel that jewellery. Its a perfectly legitimate reason but comes across in a weird way, that makes the man and performance that much more believable and special.<br/><br/>Other performances such as Claire Foy, Corey Stoll, Kyle Chandler and Jason Clarke are all really strong across the board, however in my opinion don't quiet match Gosling.<br/><br/>Overall this film is very good 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, I would go as far to say that this is Chazelle's best work (even though saying that I've never watch la la land, but i will never watch musicals......but thats a whole other conversation). This film is actually in a weird way not for everyone, its slow, methodical and only a small percentage of the film is actually in space. Don't go into the film thinking its gonna be like ""Apollo 13"" because it definitely isn't.<br/><br/>Lastly there was some backlash against this film due to it not showing the planting of the American Flag on the moon . Fully disclosure I'm not American but I cannot see how this film is anti American, the main story of the film is about how the Americans beat the Soviet Union to the moon. How much more pro-American can you get??? Im so confused on this tiny and insignificant issue, its was a giant leap for mankind!"

","First Man is a triumph. As a warts-and-all biopic of Neil Armstrong, detailing the most important part of his life, I can only speculate as to its authenticity. The main problem with biopics, it seems to me, is that unless there is documented evidence of that person's innermost feelings, it's effectively just guesswork. That's where the drama comes in. What makes a great story like the US/USSR space race come alive is the impact it had on the lives of those most intimately involved. There's little risk of getting it wrong in speculating how a man might feel over the premature death of his young daughter from cancer, or surviving a near-death experience of his own; the emotional strains these things would place on his relationships with family and friends. No, the real strength of this story is not so much laying bare the soul of Neil Armstrong as using his personal experiences to allow us on board the space race itself. Having said that, magnificent though the depictions of NASA's endeavours are in First Man, the main cast really bring it to life and invest the story with a sense of purpose. No one conveys emotional depth through silences better than Ryan Gosling, and Claire Foy was wonderful as the worried wife pushed close to the edge of endurance by the risks her husband was taking, and the emotional distance he kept, seemingly as armour against allowing himself to give up.
Where First Man really ups the ante is in the NASA development testing events, when things went wrong. The accidents in which Neil Armstrong was personally involved were conveyed on the big screen with gut-churning intensity; there's no doubting his courage and coolness under pressure, to be able to think and perform his way out of certain death in those situations. Damien Chazelle's direction places the viewer in the cockpit with Armstrong; you effectively become him at key moments. This intensity is aided and abetted by a superb soundtrack of music and sound effects, the like of which I can't recall experiencing since Interstellar.
The icing on the directorial cake is the 1969 moon landing itself; the way it is done actually creates the sense of wonder and awe which I feel would have been experienced at the time it happened; there is absolutely no feeling of anti-climax as Armstrong and Aldrin step out onto the lunar surface and take it all in. Magnificent."

","My pedigree in the ""NASA Universe"" requires me to see this movie. <br/><br/>Watching it on IMAX was a mistake. The huge screen and the movie full of close-ups is a bad combo. I barely survived it.<br/><br/>As a teenager in 1969 I was a volunteer at a science museum in Florida. Our rocket nerd circle got regular trips to the Cape for launches, some lucky ones even got press credentials. Needless to say, we were, and still are rocket nerds.<br/><br/>This film does a nice job telling the story of Neil Armstrong. His story would not have been noticed in an Apollo 13 style production. His story is small compared to the space program and the monster-sized flame throwing rockets. This film is about the man not the mission, perhaps a gutsy move by the director.<br/><br/>NASA selected Neil Armstrong to be first man on the moon because of his modest and meticulous style. There were few modest personalities in the astronaut corps. The last thing NASA needed was blow-hard ""First Man"" on The Tonight Show. Neil was known for being a man of few words but, when he did speak he would say exactly the perfect words at exactly the perfect time. The movie over-did the quiet Neil a bit, which added about 5 minutes to the film. It's too bad because when Neil spoke in public the ""Hero First Man"" came out. This contrast would have been powerful in the movie.<br/><br/>First Man mostly uses realistic in-camera effects techniques, as opposed to computer 3D models and green screen. Combining fresh new sound effects and extreme closeups these flight scenes are breathtaking. <br/><br/>For the propeller heads, great cockpit stuff, launch stuff and I really liked the X-15 sequence. <br/><br/>I'm glad I saw it. I did learn something about Armstrong and that's good!"
"Anurag-Shetty","9","0","1","16 October 2018"," Focuses more on the man than the journey.
","First Man is a biopic about Neil Armstrong(Ryan Gosling) & all his trials & tribulations before his historic moon landing on July 20th, 1969. <br/><br/>First Man is an amazing film. Director Damien Chazelle has given us another unforgettable movie, after Whiplash(2015) & La La Land(2016). The space shuttle sequences are exciting, edge of the seat & the highlight of the film. The most impressive part is that, they've been shot with minimal visual effects & green screen. The background score by Justin Hurwitz is very memorable. One minor flaw is that, the movie could have been cut short by at least 5 to 10 minutes, as it drags fleetingly. Ryan Gosling is a tour de force as Neil Armstrong. Gosling has given us the best performance of his career & brings many different nuances into his portrayal of Armstrong. Claire Foy is spectacular as Janet Armstrong. Foy's emotional yet effortless portrayal makes her a force to be reckoned with, in Hollywood. Jason Clarke is great as Edward Higgins White. Pablo Schreiber is awesome as Jim Lovell. Ethan Embry is impressive as Pete Conrad. Corey Stoll is excellent as Buzz Aldrin. Christopher Abbott is good as Dave Scott. Olivia Hamilton is effective as Pat White. Ciaran Hinds is great as Robert Gilruth. Lukas Haas is perfect as Mike Collins. Shea Whigham is brilliant as Gus Grissom. Patrick Fugit is super as Elliott See. First Man is a must watch for everyone, who loves a story of an individual going all out to achieve his hopes & dreams. Prepare to be enthralled!"

","There can hardly have been a more dramatic adventure since the Age of Exploration than the 1960s U.S. mission to send 'a Man to the Moon'. Neil Armstrong was that first man, and the story of his preparations for this venture and subsequent success are told here to great effect. <br/><br/>This movie is both exciting and poignant, weaving together the astronauts' professional and personal lives, revealing the enormous mental, physical and emotional pressures and tensions exerted not just on Armstrong and his colleagues, but also their families; the ever-present risk of death hangs over the mission as the astronauts prepare and compete to be the First Man. <br/><br/>A story like this hardly needs dramatisation - it is itself amazing - and the understated approach adopted by Damien Chazelle works very effectively. Although in danger of lapsing into sentimentality now and then, generally the movie avoids the schmaltz traps. This makes the emotional impact of the story all the more powerful, epitomised by the way the ending has been treated. <br/><br/>The performances are generally good, though perhaps not outstanding, and the cinematography and FX are quite brilliant. CGI excesses and bogus sci-fi scenarios have been avoided, putting this film in a league well above, for example, The Martian.<br/><br/>At 2hrs 21mins, this is a lengthy film. But I found it so engaging - you train with the astronauts, travel with them, land on the Moon with them, and feel every rattle and groan along the way - that it did not feel excessively long. And in its portrayal of the massive forces required to carry humans beyond the grip of Earth's gravity, and of the phenomenal courage of those space pioneers who subjected themselves to those forces, it has done justice to the magnitude of their achievement.<br/><br/>Not to be missed!<br/><br/>(Viewed at Odeon, Warrington, U.K. 15 October 2018)"

","***********CONTAIN HEAVEY SPOILERS!!! READ ON YOUR OWN RISK!!!!***********<br/><br/>First of all, I don't write reviews a lot. In fact, it's very rare it comes from me. Usually I write them if I am wondering about something or if I get really impressed about the movie. In this case, it's the latter one. <br/><br/>From the moment this came on the cinema I wanted to watch it. I didn't believe it would be so good, but I had some hopes for it. I got really impressed after watching the movie. Damien Chazelle (director) did a excellent work with the timing of the music, the camera angles, the shadowing, etc. I.e. points that really matters. I think they did a great job not only on the developement of the NASA technology, but it also showed us the situation of the people and how they reacted to this project. I am glad that they told the story mostly how it really was, though I agree things got a bit dramatic and exaggerated. But then again this is a movie, you have to twist it somehow from the reality. <br/><br/>Usually Ryan Gosling (Neil Armstrong - actor) don't impress me very often. He is an alright actor, but here he did a great job. In my view he carried the movie. He did, in fact, a great job. His acting was superb and he did really a good job. <br/><br/>I have talked to my friends about how exaggerated they made it with the loss of his daughter. A friend meant that he got the impression that he went to the moon because he lost his daughter. <br/><br/>However, I got another impression. In my view, the loss of his daughter was quite heavy. We saw that he didn't talk about Karen (his daughter)'s death to anyone. In other words, he kept the sorrow of his loss all to himself. This affected him very much. To me, his dream about going to the moon was always there. He loved being an astronaut, but after the loss of his daughter this disturbed him both on job and funerals. This is something he had on his mind for a long. <br/><br/>What I really liked is how they symbolized that he accepted her death and let her go once he threw away her bracelet. At that point he accepted the fact that his daughter is gone and wanted to start a new life. It may have been a bit exaggerated, with that we saw her in his eyes a lot, but I feel like this was necessary to make us understand how heavy the loss of his daughter was for him. <br/><br/>There were one thing I didn't like in the movie. Personally, I believe it should have ended with once he threw away the bracelet. This would symbolize that he accepted her death and let it go from his mind. This would also symbolize that he wanted to start a new start with his family. <br/><br/>Overall, I found this movie very good. It was good in many ways. 7/9 is a fair rating from (which would be 5/6). I would recommend people to watch it! It may be one of the best movies of 2018, if not the best."

","Damien Chazelle, I don't know how you do it but you've done it again. 'First Man' is superb. In its documentary feel, utterly realistic depiction of the early days of the space programme with meticulous attention to details, in making something we've all heard of look somewhat new and even unpredictable. What they've managed to achieve is a beautiful balance of intimate and epic especially in those sequences with quick switches between the every-day life shots and NASA realities. And it's been remarkably done with brilliant colour grading, Linus Sandgren's cinematography which makes you feel a part of the movie in almost every single shot, and Justin Hurwitz soundtrack - hauntingly beautiful, touching yet powerful. Gosling's subtle, restrained and internalized performance is well matched by Claire Foy who I guess might pick up a supporting role Oscar nomination for this. All in all, a beautiful piece of film-making to be experienced on a big screen. I left the theatre feeling as if I've just been to the Moon myself along with Neil. I guess it says it all. Spellbound."

","....as some reviewers appear to. This is a marmite film; if you understand the calm, intelligent character needed to land on the moon then you will appreciate this. Neil Armstrong was such and it is a strength that Ryan Gosling presents him as such. I do not know how tense the relationship was in the marriage but if you are risking your life as the astronauts did, it is hardly surprising. But the interspersing of family life is another strength since we should know more about the Christopher Columbus of our generation. I liked the muted orchestral soundtrack; a Titanic or brash rock music soundtrack would have been out of place. And pace? Well there were many minutes when I was so engrossed by the rattling old rockets and shaky camera work that I swear I didn't breathe, such was the tension. Time flew, a sign of a good film."
