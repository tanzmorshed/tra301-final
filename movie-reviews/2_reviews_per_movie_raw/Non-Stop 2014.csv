","When I first saw previews for this I called it ""Taken Plane."" After seeing it, it is everything but that. Excellent script that keeps you guessing and trying to figure out ""who dun it."" Liam Neeson does a great job and keeps you rooting for him the entire film. He gets a great supporting cast as well. Top notch performance by Corey Stoll as the NYPD detective passenger on the plane as well. The only downside to this film was that when the film started it almost seemed like the first 2-4 minutes were cut and just dropped you right into the film. A little confusing but nothing extreme to take away from the rest of the film."
"statuskuo","7","175","214","3 March 2014"," Keeps You Guessing
","This surprised me. A thriller on a plane that has you thinking you know all the answers (because we're such expert movie watches), then flips it. Yes, it's a contrived subplot. And the reasoning behind this terrorist act is goofy, BUT...it is a lot of fun. It interweaves a really elaborate set-up that you have to focus on to understand.<br/><br/>Also, for people who think they're sophisticated in camera motion. Think about that space. The camera moves in (perceived) 360 degrees without a) seeing camera shadow b) camera angle is near impossible with the movements they had. This is visually sophistication that most won't see or care. But it adds a ton to the claustrophobia.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore is great, as always. Neeson is perfect for this role, but one has to wonder how this behemoth of a guy fits in a airplane bathroom."
"ezranelson98","8","124","159","12 March 2014"," Surprisingly entertaining
","I never was a huge fan of Liam Neeson's action flicks, but I went to see this because of the good reviews. This movie is a very suspenseful and a great ""Whodunnit"" movie. It it's share of action scenes, but it never went too over the top. Even if you don't like Liam Neeson, this movie is worth seeing and is a guaranteed good time. Lot's of twists and suspicious characters leave you guessing and most likely wrong. Lot's of on the edge-of- your-seat scenes because of how well it was made and has a silent and lonely feel to it which helps you understand everything going on. Overall, this movie is a great thriller without being packed full of action."
"zetes","7","184","243","6 March 2014"," Silly as Hell, but quite entertaining
","Absolutely ludicrous Liam Neeson thriller (which is a genre now), but, frankly, it's just a lot of fun. I found myself smiling and giggling at the silliness of it all, but damned if I wasn't enjoying myself the whole time. Neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly after his flight commences that, if a load of money isn't deposited into an untraceable bank account, a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes. The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess - or, alternatively, you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they don't pull out the old Liam-Neeson-has-multiple-personalities-and-is-doing-it-himself twist. The film is hilariously convoluted with plenty of plot holes. When the villain is revealed, they say ""You'd never believe how easy it all was!"" They are correct. I would never believe it. I still quite enjoyed watching it."
"OllieSuave-007","8","103","136","10 March 2014"," Non-stop thrills and suspense!
","This is an action-thriller starring Liam Neeson as U.S. Air Marshal Bill Marks who, while boarding a flight to London, receives text messages from an unknown assailant, threatening that if he doesn't transfer $150 million to an account, a fatality will occur on the plane every 20 minutes unless Marks complies with the money request.<br/><br/>The film starts off with some intrigue, showing Marks depressed, consuming alcohol and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers before he boards the plane, already giving the audience the impression that Marks is a disturbed person and making us eager to know what his background story is. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) sits next to Marks on the plane, whose background story is also a mystery until later on in the film, providing us with another interesting subplot.<br/><br/>However, the main plot and action come almost immediately after the plane takes to the air when Marks starts receiving the threatening text messages. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat and mouse as Marks attempt to find the perpetrator and, when the casualties start to mount, it becomes a thrilling roller-coaster ride.<br/><br/>The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. Highly recommended.<br/><br/>Grade B+"
"Taizpian","9","216","314","25 February 2014"," Great ""Edge-Of-Your-Seat"" Film
","I saw an advanced screening of this movie yesterday, and I was absolutely blown away. I had hoped it would be a fun thrill-ride, but I did not expect it to be as exciting and involved as it was.<br/><br/>My favorite part of this movie, was the fact that it takes a plot that is implausible, and makes it as plausible as possible. You can definitely tell that the writers did their research on air marshals, airplane mechanics, etc. There was not one moment in this film that I was bored, and it was filled to the brim with twists, and turns.<br/><br/>There definitely is a lot that went into this movie, and even though it'll have you thinking more deeply about the security of airlines, most of all it's just a really, really fun ride."

","When I first saw the trailer, I thought it would just be another generic action movie. However, I found myself to be enjoying the movie and was entertained.<br/><br/>Non-Stop stars Liam Neeson as air marshall Bill Marks. The journey starts out as any other until he gets a text from an unknown person which says that he will kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account.<br/><br/>As the movie progresses, the stakes get higher and things just keep getting worse for Liam Neeson's character. If you haven't watched the trailer, there is a twist which would have made some scenes much better. In my opinion, don't think they should have shown that in the trailer.<br/><br/>Along the way, there are some sweet action scenes and plenty of moments to keep you guessing. You will have to suspend a lot of disbelief though, some of the events that happened were timed so perfectly and seemed just lucky to even occur the way it did. <br/><br/>The final third of the movie, although very entertaining, felt a bit weaker than the rest of the movie. Mainly because of the reasons of the villains -didn't really like reason. Apart from that, I enjoyed the action, the story and the ending. Plenty of action to keep you entertained and a decent story."
"tavm","9","96","148","2 March 2014"," Non-Stop was one exciting plane thriller!
","Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend. We both were watching this for the first time and we both were thrilled by it. Liam Neeson plays someone taking a flight from London. The only other player we recognized was Julianne Moore and not much is learned about her during most of the narrative except she takes a lot of flights and was coming from a trying day. Oh, and she observes most of the action when Liam talks to the crew on board when the crises happens. Plenty of twists happen when trying to guess which passenger is responsible for some threatening comments on Neeson's tablet so that was a plus. In other words, it was riveting throughout! Really, all I'll say now is I and my friend highly recommend Non-Stop!"
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","3","55","82","15 March 2014"," Implausibility reigns supreme here,
","What could have been a fun throwback to disaster movies from the 1970s, about a bomb on a plane and a terrorist threat, is over complicated with its political subtexts and wholly unbelievable contrivances.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is good, as usual, as an Air Marshall who begins receiving text messages threatening to kill a passenger on board his midair flight (from NY to London) every 20 minutes, unless a huge ransom is paid to a bank account in Neeson's own character's name. The first death, at the hands of Neeson's character himself, was clever and well done, I thought. But the explanation later given for that death was ridiculous, and that's it for originality here, unless you call absurdly drilling a hole from the toilet to the cockpit originality.<br/><br/>One ludicrous twist after another follows, as nearly every stereotypical character in arm's length is turned into a red herring at some point. Julianne Moore is mostly there just to act suspiciously, and babble about her surgery, which is completely irrelevant to the plot.<br/><br/>The conclusion takes itself FAR too seriously, going from what should have been a fun action thriller off into a political message movie, by claiming the two men responsible for these actions were motivated by 9/11. But then the screenplay reverts to its illogical ways, as the two men responsible for this are going to ... wait for it, wait for it, parachute from the plane flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Then what? Will they swim to the UK? <br/><br/>Film tries to work as a mystery, but with so very many red herrings, startling coincidences, and plot holes, it falls flat."

","The alcoholic and discredited air marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is a former cop that still grieves the death of his eight year-old daughter that died of leukemia. Bill is assigned to a flight from New York to London and the passenger Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) sits on his side in the first-class. When the plane is crossing the Atlantic Ocean, Bill receives text messages telling him that one passenger will die every twenty minutes unless the TSA air flight company transfers 150 million dollars to an offshore account. Bill contacts his superior that does not believe in his words. Further they discover that the bank account is in the name of Bill. Now Bill has to find the terrorist with the support of Jen and the flight attendant Nancy (Michelle Dockery) only and soon he finds a bomb on board. But the TSA representative believes that Bill is the terrorist. Will he succeed in saving the passengers lives? <br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" is a non-stop action thriller with a simple but engaging story in a claustrophobic environment. The camera work is outstanding considering such narrow space and the performances are magnificent. The plot keeps the mystery to the very end and the viewers guessing who might be the terrorist. Liam Neeson and the gorgeous Julianne Moore are like wine, the older they are the better. If the procedure of putting a bomb in the rear of the airplane is for real, why not building a reinforced box in the location to protect the airplane structure? My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Sem Escalas"" (""Non-Stop"")"
"bob-the-movie-man","6","22","32","28 March 2014"," Popcorn nonsense - but entertaining popcorn nonsense
","There is something rather compelling about action films set on aircraft. The claustrophobic confinement and obvious dangers of guns, decompressions and - erm - gravity naturally add to the sense of peril. Examples of the genre are Air Force One, Passenger 57, United 93, Airport 77/79/etc. and (at the ridiculous end of the spectrum) Snakes On A Plane. Some films in this category try to mix the action with a mystery plot (Jodie Foster's Flightpath was a case in point), although after the real-life mystery of the Malaysian Airline Flight 370 jet in recent weeks no film drama could hope to compete. Non-Stop tries to join both of these sub- genres by wrapping a mystery into an action film. It largely fails in the former and partially succeeds in the latter.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, Non-Stop is arrant nonsense. Liam Neeson - the go-to action hero of the hour - plays Air Marshall Bill Marks: a chain-smoking alcoholic, with a tragic family past, who is the last person you would trust to wave a gun around on a flight. Bill Marks boards a London-bound 'Aqualantic' flight (REALLY? Would you REALLY want to link a transatlantic airline brand with water?). Mid-Atlantic Marks is sent messages on his secure Air Marshall network (clearly not THAT secure) from someone on the plane threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes until they are paid 150 million dollars into an offshore account. It emerges that Marks is either the terrorist himself (the account is in his name) or is being set up by someone to appear to be the terrorist. A chief suspect would appear to be one of Mark's fellow passengers in business class, played by Julianne Moore: someone living life to the full with a big scar on her chest and with nothing to lose. As the body count rises, questions arise as to who the terrorist is, why they are they doing it, how they are doing it, who will be murdered next and - most importantly - does any of this make any sense at all? Liam Neeson is in ""Taken"" mode and as personable and effective as always. Michelle Dockery (of ""Downton Abbey"") plays air stewardess Nancy, and the film is also notable for featuring Lupita Nyong'o as another of the stewardesses, before her breakout recognition in ""12 Years a Slave"" (one assumes that the Oscar judges voted before seeing this).<br/><br/>Whilst the plot was nonsense - leaving more open questions than answers - it was quite enjoyable nonsense, and I should add that my wife absolutely loved it (although it should also be pointed out that Air Force One is her favourite film!). I have to confess that I found the ending uproariously funny. No spoilers, but in a number of scenes the classic lines from ""Airplane!"" leapt unhindered into my head: specifically ""Auntie M - It's a Twister, It's a Twister""; ""I just want to say Good Luck. We're all counting on you"" and Robert Stack's post-crash speech to Ted Striker.<br/><br/>Popcorn fun - but not a classic.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review, please see more on bobmann447.wordpress.com, and sign up to 'Follow the Fad'.

","Non-Stop is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a talented cast.The films story was certainly an original one,and I though I think the final half of the movie is a disappointment,the movie is still a very exciting action and thriller from start to finish.Liam Neeson is without a doubt the best actor in this film,he really carries the rest of the cast and the movie certainly wouldn't be the same without him as the very likable lead,although Julianne Moore did deliver a great performance and none of the actors were bad.The reason why I was disappointed by the ending is because it seemed like there was going to be an amazing twist,but that never happened,nothing was very shocking which I did find to be a big disappointment.Non-Stop is a very enjoyable movie that I would recommend to fans of Liam Neeson,thrillers and actions.<br/><br/>On a plane headed to London,an air marshall must springs in to action after he receives text messages that someone will kill a passenger on the plane every twenty minutes unless the airline transfers $150 million in to an anonymous bank account."
"mangorick","1","72","134","6 March 2014"," Plot as thin as the air at 30,000 feet
","Terrible, headache-inducing film full of clichés and plot holes. For example, how did the masterminds know that the second air marshal would pull a gun on Bill and that Bill would have no choice but to kill him? Maybe the guy would've just broken down and cried, or maybe it would've taken 35 minutes instead of 20.<br/><br/>It's also just lazy film making. For instance, the passenger who appears to be Muslim WASN'T the terrorist after all! Wow, such inventive mis-direction totally blew me away. And he turned out be a doctor who HELPS people... Yawn (by the way, his profession sounds like someone who has a PhD, not an MD, but anyway...). <br/><br/>The co-pilot had to bring the plane down to 8,000 feet so the bomb could explode without de-pressurizing the cabin. But the jets would shoot down the plane if he did that because he would be endangering civilians. So why didn't the co-pilot just keep the plane flying over the open ocean, radio that that he was going to descend so a bomb could explode, and NOT RISK being shot down? Such a frustrating film to endure.<br/><br/>But there were many smaller issues, too. Such as in one scene we see the phone's screen says January, but when they land in Iceland it appears to be a comfortable 70 degrees out (the January average high temp. is 35 F)."
"ironhorse_iv","7","11","16","20 March 2014"," Non-Stop Suspense. Yes! Non-Stop Action. Not really. Still, it was a great thrill ride.
","Some people might get confused, as there was a Lifetime TV movie made in 2013 name 'Non-Stop', with similar concept where a man put everyone in terrible danger on an airplane. This movie is a little bit better than that. So watch out when trying to find this film. In plane sight, this 2014 film by Jaume Collet-Serra, might fall into that type of stupid action film on a plane, but surprising, this movie had a lot of twist and turns that make up majority of the film. The film had little to no action to it. At age 62, at the time of filming this. Liam Neeson can still kick butt, but gees. I really doubt, he can for long period of time. There is very little room for Liam Neeson to engage a person if his character really wanted to. So, if you're looking for something like 2008's Taken, it's not that movie. It reminds me more of 1978's Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express or a Hitchcock's film, you really can't tell who the murderer is in this film as everybody is made out to be suspects. The movie is about an broken down alcoholic U.S air marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who on a non-stop flight from New York to London, receive a text message on his secure phone stating that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account. Soon enough, people start to die, and Bill is the only one who can stop it. Movie was a bit turbulence when it's come down being plausible because it all happen in a plane, but once you find out who the murderer is, the film kinda make it look like it's possible. I wouldn't say, all the plot holes were sealed. There were a few unrealistic things that go through the film, like how people can't hear anything or going on. Example is the fight in the bathroom. That was pretty loud. Honestly, if you dissect the film, you find others far-fetch things that might be bothersome like why the Air Marshal Service would hire a drunk Cop? For the most part, it's pretty entertaining that it keep your attention enough, so you don't question that. You will have to suspend a lot of disbelief. The film does make a good statement on our post 9/11 fear of air travel, as the movie digs deep into the discussion if Air Marshall are really needed or not. Some people might get offended by how the film portrays some of the 9/11 victims and a US soldier as terrorists, but I have to say. It could happen. The movie isn't being political correct here. Even the Islamic doctor, Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally) could be the killer. The movie even have a disturbing scene that remind me of Sept. 11's Flight United 93 where the passenger fought back against the terrorist to regain the plane. The film also dig into how quickly the media is, to able to villainous a person without learning any solid facts about what is truly happening. The film makes us know, how depressed Marks is, hating his job and having a couple of run-ins with some passengers before he boards the plane. Liam Neeson really made this movie, good as you can see the stress in his film. The acting is alright from the supporting cast. They weren't so annoying like other films like this. Julianne Moore as Jen Summers who sat next to Marks on the plane was an interesting subplot, because she seem to display an inordinate amount of concern for him. I can do without the un-necessary romance in action film. Jen Summer is example of this. Then there was the air attendant Nancy (Michelle Dockery) who had access to every place on the airplane; could she be the killer? Could it be the non-existent Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o)? I almost forgot that Oscar Winner, Lupita was even in this movie. Could it, be the hot-headed New York cop Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll) as the killer? Corey Stoll is amazing actor. I love him in this movie. Maybe, it's the cell phone programmer, Zack White (Nate Parker) or the man, Bill Marks talk with before the flight, Tom Bowen (Scoot McNairy)? Maybe the killer is the other Air Marshall, not-trustworthy Jack Hammond (Anson Mount)? You just have to watch it to find out. The camera work was pretty good. It sophisticated in camera motion that get you in that claustrophobia feel. Still, I can do without the shaking cam. The CGI special effects are mediocre, at best. One thing, I did love is the floating cellphones text showing on the screen, whenever a character use a phone. I love how they even add broken cellphone text to show damage, and struggle. There are few elements that remind me of other flight disaster movies such as 1970's Airport series, 1990's Turbulence series or 1957's Zero Hour. Overall: I have taken everything you need to know about the movie coming in, without spoiling too much of it. In my opinion, it's worth watching. So go fly ahead and go see it."
"rooee","6","65","124","10 March 2014"," Non-sense
","Much of the tension in Non-Stop trades off the likability of its star, Liam Neeson. It's a conceit frequently used by Alfred Hitchcock, from Henry Fonda to Anthony Perkins. Jaume Collet-Serra's film doesn't mine the dark psychological depths of Hitch's best output, but it's a lean and sometimes amusingly mean thriller.<br/><br/>What starts as a high concept mid-90s straight-to-video plot – a passenger will be bumped off every 20 minutes unless Air Marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) arranges for $150m to be transferred to the perp's account – soon becomes a nail-biting, disbelief-suspending whodunit (or who's-doing-it). The film is elevated above the ordinary by Neeson's depiction of the boozy, grief-stricken Marks: there are moments when we truly share the passengers' distrust of the man apparently going mad in their midst.<br/><br/>Marks communicates with the hijacker via text message. Here, Collet-Serra comes up with a nifty way of presenting these conversations through graphics overlaid on the screen, negating the usual tension-killing cut to a tiny cellphone screen. Incidentally, the bad guy/gal must win the award for fastest thumbs in the English-speaking world.<br/><br/>Superior character actors like Linus Roache and Scoot McNairy provide decent support, although recent Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o is wasted as a gasping air stewardess. And is there any reason for Julianne Moore to be in this movie? Well, there's always a reason for Julianne Moore to be on the screen. But her character isn't really any more than an extra suspect and an excuse for some agonisingly cheesy and unconvincing flirtation. I guess one could argue she adds ""heart"" to the movie – except this is a movie which is most fun when it's at its most heartless.<br/><br/>The dialogue is lousy; the look is advert glossy; the CGI is poor; the performances are hugely variable; the action is brief and messy; the plot is preposterous (especially the final third). All in all, like Collet-Serra's and Neeson's previous outing, the Frantic-esque Unknown, this is an efficient and enjoyable thriller which will never be lauded as a classic, and never really attempts to make any sense, but further cements its star as the go-to guy for solid, ruffled, old school rough 'n' tumble."

","What a disaster. What a boring disaster. Finding a spider in my bed would have been more exciting than suffering through this sophomoric and predictable flick.

This movie has already made its fair share of money and that's all the studios are concerned with."
"SJinSeaTac","Null","41","75","2 March 2014"," A clunky and silly thriller
","I will admit that my hopes for this film were higher than normal. Being a fan of director Jaume Collet-Serra's work on ""Unknown"" and ""Orphan,"" I was surprised to find out how terrible this film really is. Let me define terrible:<br/><br/>Frustrating. Ridiculous. IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>The plot set up is really simple. Bill, a federal air marshal, boards a flight from New York to London. Three hours into the flight he starts to receive text messages from someone who purports to have hacked into the federal messaging database. This person claims to be on the plane and directs Bill to have $150 million deposited into a bank account or someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes. Off runs Liam trying to figure out who is messaging him, who he can trust, and is there a greater master plan afoot. <br/><br/>Sounds simple enough? Wrong. Collet-Serra is determined to throw everything including the kitchen sink at this movie where credulity is stretched past the breaking point. After the first death comes at the hands of Bill himself (solid plot twist, IMO), everyone else starts dying of anaphylactic shock. How? Well, the plot holes are big enough to fit an elephant into. <br/><br/>What is more frustrating is how obvious the plot holes are. For example, since when is the security of the pass code protected cockpit door so easily bypassed by poking a hole in the wall that is behind the bathroom paper towel dispenser? Yes really, I am not even joking. <br/><br/>Finally, when it is revealed whodunnit, you might as well just take your ball and go home, because the explanation, if you even want to call it an explanation, makes no sense. <br/><br/>**Read no further unless you, unlike me, desire to save yourself two hours of your life**<br/><br/>The writers seem to have lifted what I like to call the ""Scream"" complex for the film's conclusion. That's right, TWO people have conspired to do this. One is motivated by money, the other by madness. What madness?<br/><br/>9/11.<br/><br/>Yes, seriously. 9/11 did it. <br/><br/>After all of this planning and conniving (and putting us the audience through the misery of watching Liam and the cast run around the plane for two hours like a bunch of idiots who have been directed to look suspicious at all times while frequently making racist comments about each other), the crazy guy simply shoots his accomplice! <br/><br/>Really? After all of this planning together, you just shoot him? <br/><br/>Seriously?<br/><br/>After sitting through this mess of a film, with subplots involving drug smuggling, the token black guy, cop, and Muslim suspects, the shifty flight attendant that will remind you of far superior films (Flightplan) and dreadful but amusing (bad) ones (Turbulence), all I wanted was a hot shower and a hug- or the plane to crash at the 90 minute mark so this entire mess would just end already. <br/><br/>Even after all of this, Collet-Serra makes the cardinal sin of casting great actors and failing to use any of their talent. Julianne Moore, Linus Roache, Corey Stoll- even Lupita Nyong'o who is currently nominated for an Academy Award for ""12 Years a Slave""- figuratively, if not actually, are all wasted. Liam Neeson is playing another angry growling character that made him famous in ""Taken,"" which apparently has taken the place of what used to be a great talent that was only comparable to that of Daniel-Day Lewis. <br/><br/>Overly long and frustrating, ""Non-stop"" will leave major action fans and other mouth breathers drooling for more. But if you are like me and you are looking for logic, you won't find it here. <br/><br/>My suggestion is that you take up drinking like Moore does through most of this film if you are in fact tempted to spend $9.00 on seeing it. She must have realized halfway through production the direction this film was headed toward and asked Collet-Serra if drinking scotch was something her character would be motivated to do. I certainly would have."

","Liam, what were you thinking? There HAVE to be better scripts out there. Don't waste your immense talent on lightweight scripts and directors like this. This film was so bad, it is hard to know where to start. How about the Air Marshal Service hiring a drunk cop fired from a major police force? Never gonna happen. How about there somehow magically appearing a hole from the lavatory to the secured cockpit? And the air pressure being lower in the cockpit than the cabin -- which is the opposite of the real world. How about the copilot assuring the air marshal he would not unlock the cockpit door for the rest of the flight then, 10 seconds later is seen in the doorway talking to a flight attendant. How about bad guys intending to parachute from an airliner with apparently no way to do so? How about the bad guys counting on Liam Neeson's character killing another air marshal in a fight -- and, for that matter, getting into the fight -- despite the fact that supposedly Liam's character is a drunk and both men are armed? And then there are the terrible special effects. Did they think we would buy a blue screen with a model airplane behind the actors. (Either that or really weak CGI). Come on. And the acting. Oh,the acting. Sometimes they cut away from the face of a character, dub in a line, then cut back to the face. Pretty transparent cover-up of terrible acting and directing. And the actor supposedly flying the plane looked like he was playing with his kid's toy. To reduce power you pull, not push the lever, for example. No wonder he crashes an apparently flyable plane (even the gear came down and all the controls worked), and he was already in the flare to land. Beyond which, it was getting pretty boring about an hour into it. The absurd and obvious mis-directions throughout were not only obvious, they were like yelling ""Hey, this guy looks like a bad guy. I'll bet it's him."" The script would have read better if it was written as a thriller, not a mystery. Tell us who the bad guy is and then the audience can yell ""Look out! He's behind you."" Instead we were yelling, ""Give me a break. This is ridiculous already."" This film would be a good candidate for the next iteration of Mystery Science 3000 so at least we can get a laugh at the awesome awfulness of it all."

No matter that the Irish actor is now at a ripe old age of 61, he is perfectly cast as the grizzled United States air marshal Bill Marks, a recovering alcoholic grappling with some demons from his past that only become clearer much later into the film.<br/><br/>First-time screenwriters John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle send Neeson's Federal agent on a transatlantic flight from New York to London, where a seemingly uneventful night on the job quickly becomes something else when he receives a series of text messages warning that a passenger will be killed every 20 mins unless he arranges for $150 million to be transferred to a bank account within that time. Needless to say, the first deadline does expire and then another and then another, but the clues all point back to Bill himself, casting suspicion on the very individual we so easily assume to be the one who saves the day.<br/><br/>For Bill (and the rest of us who continue to believe that he is just being set up), there are plenty of possible suspects on board. Could it be Bill's chatty seat mate Jen (Julianne Moore) who seems to display an inordinate amount of concern for him? Could it be either one of the air hostesses air hostesses Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and/or Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o)? Could it be the co-pilot (Jason Butler Harner) who's never really trusted Bill? Could it be a hot-headed New York cop (Corey Stoll)? Or how about the thirty-something bespectacled dude (Scoot McNairy) who had tried to make small talk with Bill prior to the flight?<br/><br/>But if there's one thing that we know, it's that it cannot be the most obvious one of them all, a Muslim doctor Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally) whom Bill regularly relies on to check the pulses and confirm the deaths of his victims. Tapping on our post-9/11 paranoia of airplanes, Serra and his screenwriters concoct a revolving door of possible stereotypical culprits that the smart viewer hopes that the film is smarter than to eventually pin blame on (rest assured, the film does eventually offer this small reassurance). That said, you should probably be prepared to be less than blown away with the revelation at the end, which strains to find motive for the crime but comes out falling short.<br/><br/>Is it any surprise that credibility isn't exactly the movie's strong suite? Indeed, if you're going to be scrutinising the proceedings for implausibilities, you might as well not even board this flight. A slightly more than moderate suspension of disbelief is necessary to fully enjoy the disposable B-grade thrills here, which among other things, assumes that there is still live broadcast TV coverage while the plane is travelling over international air space. On his part, Serra rewards those willing to check their disbelief at the boarding gate with brisk pacing designed to keep you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.<br/><br/>And you know what? He does succeed, to a large extent, and may we add, to a far greater extent that we had expected. Encouraging its viewer to play detective alongside Bill with what limited clues presented on screen, Serra further tightens the noose by making full use of the enclosed environment to induce a sense of claustrophobic danger. Nowhere is this more apparent than a full-on mano-a-mano brawl that takes place within the tight confines of the bathroom, where Neeson once again showing off his prowess at close-quarters grappling that was a trademark of his 'Taken' movies.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, those expecting the same level of excitement from these fight scenes will probably be disappointed. No thanks to the setting, there is very little room for Neeson to engage in many of these, and whether by artistic choice or spatial limitations, the photography remains too much in close-up mode. And yet Neeson remains undoubtedly the tough-guy hero of the movie first by his imposing physicality, but also more importantly by his thespian muscles that lend his tortured character plenty of gravitas despite some brutally stiff dialogue at the more supposedly poignant moments.<br/><br/>It is also Neeson who keeps the movie from flying off the rails even though it does get increasingly ludicrous in the third act on its way to an explosive finale. No surprises that there is a bomb on board, it does detonate mid-flight, and it does end with an emergency landing made under the most dire of circumstances that pretty much obliterates the plane from ever flying again - truth be told, it's been a while since we've seen a similar high-altitude set thriller on the big screen that its clichés no longer feel so. It's no 'Taken' that's for sure, but it packs a fair share of solid gripping thrills in between an Agatha Christie mystery that makes it perfectly watchable for those in need of an action fix."

","Liam Neeson is an air marshal who gets framed for a hijacking while the plane is over the Atlantic. Should be a nice little actioneer, especially what with Liam coming off the two ""Taken"" movies. In reality, we're treated to a slow-poke ""whodunit"" that never really gets anywhere. Julianne Moore is a snooze, and the assorted collection of actors never get a chance to develop (for a fantastic example of how to develop a character in a flash, see Denzel Washington's ""Flight"").<br/><br/>Worst of all, the movie never sticks to any one genre. It's an action flick, no, it's a mystery, no, it's a feel-good movie, no, it's a political thriller (main character's Irish heritage is mentioned (why???) and many a time the lonely token Muslim is presented as the potential thorn in everyone's side).<br/><br/>Don't waste your money on this. And, Neeson needs to find better scripts."
"natashabowiepinky","7","19","33","8 March 2014"," 'Non-Stop ' is right...
","Some may accuse Liam Neeson of being typecast, as YET AGAIN he stars in a violent action film... but this was quite different from the Taken movies. For a start, he has to save a whole plane full of people, rather than various family members. He doesn't take down foe after foe without respite either... he must play the sleuth a bit as well.... working his way down a list of suspects until he finds the one(s) responsible for the imminent threat.<br/><br/>The way the plot tosses up some hints, only to change direction at a moment's notice works well in keeping the nerves a-jangling. And the fact everyone thinks HE'S the terrorist adds a bit of extra spice, already adding to a thoroughly absorbing experience. When we eventually do find out who is behind the oh-so-intricate plan, it is very clever in the unveiling, and we don't feel a bit cheated.<br/><br/>My only real complaint is the brief fight scenes are so speedily edited that I found it hard to see what was going on, though the sound effects made it more than clear. Perhaps a bit more clarity next time...? That aside, it's nice to watch a thriller which keeps the brain occupied rather than just going for the testosterone factor, and as long as Liam Neeson keeps churning out genre films of this quality, who cares if he's become pigeonholed? 7/10"

","Nail-biting and astounding thriller stunningly directed by the Spanish director Jaume Collet -Serra . Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .<br/><br/>This exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation & arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4"" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue . Liam Neeson is top-notch as a drunken and discredited air marshal ; Liam Neeson has propelled many an action thriller to big box office numbers, as Unknown , Taken 2 and this Non-stop . Accompany efficiently to starring two nice actresses as Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery . There are many suspects , all support cast formed by good secondaries such as Scoot McNairy , Corey Stoll , Jon Abrahams , Nate Parker , Jason Butler , Linus Roache , Shea Whigham , Anson Mount and Lupita Nyong'o who in her next film would win an Academy Award .<br/><br/>Colorful cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano using Steadicam and with majority locations from plane interior . The musician John Ottman creates a stirring , rousing soundtrack fitting to frenetic action . Lavishly produced including spectacular scenes by the successful American producer Joel Silver . The flick was compellingly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra . Collet is an expert director of terror movies as ¨Orphan¨, ¨House of wax¨ and for TV , ¨The river¨ , and of course his greatest hit was ¨Unknown¨ also with Liam Neeson and similar artistic team as cameraman Flavio Laviano , musician John Ottman and producer Joel Silver . Rating : Better than average, well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans ."

","*** This review may contain SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>⇓ ⇓ ⇓ ⇓ ⇓<br/><br/>If you are a 'hate America first' type of person, then this is the film for you. At it's root, the film is yet another attempt to implant the mantra of progressive elitists into the brain pan of the audience. It is a celluloid rant favoring false Hollywood ideals. <br/><br/>As far as production values, the film is decently acted, fairly well crafted, with a story line that will initially engage you(that's how they suck you in). First, they get you involved into the story and characters. When they've got you caring and focused on the people and the surrounding events, that is when they start to slip in the messaging, hoping that it will subliminally slip under your cognitive radar. This familiar Hollywood tactic goes terribly wrong this time. Elements are introduced that will at first puzzle the audience, then annoy them. By the final act, you may begin to feel genuine anger toward the filmmakers for their no-so-subtle anti-American digs.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston famously said that ""Political correctness is tyranny with manners"". You may rest assured that 'Non-Stop' is a movie chock-full of that form of tyranny. By the end of it's 100 minute run time, you will have been told how you should feel about a great many things. Things that have nothing to do with an action film. The 'action' is just a thin coat of icing over a multi-layered cake of Hollywood's political self-righteousness. If that is the type meal you commonly enjoy, then by all means, shell out your twelve bucks and go and get your fill."

","I am a big fan of the Liam Neeson and have become an even bigger fan of his slap-fu action films over the last 5-6 years starting with Taken, A-Team, The Grey, even Unknown was decent...Liam could do no wrong! So I thought.<br/><br/>First there was the absolutely awful Battleship - terrible idea, craptastic script, complete Peter Berg fumble. Huge budget, lost a ton of money and should have just never been made. But hey, it happens, everyone makes a mistake.<br/><br/>Then oh thank God, they're making a sequel to Taken, can't go wrong! Oh wait...Oops. All things that made Taken awesome where bastardized into this pathetic effort at a sequel that disappointed fans of the first film to no end. Personally I just try to forget this film ever happened.<br/><br/>And now we have Non-Stop...if you thought Bryan Mills using hand grenades while running across rooftops of Istanbul to find his kidnapped daughter wasn't stupid enough, well then we got just the plot for you! Non-Stop is a non-stop roller-coaster of ridiculousness from terrible campy lines to bad acting by good actors (guilty parties include Liam, Julianne Moore & Scoot McNairy) to the over-the-top unbelievable plot. The only saving grace of this film is Liam's ability to dominate every adversary in his path in the same fantastic fighting method (I described earlier as ""slap-fu"") he's employed over this last 5-6 year span of action films.<br/><br/>If you expect Non-Stop to be a reboot of Bryan Mills version 1.0 (Taken) just stop, you'll be reminded that version 2.0 (Taken 2) did happen and immediate become sad. I hinge my hopes on Liam coming out of the action-slump soon as I happen to see that Taken 3 pops up on his IMDb profile as ""announced"" for 2015...please be good, please be good!"

","'Non-Stop' did have potential. With an intriguing premise, and great actors like Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, what could go wrong? Sadly, while 'Non-Stop' did do some things right it also did a lot of things wrong as well. One of those films where a good but not great film turned into a mediocre and disappointingly uneven one in the last third.<br/><br/>The film does look great, the cinematography is slick and often adds to the atmosphere created, the lighting is moody and neither garish or drab, the special effects are good and don't overload the film in quantity and the confined location is well-chosen and creates a genuine sense of claustrophobia, a feeling maintained for two thirds of the film. The score is also suitably moody, not sounding too obvious or manipulative.<br/><br/>Neeson is a very strong, commanding and appropriately stoic presence, and doesn't lag too much at all in the more action-oriented parts. 'Non-Stop' is atmospherically directed too, and the film is quite good and watchable for two thirds of the duration, the pace takes its time but didn't feel too draggy and there was plenty of suspense and tension with great use of misdirection.<br/><br/>However, the rest of the cast don't make much of an impression. Moore does do her best and she isn't bad but her character didn't feel needed to the story and added little. Chemistry with Neeson was bland. Of the supporting cast, the best performance came from Linus Roache, but his role is not big enough to shine properly. The rest consist of either talented actors who have nothing to do (Michelle Dockery and especially the completely wasted Lupita Nyong'o) or those who overplay or underplay (didn't buy the villains' performances for a second).<br/><br/>'Non-Stop' is most let down by a mess of a last third. Not that the film was perfect up to then, because it wasn't, with a less than stellar supporting cast, the film lacking some momentum in the second half onwards and a patchy script. The last third really underwhelms in nearly every way, it is here where the film particularly loses momentum, the dialogue is particularly hammy (that speech in particular) and it goes overboard in implausibility and lack of credibility, while the final solution is underdeveloped, overplayed and incoherently convoluted.<br/><br/>All in all, promising start and not bad for two thirds of it but the last third really let things down. 5/10 Bethany Cox"
"Shopaholic35","6","4","5","21 February 2015"," Totally unrealistic yet pretty good.
","Geez this movie is suspenseful. Who would have thought that a movie set solely on a plane could be so entertaining. It keeps you guessing the whole way as to who dunnit. Honestly the one person who is behaving strangely is Liam Neeson's character. He is a seriously angry man and should not be allowed to have a gun or a badge. The whole time you cannot help but think how unrealistic it all is. Normal people would never get into this situation.<br/><br/>Aside from the ridiculousness of the whole concept I'm not sure the ending needed to be so deep and political. I wish it stayed totally action and didn't try to be all deep and intellectual. Luckily that was a very small part of the movie. Overall though pretty good."

The one thing that did look good where those first class seats on the plane that go down to a bed, because 30 minutes into this film that's where i wanted to be. I honestly don't see why this film could garner such praise.<br/><br/>It is lifeless and with absolute common sense, i knew exactly who the killer was. So the element of surprise was basically non-existent. The whole thing drags in, every now and then trying its very best to inject some life into a film that had been in a coma from the first minute. In typical Neeson-esque fashion, the ridiculousness goes to the extreme and then there is ""The Yawn"". Yes, if there where an academy award for most blatantly fake yawn, then Liam Neeson would win hands down. <br/><br/>Cheesy one liners, preposterous acting, a soul-less plot and i type this with confidence when i say you would get more suspense by sitting at home and playing a game of Cluedo or Guess Who?"

"matthewssilverhammer","1","26","52","8 March 2014"," Non-Stop Tedium
","2014, what are you doing to me?! I normally feel like a positive person, but you have given very little to get excited about at the movies. Unfortunately Liam Neeson's latest uber-serious thriller, Non-Stop, is the next in line of bad action movies this year. It's a shame, because I was excited about this one. I love a good airplane nail-biter (Red Eye, United 93, the plane sequence in World War Z), but no one seems to be trying very hard here and it shows. Non-Stop is a soap-opera level suspense film about a troubled air marshal aboard a hijacked plane, in which he is a suspect. As you can see, the guys making this film aren't terribly interested in making a unique movie, but even worse they don't make an intriguing one. Every ""twist"" is seen from a mile away with the movie becoming abrasively preachy towards the end. The obnoxious style makes it feels like a film student just learned how to use his after-effects computer program. The music is over-bearing, not allowing the story to do any of the emotional weightlifting. If young guys made this movie, then it's forgivable to have these frantic choices; otherwise these decisions just come off as ineffective and pretentious. There is a decent action scene or two here and there, and some of the mystery works, but the cheap thrills rarely pay off emotionally and are too steeped in convolutedness to really work. The only thing ""non-stop"" here is the tedium. If you must see an action movie in theatres this week, see ""Robocop"", but skip this."

","Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey). Sounded like a great start to a movie; and Liam in another suspense/action movie?....a no-brainer one would think. I went to the movie with great confidence that I'd invested well in my evening's entertainment. NOT! Turned out to be a short, cheaply made and poorly written contract film that apparently offers not so much a fast-paced action thriller but more of a fast-paced cameo clipping for backstage stars needing some camera time for SAG benefit reasons. Not to mention it was just more of the same Hollywood liberal influence over the writing that culminated in an implausible ending that supports the completely debunked and disreputable 9/11 Truther mentality and flips realities to once again give hero status to America's enemies (radical muslims) and portrays American's as hate-filled, violent and vengeful war mongers. I no longer feel shame for these sorts of films since the reality is that many of our films are funded and produced by international groups underwritten by many Anti-American and Muslim corporations. Money talks and it makes easy prey of even Brand name actors looking for an easy payday regardless the principles and self-respecting standards they must toss out the window to earn it; but then, they are just actors...puppets. I do however feel ashamed for the screenwriters, writers and editors who suspend their reason and sensibilities for the low-rent writing and editing of these garbage films. This film is on your resume forever people, no matter what you write in the future to try to clean yourselves of it. While I am totally against the idea of any kind of book burning, I would be in favor of gathering up this movie (once released in DVD)and throwing a match to the lot of it. #Non-StopStinks#Non-StopLies"
"marcinsmok","3","12","21","28 July 2014"," An uninspiring, badly written mess of a movie
","Usually, when I see a bad movie that had good reviews, I keep quiet and seek for reviewers who had similar to mine experience after watching a given title, just to confirm I wasn't alone thinking that title sucked. However, Hollywood keeps pushing these dumbed-down plots in order to get to wider audiences and I need to shout out my disapproval to such strategies. In case you don't have time and energy to read the whole review, here's what you can expect from ""Non-stop""- a thriller taking place in one location (a passenger jet flying from New York to London) with passable story being raped by numerous plot holes, bad acting and characters you don't care about. Here's a list of things that ruined the film for me:<br/><br/>-right before take-off, we meet a kaleidoscope of Hollywood cliché characters that you've seen in so many other bad movies- a black guy who dresses like a human Christmass tree and tries to be a douche by refusing to follow orders from an Air Marshall (that is before Liam Nesson's intentions are actually questionable, a Muslim guy in religious outfit that everyone looks at like he was carrying a bomb (which turns out to be the most helpful person on a plane and a know-it-all doctor), a neurotic woman that desperately needs to tell her whole life story to the person sitting next to her, a man with rapist glasses that has "" I am a psychopath"" written on his forehead, an uninformed, disposable flight attendant who doesn't know how to behave in emergency situations (according to the script writer, airlines only train their personnel on how to pour drinks and smile like idiots), a NYPD cop who has a fight with main protagonist only to be his best friend at the end of movie and finally the main character played by Liam Neeson, which must be the biggest joke of them all- an emotionally unstable alcoholic with highly questionable methods of dealing with security threads... <br/><br/>-an idea that a Federal Air Marshall carrying a ridiculously cliché black briefcase can board a plane without any screening at the airport is just plain dumb- does the script writer think TSA would allow for such a security hole- everyone, including the pilot, flight attendants, Air Marshall pass through clearance before boarding a plane (please correct me if there is a chance I might be wrong) <br/><br/>-when Liam Neeson asks one fellow for help breaching a federal secure phone line to send a bugged MMS and the guy manages to do it in just 8 minutes or so, DOESN'T IT RING A BELL, Air Marshall???? Maybe, just maybe, he is the one sending these messages in the first place, or at least is helping someone else do that. Damn, do directors really think everyone going to the movies these days are complete morons?? -when the two Air Marshall officers meet in the bathroom, wouldn't you think they could work something out rather than trying to kill each other right away (by the way, the bad guy has a perfect sense of timing, what if they fought 5 minutes longer, he would text them it's overtime???)<br/><br/>-like I mentioned before, Liam Neeson character is an alcoholic with a history of violence (we learn that at some point in the movie) and horrific past (how did he get a job as an Air Marshall in the first place) and what is even funnier, both pilots and one flight attendant knows about his problems, but not only refuse to report this obvious security issue but also listen to whatever he says in questionable situations)<br/><br/>-the thing that grinds my gears the most was when Liam finds out a bomb stacked in what appears to be a 10 pound cocaine bag. A bomb that happens to have, you guessed it, a glowing red display counting down time to explosion. I've seen it so many times and I still cannot believe anyone buys this bullshit- why would a terrorist ever use a time-bomb when he can detonate it remotely (he has skills to breach a secure line but he can detonate the bomb using a cellphone?). There is even a scene where you can clearly see a cellphone taped to the bomb- but no, the bad guy choose a timer set to just the right amount of time for a hero to come up with a plan. And it is all in a clear acrylic box so everyone can take a close look on how the bomb has been put together. Pleeeeease!!!<br/><br/><ul><li>hijacked plane's pilot receives a direct order from British military to keep the altitude but instead listens to an alcoholic Air Marshall, threatening lives of everyone on the plane</li></ul><br/><br/>-I am not an aviation expert, but if a commercial plane can make a clean landing with a huge freaking hole in the rear, please tell me because I am clearly missing something <br/><br/>-the last scene is hilarious- check how everyone sliding down the emergency slide cross their hands just like in drawings on the plane safety card. Not only you would see a wide smear of feces on that slide from people who almost died just seconds earlier, but also wouldn't you be like ""Screw you and your hand crossing protocol, let me get off this damn plane NOW!"" <br/><br/>-when you learn hijackers motives at the end of this painful experience they call a thriller, your jaw will drop to the floor, that's how ridiculously stupid these motives are <br/><br/>I could go on and on, but the point is, ""Non-stop"" represents a category of films I call dumb,uninspiring mess offering nothing but a feel of being viewed (by producers and directors alike) as a mindless consumer that would not question the stupidity being exposed to at the screen."
"Likes_Ninjas90","3","19","37","25 February 2014"," The director's mistake is wallowing in Liam Neeson's self-seriousness
","Cinema can reflect the historical emotions and political temperament of a country. The characters Liam Neeson chooses to play embody the post 9/11 angst and the impulsive right wing rhetoric of violence and retribution. These were the grounds for which America went to war in both Iraq and Afghanistan. It is why Muslims and Arabs were racially vilified in America. Throughout the history of cinema the United States has used the medium to channel its fears of foreign threats from Indians, Nazis, Soviets, Arabs and Asia. But for how long should films continue to channel the same fears and terrors? 9/11 was thirteen years ago and yet action films are still being made to reinvigorate racial and religious agendas and to deliberately instill fear over national security and the American way of life. How was a film like Olympus Has Fallen from last year, where Asian suicide bombers attacked the White House, allowed to be made with such vicious racial hatred? <br/><br/>It's a mystery as to why Liam Neeson wants any part of this. With Taken, Taken 2, Unknown, The Grey he has been typecast to play square jawed, indestructible American characters that are indisputably good, endlessly resourceful and ultimately dull. I find the Taken films most problematic, where he plays a former CIA agent. He has on two occasions saved his family from Albanian terrorists by hunting, torturing and murdering them. Why is this once serious actor interested in this level of fascism and barbaric xenophobia? He is all too willing to embody a character that represents blind, righteous vengeance in the name of quaint family values. His film choices are about personal therapy as much as political rhetoric. In 2009, a year after making the first Taken film, Liam Neeson's wife Natasha Richardson died in a skiing accident. Many of the films he has chosen since then involve his family being in danger or in the case of The Grey, he is grieving for his wife. <br/><br/>Reteaming with Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of Unknown, Liam Neeson is glum and depressed again in Non-Stop. The film thankfully sidesteps racial vilification but this is still an ode to 9/11 paranoia, which makes the story seem tardy. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an air marshal who is an alcoholic and has a tragic domestic history that has once again left him in mourning. On board a flight, he is sent a text message from an anonymous source telling him that they are going to kill someone every twenty minutes until a large sum of money is transferred into a bank account. The film is a mystery, a ""who done it"", like Cluedo with handguns. Is it the woman (played by Julianne Moore) he's just met, his fellow air marshal or one of the other passengers? As Bill struggles to find who the murderer is his superiors think that he has gone off the rails because of his alcoholism, leaving himself as a suspect. <br/><br/>The director's mistake is wallowing in Liam Neeson's self-seriousness. The film is colourless in every way. It is photographed in drab tones and his lead actor's performance is as predictably bleak as it was in Taken and now verges of self-parody. Bill is an alcoholic fighting machine, who can kill someone in an aeroplane toilet without blinking. It's not all dour though. There are laughs in the film but they're not intentional. The film might have worked with a different actor. The casting sabotages potential ideas in the script by the film's three novice screenwriters. The passengers grow more agitated by Bill's erratic behaviour and manhandling and it is suggested that he is attempting to steal the money for himself. But these are only red herrings. With Liam Neeson there is a numbing inevitability about how these threads will resolve themselves. The film is all setup and no payoff when we know it will resort to shootouts, knife fights and eye- rolling plot devices (it ticks). It's increasingly stupid, implausible and full of holes and especially disinterested in physics, realism and human reactions. The film is a tribute to heroes of American safety, those who acted bravely during 9/11, but it trivialises the fears that Americans still have by turning towards improbable action clichés and cartoon violence. What benefit is that to anyone?"

","Liam Neeson is a talented actor who has been known to give his characters an additional boost. So it was with this film, his character was down to earth with his complications, which was a big plus for the film.<br/><br/>However, while the thriller part of the film lasted for approximately 2/3 of the film and its plot was rather good, there were a few holes in the plot that caused it to be 7/10 thriller.<br/><br/>The real problem is with the way the film progressed towards the end. It recycled all the bad clichés of action films and in fact ruined the film. Any sort of realism that had ruled the thriller part of the film was thrown into the garbage bin. Quite frankly, it felt as if screenwriter got fired and was replaced by someone whose task was to copy ideas from popular action films. As a result the remaining plot started to resemble Swiss cheese (holes in every direction) and the role of the main character could have been played by Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, Dolph Lundgren or any of the other action stars who cannot act.<br/><br/>In that respect I left the theater A) laughing at the stupidity of the plot B) disappointed at the waste of money/time."

"willcundallreview","4","2","2","10 December 2015"," A poor attempt at thrilling
","Liam Neeson has single handily created a new career path for ageing actors to go into action movies. Non-Stop is a kind of action thriller but with a mystery thrown in there too, it can't quite make it's mind up which of the three it truly wants to be though. It all revolves around an air marshal (Neeson) who is on a routine flight from New York to London; the flight soon turns ugly though. The story is basically about a mysterious passenger threatening to kill other passengers unless they get the money they want, if not then someone will go every 20 minutes. Of course Liam Neeson's character isn't going to just take his seat and watch as everyone dies, no he is going to go kind of crazy and try to save everyone but also find out who is behind this sinister plot.<br/><br/>The film for me is a poor one, easy to watch yes but lacks in any decent substance, you certainly can turn your brain off for over 100 minutes though. The movie tries to be smart and that is where it fails, it tries to thrill and also fails and although the quest to finding who is behind the plot is exciting, it never quite is matched by anything else. Liam Neeson goes full on with the action in the style most recently some have become accustomed too, it never goes over the top and that I can respect it for but the plot is no great one. I very much disliked the ending which is so sort of stupid even that it brings this from being a pretty mediocre film to being just plain poor and below-par.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is actually not bad in his role, he kind of mumbles a lot and isn't given the best lines it has to be said but nevertheless the action scenes he does are well choreographed and done well from Neeson himself too. Julianne Moore makes a random appearance as a fellow passenger and is the person sitting next to Neeson as the plot unfolds so of course she is dragged into the story too. The most random appearances have to go to Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o who just seem to dawdle an awful lot and really didn't even need to be in the plot; in fact most characters are pointless in this.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra directs and he doesn't do much to make this good, you know the script isn't half bad in terms of how the story plays out but Collet-Serra doesn't bring the story to life enough and it ends up too dull in certain ways. The thrilling parts of the movie (the thrills that are good that is) are usually scenes that contain the score from John Ottman who does a good job of at least trying to make us pumped up or want to know more about the mystery, the film can never quite grab you enough to really make you interested though so you're left kind of hanging as the ending comes up.<br/><br/>Overall a pretty dire movie actually, it's nowhere near awful of course and I would even recommend it to those who enjoy a good if not basic thrill. Fans of Liam Neeson you may also enjoy this, if I had to recommend one of Neeson's recent travels into action movies this would not be the one I would say although moments of this can show you that Neeson really can fight pretty well on the big screen."
"A_Different_Drummer","Null","11","20","3 March 2014"," One of the worst movies ... EVER
","The good news? At 62 Neeson is likely the oldest Hollywood action hero who has not retired at least once and then made a comeback. And in spite of the mess that has come to be known as Taken 2, Neeson is astonishingly still basking in the glow of Taken 1 (which was an exceptionally well-done film and -- spoiler -- if you have not seen it, don't even bother finishing this review, go get a copy and see for yourself what it looks like when Neeson is at his best). As for NON-STOP, it is very likely one of the worst films of all time, and an embarrassment to both the actors and the audience. First, it is immediately obvious that his production was greenlighted on the basis of being ""hi concept, low cost"" which (most viewers don't know this) is really the Holy Grail of Tinseltown film making. The ""packager"" who put this deal together no doubt punched up the idea of a ""Hitchcock style"" thriller where the Air Marshall on an overseas red-eye doesn't know who is texting him with threats, or how they are so successfully ""manipulating"" his actions. That same packager (trust me) also emphasized how cheap the film would be to make, once you covered the two (and only) recognizable stars. ""Hey Wally, like the whole thing takes place inside a plane. Once we create the main set, which is a one-time cost, we can shoot the rest of the film in a parking lot behind a Wal-Mart, and save a bundle on production costs. We'll be into profit on the pre-sales alone."" And they probably were. But that does not help or provide solace to the hapless viewers who are going to be expecting some actual entertainment from this production and will instead discover a monotonous, boring, claustrophobic, lifeless film with no character development, no audience connection, no sympathetic characters, no suspense that is not either awkward or forced, -- and no relief from any of the above until the plane lands or the film ends, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>** A final note on the relationship between film and social gestalt -- to even consider making a film like this at a time when society's love affair with plane travel has plainly reversed into a near-phobia, shows an astonishing lack of empathy (and common sense) by the producers. Seriously. This film should come with an airsickness bag."

","I liked this film a lot! I thought it was interesting and I found the film very involving.I don't know what the critics were expecting when they saw this film were they expecting some big Action epic?. If so then it's no wonder they didn't like the film. For those who don't know this film is a mystery thriller NOT an Action film so don't expect to see lots of action or you will be disappointed. The film plays out as a whodunit mystery only on a plain. Since the whole film is based on a plain the actors are limited to what they can do so if you see the film don't complain about the lack of Action. The film has a good story and it kept me interested and intrigued. Liam Nesson plays an air marshal and he befriends a women on the plain Julian Moore who is sitting next to him and later in the film Liam starts receiving text messages from someone and the person starts toying with him then the person threatens to kill someone on the plain every twenty minutes unless one hundred and fifty million dollars is transferred into his off shore bank account. Liam Nesson takes no crap from this anonymous individual and what I liked about his character is that he's never the victim in the film he always fights and he never gives up even when the odds are stacked against him. At first Liam tries to keep things quite because he doesn't want to panic anyone on the plain but he soon asks for help from one of the flight attendants that he trusts along with Juliane Moore and he tells them about the threatening messages and they help him to find who's sending them. <br/><br/>Even though the film lacks action it still kept me watching because I enjoyed the mystery and the suspense and I thought it was very well done and Liam Nessons acting was very good and I thought he was very believable in his role as the air marshal. Liams character seems somewhat troubled in the film but at the same time he had a lot of courage and determination to find the person that was threatening people.the film also has some good ideas that I liked and hadn't seen before. Now is Non stop a great film no and does the film have problems yes,there are things that happen in the film that may come across as silly or unbelievable but those things didn't bother me much because I was entertained by the movie and the story interested me,I guess I just like these kind of stories. The film does have action but the main action kicks in during the last twenty minutes of the movie when Liam finds out who the culprit is but everything before that is suspense and mystery,so if people are fans of mystery films they will probably like this film because I thought the mystery was done very well and I never guessed who the culprit was until near the end because there were some good red hearings in the story and it really makes you think and I liked that about this film. The performances were good from everyone and Liam was great in the movie and I found his character likable and strong and I hope he does more films like this one.this is one of his best films and if you like mystery's Then I Highly recommend the film."

","The good thing with action movies is that I am not expecting too much. My curiosity was adequately titillated, less than for Snakes on a Plane, but Non-Stop is definitely not in the 'tongue in cheek' category. On the one hand Liam Neeson is really good at being dead serious for 100min and on the other hand straight all thrills/no pun action is a difficult plane to land.<br/><br/>The buildup is really good, you fasten your seat-belt and get into the story smooth and nice. But it is a really long stretch for your average suspension of disbelief. And Liam Neeson's character gradually loses its aura once we get the full swing from his heavy back-story to the clear situation in the plane. He is travelling business class and should really concentrate on suspects monitoring him here. Instead we get a man on the loose that is more a pawn in a malicious plan than the guy in charge.<br/><br/>As an action movie it is not quite satisfying because we are kept wondering where the threat is coming from for too long, and we don't even want to believe in the various paranoid bursts. When the hijacker comes forward there only remains space for full throttle action, or as they say in the cockpit apply TOGA power: Take-off/Go Around. So we go around with a lame exposition of the hijacker's motive before routine action brings it all to a close.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch a simple and effective action movie but Non-Stop only exists thanks to Liam Neeson (and Julianne Moore). Suspense and action are really poor and there is not real effort to make it consistent. Unfortunately it is more about the viewer being hijacked. I will check Unknown though for it can only be slightly better."

","Hack director Jaume Collet-Serra's red herring film about a mystery passenger on a commercial flight who wants money or he/she is going to kill someone every 20 minutes and only a drunkard air marshal played by Neeson can save everyone on board. Everything you need to know about Neeson's barely one dimensional character is in the first scene of the movie. He stares despondently at a bottle of whiskey, so the man's an alcoholic. He stares into further despondency at a picture of a little girl, obviously his daughter - who's obviously a link to why he's staring into that bottle of whiskey. Top notch writing. This is also one of those films that writes itself into a corner. Every character could be or couldn't be the maniac pulling the strings and the resolution comes at no surprise, because it literally could be anyone. They could have filmed thirty different endings - each ending changing the villain and personal motivation and the preceding events wouldn't have to change a single frame and the outcome would be exactly the same. Neeson gets worked up and huffy and puffy and punches a few people, but other than that, barely anything of interest happens."

","The most unfortunate thing about ""Non-Stop"" is that it's 1:46 long. That last :46 was just too much for me. Seriously - I was enjoying this for the most part for the first hour or so, and then it just lost me. Not that I didn't understand it - it just stopped interesting me. Too much that was happening just wasn't making enough sense. Sure, I get that in an action movie you sometimes have to suspend your disbelief - but I was being asked to suspend too much disbelief.<br/><br/>First was the rather - shall we say - convoluted plan that the bad guys had hatched. The story revolves around a plan to extort $150 million from an airline - or someone - and a threat to kill one passenger every twenty minutes unless the money is paid. Or the plane is going to be blown up. Or it's going to be blown up anyway regardless I guess. Whatever. This plot depended on so many little details going absolutely right. It depended on things happening to the split second. Or, if it didn't depend on that, still so many things happened right on the split second that it was bewildering. Like the twenty minute thing. Liam Neeson's Agent Marks could literally set his watch by this timing. The deaths happen literally at the 20 minute mark - not 20 minutes and 30 seconds, or 19 minutes and 45 seconds, but literally at 20 minutes - even though there was no way the plotters could have possibly controlled everything that needed to happen so precisely. And how did these guys plan to escape anyway? Sure they had parachutes. So they were going to jump into the middle of the Atlantic Ocean? (This was a flight from the US to London.) What would they do then? And how did they set up all these bank accounts - hundreds of them apparently - all around the world? What? And how did they know that Agent Marks was going to be on this specific flight? Because a lot of their plan seemed to revolve around their knowledge of some of the troubled personal details of his life. And - if his superiors trusted him so little that they wouldn't believe him when a crisis on a flight came up and would readily accept that he was actually a suspect, why was he still an air marshall in the first place? It was all mind-boggling.<br/><br/>And it worked for a while. Convoluted? Unbelievable? To the point of ridiculousness? Sure it was, but I could hang in for about an hour in the hope that some sense would be made of this. But it never was. After about an hour I just started thinking how long it was taking this movie to end. Which is never a good sign.<br/><br/>There were things I liked about it. Liam Neeson was pretty good. Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson. He worked in the role of Marks - the air marshall dealing with a lot of personal demons. Julianne Moore was pretty good as Marks' seatmate on the plane - the one passenger he seemed able to trust and so he brings her into the circle and she starts to help him get control of the situation. I appreciated the fact that no one decided to introduce a romance between these two. That would have made me roll my eyes a lot sooner than I did. I appreciated the fact that the only Muslim on board the plane was a good guy. I did wonder about his medical knowledge. He identified himself as a molecular neuroscientist or something. Why? Why not just call him a doctor? There seemed no particular reason to make him a molecular neuroscientist if he was going to be providing medical care. But at least he wasn't one of the bad guys.<br/><br/>This worked for a while. There was just too much going on that made the whole story implausible. (5/10)"
"bryank-04844","4","3","4","22 August 2015"," I enjoyed 'Non-Stop' for what it was and what it tried to be, but the ending is almost unforgivable.
","In the next installment of Liam Neeson saving the world, or in this case, 150 people 30,000 feet up in the air on a commercial airliner from New York to London, things are so over-the-top ridiculous, things tend to not make a whole lot of sense. But what do you really expect from a Liam Neeson movie these days? That being said, this thriller in the air called 'Non-Stop' is quite fun and is less cheesy than the 'Taken' films, but not as gritty as 'The Grey'.<br/><br/>This outing marks the second team-up with Neeson and director Jaume Collett- Serra who previously worked on 'Unknown'. Jaume also directed the remake of 'House of Wax' (the one with Paris Hilton), and the little horror film, 'Orphan', so keep that in mind. But I have no doubt that Universal Pictures will make their money back with this Neeson vehicle, despite just how absurd this film is. The three writers on this movie make a decent attempt at a ""terror in the sky"" story line as we meet Bill Marks (Neeson), who is a former NYPD officer turned Air Marshall who is completely afraid to fly. So much so, that he has a death grip on a ribbon and his seat at the same time.<br/><br/>But luckily he sits next to Julianne Moore, who makes an effort to calm him down. But this seemingly normal flight takes a turn for the worst when Marks receives a text message saying that someone will die on the plane every twenty minutes if $150 million is not wired to an account.Twenty minutes go by and someone dies, and then another, and another. Meanwhile for reasons unexplained, the rest of the people on the plane are unaware that people have died, nor do they know what is going on.<br/><br/>The writers give us a twist with the account that the $150 million is supposed to be wired to is under Marks' name, thus everyone accuses him of hijacking the plane, rather than protecting it. Marks tries all sorts of tricks to find out who is sending the texts to him, but cannot seem to find the villain, let alone figure out how wireless works over the middle of the Atlantic ocean. For most of the film, we are on a mystery hunt with Neeson, as it plays out more like a 'Whodunit' yarn, than an action packed thriller.<br/><br/>The characters on the plane aren't exactly original as we have the Muslim guy who everyone thinks is a terrorist, the burly bald guy who is a police officer, the angry black guy, a creepy dude with glasses, and a hot female who is not above having sex in public. The plot goes from bad to insanely ridiculous when a bomb is discovered on board. How they deal with this is laughable, and when the villain and reason behind this debacle is just atrocious. It comes across as lazy writing, and would never be a real reason for doing something like this. It just doesn't make sense, much like the entire movie.<br/><br/>Neeson does all he can with what he's given here, and even his short speech of how he's not a great man, but an asshole alcoholic is not engaging. And anybody, literally anybody could have played Julianne Moore's role, as her character is not important. It took 'Flight 10 minutes to accomplish a great and suspenseful airplane sequence, in what it took 90 minutes for 'Non-Stop' to not accomplish. I know this review makes it sound like i really hated it, but that's not necessarily the case. I enjoyed 'Non-Stop' for what it was and what it tried to be, but the ending is almost unforgivable. Is it worth seeing? I wouldn't waste your time in the theater, but should satisfy enough on home-video."

As if that were not unpleasant enough, Moore disappears from the screen for long periods, almost as if she leaves the plane, only to return to speak a few pointless lines to Neeson. She is not even seen mingling with other passengers, she does not appear in passenger group shots, but, rather, moves suspiciously around the toilet area, near the air hostesses and cockpit, and she contributes ZERO to the plot, apart from what appears to be a sudden blossoming of unexpected love for Neeson in the movie's last frames. <br/><br/>Neeson, usually a highly reliable actor, is apathetic and never comes into his own in this flick - but then, he is not helped by a script that variously makes him a hero or a vlllain, and where passengers facing bomb and other threats actually have the luxury of watching TV and learning that Neeson is a psychopath cop, as if personal data like that were conveyed over TV, especially when there are hundreds of lives at risk in an aircraft under attack from a villain who is anything but credible or menacing, and who, for no apparent reason, actually saves Neeson from passenger lynching at one point.<br/><br/>There is another, NYPD cop on board, but he is just as dumb and gullible as the would-be robbers/criminals, and tenderfoot as the little girl who reminds Neeson of his own dead daughter. So schmaltzy...<br/><br/>The final straw in terms of credibility is the bomb that explodes and yet the plane is able to land with everyone apparently unscathed. I could have kicked myself for watching this NON-STOP rubbish to the end. <br/><br/>Best avoided. Gets 1 star because I can't zero it."

","Who doesn't love a good action film? Great effects, some white-knuckle, adrenalin fueled mission against the clock with fantastic fight scenes and cracking one liners. This is not the case with Non-Stop. I honestly feel that after wasting the last 106 minutes watching this run of the mill, cheesy, completely unoriginal ""action-thriller"" that someone has to stand up and say ""Enough""! This film received an average score of 7.2 from approx 40k voters! Really?? How? The characters were completely miscast, Julianne Moore (can be great) was utterly pointless as the supporting star and Neeson..well, he is now a parody of himself and is managing to De-value his worth as a lead with every crock of crap he releases. At least Mr Neeson is predictable - Non stop is probably even worse than any of the others on his downward trajectory since Taken. The story is just ridiculous, impossibly daft. The supporting cast is crazily off, effects and fight scenes were nothing special at all and the entire film felt like it had been hurried through, hastily edited and thrown together at the last minute. My advice is Avoid. I guarantee that you will find something better to watch instead of this joke. A $50 million budget for this! I guess the world is crazy."

The characters were poorly developed, especially Liam's, the story was dumb and recycled from four different 'Die Hard' movies and, worst of all, the villain was so clichéd and ambiguous that he might as well not have been in the film at all. To be honest, at this point, I can't even remember who the real villain was. In fact, that's the best way I can think of to sum up 'Non-Stop' with one word. The entire thing is utterly FORGETTABLE.

"PassPopcorn","7","6","11","18 March 2014"," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Who else saw the trailer for Non-Stop and thought, ""oh dear, here's another movie that will make me feel ashamed when I go buy the tickets for it, I'll probably give it a low grade and write a negative review about it – what a waste of time and money!""? I hope it wasn't just me. I mean, an action movie, set on a plane, and the main character is played by Liam Neeson. Not my kind of movie, to be honest. I just couldn't understand what Julianne Moore was doing in the movies, as she's a good actress. Well, it turns out Non-Stop is actually a good movie that managed to keep me interested all the way. I was never bored and some scenes and twists even surprised me. My apologies to the movie makers for my jumping to conclusions! <br/><br/>In Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U. S. Federal Air Marshal, and a divorced alcoholic who doesn't like flying. On the flight from New York to London, he meets Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), who asks him about his private life in order to relieve the fear he feels while the plane is taking off. While over the Atlantic, Bill receives a message on his secure phone from an unknown person who threatens to kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred to a bank account. Bill asks the other air marshal on the plane, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), for help, but they get into a fight and to save himself Bill kills Jack – at the 20 minutes mark.<br/><br/>Why did I presume this would be a bad movie? Well, first of all, it's an action movie. More often than not, little effort is put in creating an interesting and original story to accompany the action scenes in an action movie, and you get a Steven Seagal movie – which means a boring collage of shootouts, explosions and deaths. Fortunately, Non-Stop didn't make this mistake: its story isn't original, but it's entertaining and gripping, and the non-action scenes aren't just tedious fillers – you can actually enjoy the movie as a whole, as it doesn't rely exclusively on action. Of course, there are some cheesy and silly scenes, but they don't ruin the overall enjoyment this movie provides; they just temporarily relieve the tension in the scene.<br/><br/>In action movies, acting can be bad, because who cares about the actors as long as there's guns and fire and car chases and bad guys dying? Again, Non-Stop avoided this trap gracefully. Liam Neeson is good, most of the time, Julianne Moore is great in every scene, and none of the other supporting characters feels unnecessary or acts bad. The only disappointment may be represented by the villain, who, when finally discovered, doesn't really have time to leave an intimidating impression, and whose motives are kind of silly and unbelievable. It would almost have been better had he remained faceless throughout the movie, but this wouldn't have made much sense. Overall, Non-Stop is a good action movie whose flaws are easy to ignore, and I'd recommend it for a Friday evening with friends.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

","I had hoped the movie would be more than it actually was. In order for the movie to come together, there were a couple of assumptions that had to be true in order for the movie to come together.<br/><br/>While not central to the plot, it just seemed a little far-fetched that there would be a Federal Air Marshal who is afraid of flying. The trust between Mary and the Air Marshal also had no basis for it to be that deep. I micro-biologist who is summoned as a medical doctor. Even the end, landing in Iceland, the timing simply doesn't work with them landing in enough daylight that it's mid-morning.<br/><br/>On a more critical level, the collective group behavior is unbelievably blasé, with hours unfolding and three dead bodies collecting before they band together, rise up, and demand answers from a visibly disturbed, abusive drunk Air Marshal. The Air Marshal alone, his actions appear to be borderline unprofessional from the beginning, and that undermines the ability of the audience to ever develop any compassion for him. He appears to be just as bad as the bad guy, and how does a movie work when there is no good vs. bad?<br/><br/>The action is exciting. The general premise is interesting. And as long as the viewer suspends belief in basic human behaviors, the interactions become believable, and this movie begins to work. But for Non-Stop, that's a big leap of faith."

","There's a whole sub-genre of movies based around trouble in an airliner - think of the four ""Airport"" films of the 1970s, the two ""Airplane"" comedies of the 1980s, the action- thrillers ""Passenger 57"" (1992) and ""Flightplan"" (2005), the real life account of ""United 93"" (2006) or even the hilarious ""Snakes On A Plane"" (2006). So don't expect anything too original from ""Non-Stop"", set almost entirely on a flight from New York to London on the fictional airline Aqualantic.<br/><br/>At the centre of the action is air marshal Bill Marks who - like the pilot in ""Flight"" - has a past fuelled by alcohol. What give ""Non-Stop"" an element of class is that Marks is played by Liam Neeson who is a serious actor - brilliant in the eponymous roles of ""Michael Collins"" and ""Schindler's List"" but latterly turning to action roles (the two ""Taken"" movies""). Julianne Moore is also around as one of the suspect passenger to add a little gravitas.<br/><br/>As entertainment, this is a fun enough film. At the time, the tension is maintained and the twists keep coming but, on reflection, little of the narrative makes much sense - but, if it did, air travel would be less safe, so let's enjoy the ride."
"maurice_yacowar","7","4","7","24 March 2014"," Compromised air marshall thwarts terrorists
","In addition to being a riveting thriller, Non-Stop has an interesting political agenda. It's about and for paranoia. Its effectiveness as a thriller makes its political undertow all the more dangerous.<br/><br/>The opening shot establishes the film's subject: a close-up of a troubled, grizzled, unkempt, shaking Bill Marks (Liam Neeson). As we know from the trailer — and as the film quickly confirms — the hero is a US air marshall, i.e., the personification of post-9/11 US Security.<br/><br/>But instead of being in steady control this federal Bill is all victim, all marks. The bad guys have framed him to appear to be the hijacker holding the plane and passengers for a $150 million ransom. As events play out, though, for all his apparent weakness and ostensible guilt he still proves the hero. That is to say, however suspect and incompetent Homeland Security may appear to be, we have to give it our abiding trust. If we want to survive the terrorist threat we have to accept our security system whatever weakness and corruption the Snowdens and cynics may expose in it.<br/><br/>Bill shows a lot of sins the film teaches us to forgive. He not only drinks on the way to work but he futilely tries to cover up his weakness. When he smokes in the plane's john he's a federal officer breaking a federal law. A relatively minor crime but still, we're led to accept this criminal because he's got a badge. In the good guy we're supposed to excuse anything. And despite everything the other passengers see him do, all his violence, dictatorial commands, beating up and even killing the wrong guys, capped by his damning exposure on the TV news, they're supposed to keep supporting him. The film calls for blind trust in one's security force, regardless of all they do and all the bad things you hear about them. Indeed the villains' intention is not to get the 150 Mill but to discredit the US security system. So if any of us feel disenchanted by anything negative we hear about our real life security system, why, then we're just playing into these bad guys' hands.<br/><br/>At least Bill's a little better than the other marshall on the flight, Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), whom the bad guys have played like an organ by planting the bomb in his briefcase of smuggled cocaine. A bomb in coke is a lot of blow. Not to mention one high Jack. Indeed even Bill's guilt is rooted in virtue. Because he was too dedicated to his cop duties he didn't spend enough time at his dying little daughter's bedside. He's given another tyke to protect here, to win redemption.<br/><br/>To compound our paranoia the film plays against all our expectations, especially in our profiling of the suspects (the other passengers). The apparent thug is a NYC cop who first leads the mutiny against our suspicious saint but then converts. The turbaned Moslem (of course Terrorist Suspect #1) tuns out to be an urbane doctor, with a super-medical scientific speciality to boot. Why, our hero is Irish but not IRA! <br/><br/>And the bad guys? The bespectacled high school teacher and the clean-cut black computer nerd. Now, when it's our All-American schoolteachers and computer nerds who are turning terrorist our paranoia needs no limits. Nor, the film murmurs, should our faith in our security system, however weak, incompetent and even criminal it may be. For more see www.yacowar.blogspot.com."
"shawneofthedead","5","8","18","26 February 2014"," A surprisingly good flight undone by its bumpy landing.
","Non-Stop - the latest installment in Liam Neeson's ongoing career renaissance as a geriatric action hero - is an odd beast. Its premise and trailer hint at a ridiculous, campy story, one that can enjoyed with very little concern for logic or reality. What's surprising about Non-Stop is that its first half actually shows great promise as a solid, rather serious action thriller, particularly with director Jaume Collet-Serra ladling heaps of tension into the narrative. Ironically, it's when the film veers irretrievably into ridiculous, campy territory that it crashes and burns.<br/><br/>Bill Marks (Neeson), a federal air marshal, settles himself in for a transatlantic flight. With a well-trained eye, he scopes out his fellow passengers in first class, including his chatty neighbour Jen (Julianne Moore), but doesn't spot anything amiss - until, that is, he receives an ominous text message demanding a wire transfer of US$150 million into an off-shore account. Failure to comply, he is informed, will result in someone on the plane dying every twenty minutes. <br/><br/>A bit of an outrageous premise, it's true, but Collet-Serra actually manages to make it work - kind of. The film's first hour unfolds with tension and tiny twists aplenty, as Bill races against time to trace the source of the threatening messages but keeps coming up empty. The first death is a stroke of story-telling genius, just as it's actually possible to see the metaphorical noose tightening around Bill's own neck as he comes under suspicion for causing rather than trying to stop the mayhem on the plane. Red herrings are liberally baked into the film's plot, to the extent that audiences - and Bill - will be rather effectively kept guessing about the culprit for quite a while.<br/><br/>There's even much to enjoy in the complicated dynamics among the passengers on the plane; they range in response from belligerent (Corey Stoll's rage-filled cop) to terrified (Scoot McNairy's Tom Bowen), from helpful (Nate Parker's Zack White and Omar Metwally's Doctor Nasir) to antagonistic (Anson Mount as Bill's colleague, Jack Hammond). Given his troubled backstory, Bill has a bit of a prickly relationship with flight attendant Nancy (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery). It all adds welcome tension, drama and even comedy to the flight, and contributes red herrings galore to the plot, as Bill struggles to determine who he can trust.<br/><br/>But surprisingly good things must come to an end, and so it is for Non-Stop. The film's final act sees it degenerate from fairly well-plotted thriller to nonsensical mile-high melodrama. The entire plot in which Bill is ensnared - so tautly fascinating at the start - winds up making very little sense, whether in emotional or psychological terms. The grand, crazy opera of it all is only exacerbated by the outrageously action-packed denouement: this is where the film was clearly headed all along, with fisticuffs, gunplay and explosions the order of the day, but it actually feels sillier because of what came before.<br/><br/>The cast is, broadly, very good. Neeson actually doesn't phone it in, just looks grim and determined as he always does in this little sub- genre of films he's built up around himself. Moore is at least a hundred times too good for this material, and so lends her character considerable empathy - and a hint of suspicion too, since it's hard to imagine an actress of her calibre and stature signing on to this film if she didn't have something meatier to do. Dockery radiates uptight tension, a Lady Mary of the sky, and Nyong'o - so arresting in 12 Years A Slave - is essentially a filler character as another flight attendant who flits around in the background looking worried all the time. <br/><br/>On the whole, Non-Stop is enjoyable, particularly in its gripping, tense first half. It's surprisingly rich and well-executed, as Bill struggles to make sense of an apparently routine job gone quite badly wrong. But the film struggles to become a more coherent whole, especially when it plunges into overblown action territory. That's where, one suspects, it was always intended to reside, but this is a descent that winds up feeling like a letdown, especially in contrast with its smoother take- off and flight."

","Liam Neeson was good in this film. Sadly, however, he was one of the only few good things in this film. The premise is interesting enough, and the film has its moments, but these are few and far between.<br/><br/>First and foremost, this movie is one of the most boring things I've seen in a while. It's slow to start, slow throughout and somehow manages to feel slow in the supposedly fast-paced action sequence at the end. People talk a lot in this movie, but seldom do they have much to say.<br/><br/>In this film, Liam Neeson (I've already forgotten the name of every character in this film) walks up and down a plane, trying to stop a murderer who kills someone every 20 minutes, all while contacting Neeson on his smartphone. The logo of said smartphone has also escaped my mind, however I am fairly sure it stayed there longer than the names of the characters, due to it having more close-ups than any other character in the film. After a while, this no longer happens, because the plot feels like doing something different now.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, for the most part. No memorable performances here though, except from Liam Neeson, for being Liam Neeson... again.<br/><br/>The film takes place during a flight between New York and London, and after watching this, you'll feel like you've done so in real time, but gone nowhere."

At that point, it becomes clear that the writers (John W. Richardson and Christopher Roach) lacked a vision of how to end their story. The characters' reactions and comments become so unfathomable that your thinking ""nobody would ever do/say that"". I was left questioning of whether any of the characters were paying attention to what had just happened.

Liam Neeson's films seem to be typical...this one follows the lines of Taken in a slightly similar fashion. A not-so-happy cop or ex cop, tall and charming and elegant but divorced with kids issues taking on some bad guys who want to harm him and others. Soon comes in thrill and speed, kicking and fighting, bam bam and boom boom, and well I'm not gonna spoil anything more.<br/><br/>The typical cop, an ex FBI guy, now an air marshal, is caught in a dilemma 35000 feet above when someone threatens him on board mid air by sms to kill passenger after passenger if he does not get him 150 million dollars transferred to an account. The cop has no option but to find out who is trying to terrorize everyone, but is in for surprises he would not be expecting.<br/><br/>Concept? Great...similar to Taken, like I said before, but definitely an unconventional film. It's not a typical hijack movie that you have seen before but it nevertheless keeps you hooked on.<br/><br/>Liam plays his stereotyped role quite well, all others have done their best too. 90% of the film is shot on an aircraft, with realistic effects.

"JayRief","8","2","3","6 March 2019"," Liam Neeson's action career is non-stop....and I love it
","This is pretty much what we've come to expect from Liam Neeson these days - a gruff, jaded, middle-aged man with a colored past is begrudgingly thrown into a catastrophic situation in which he can trust no one, and he must transform into the gritty action hero that we have all come to know and love. I seriously never tire of watching Liam Neeson in these roles (I get unabashedly giddy every time a new ""Taken"" is announced), and he certainly does not disappoint in ""Non-Stop."" The writers did an amazing job with a story in which you are constantly questioning who the actual villain is, which at more than one point they lead you to believe might even be Neeson himself, and you can never quite shake that shadow of doubt.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is just as much a part of this movie's appeal, with Julianne Moore (as her usual charming self), Michelle Dockery, and Corey Stoll sporadically muscling their way to the forefront, all the while casting doubt on their own motives. My only strike against it (and it might just be my mood today, because it's not a make-or-break kind of complaint) is that it doesn't truly reach a climax of epic proportions like it seems to build up to - but that's understandable because the entire movie takes place inside an airplane, so you can't exactly build up much larger than that. All in all, though, a very enjoyable little action flick, a nice way to spend a Saturday evening."
"grahamvandyke","8","2","3","16 April 2018"," Great thriller/mystery movie
","""Pure non-stop action"" is what seems to be the main motif to Liam Neeson's movies now. This was certainly marketed and perceived by most people as such. I beg to differ with this one.<br/><br/>The acting is above-par with what you would see in the average popcorn action flick. The title itself certainly indicates that this is an action movie that never stop moving, which is true, but it has less to do with non-stop action. This movie is all about mystery. <br/><br/>It is a cleverer movie than Taken, albeit Neeson plays a very similar role. However the suspense and questioning of all the passengers on board makes this movie more akin to Flightplan. It is the basis of being trapped with no means out and being the only person onboard who is convinced of what is truly happening. <br/><br/>The action in the movie is certainly worth the watch, having close quarters fighting that makes for very interesting fighting styles in the enclosed spaces. Neeson also appears larger than ever with his 6'4"" frame towering over everyone on the plane. <br/><br/>A very solid movie with great twists and turns that is slightly better than the Neeson flicks he's been typecast in since Batman Begins & Taken."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","2","3","25 February 2018"," Non-Stop may not be as relentless as its title suggests, but it is undeniably entertaining.
","I despise the title of this film. Automatically brings out connotations of blandness and genericness, kind of like a Straight-To-DVD low budget action film starring Bruce Willis or Nicholas Cage. However, the Neeson and Collet-Serra combination is a winning formula as this is yet another fun ride. A damaged Air Marshal is trapped in a murderous mystery where he must transfer $150 million to a bank account. If he doesn't, a passenger will meet their demise every 20 minutes until he does so. All of this happens on board a long plane journey. It works, it works so well. Very reminiscent to 'Flightplan', but far more focussed on the characters. Like with any mystery, the list of suspects need to be developed to a point where the final reveal shocks you. Given the small runtime, I believe the character developments were adequate. Their backstories and motives are naturally revealed. It's not a case of our protagonist interviewing each one in turn, he instead provokes them and addresses the passengers as one entity. Sure there are times where he questions individuals, which is necessary to identify possible suspects, but that cannot be avoided. I appreciate the small details in these characters. Moore's vulnerability is shown as she explains why she sits on the window seat, our Air Marshal's troubled past is revealed which questions the authenticity of his actions. It's very twisty, full of turns and a meticulously thought out narrative. The final reveal and motives are slightly blurred and unmemorable, although I was still on the edge of my seat...even after my fifth viewing! The claustrophobic environment adds to the suspense and tension. Liam Neeson still thrives on his rejuvenated action career. I did roll my eyes at the end where he was saving the little girl, makes his character arc far too predictable. Non-Stop is not going to fly away as a classic thriller, but it lands with such confidence that it's hard not to enjoy this."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","14 March 2014"," An exceptionally well made movie in its genre
","""Non-stop"" can arguably be viewed as a double bill: suspense thriller in the air (such as the recent ""Red eye"" and ""Flight plan"") plus airborne disaster along the tradition of all-time classic ""Airport"" (1970).<br/><br/>Reviews on this genre of movies should be as brief as possible to avoid spoiling the readers' fun in enjoying the movie. This one takes place entirely in a flight. An air marshal (a very effective Liam Neeson) who has his fair share of personal problems and vicissitudes receives text messages on a work-related cross-Atlantic flight he is taking, demanding $150 million to be transferred to a specified account or else. ""Or else"" means having one person on the flight killed every 20 minutes. Enough! Suffices to say that this quality thriller does not follow the often predictable path. While the final solution may not leave you in a state of ecstasy of enlightenment, it will not make you curse or cry foul as quite a few other movies of this genre would.<br/><br/>There is the usual ensemble of a variety of characters and suspects. In term of actors, by far the most prominent is obviously Julianne Moore, as a fellow passenger met on the flight by our protagonist and becoming the only person he can trust. In term of recent prominence, there is Oscar Best Supporting Actress Lupita Nyong'o (Moore, incidentally, has 4 nominations under her belt, including both lead and support roles, but has still to win her first Oscar) who unfortunately is nothing more than moving and talking prop impersonating an air hostess. As one critic (at least) said, her next role will undoubtedly not be something like this. The other air hostess, who has a great deal more acting to do, is capably delivered by Michelle Dockery. The rest of the large cast includes faces both familiar and unfamiliar. Two that may have a chance of ringing a bell are Scoot McNairy as a passenger falling under strong suspicion and Corel Stoll as an NYPD who just happens to be on the flight.<br/><br/>To reiterate, nothing more should really be disclosed about the movie. The overall verdict from critics and general audience alike is that this is an exceptionally well made movie in its genre. Watch it. You won't regret."

The terrorist sent a short message to Bill with the message that Bill immediately send money worth $150 million to him and if it did not do so someone would die every 20 minutes. The film is full of puzzles, while watching this film, I keep trying to find out who the culprit is because everyone looks suspicious and what will happen in the next scene. In each scene, I was treated to a camera glare at certain people who could make me think, ""lest he is the culprit."" But it's unpredictable, people who look fine are actually bad people in the film.<br/><br/>

","Non-Stop (2014): Dir: Jaume Collet-Serra / Cast: Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o, Scoot McNairy: Action farce with a lot of potential and a whole lot of nonsense. Liam Neeson plays a federal air marshal whose drinking is the result of the death of his daughter. During this particular flight he receives threatening texts that warn of a death every twenty minutes until a large sum of money is sent to an account that is actually in Neeson's name. Naturally he struggles to find the culprit but the passengers become increasingly anxious as he trots about with a gun zip tying suspected passengers. Starts out with a bang with a structure that builds around everyone whether it be passengers, flight attendants or even Neeson himself looking guilty. Unfortunately the third act collapses with ridiculous action scenes particularly when the plane is plummeting and Neeson in slow motion manages to grab a gun in the air. Director Jaume Collet-Serra is skilled with the action but his screenwriter is hardly skilled at creating characters beyond the surface. Neeson isn't elevating his range yet he displays a boldness over a thick vulnerability especially when the media peg him as a hijacker. Julianne Moore does her best in a somewhat limited role as a passenger seated next to him. Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o play the typical flight attendants that are meant to be suspicious. Everyone else basically sit around looking suspicious and wasting screen time. Action fans may enjoy the non-stop hijinks while others may wish to leave this plane to land to superior entertainment.

"Desertman84","8","1","1","11 March 2015"," Great But Fails At The Conclusion
","Non-Stop is a mystery action thriller that has its events occurs 40,000 feet above inside an airplane. It stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks,a U.S. Federal Air Marshall who was set up to do an impossible task of inside an airplane,together with a brilliant supporting cast led by recent Oscar winner Julianne Moore as well as Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o and Scoot McNairy. <br/><br/>Bill Marks is an alcoholic Federal Marshal that was enrolled in the Air Marshall after he was discharged from the New York City Police Department.On a Boeing 767 non-stop flight from New York to London, he receives text messages on his secure phone stating that someone on the plane will die every 20 minutes unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account.<br/><br/>Just like its title,Non-Stop provided non-stop suspense in the first 80 minutes.No question that Liam Neeson is solid as Bill Marks,a man who intends to redeem himself in the current situation that he is in.The action was also intense as Marks try to solve the mystery of the man who assigns him of doing the impossible tasks and tries to locate his identity among the passengers.Too bad that the conclusion somewhat becomes implausible and unrealistic as the action sequence was simply cheesy especially when Marks killed the killer with the help of the co-pilot. If the conclusion was handled better by the writers,it could have been one of the best action thrillers of the year."
"mgruebel","4","1","1","12 February 2015"," Plothole extravaganza
","Liam Neeson almost carries this one through.<br/><br/>Air Marshal Bill Marks has to deal with a deranged killer, who is knocking off passengers and pilots with a poison dart every 20 minutes. It becomes increasingly clear that the bad guy is not after the ransom, to be deposited in an account in Marks' name. He wants to avenge his father's death on 9/11, which he blames on the incompetence of the US government, and specifically then-NYPD fireman Marks. The film does a good job at keeping you guessing who the bad guy might be, and even the pretty explicit plot summary I just gave may still leave you surprised. Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery provide strong support, and if you love that actor combo, you may forgive the film its shortcomings.<br/><br/>Those shortcomings are the Non-Stop plot holes. Now, I'm not one to search for accuracy or total consistency in action flicks. Let's face it, if things are moving fast enough, we can overlook the holes. But when the holes get big enough that you start thinking about them while watching, the script has failed. There is a trade-off between zipping along fast enough so you can't think about the holes, or zipping along slower but with greater consistency. Think ""Olympus Has Fallen"" at one end of that spectrum, and ""North By Northwest"" at the other end of that spectrum.<br/><br/>I'm not talking about small holes, like a bomb that can't be thrown off the plane because a low pressure switch will set it off, but then when someone shoots out a window in the plane a minute later and the pressure drops, the bomb does not go off. The bomb went off a minute later anyway, no big deal for the plot. <br/><br/>I'm talking about why US Air Marshals would hire a drunk with publicly known problems that are broadcast live to passengers on those little back-of-the-seat monitors. An Air Marshal supervisor who furiously refuses to listen to his employee trying to explain that if he were to hijack a plane, he would not put the ransom account in his own name! A non-suicidal helper of the suicidal bad guy who goes along with a plan to collect the ransom after parachuting off an exploding passenger airliner (he deserves the $150 million for stupid ballsiness). Or a pilot who needs to drop to 8000 ft to avoid an explosion, but never tells the escorting jet pilots ready to down the plane why he needs to drop altitude. And so on and so forth. These holes are both obvious and plot-critical, and for me they ruined the whole thing even as I was watching it.<br/><br/>The movie also dishes up the stock characters and politically correct anti-stereotypes, like the Islamic MD complete with Taqiyah who is suspected by all yet innocent, versus the white 9/11 victim nice guy who turns out to be a terrorist. Sure, the US has its Timothy McVeighs, but I still say: Yawn!<br/><br/>So a 5/10 it is, for solid acting that almost rescues this Neeson action vehicle, and for keeping me guessing who the real bad guy is. The film only partly satisfies in a single viewing."

","On entering the movie theater it must be said that I was in the exact same mindset as the other 400 sitting alongside me; ""Just another blockbuster - i'm only here cos its got Liam Neeson in it"", and while the lead protagonist was the star of the show (giving his best big- screen performance since Taken), the true genius of the film chose not to rely on the star-studded cast (including Oscar-nominee Julianne Moore) but came down to the crafty nature in which the plot was unraveled, utilizing ambiguity and unpredictability to the greatest effect. Leaving no stone unturned, the audience are Neeson's ally for the whole journey, knowing just as much as he does and shitting themselves with panic of much a similar capacity. <br/><br/>No film is without its flaws however and Non-Stop is no exception, with a repetitive screenplay that throws in several cringe-worthy one-liners, it could be argued that the script is the main factor holding the cast back from unleashing their full potential. But they do with it what they can, and once you get over the unrealistic (yet utterly thrilling) action sequences, you might just see the picture for what it really is: a smart, white-knuckled roller coaster ride that keeps audience members hanging off the edge of their seat for the whole of the thrilling experience - Non-Stop Entertainment!"

It may not be as suspenseful as other great thrillers like ""Perfect Blue"" or ""Rear Window"" but it is just as entertaining. ""Non-Stop"" had a few pretty silly moments and it did drag on a little longer than it really needed to, but it still did its best to keep from losing focus and keep the audience entertained. Is it an absolutely amazing movie? No. Is it a well done movie? Yes. Is it Oscar worthy? No and I don't think it's really meant to be. It's a decent thriller film that does prove to be a great time at the movies. The story is good, the action is good, most of the characters are forgettable but likable, and Liam Neeson is, well, Liam Neeson. It's just a fun movie to watch and I think it's worth at least one viewing."

","If you're looking for a movie that manages to keep the tension and the suspense the whole time, this is a great choice! This is not the typical ""I saw it coming"" type of movie since everyone becomes a suspect. Everyone is suspicious to the main character and to the spectator.<br/><br/>This is a perfect thriller, with a pretty good story line, unlike most action movies.<br/><br/>*** Not a spoiler but : It looked like they were looking for a way to end this movie quickly which made the ending a little bit rubbish. Since the ending was quick, the movie is still great in general and I would recommend it as a great suspense."

","I went to watch this film with high hopes. As an avid fan of Liam Neeson's acting I felt this was going to be something to remember. Whilst it was a very strong, exciting film it could have been better. It has lots of twists and turns and some decent bits of action.The action was good but not amazing and I didn't feel it was on the level of some of Liam Neesons other films such as Unknown and Taken. I felt the director could have made the film and characters more tense to keep you on the edge of your seat a little more and perhaps the parameters weren't fully explored on what could have been an amazing film.<br/><br/>However, in saying all that it is definitely worth watching and definitely not a waste of your money or time. 8/10"
"edwardanthony9","8","5","13","27 February 2014"," With a movie as fun & thrilling as this, the details don't matter much...
","When you watch a movie as fun and as thrilling as Non-Stop, little does the details matter. Despite minor letdowns here and there, it never seemed to matter much because from start to end, the movie just flows with suspense that keeps your mind fixed on the mystery itself.<br/><br/>The unique premise in its own is the strong foundation of this film. With the idea of a mystery killer in the middle of a flight high up in the air, all that needs to be done is to translate that to the screen, and it will be thrilling. The good news is, the production team did just that, and it succeeds where it needs to be. Every minute from when the culprit sends the first message, you just can't take your eyes off the screen, and you just can't help the feeling that in an enclosed space like this, and the killer is seeing our hero's every move and could possibly kill him at any moment. That feeling is what we pay this film for. They keep you guessing, and they keep you worried for the sake of our protagonist.<br/><br/>Some characters were pretty likable, while most of the cast portray them brilliantly. And you just can't hate Liam Neeson. He has that brilliance and charisma on screen, that you just want to root for him at every moment. The comedy gives some necessary laughs in between tenseful moments, and the drama of some of the characters gives for a more meaningful story. While these aspects where never very good, they are decently supportive of the strengths of this film. Yet, the action sequences were not fully brought to life, and while this film may not have the best or the most plausible of endings, it never really mattered when you are having so much fun with the film.<br/><br/>VERDICT:<br/><br/>Good: Clever premise, Great characters, Full of thrills & suspense<br/><br/>Bad: Implausible ending, Not fully structured fight sequences<br/><br/>SCORE: 7.5<br/><br/>(blockbusted9.blogspot.com)<br/><br/>note: watching a plane getting hijacked one day before getting on a plane ride yourself is not the best idea (what I did) lol"

","Greetings again from the darkness. Hollywood is a true believer in the theory that imitation is the greatest form of flattery. The constant attempts to capture the same lightning bolt in the same bottle would be kind of funny, if not so frustrating for us movie-goers. Liam Neeson's surprise hit with 2008's Taken spawned not just a Taken sequel, but now two movies from director Jaume Collet-Serra - this one and the disappointing Unknown. Oh well, it's easy money for Neeson and it's not the worst early year release.<br/><br/>It's been 20 years since Liam Neeson's Oscar nominated performance in Schindler's List. Rather than a great actor, he might best be described as a familiar screen presence ... a guy we can somehow relate to most of the time. Well, at least until he unleashes his particular set of skills ... this time in an airplane lavatory! The set up for this thriller is quite promising. Neeson plays an alcoholic US Air Marshal looking and sounding quite beaten down by life in the first few minutes. Once on his flight, he receives a text informing him that someone onboard will be killed every 20 minutes until $150 million is transferred into his account. It's a combination hijacking, extortion, whodunnit murder mystery and blackmail story. Unfortunately the three first time screenwriters (one of whom ""wrote"" for the WWE) botch every possible twist and turn. With a plane full of suspects, we play right along with Neeson as he begins the process. We've enjoyed the claustrophobic approach to movie thrillers before in such movies as Flight, Air Force One, Flightplan and even Phone Booth.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, this plane never feels cramped and the tight spaces only come into play with the aforementioned lavatory fight scene, and even that seems like the most spacious airplane restroom of all-time. Even the multiple drop-dead deadlines aren't really played for full effect, and the decent supporting cast isn't given much to do, save for looking suspiciously at Neeson.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore co-stars, but mostly her role consists of disbelieving stares and a tilt of the head. Corey Stoll (House of Cards) gets a few juicy scenes, as does the always interesting Scoot McNairy. Unfortunately, Oscar nominee Lupita Nyong'o, Shea Whigham, Michelle Dockery (Downton Abbey), and Nate Parker have little to do, and the absolute wasting of Anson Mount is a crime.<br/><br/>If you are skittish about flying, there is no reason to see this one, though the convoluted motive and lackluster reveal might help you forget the story takes place on an international flight. The one thing we do learn is that Liam Neeson can take a fire extinguisher to the head and bounce right back up without a mark. Let's add that to his particular set of skills, while we less than anxiously await yet another collaboration between Neeson and this director coming in 2015."

","Non-stop was a movie that did not leave you calm for a minute. The scenario was very original, and always kept you guessing about who the Air pirates were. The film focused on some certain passengers, implying that one of them is the secret Messenger, but I believe that nobody expected the ending. Liam Neeson's acting was exceptional once again, adapting in the role of Bill Marks very easily, and Julianne Moore's performance was also of the highest quality. I have to say that the film proved to be above my expectations. From the moment the messages began, I couldn't get my eyes off the screen. It was full of conflicts and twists,and the suspects changed from one scene to the other. I highly recommend it, to anyone wishing to watch a film full of action."
"billygoat1071","7","3","7","2 March 2014"," The Plane Has Been Taken
","Liam Neeson continues to bear his straightforward action star talents that was famed by Taken. This time it takes place on a plane and unsurprisingly he has to beat up some bad guys there. We're always fine by it, but Non-Stop is the one that it's hard to take seriously. It does have a great setup, but ends up making silly tricks through the third act. It's not a bad thing, in fact the film takes plenty of clever choices to bring out its tension, even if the revelations of the mystery have gone absurd. Non-Stop is the kind of simple action film that pushes the limit of its ridiculous and by that, it's fun.<br/><br/>Before all the twists and turns, there is this intellectual intro. The camera focuses on every passenger assuming that one of them could be the suspect. We don't have any knowledge about the characters until they entered the plane. What's smart in this case is the beans are allowed to be spilled when they exactly needed to. It's a shame that their answers turn out to be the silliest things you would get in any basic thriller. But the tension is inevitably effective. The direction just keeps the bad things happening in the oddest ways possible to make it feel so surreal.<br/><br/>Even the characters are a lot smarter at the first half. The passengers having awareness on the situation gives a secondary conflict for Bill Marks to deal with. How the problems are solved are either too easy or something that are senseless. Despite of that, the ride is quite fun, even if it also inappropriately includes humor in some critical moments. The acting helps to brim up the suspense. In every action Liam Neeson makes, it always have to be interesting. He's also backed up with actors who gives a lot personality to point fingers at him.<br/><br/>Non-Stop would have been as smart as its setup, it just couldn't regress from the standard action movie storyline. And there, it ends with a silly bang. Although silly, it's undeniably enjoyable which lead to instant forgiveness for its twists, because definitely its only ambition is to excite and it succeeds by being creative to its thrills. It still leaves a couple of holes in the end, but then no one seem to matter. The ride already provides enough tension and energy to make things worth it."

It felt fresh to see him play this rugged, calm under extreme pressure, government agent who is the man of the hour. He has explored breadth of this character really well. This is a fast paced action movie with a decent plot. You are here to see how Liam Neeson pulls it off, not the writer or the director. He doesn't disappoint a single moment.

","How is this getting such high ratings? I am quite happy to suspend disbelief and enjoy a standard silly thriller but this one just went way beyond the point of no return. The actions of the character played by Liam are just too stupid for words and although I'm happy to allow characters to make dumb decisions it gets tedious and ridiculous when they keep making the same errors over and over and the only discernible reason for this to happen is to drive a ludicrous plot that would otherwise fall apart completely. Liam was irritating as the overly aggressive marshal and the majority of the cast working with him were superfluous. There were numerous plot holes, lots of subplots that went nowhere, shallow stereotypes, an annoying over-use of red-herrings and whole scenes directly stolen from other - better - movies with similar themes. I struggled to watch it all the way through. Watch Flight Plan or Red Eye instead."

","Well, that was forgettable fun. Liam Neeson as a sort of Gaelic-accented Bruce Willis, forced to hunt down a hijacker on a trans-Atlantic flight.<br/><br/>I don't quite buy Neeson as an action hero. He's too a bit too portly these days, looking much more like he rather solve any problems by sitting down and having a good natter over a pint of Guinness, rather than go gallivanting around like a mad thing.<br/><br/>He does put on a good show in this movie though. After boarding a plane, he starts getting text message threatening the lives of various passengers and crew, and has to gradually eliminate various suspects, often in a rather gung-ho fashion. He's not helped by everyone who should be helping thinking he's off his rocker.<br/><br/>The movie switches from psychological drama to much more of an action film as it nears the end, and the final scenes are well handled and wind up events well.<br/><br/>It a reasonably good action flick. Not a lot of depth to it, but then there's not supposed to be."
"Rickting","4","2","4","22 August 2014"," A watchable two star action flick with one of the stupidest plots in recent memory
","Liam Neeson, playing a haunted Air Marshall, starts receiving texts saying someone will be killed every 20 minutes until he transfers several hundred million dollars to an off shore account. In a very bad-ass manner, he tries to uncover the murderer and save the plane. Count me in! Liam Neeson is a great actor and manages to make being understated cool, while the premise, although preposterous, is claustrophobic and thrilling. As well as loving action films I also love mysteries so this was one of my most anticipated films of the year. And one of the most disappointing. If you saw this, do you actually remember any of it? Like, anything at all? I barely remember it and I only saw it a few months ago. A little worrying. Although this is a 2 star movie, it's not something I totally hated watching and I moderately enjoyed in some ways. Liam Neeson owns the film and brings grit and a tiny bit of emotion to a silly story. Lupita Nyong'o and Julianne Moore are both underused, but still good. It does have plenty of exciting moments, the direction is competent and it's an action film emphasizing tension over mindless thrills for once.<br/><br/>So, it's a watchable movie and moderately exciting. But no enough. The film is style over substance but there's nothing wrong with that. But it can't decide on murder mystery or action thriller. It veers between the 2 in a very irritating manner. Although there are thrills, a lot of the time they don't go far enough and as the film goes on and it switches to brutal beat em up mode, it loses the sense of tension and claustrophobia it had at first. The primary thing that lets it down is the screenplay. This has a plot so stupid it's makes Snakes On A Plane look like a documentary. OK, so blockbusters are about suspension of disbelief but this takes action movie ridiculousness to a whole new level. But not in a good way like Fast & Furious. The plot doesn't make any kind of sense, and the plan of the main villain would have been impossible to pull off. This is total and utter rubbish in terms of storytelling and it is possible to pull off a plane set action film, but this would have worked better on a train. A ludicrous, although not totally unforgivable disappointment. Silly.<br/><br/>4/10"
"eddie_baggins","4","2","4","12 August 2014"," While Neeson is good, this one doesn't fly
","Ever since Taken took the box office by storm back in 2008 its aging star Liam Neeson has become somewhat of an action master appearing in films such as The A Team, Taken 2, Unknown, The Grey (which by the way is a seriously underrated gem) and now in Jaume Collet-Serra's thriller Non-Stop in which his presence alone saves this particular plane from a dreadful plunge into the deep dark oceans of movie badness.<br/><br/>Non-Stop is one of those thrillers than remains quite preposterous the whole way through, a suspension of disbelief well and truly required if you are to enjoy it's over the top aeroplane goodies. A suspension of disbelief is made all the more possible thanks to Neeson whose role as alcoholic Air Marshall Bill Marks is enough to earn this movie an extra star. Neeson can do gruff, he can do wisecracks and he can do menacing and his on form here from the get-go. By now Neeson can do these type of roles in his sleep though and it's a little disappointing that an actor with obvious talent would continue to sell himself to these type of movies especially a movie such a this with no real redeeming features bar the man himself.<br/><br/>I can guarantee annoyance levels will reach a near unbearable level about 30 minutes into Non-Stop when Bill's phone continues to ""ding ding"" with a message received tone, that is up FAR too loud. Annoyance is then ramped up with a continual reading of text messages displayed all over the screen in a shaky unfocused manner. These unfavourable decisions by the movie makers are not helped by a supporting cast either underused (Scott McNairy, Lupita Nyong'o who sports a hairdo not too far distant from The Fresh Prince of Bel Air) or overused (Julianne Moore, in another one of her ""needed the pay check"" roles) and the story working here hinges on what needed to be a perfect landing of an ending but instead we get a bumpy finish with a horrible last act and a severely underwhelming reveal of just who is behind all of this nasty threat business.<br/><br/>The more you think about Non-Stop the more it will frustrate you with his myriad plot holes and incredibly daft decision making skills by its participants and while Neeson is once more a solid centre to an otherwise crumbling film there is no denying that Non-Stop is a flight you regret taking and an experience not dissimilar to flying economy class with a crying baby situated behind you as your next seat neighbour falls asleep on your shoulder.<br/><br/>2 blue ribbons out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check into - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

","I really could not in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone. There is little that is truly thrilling or suspenseful in what happens in this film, and it drags on to a whodunnit conclusion that you will probably not have guessed. But at that point you won't think ""Wow now I see how it was done!"" because like much of the rest of the film it is put together in a ham fisted way. Non-Stop is really not articulated well, and even it's final message is slapped over the top of your head in a clumsy way. Is there anything good to report? Well I can say that the use of text messages on screen was done in a relatively innovative way. Liam Neeson plays alcoholic and solitary Air Marshall Bill Marks very well. Marks haggard tired appearance unfortunately reflected my own growing tiredness as the film dragged on to a conclusion that was not able to save it."
"chaos-rampant","Null","2","4","30 May 2014"," The usual suspects
","This is one of those things, tolerable to watch because it moves fast, mind-numbing to think about, but the trick here is that you either make it taut enough so that we don't mind, or so ridiculous that minding makes you feel like a sourpuss. Con Air.<br/><br/>The main idea is promising; an air marshal gets mysterious texts by someone on board the flight who demands money wired to an account or passengers start dying. They bangle this, because they try to shoehorn the idea that our guy may be the hijacker, and a loud subtext about absolute authority in the skies that has gone haywire and may be itself to blame, so they have the protagonist act like an out-of-control fool who can think of no subtler way of searching passengers than to have the whole cabin put their hands up!<br/><br/>This isn't a complaint about realism, no one has time for that. Someone might do that, another not. It's about the potential way you'd like to see something unfold. I miss here an atmosphere of glances, strangers, peering among the sleepy passengers and having to remain inconspicuous as you swish back and forth in the cabin; then we could get to the pistol- whipping.<br/><br/>Not a good film, but tolerable."

","Liam Nesson's Non-Stop is a movie that will keep your eyes glued to the screen. There are a lot of action and thrill sequences to keep you entertained. Even though there are points in the movie that don't add up or make sense, you will be too involved into the film to care about it until afterwards. <br/><br/>The introduction of the movie is very clear and efficient in plot and character development. You will feel like you know the protagonist, Bill Marks, right off the bat, as a man who had just gotten out of a divorce and is now an alcoholic. This backdrop to the character is important throughout the plot. <br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the film's introduction is how Bill encounters or sees passengers of the plane before boarding the flight. With the movie trailer, it is already established that one of these individuals is the culprit to Bill's dilemma in the plot of the movie: being framed. Thusly, this ensues the audience in a little fun mystery game of ""Who's the bad guy?"" through most of the movie. This is an engaging feature of the movie and makes its audience want that satisfaction of the pieces coming together to solve the crime of this mystery.<br/><br/>(Spoiler Alerts) One of the things that disappoints me in the movie are factual errors and holes in the story. In other words, the movie is not realistic in that it is very unlikely for these series of events to *Ever* happen. How is an entire briefcase of cocaine brought into a plane undetected, let alone a bomb within the substance? Realistically, that briefcase would not have made it anywhere close to the plane. How is it that one of the murders takes place in the bathroom, and the murderer discovered at the end of the movie is never seen to be there? At this point of the movie, the plane is under complete lock down by the air marshal, so nothing could have possibly slipped by him. Or how is it that the plane makes a hard pull upwards and everything starts to float and hover? This hard pull upwards would have made the passengers feel more force of gravity instead of the sense of a freefall.<br/><br/>Many of these parts don't make sense, and to me, it's rather upsetting. Also a little downing is how the movie trailer shows too much of what I believe are the better parts of the movie. Because of that, some of the movie wasn't too much of a surprise or climax where it should have been. Like the scene where Bill grabs the firearm falling in the air due to the supposed ""freefall"" and fires a round. However, this movie wasn't made solely for a nit-picked plot in my opinion. I see this movie as a theme park attraction: and people want to watch Non-Stop to enjoy the ride. When and if you see this movie, take it with a grain of salt. This ""rollercoaster"" (known as Non-Stop) will give you a satisfying feeling after the ride."

","Despite its shoddy CGI shots of a bogus jetliner plunging earthward with two jet fighters flanking it, ""Non-Stop"" qualifies as an extremely preposterous but thoroughly entertaining airborne mystery-thriller. At 61-years of age, rugged Liam Neeson stars as troubled U.S. Air Marshal William Marks. Not only has Marks survived the death of his cancer-ridden, adolescent daughter, but he has also experienced a devastating divorce along with the loss of his 25-year job as a New York City Police Department detective. Meantime, the unshaven Marks has deteriorated into a guilt-ridden, nicotine-addicted, alcoholic plagued by memories of his grim past. At one point during this tense as well as terse PG-13-rated melodrama, our hero exposes his clay feet and describes himself as a deplorable dad. A flawed hero usually wins an audience's sympathy, and the scruffy Neeson emerges as an affable enough protagonist with a dark mood or two. He winds up tangling with a homicidal hijacker who has skewered his authority in the eyes of his superiors.<br/><br/>Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra of ""Orphan"" and rookie writers John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle challenge us with a gallery of unusual suspects when they aren't playing a game of charades with us about the hijacker's identity. Naturally, they dole out red herrings galore to throw us off the scent. Unless you're blessed as a psychic, you may have a difficult time exposing the perpetrator. Cunningly, for the better part of its white-knuckled 106 minutes, Collet-Serra keeps a variety of paranoid passengers bottled up inside the cramped confines of an airliner and kindles sufficient tension within this combustible setting after our hero discovers a ticking time-bomb on board. Rarely does Collet-Serra and company relieve the tension by cross-cutting to exterior scenes of ground personnel until the end. Indeed, you may find yourself feeling a little claustrophobic before an explosive but formulaic finale. Unfortunately, ""Non-Stop"" suffers from a dire lack of plausibility, but the filmmakers compensate with a compelling mystery, slickly staged combat action scenes, and a brisk, snappy pace that never lets up. Although neither as gripping as either ""Flightplan"" nor as serious as 9/11 hijacking epic""United 93,"" ""Non-Stop"" generates more than enough suspenseful, edge-0f-the-seat seconds to offset its superficial moments. What it does wrong may be overlooked charitably enough because it is a movie instead of a real-life predicament. Whoever heard of a cop accepting a gun from a man that he doesn't know and then neglecting to see if the firearm is loaded? The cast is strong and does a good job of diverting us from the identity of the hijacker.<br/><br/>William Marks isn't having the time of his life as an undercover U.S. Federal Air Marshal when he boards British Aqualantic Flight 10 heading for Heathrow. Initially, he coaxes an anxious little girl aboard the 767 airliner after he recovers the plush toy she left behind. What better way could the filmmakers have aligned our sympathies with the hero than by showing him sticking up for a lonely little girl on her first flight. Ironically, Marks loses it every time the plane that he is guarding takes off. He wraps a ribbon around his hand that once belonged to daughter before she succumbed to cancer. Later, when Flight 10 reaches its half-way point across the Atlantic, suspicious text messages show up on the Marks' secure phone by means of the aircraft's WiFi. Grimly, Marks realizes with mounting dread that his wily, anonymous adversary is undoubtedly a passenger aboard Flight 10. Basically, according to these messages, a person will die every 20 minutes until $150 million is wired to a specific bank account. The big surprise is that the dough lands in Marks' own bank account and his own people on the ground disown him. Eventually, chief pilot Captain David McMillan (Linus Roache of ""Batman Begins"") insists that Marks surrender his badge and his automatic pistol. Despite deep misgivings, our unhappy hero complies with the captain's request, but this doesn't discourage him from ferreting out the perpetrator with the help of some passengers,primarily frequent-flyer business woman, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore of ""Carrie"") who looks pretty suspicious herself; a balded, NYPD cop (Corey Stroll of (""House of Cards""); former U.S. soldier Tom Bowen (Scoot McNairy of ""Killing Them Softly""), and a kindly Arab, Dr. Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally of ""Munich""). Along the way, Marks discovers an attaché case packed with cocaine as well as a bomb. By this time, Marks has been thoroughly incriminated as the hijacker thanks to a passenger who has caught some of our hero's questionable actions on video and has somehow wired them to news agencies. The situation grows even worse when Captain McMillan dies inexplicably from poisoning while he is flying the jetliner. Nobody can enter the flight deck where the pilot and co-pilot stay, and this bit of skullduggery really gives Marks as well as the audience something to think about as the seconds to doom tick inexorably ahead.<br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" doesn't let up until the last minute when all hope seems to be lost not only for the passengers but also our hero. Meantime, little else can be said about this exciting, nerve racking, nail-biter without divulging important plot points. Interestingly enough, Oscar winning ""12 Years A Slave"" actress Lupita Nyong'o appears in a minor role as one of several flight attendants. Altogether, Liam Neeson fans should be pleased with most of what occurs in ""Non-Stop."""
"JohnnyPHreak","7","2","4","2 March 2014"," A fast paced thriller in the skies
","I hate when a film is badly advertised. It's one of those things that can kill a decent movie or even bury a great movie. Because of Taken when someone sees Liam Neeson kick ass all over the place the first thing they think is this is going to be an action movie. So when the ads for Non-Stop first came out I thought it might be Taken on a plane. I was wrong but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Actually in this one case, the bad advertising doesn't harm the film too much. <br/><br/>Neeson plays a rough, drunk of a US marshal on a non stop flight to London. When he gets a text that if $150 million dollars aren't placed in a bank account in twenty minutes after the flight takes off, a passenger will die. Then the clock resets until the money is paid. That's when the audience and Neeson go on the hunt to figure out who is doing this. But with this kind of movie the why doesn't really matter. And as usual, the why is explained in a speech given by the villain during the finale. <br/><br/>I had my doubts about the film. The thought of Taken on a plane was pretty cool. Especially when the trailer ended with that zero gravity shot of Nesson with gun in hand. The film is directed by Jaume Collet- Serra who teamed up with Neeson for the dreadful Unknown. When I heard he was the director I thought twice about Non-Stop. <br/><br/>The film moves at a quick pace, with the entire audience trying to figure out who is doing it. The thriller aspect is in high gear. A few moments I was on the edge of my seat. Nesson is perfect in this role. He's tough, grizzled and at times emotional. We all know the man can act. It's nice he brings some of that acting after he's killed bad guys and yelling at people. The supporting cast does their job with what they have. Jullianne Moore brings a bit of humanity to her role. It seems as if all these passengers have a back story, some which get explained by them and other by Neeson after some digging. <br/><br/>This is one of those thrillers where the clues are given to you to figure out who has done in the first few moments but the filmmakers realize they want you for the full ride. There's not much action other than two fights, one which is a pretty impressive hand to hand brawl in a bathroom. And of course there is the chaotic finale with has a few explosions and some shots fired. As long as there isn't too much deep thinking the film goes for the swift ride with some thrills. It's in the vein of Passenger 57 and Snakes on a Plane. <br/><br/>For the most part Neeson more than makes up for the awful Unknown with this thriller that has a decent premise, some okay supporting characters and Neeson being pretty awesome he usually is. I haven't seen The Grey but of his action films I would put this third or fourth behind that and Taken. I walked out of the theater with a grin on my face quoting Key & Peele, ""Liam Neesons is my sh...!"". That must be a good thing. <br/><br/>Quick Review: Non-Stop is a fast moving thriller with Liam Neeson doing what he does best. The thrills are quick and enjoyable. There is a decent hand to hand fight and a fun final action scene. Other than being advertised wrong, this film is fun for a good 90 minutes."

"miroslavhradel","7","0","0","14 May 2020"," A gripping and entertaining thriller, but it struggles to be credible
","Non-Stop features a gripping story that kept me interested from the beginning to the end. Additionally, it turned out to be a fairly entertaining movie. On the other hand, it chronically struggles when it comes to being believable, even though it does offer relatively plausible explanations for some of the events that seem to be illogical and impossible when they first pop up on the screen. The eventual crash landing makes for a predictable finale and turns out to be more theatrical than realistic as far as its visual appearance is concerned. Although winning some points in terms of coming as something of a surprise, the preceding sequence in which the two villains expose themselves happens to be more comical than harrowing, especially in relation to the character named Zack and the way he takes off his shirt and tie to reveal tattoos on his muscular arms and a stereotypical commando outfit consisting of a black sleeveless top. There were several other clichéd characters and opinions throughout the film, even though some of them appeared to have been depicted in a vaguely satirical manner. Equally, Liam Neeson plays the kind of a law enforcement officer that one gets to encounter in hundreds of works of fiction - weary, stubborn, traumatized and unable to calm himself down unless he has a couple of drinks. Still, he manages to deliver a convincing performance and the remaining members of the movie's ensemble are just as successful at playing their parts."

"lukem-52760","9","0","0","20 April 2020"," A GREAT ENTERTAINING MYSTERY THRILLER
","Liam Neeson is an action legend in his own right & has made some of the most entertaining Action Thriller's of the about the last ten years, we've had Neeson vs wolves in the snowy wilderness survival Thriller The Grey & we've had his iconic kidnap & revenge Taken Trilogy & his memory loss Mystery with Unknown & his troubled grizzled Detective Crime Thriller, A Walk Among The Tombstones & his Survive the night chase Thriller, Run All Night, all excellent Neeson flicks. So it's definitely safe to say that Neeson is an action Hero legend just a later in life ageing action hero but already he's one of the greats in my opinion & i just totally enjoy his films as he takes out plenty of villains & saves the day, he makes high class slick, big budget action Thriller's that are a perfect night time watch as a ""Popcorn"" flick.<br/><br/>Non-stop is a smart & stylish suspenseful Murder Mystery Thriller with some good action scenes but it's mainly in the Thriller genre just like Neesons other Mystery Thriller flick ""Unknown"" with the same Director (Jaume Collet-Serra) who obviously has a great working relationship with the ageing action star as they've made so far four films together with Unknown, Non-stop, Run All Night & The Commuter.
Here Neeson plays another troubled & rugged type of character with a very sad backstory as an Air Marshall named Bill Mark who gets thrown right into a deadly mystery aboard his flight with a terrorist messaging him about a passenger with die every twenty minutes if his demands are not met. Neeson does give such a good paranoid & frustrated performance & has created one of his best characters in my opinion.<br/><br/>The suspense is high & very claustrophobic as our hero is stuck on the plane wondering up & down the aisles & looking at the passenger's wondering who it is.
I liked the quiet & lonely night time atmosphere. This is a smart Mystery & an exciting one too & it has a nice night time feel to it & a slick look & a great supporting cast with an excellent Julianne Moore in a good solid role here with some nice character depth & back story as Jen, a passenger who helps our hero & we have an off duty New York Cop named Austin played by Corey Stoll & he's a good character here too & there's also solid performances from Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Michelle Dokery & Lupita Nyong'O.
Non-stop is a fun popcorn Thriller that keeps you guessing & wondering who is doing this & why? How many terrorists? It's a clever story & also frustrating as Neeson's Character is constantly being look at as the terrorist himself as things keep happening & pointing directly at him by the clever terrorist.
Just an enjoyable Neeson thriller & he's so good at them."

","This is a movie which I enjoyed thoroughly, it is pretty slow to start with, but it is needed to set the scene and introduce us to the various characters which will feature in the film.

The twists are good, except, in my opinion the way the huge reveal at the end is handled.
The acting is believable and good. But, the reason I didn't rate this movie higher, the end. Without giving too much away, the twist near the end isn't executed very well, it does it in a way which you don't even realise it's happened and so your only thought might be 'Wait, what just happened?'

NonStop, from the director of Unknown (another Liam Neeson action film), is no exception. The setup is actually a fairly interesting one. Neeson, an Air Marshal, boards a flight on which someone will die every twenty minutes unless he gives the unknown perpetrator $150 million. The claustrophobia that comes with the setting works well for this type of film, and there are no fewer than fifteen passengers that are presented as potential terrorists. People begin to drop without any apparent cause, the absurdity of the plot growing in direct proportion to the body count.

","Bill Marks is an air marshal on a flight from New York to Heathrow and as is to be expected in this sort of film he has his issues; in this case a drink problem following the death of his daughter some years ago. The flight starts normally enough as he chats to Jen, the woman seated next to him, but then he gets a message on his secure phone stating that a passenger will die every twenty minutes unless he arranges for $150,000,000 is placed in a numbered Swiss bank account. He initially assumes the other air marshal, Jack Hammond, is playing a joke but he assures Bill that he isn't. Shortly afterwards Jack is seen using his phone as he enters the toilet; Bill confronts him again this time Jack attacks him and after the fight Jack is dead. Soon Bill gets another message; the hijacker is still out there and one person is indeed dead. Now Bill knows the threat is very real and must decide who he can trust; there is Nancy, stewardess he knows and Jen who he instinctively trusts. He enlists their help to try to spot who is sending the messages. As time passes, and more people die, the tension rises and he even starts to question whether he can trust these two; then to make matters worse the airline start to believe that he is actually the hijacker!<br/><br/>It must be said that the plot is rather far-fetched and there are a few plot-holes that surprisingly didn't bother me while I was watching as the tension was so high. This is largely down to Liam Neeson's portrayal of Bill Marks; he brings an intensity to the role that makes him believable even when what is going on isn't very likely. He is ably supported by Michelle Dockery as Nancy and the always dependable Julianne Moore as Jen. The setting provides us with lots of suspects so the viewer should be kept guessing till the very end. This ending is thrilling even though the hijacker's motive is particularly far-fetched. Before this finale there is a good amount of action, some of it fairly intense. Overall I'd say that I enjoyed this a lot more than I expected and would recommend it to anybody who enjoyed Liam Neeson's other action films or who just enjoys the genre in general."

","Alcoholic Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is flying across the Atlantic when he receives a text message on his phone: someone on the plane is threatening to kill a passenger every twenty minutes unless $150m is transferred to a specified off-shore account. Working against the clock, Bill desperately tries to figure out who is behind the threat, but as he pieces the clues together it slowly becomes apparent that he has been set-up to take the fall.<br/><br/>The success of hard-hitting thriller Taken (2008) transformed respected thespian Liam Neeson into an unlikely Hollywood action hero. With a title like Non-Stop, one might reasonably expect this particular Neeson vehicle to be a thrill-a-minute, stunt-packed, white-knuckle ride from start to finish—but it isn't: it is, for the most part, a mystery, and only really kicks into action mode during the final act.<br/><br/>While this might understandably upset those expecting more in the way of spectacular adrenaline-fuelled excitement, I found Non-Stop to be an enjoyable suspense film, albeit one riddled with plot-holes big enough to fly a passenger jet through.

","First of all, this is the only movie I think I have ever watched that almost made my cry. When the little girl Becca is in great danger, I got the feels and almost lost it.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, the story, actors, score, its just amazing. the story of non- stop is quick to kick in, once the texts start coming, tension starts to build, and I have never felt this way about any movie I have watched so far. You just can NOT STOP WATCHING. The plot is really creative in the way that the camera shot and story makes you think that it is this guy, but its not, then you think is is her, but then its not. The story does get a bit complex, so much so that you have to watch it a couple more times, and even though you know who it is, you are still enjoying the movie and in on the action.<br/><br/>The acting in this is on point, having the main character being possibly one of my all-time favorite actors (Liam Neeson). There was some other familiar faces throughout. The casting was well done having a variety of people, many of them stereotypically being the one(s) behind the plot."
"rzajac","8","0","0","3 April 2016"," Honest about what it is
","Non-Stop set its sights on being a mid-air heavy action whodunit and sets forth to stealthily achieve that goal. Sometimes its possible to smell ""producer cold feet"" syndrome, where stock action-flick action gets hyperbolic toward the end--and you can tell that the producers are panicking and pulling rank over the director. Non-Stop doesn't suffer from this: It's designed, from the ground up, to be a steady IV drip of incrementally escalating dramatic tension, built around a simple, operatic concept: Someone, for some reason, wants to endanger everyone on a transatlantic flight.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's operatic and simple, albeit with flurries of complication arising largely from the mystery: What are the motives and means involved?<br/><br/>The usual barrier is encountered: The viewer disbelief over the unlikelihood of the byzantinely complex scenario can be suspended IFF the mythos is compelling enough.<br/><br/>Is it? Mmmmmm...maybe. Oddly, the ultimate revelation of the motive is a key point in the flick, and it'd be spoiling to reveal it, here. Not giving anything away, it's a guy at the frazzled end of his psychological rope, seeking to make a large social point.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the mythos is time-honored (read: OLD): It's what Paddy Chayefsky characterized in Network (1975) as the ""crusty-but- benign"" public servant character.<br/><br/>I give this flick as high a score as I do because it's honest about its intentions and amazingly fleshes in those intentions with very good production values and pacing. Non-Stop is not normally my cup o' tea, but I found it nonetheless compelling, in a parameterized sort of way.<br/><br/>The tension follows the eldritch narrative trajectory; exponentially rising tension to a vertiginous height, a brief chain of intense crisis moments, release, a coda of calmness and connection.<br/><br/>From time to time, I chime in on IMDb User Comments to tell readers to avoid certain movies, and I try (and don't always succeed) in telling folks why. The usual reason to avoid a flick is artlessness. Strange to say for a made-to-spec action flick, but Non-Stop is amazingly artful. I would definitely recommend it to budding screenwriters."

","Enjoyed this one quite a bit, it managed to be more than just your straight action film and I liked trying to figure out whodunit from a whole plane load of potential suspects, for a while I even thought Liam Neeson was guilty. Plenty of red herrings throughout to misled you and an exciting (if implausible) closing scene.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays a familiar role, his stock action hero guy. This could easily be his 'Taken' character actually, just as an air marshal pursuing a hijacker on a non-stop flight from New York to London. It doesn't matter though he does a good job with a decent amount of action considering the limited space, including a hand-to-hand fight in the tiny airplane bathroom.<br/><br/>Great secondary cast here too including Michelle Dockery & Lupita Nyong'o as flight attendants, Julianne Moore as mysterious woman and Anson Mount as suspect #15. 1/20/16"
"BeefMaple","6","0","0","7 April 2015"," Non-Stop is a fun film, but it isn't perfect
","Non-Stop is a film starring Liam Neeson wherein he plays the part of a troubled air marshal who must solve the mystery of who is murdering people on a jet airliner every twenty minutes while being taunted through a string of anonymous text messages. This plot lends itself to many situations where a strong suspension of disbelieve is crucial if the viewer has any intention of having a good time sitting through it.<br/><br/>The ultimate strength of this movie comes from its exceptional use of misdirective writing and the amount of red herring incidents found within the screenplay. There is several times where the plot will convincingly mislead the viewer to suspect the wrong character, including moments where doubt can seep in and make some even question the main protagonist himself. With all that said the actual big reveal and explanation of the antagonist's motives are extremely disappointing and lack any great deal of sense. <br/><br/>The pacing of this film varies from mind numbingly slow and deliberate to heart pounding speed and action. This does lend itself to some dull moments, as well as times were things are happening at such an alarming rate that you might not catch every important detail, all despite its interesting writing. <br/><br/>The soundtrack to this film is mostly subtle, as it should be, but when it isn't the music can be seen as an irritating and overly deliberate attempt to maximize suspenseful moments. A more subliminal soundtrack would have been better to try and achieve this affect throughout all the scenes.<br/><br/>The camera-work for this film is absolutely superb and does an amazing job at capturing the claustrophobic elements of the narrow spaces within an air plane. However, there is some moments during action sequences where some may find the shake-heavy movements of the camera to be jarring or even distracting.<br/><br/>Non-Stop is the kind of film that is Liam Neeson's bread and butter and if you don't find the typical Liam Neeson film stale, than you will definitely adore this movie. However, this film does not differentiate itself enough in this reviewer's opinion to warrant any significant praise not also owed to those other films. It's more of the same. It's a simple movie that is pretending to be complex but does a fun job in doing so."

","Really, is there anything better than a tear jerking Liam Neeson action film? Maybe one starring Jason Statham? This is the legacy of Jerry Bruckheimer, who gifted to us all the unforgettable Armageddon (and we love him for it), and another reminder Hollywood has just gotten better at packaging celluloid sentimentalism with heroic atonement. So good that, even though we pick them apart with relentless critical abandon and expose them for the unrepentant saccharine clichés they are, in the end, deep down, we find ourselves rooting for Liam and suspending disbelief as he embodies the protective father, alcoholic failure and terrorist ass kicker all at once. Only Taken is better (perhaps the best of the genre) and I for one am looking forward to Non-Stop Too, bitches. Curious side-note: tonight I watched Non-Stop for the second time, and it only took 3 Scotch Ales to thoroughly enjoy it as much as I did the first time."

","In anticipation for Liam neesons new action film run all night so I watched his action film from last year non-stop and I must say I am a bit disappointed because it is completely average. The premise of this film sees a US Marshall who is on a flight that is being hijacked and every 20 minutes someone will die unless the hijacker gets 150 million dollars. Now Liam neeson is always great in these roles and this one is no different as he completely commits to the role and makes this film somewhat enjoyable. There is allot of characters in this film and Julianne Moore is good in the film and she is the the most interesting character apart from neeson. Even though there are some other decent performances there characters are not expanded enough to make you care about them. When you look at the story you start to realise just how ridiculous it is, when the deaths happen they are ridiculously convoluted and crazy that you just can't buy it. Also when the reasoning behind the hijackers motivation is revealed it feels underwhelming and doesn't resonate with you. The script has some good dramatic and humorous dialogue but some of it feels cliché and doesn't help make these characters interesting. The style is alright with the film not being a complete action film but having allot of suspense to carry the film and that was interesting. But when the action scenes happened it was a little hard to see what was going on and what was happening. Overall this is not a bad film but it isn't memorable and is totally average."

","What does this title even mean? seriously I know most action flicks have ridiculous names simply to look and sound cool (Rush Hour, Maximum Force, Sudden Death) but this is meaningless. I guess it means the action and suspense is...non-stop, good golly that's some good thinking' right there, what's wrong with...Airplane...oh wait I see. Anyone else notice that some action flick titles are getting really obscure these days, especially Liam Neeson action flicks. I mean seriously...what the hell is 'Unknown' suppose to be?<br/><br/>So anyway Neeson is a recovering alcoholic whose young daughter died from cancer years ago, oh and he also lost his job as a cop...wow. Now he's an air marshal flying from New York to London which he doesn't really enjoy doing. What I initially found amusing was all the stereotypical passengers which are automatically racially profiled, the main target naturally being a Muslim (or at least someone of Middle Eastern descent), a black youth and just a bunch of random looking white people. But as we all know the terror suspect (yeah its that kind of flick as if you didn't know) could be anyone.<br/><br/>A plane load of civvies, one on the edge air marshal, one love interest and one obligatory cute little girl. Then all hell breaks loose as Marks (Neeson) starts getting threat texts on his special air marshal smartphone thing. The whole premise does seem quite ridiculous really, in reality if this happened I'm sure they wouldn't do anything and just land the plane. As they say in the film it would be hard and obvious eventually if someone did start murdering folk on a plane. What also bugged me was the attitude of the passengers on this flight. Marks starts to take control and needs people to cooperate with his instructions and everyone starts whining and bitching. Oh you can't do this, you don't have the right, who put you in charge?? Errmm...he's the fecking air marshal you cretins, he's basically a police officer on the plane, if this dude has reasons to do something then it would be advisable to follow his instructions for your own safety, sheesh!<br/><br/>I'll be honest, this film had me, I genuinely was unsure who would turn out to be the bad guy. You know to suspect everybody of course, in flicks like this we all know half the time its the heroes partner or person he made friends with on the plane or the nerdy guy that comes across as useless and weak (ahem). But yeah I went through everyone thinking ah its gotta be him or her, but I was totally wrong so kudos there. I also didn't know that flights have a special closed wi-fi network or secure line for air marshals, unless of course that's a movie thing. I know wi-fi on international flights isn't really a proper thing yet.<br/><br/>Again I'll be honest, this film did have me on the edge of my seat for the most part. The plot isn't overly original but the slow building tension as things are amped up and Marks is seen as the actual threat does work nicely. I felt quite uneasy during the run time, I found myself really wanting Neeson's character to just explain from the start what has happened. The fact that everything has been recorded on his special smartphone thing (all the serious threats) puts him in the clear so no worries. It frustrates you how Marks seems to keep everything shrouded in mystery and eventually you do begin to side with the annoying passengers. The stupid thing is towards the end he has to tell everyone what's going on anyway to get them on his side and for their help. Naturally everyone does end up believing him so you kinda wonder...why didn't you just do that in the first place Marks!<br/><br/>What I didn't get is the fact that the villains plot only seems to work out by pure coincidence, the threat is someone will die every 20 minutes until this amount of money is transferred into this account blah blah blah. Yet this only happens because the villain is counting on Neeson's character to actually kill someone in his game of tricks...for the most part. So when things seemed to go awry it turns out it was all in this villains master plan anyway...pfft! So if Marks had just ignored it and fallen asleep...would anything had happened?? The villain was depending on Marks and his current unhinged state, without that...I dunno was there a plan B?<br/><br/>Its nice to see Neeson actually play a character who isn't just some uber awesome badass with a halo around his head. Despite the fact he is actually an uber awesome badass he is also a bit of an A-hole too. I mean seriously Marks, you're stampeding around this international flight and scaring the bejesus outta everyone. OK sure the passengers are a typically annoying bunch of moaners but dude...a tad of diplomacy surely, you're not walking your beat here. <br/><br/>So in the end everything turns out OK...what you didn't think it would? Are you suggesting they might leave an open ending so Mr. Neeson can take to the skies again in 'Non-Stop 2: Please Stop' and maybe even 'Non-Stop 3: Why Isn't This Stopping'?? Nope everything gets sorted out and wrapped up in a nice pretty little bow...phew! Can't deny the film was a solid blast of entertainment though, no doubting that, don't watch before flying though...well that goes without saying surely.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

","Non-Stop is a better-than-average action movie that takes place solely in the air. With the only location being an airplane, this action film manages to be quite thrilling and entertaining. I thought this would be a retread of Taken, but in the air but instead it's a complex thriller that has quite a few twists. It's the kind of movie where you'll never quite know who the villain is until they reveal themselves. That is what I liked about this movie.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra's film is about an alcoholic air marshal who has a haunted past. Aboard a transatlantic flight, he receives text messages saying that people will die unless he transfers 150 million dollars into an offshore account. Now in a race against time and unknown villains, Bill Marks must be sure to hit the right mark.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does very well in this role as the grizzly drunk air marshal. When needed, he still features a simple set of action moves that made him a bona-fide action star. Julianne Moore was good, though I feel like her role should have been more challenging. We also get good supporting turns from Scoot McNairy and Lupita N'yongo.<br/><br/>Overall, Non-Stop is a surprisingly great action thriller that is tense and suspenseful. The twists and turns come out at you from each direction, so I must give the screenplay the credit it deserves for not making the film predictable. If you're expecting this film to be Taken in the air, then you're in for a surprise. There are a few action scenes, but not as much as there could have been so this film works more of a thriller thankfully.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"

","Non-Stop is action packed from beginning to end. Bill Marks(Liam Neeson),was an ex NYPD officer at one time; until personal problems hit. Basically his drinking, the loss of his daughter to Cancer, and a failed marriage sent him over the edge. Once fired from the NYPD, he was transferred to TSA. He is now a Federal Air Marshal. He is getting ready to board an international flight to London. He is teamed up with another Marshal, Jack Hammond(Anson Mount). Marks is a nervous flyer especially during take off. Another passenger Jen Summers( Julian Moore), who wants a window seat gets one next to Marks. Once in the air, everything seems to be going smoothly. Bill gets up to go to the lavatory to sneak a smoke. Once he returns he receives a very personal text from one of the passengers. The text tells him to transfer 150 million dollars into account in 20 minutes. Marks gets up to see who it could be; he searches up and down the plane. He then alerts the Captain David McMillian(Linus Roach). The threat has to be reported to TSA, and be verified. Marks tells Nancy(Michelle Dockery) one of the flight attendants, as well as Gwen(Lupita Nyong'o).He knows Nancy well, and explains the situation. He tells her to meet him in the galley in back. Then he walks back to Jen's seat, flashes his badge; and tells her to come back with him. Since the only two people on the flight he trusts at the moment are Jen and Nancy he has a plan. He wants the two to view the cameras ,and tell him who might be using a phone to text. Jen keeps telling Bill, it's the guy up front(Jack). Bill tells her three time it's not him, but then Bill gets suspicious when he sees the camera. He texts Jack back to the galley, they talk; and Jack denies it. Jack returns to his seat, but five minutes later Bill's phone gets a text, Jack comes back to the lavatory with a briefcase. This time Jack and Bill have it out, the texts have been coming from Jack. Jack explains to Bill the money could really help him. This time the fight continues; and jack tries to kill Bill, but Bill breaks his neck in the bathroom. Afterwards Bill discovers what is in the briefcase, Cocaine. Bill, thinking the threat has been neutralized receives another text. Jack Hammond was just a fall guy, the threat is still on the plane. Another text comes through; if the money isn't transferred in twenty minutes someone on the plane will die. Once Bill receives this he notifies the Captain. Captain McMillian finds out the account is in Bill's name. McMillian is ordered to confiscate his badge and gun. McMillian tells Bill to just set back and enjoy the flight. Jen overhears what is going on, but instead of assuming anything she stands by him all the way. Bill refuses to just set back, someone is setting him up, and he his taking matters into his own hands. The texts continue back and forth, and the passengers are starting to ask questions.<br/><br/>Unaware to Bill, and the rest of the passengers are two ex-military passengers, Zack and Tom. They are the ones who are sending these texts to prove a point. They succeed in killing the pilot, and another passenger, Charles Wheeler(Frank Deal). The method they use is darts that are dipped in poison. The darts cause antiphalic shock, it is severe enough once injected nothing can be done. The way things are going makes Bill Marks look like he is the terrorist, due to his background. By then passengers are getting conflicting reports about Marks from the news. Marks goes back to the lavatory, and discovers a bomb. The bomb was hidden in the Cocaine. The bomb is a military style bomb that is impossible to disarm. He has thirty minutes to save the passengers, and with the help of some of them hopefully save the plane. In order to have any chance of survival, they will try a new procedure to protect the people when the bomb detonates. Around this time Bill Marks, and the rest of the passengers find out who is responsible for the terrorism. It is Zack White(Nate Parker); and Tom Bowden(Scoot McNairy). They carry this plan out to extort money from TSA. To show the people how flawed Homeland Security is.<br/><br/>This movie is good, except for some of the ending. No plane can sustain that much damage; and have somewhat of a happy ending. A known fact speaking from having Criminal Justice experience. If a law enforcement officer of any kind has a drug/alcohol problem they are finished. They would not have the opportunity to transfer to another agency. I guess that's why I gave it 8 out of ten. I would have given it a 9 out of ten if it wasn't that exaggerated. I really loved the story; and the way it keeps you guessing. Liam Neeson is also another plus to this film. He is one of my favorite actors who's talent, looks, and style are one of a kind.<br/><br/>THX, Kris L. CocKayne"

","This movie of course manipulates the audience, it has to last almost 2 hours so they created ways to lead us towards one direction, then another. I admit, it had me guessing and in the end all my guesses were wrong.<br/><br/>Ever since he was so successful in ""Taken"" as the special ops guy who can defeat almost anyone in almost any situation, Liam Neeson has had serial success in similar roles. And for good reason, he is big, menacing, and good in those roles.<br/><br/>Here he is Bill Marks, an air Marshall, being assigned to a non-stop overnight flight from New York to London. It is about a 6 to 6 1/2 hour flight. Things seem to be going smoothly, he meets a seemingly nice lady sitting next to him, Julianne Moore as Jen Summers.<br/><br/>When everything is quiet, with the plane at cruising altitude over the Atlantic, things begin to get strange. Bill gets a text message on his secure phone. As more and more messages come through it is clear that someone, most likely on the airplane, wants $150 Million to be transferred to an account otherwise a person will be killed every 20 minutes.<br/><br/>On the surface that would seem easy to sniff out and prevent but it gets very complicated. So almost all of the movie involves Bill's efforts to safe the passengers and save the plane, once he suspects there might also be a bomb onboard.<br/><br/>(As a side note, it was nice seeing Michelle Dockery as one of the flight attendants, Nancy. She is so cute I could watch her in anything.)<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The first person to die, quite mysteriously, was the pilot. Later Bill discovered a hole from the toilet wall to the cockpit and remnants of a blowpipe, he had been shot with a poisonous dart. After he had to fight and kill the other air Marshall he discovered cocaine in that man's briefcase, but hidden inside was also a bomb. The account for the money was actually Bill's account, so he was suspected of being a terrorist, but that was a ruse by the two guilty men, who had a plan to parachute to safety once the plane was brought down to 8000 feet, then the rest would die in the blast and plane crash, allowing them to capture Bill's money that would have been transferred to any number of trusts around the world. But Bill sniffs them out, they are killed, the bomb explodes but having put it near an exit door with all the luggage stacked against it, the copilot was able to crash-land the plane and all survived. Bill and Jen made a date."

","I love events unfolding in real-time. The intended effect filmmakers using this technique want one to have is of being there, and interacting, or feeling as if one has influenced those proceedings unfolding in front of them. However, its still a movie, and needs much more than just technique to propel it forward Non-Stop, as these filmmakers have elected to call this misstep in misdirection.<br/><br/>In spite of that, this still is what's known as a Paisa vasool timepass flick over 'ere. Liam Neeson continues to slum past his prime in no-brainer actioners like this one, and Jan/Feb seems to be the perfect time for his flicks to find multiplexes. <br/><br/>This time, he's the cop on a plane, and no one's quite 'taken' his family - there's a different motivating factor this time around, like it was in 'Unknown'. There is a backstory influencing everything, and the makers try to tie up a few loose ends neatly, but it falls apart if you feign to pay attention to the plot. Instead, like one does at those Transformers movies, don't think, just react to the events unfolding, and you might find the goings-on passable, maybe even plausible, since one needs that, plus oodles of suspension-of-disbelief, esp. towards its eventual denouement, to enjoy this dumb plot. I confess this made for my guilty pleasure, esp. after having watched 'Dallas Buyers club' and 'Nebraska' back-back the previous night. I'd double- billed this one with 'Mr. Peabody and Sherman', so this seemed like more of the same (admittedly, more brainwork was required for processing the former), albeit without the 3D, or Mr. Peabody. <br/><br/>The weakest part, that everyone would have pointed out by now, are the following aspects, IMO:<br/><br/>a. Who the bad guy(s)/gal(s) is/are; b. What motivates(d) them to put this entire movie in motion; and c. How any number of logical actions could have prevented him/her/them from succeeding within the first 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra did infinitely better with Neeson and the rest of the cast of 'Unknown' and that's definitely sayin' somethin'. Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy (fantastic in 'In search of a midnight kiss', 'Argo', 'Killing them softly', 'Monsters'.....), Corey Stoll (one of the best reasons to follow 'House of Cards') and Lupita Nyong'o (12 years a slave - best supporting actress winner) are all gloriously wasted, though I do confess enjoying watching their stock characters interact on the big-screen. Omar Metwally (Munich, Rendition..) stood tall among them all, even taking on Neeson's performance head-head, IMO. I do hope we see more of him (NO pun intended).<br/><br/>The CGI was surprisingly better-than-average; considering the outsourcing trend in Hollywood these days, I thought it'd be crappy like it has been in quite a few big- budget no-brainer actioners in the recent past (I'm lookin' at you, Bruce Willis - for having done 'The cold light of day' and 'A good day to die hard', 2 flicks with some of the most crappiest CGI ever committed on-screen). He's making another one with Neeson called 'Run All Night', and I do hope it turns out better than this one (its got Ed Harris too, so......).<br/><br/>Disposable/forgettable/regurgitated, yet passable entertainment."

"lee_eisenberg","2","3","8","7 July 2014"," Lupita Nyong'o deserves MUCH better than this
","Liam Neeson, once upon a time a serious actor known for roles in ""Schindler's List"" and ""Rob Roy"", now sticks with roles that historically went to Sylvester Stallone, Chuck Norris, etc. The ridiculous ""Non-Stop"" is the latest example. Even more disappointing is the presence of Julianne Moore. She's supposed to star in movies like ""Far from Heaven"" and ""A Single Man"", not action flicks. But the real letdown is the presence of Lupita Nyong'o. An Oscar winner for the role of a slave in ""12 Years a Slave"", she now stars in this. Can't she catch a break?! I looked at director Jaume Collet-Serra's repertoire. It includes the ""House of Wax"" remake. One would hope that as a Catalan, he would make movies about issues affecting Catalonia, such as the independence movement there. As it stands, he's not doing that region any favors.<br/><br/>Yes, I know that this movie wasn't intended to be anything serious. I stand by what I said. THIS MOVIE SUCKS!"

","You usually know what you're gonna get from a Liam Neeson movie. And that is an action-packed adventure that keeps your attention throughout. What I like about his movies is three-fold: He kicks large amounts of ass, he keeps you intrigued, and the fact that they are typically under two hours. Non-Stop is no different; just like Taken the action takes place within twenty minutes from the start, and things snowball from there. Non-Stop does a good job of throwing curve balls to keep you guessing until the very end. Sure, it's not perfect, but it is one of those movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration. I say it is as good as Taken, with a better story, but with a little less hand-to-hand combat. Definitely a must see. Thank you!"
"nsharky-732-789549","3","2","5","15 April 2014"," Entertaining but Somewhat Disappointing
","I usually like movies starring Liam Neeson. So I expected some good entertainment with a healthy dose of realism. I was actually kept guessing throughout the movie and in this respect, I am quite satisfied. However, I am very disappointed in the lack of realism exhibited by the writers. In fact, this has erased practically all the positive feelings I originally had about the movie. What I am particularly disturbed about are the identity and motive of the perpetrator. They illustrate not only a lack of realism, but more importantly a lack of sensitivity. If this was a science fiction movie or if it was completely unrelated to a real-life event, I would not have expected any degree of realism. <br/><br/>Regarding the subject of realism, there is no question in my mind that the vast majority of the 1.5 billion Muslims are peaceful and are against terrorism. However, there is an important distinction between the following two conditional probabilities. The first one is the very low probability of being a terrorist (or backing terrorism) given that the person is Muslim. The second one is the very high probability of being a Muslim given that the person is a terrorist (or backs terrorism). In conclusion, I would have completely enjoyed this movie if the writers chose a more inspiring and realistic scenario. For instance, the perpetrator could have been a Muslim extremist while the person who helped Liam Neeson would still have been a moderate Muslim."

"Troy_Campbell","5","2","5","4 March 2014"," Revisit The Grey instead.
","The next movie in Liam Neeson's badass phase, Non-Stop is the sort of flick that becomes worse, and stupider, the more you think about it. Set aboard a mid-flight airliner where a concealed passenger threatens to kill somebody every 20 minutes unless paid $150m, it initially appears clever and ripe with opportunity. However when the ludicrous third-act twist comes along, it becomes evident just how dumb the plot really is, subsequently making what came before it harder to swallow. Which is a shame because for the first hour or so it's a decent thriller. The claustrophobic setting offers a few splices of tension, the occasional sudden change in the plane's elevation allows director Jaume Collet-Serra to include some choice slow-mo moments and the rare fight sequences – a bathroom brawl a standout – are effective. Neeson gives good gruff as the U.S. Air Marshall attempting to save the day and Michelle Dockery excels as an experienced air hostess conflicted when Neeson's Marshall is posed by the media as a hijacker, however Corey Stoll is dire as a dogged NYPD cop aboard the flight and Julianne Moore seems embarrassed to be there as a frequent flyer and potential love interest. If it weren't for the drivel in the final 30 minutes Non-Stop would be passable cinema fodder, as it is if you're looking for an exciting, interesting and smart Neeson-thriller you should revisit The Grey instead."

","Non-Stop is another highly intense, suspenseful, engaging, entertaining, satisfying action thriller with Liam Neeson stars as the one man action hero (again). Despite an old age of 61, Liam Neeson still got what it takes to be the 'man'. This time around, he's an alcoholic, aerophobic Federal Air Marshal haunted by the past, whose job is to quietly protect flight passengers and ensure that they land safely. The film takes place on an international flight from New York to London.<br/><br/>As usual with many thrillers in the past, the audiences were 'invited' to play guessing games as the film progresses...who's the real hijacker? What actually happened? What's going to happen? How the next victim going to be killed? Who's the next victim? What will our main hero do next? This film is in many ways similar to Taken, another brilliant action thriller with Liam Neeson as an ex-CIA agent trying to rescue his daughter, but less violent and more suspense. the film does raise a few questions on flight security, the various precautions and measures taken against terrorism since 9/11.<br/><br/>Yes, the film has too many contrivances (However, Within the film's context, some of the contrivances work well though)...Sure, the plot is flawed and cliché-ridden...but it's sure one hell of a ride! Who cares when Liam Neeson is here to kick ass? This is one of those guilty pleasure movies, the ones that aren't great but we love for some reason.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 (Sorry, I enjoyed it very much) http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/02/movie-review-non-stop.html"

","Spoilers! It's engrossing & suspenseful but in that almost too painful to watch way. Right off the bat then again every few minutes there's another absurd plot flaw. Why is a known alcoholic still employed as an Air Marshal? Why does Neeson order a drink he won't be served cuz the flight attendants know he's on duty? So hello passenger next to me: that's not oddly noticeable, she got her drink but he water when they ordered the same thing at the same time?? Why is the airline confirming a highjcking in progress to the news-seen on the plane live-identifying Neeson? How's that not make the situation more dangerous. Why are the passengers so belligerent (how about a racist stereotype of a rough black guy-really??)? Why is Neeson acting so volitlle & rough almost immediately? Again, creating passenger anxiety is counterintuitive?? Why can the tech guy turn on & find the highjackers phone but no one suggests he try to unlock it? Then why & I think this may be the most absurd of all, does Moore suggest GUESSING at the phones passcode? Why do they insist on disconnecting the planes WiFi?? Is it dangerous or something? It THAT what highjacked the plane-really how on earth does that help foil the way-too-quickly-concluded suspect Neeson's evil plan? It was so poorly written that I was waiting for the next huge gaping plot hole rather than what's going to happens next. So many so often I found it far more WTF frustrating than disappointing. Kinda feel sorry for Hollywood's pathetic miss on what could have been a great movie!

","""Non-Stop"" is an action/thriller film about Bill Marks, an air marshal on a non-stop transatlantic flight from New York to London. Midway over the Atlantic Ocean, Marks receives a series of threatening text messages from an unidentified source claiming that unless $150 million are transferred to an off-shore account, a passenger will die every 20 minutes. As the body count starts to rise, Marks is forced to spring into action to find the perpetrator, save the passengers and clean his name.<br/><br/>The movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra and stars Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Lupita Nyong'o and Scoot McNairy. The script is written by John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle.<br/><br/>Jaume Collet-Serra did a great job regarding the film's direction, keeping the tension throughout the whole film and presenting each character in a way that makes you suspect of their true intentions, even with Marks. The screenplay by Richardson, Roach and Engle takes the premise of a plane hijacking and adds many unexpected twists to it, which results in a great story that manages to keep your attention from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives an incredible performance as Bill Marks, the U.S. federal air marshal caught in the hijacking. Neeson is able to show the melancholic nature of his character as well as his tough part when he's required to take matters into his own hands, showing what makes him one of the greatest action stars of our time.<br/><br/>The movie manages to make you feel immersed in the story, like if the theater was the plane and you were sitting in one of the plane's seats instead of the theater seat.<br/><br/>All this elements make ""Non-Stop"" a great film, a movie that provides non-stop action and thrills to its audience."
"JustAnEpicPerson","7","2","6","19 April 2014"," Calling it, one of the most disappointing of movies of 2014
","I told my friend that we should see a movie this weekend. Please keep in mind, I already saw the new Captain America, and nothing interested us. We saw Non-Stop, because the poster and trailer looked cool, and the reviews were too bad.<br/><br/>Damn, even for an 8 dollar matinée, that was disappointing.<br/><br/>Let's start. The first 10 minutes are probably the most boring part of the movie, unless you like seeing Liam Neeson getting in a metal detector and helping little girls. Now obviously, I'm not going to complain about the first 10 minutes all that much, but they really could of made it better.<br/><br/>Then we get on the plane, where we see everybody on the plane, excepted for THE ACTUAL Villain. How the hell does this movie think I'm supposed to guess who the villain is if we don't see him until the last 20 minutes? Oh wait, I forgot the story. The story is that Liam Neeson gets a text message saying he will kill somebody on the plane every 20 minutes until the text messages gets 150 million dollars.<br/><br/>Now the first '20 minute kill' is ridiculous, THERE IS NO WAY THAT HE COULD OF POSSIBLY KILLED HIM EXACTLY 20 MINUTES. Now, some people are complaining the movie is too perfect, and it is.<br/><br/>Let's skip some part where we see Liam beat up random citizens, yada yada, slow stuff.<br/><br/>One thing I did like is that it gives you clues throughout. Like at first, you had to pick ANYBODY. Then later, it tells you it's not a passenger and stuff (spoiler it is). Another good thing was the acting wasn't too shabby. I was impressed with Liam Neeson and even the little girl did a good job acting.<br/><br/>We do end up meeting the villain, and by then, we all want to know why he is doing this. When I heard why, I laughed so freaking hard. Speaking of laughing, their is so many scenes that try to be dramatic, but it's just laughably bad. He wants to kill air marshals because of 9/11? So wait, you're going kill the air marshals, who do their possible best everyday to protect the plane, instead of killing terrorists who is the reason WHY 9/11 happened in the first place? Also, if you wanted revenge on the air marshal so bad, why did you ask for 150 million dollars instead of just killing the passengers. Are you saying your dad is worth 150 million dollars, and you rather take that instead of revenge? Then we get to some action. This movie describes itself as an Action flick, the trailer and poster, and even the IMDb genre is titled as an action flick. Only the last 20 or so minutes is action. And even when we do, the cheapest possible CGI is used. I remember somewhat complaining about the CGI in The Winter Soldier at some points, and I actually want to take back what I said about the Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>After all the crappy CGI mess, they land, and (pretty much) everybody gets off safely. By then, I was waiting by the exit of theater to leave.<br/><br/>Even for 8 dollars, don't buy a ticket for this crap. If you do want to see this, pop it for free on TV or a dollar at Redbox."
"bobbystryker","10","2","6","2 March 2014"," Liam Neeson's latest action-thriller is Non-Stop awesomeness!!! Read on to find out why this is probably the best film of the year so far!!!
","This is one rocking movie and Liam Neeson once again proves why when it comes to tense, gritty, grounded action, he's the best man for the job. With a resume including Oscar winning material such as Schindler's List and not to forget the fact that he's trained Batman, Obi Wan, The A-Team, Darth Vader and he is both Aslan and Zeus, in short, Liam Neeson is just one awesome dude!<br/><br/>Unlike Jason Statham, Arnie, Stallone and the other usual action suspects, Neeson brings a certain vulnerable quality to his roles, makes them human, believable, which of course just pulls you in as the viewer. His first real foray into the world of action was Taken. A one-man army type story we've seen from Luc Besson many a time before (The Transporter series, the much underrated Kiss of The Dragon etc). The movie was a huge success thanks to Neeson's poignant performance. I saw the movie shortly after the passing of Neeson's wife, Natasha Richardson, which made his desperation in the movie seem all the more real. It was a huge success and is still one of my favourite action movies. Neeson followed up Taken with the pretty great Unknown, Taken 2, The Grey and now Non-Stop.<br/><br/>Non-Stop may even be better than Taken. It's a close call, but it's at least as good as Taken was.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bill Marks, a troubled U.S. federal air marshal on board what should be a normal flight like any other. He soon starts receiving sinister messages on his phones encrypted air marshal instant messaging service with demands that 150 million dollars be transferred to an offshore account or a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes until the demands are met. The threat proves to be a real one and it becomes a race against time for Bill to try and identify the killer. 149 passengers, 149 suspects!<br/><br/>This is a fantastic film. The tension grips you from the moment the text messages start rolling in and it doesn't relent until the movie reaches its satisfying close. A super tense, edge of your seat, whodunit thriller, which keeps you guessing right to the end. <br/><br/>The action is tight and well choreographed but it's the drama which keeps you hooked. I especially loved how besides Neeson's character, there are several other fleshed out and important characters which made proceedings that much more real. Julianne Moore is of course pretty great as always. My only gripe was that I wish the fantastic Lupita Nyong'o from 12 Years a Slave had a more substantial role.<br/><br/>The film ends with a bang on a very satisfying note and left me wanting to watch it again. There were no lulls or slow moments, once the momentum picks up, the movie just keeps going.<br/><br/>Wristwatch fans should also be kept happy, look out for a nice close up shot of a Patek Philippe. If you know what model it is, please write in to us!<br/><br/>I can't wait for this to come out on Blu-ray!<br/><br/>Highly recommended, an excellent thriller, catch it on the big screen while you can!<br/><br/>Rating 10 out of 10<br/><br/>FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"

","'Non-Stop' is yet another action vehicle for Liam Neeson and director Jaume Collet-Serra, having previously worked together in 'Unknown'. Entertaining and thrilling, but this flight is a long one.<br/><br/>1. For the most part, the movie has a mysterious and intriguing setup. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sucked in at the beginning. The plot involves former cop and now 'Federal Air-Marshall' Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) as he reluctantly performs his duty overseeing a red-eye flight from New York to London. He soon begins to receive random and threatening text messages from a mysterious terrorist who just may be one of the passengers on board. I honestly thought the plot might have been straight forward, but it ends up being more intricate and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>2. As interesting of a mystery this film is, it turns into more of a thriller not long after. When the unknown figure lives up to his threats, the tension begins to build as Liam Neeson races against the clock to find the killer. However, all good things must come to an end. For a movie that has a great beginning and middle, the twist that is revealed in the last third is heavily underwhelming. The film plays to it's advantage as a suspenseful thriller, but looses all momentum when it delves into the generic action realm at the end. It feels like studio interference to the original script.<br/><br/>3. If there is one saving grace, it is Liam Neeson himself. For an actor who has jumped into action films in recent years, Neeson is still a theatrically trained actor and he delvers an exceptional performance no matter what he stars in. Julianne Moore, Corey Stoll and Michelle Dokery round out the cast. Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o also appears, but she is completely misused in her role. This film was on the brink of being something more than what it was, but it all comes down to wasted potential. I personally enjoy thrillers, but I was disappointed to say the least.<br/><br/>Even though the movie lost a lot of points for the climax, It was still an entertaining flick. If you're a fan of Liam Neeson, then no matter the flaws, this would still be on your watch-list."
"Scarecrow-88","7","1","2","26 November 2015"," Non-Stop
","An alcoholic, disgraced NYC cop divorcée, Bill Marks (Liam Neeson), who lost his daughter to cancer has been an US Marshall on board planes serving as a protector, but his job will get a bit complicated: a terrorist is on board and using text messages (there's this savvy use of on screen text, a visual that ably communicates to us what he reads on his phone and responds in kind) to indicate a death-every-twenty-minutes threat which further makes matters worse when he's implicated as the one responsible for holding a plane full of passengers hostage in the sky! He will need to find out who is sending him messages and poisoning people (the head pilot dies as does a passenger first believed to be the terrorist), as well as, find and dispose of a bomb found in his fellow Marshall's case (Anson Mount; trafficking cocaine, engaging Neeson in hand-to-hand combat within a restroom in a memorable sequence), with protecting everyone on board a top priority becoming increasingly difficult. With tensions among the passenger manifest growing, impatient with his efforts to search out a terrorist, using physical methods when necessary (his ""roughing around certain passengers"" routine does not ingratiate himself to those on the plane at all), and his own law enforcement on the ground believing he has become a loose cannon needing money wired to a trust account (this whole elaborate set up thanks to quite a brilliant mastermind), with a media now condemning him as guilty, Marks has mounting obstacles uprising against him. Can he weed out the real culprit? <br/><br/>Preposterous plot (really, the eventual unmasking of the ones responsible for this whole affair and the reasoning behind why is just a doozy) and implausible conclusion involving altitude, a bomb going off, and a heroic landing, ask a lot of us, that's for sure. If Neeson wasn't in charge of this, as if a sheriff in charge of Tombstone, then Non Stop would be a hard pill to swallow. But, dammit, if he doesn't hold this together through star power alone! Julianne Moore gets the equivalent of a paycheck part as a passenger sitting next to him, becoming one of a few that totally trusts him. She is just fine, given a bit of a back-story involving a heart condition and secretive about her past, because Moore's a pro, but this kind of film is really beneath her caliber of talent at this point in her career. Neeson, however, has become an amazing model for a geriatric hero, once occupied by the likes of John Wayne and Clint Eastwood, so good at this action hero gig he defies age and is believable in the parts assigned him. How Neeson is able to continue to do this and not become a joke is a testament to his charisma and on screen prowess. He is the whole show, here, doggedly in charge of rooting out the bad guy(s) and rescuing the innocent, doing whatever it takes to save the day. At the end of the day, no matter the plot developments and complexities that are simply too unbelievable to accept rationally, it comes down to the hero before you and whether or not he is compelling enough to dedicate your time to. Neeson is such an actor.<br/><br/>Going back to Moore, I do think she has good chemistry with Neeson who starts to rely on her and a stewardess he has grown to trust during his time as a US Marshall while on the plane. The discovery of how the pilot died, as an example, due to a hole in a restroom he goes to smoke a cig on occasion shows you how the film goes through its grab bag to help the hero solve his case. The film's pace, busy plot, and active hero keeps things rolling, hoping we don't try and stop to think about it. Corey Stoll of Ant-Man is a NYC cop, Scoot McNairy a school teacher, and Michelle McDockery a trustworthy stewardess with important parts in the film among an extensive supporting cast."

I was intrigued from beginning to end.

Watching this movie, reminds me not to pass judgment.

There is an anonymous passenger on board who threatens to start killing the passengers if a large sum of money is not deposited into an account. Marks then pilots into action to save the day. Sure, you could call this flick ""Taken on a Plane"", but somehow this one worked for me. Director Jaume Collet-Sera steered the movie with intensity which kept me on the edge of my seat; so que Sera, Sera. The script sure had its flaws, but who cares; this is not a movie that flies on dialogue. Neeson was tough as nails as Marks. A underutilized Julianne Moore flies coach in this one with a supporting role as a female passenger who inadvertently gets caught up in the action; sure one always wants more from Moore, but it seems like she was just flying high and having fun with this role. "" Non-Stop"" is not a showstopper of a flick, but it won't give you much of a red eye of boredom. So hop on this cinematic flight and have fun with it. **** Good"

"templar77099","7","1","2","14 June 2015"," The Best of Jaume Collet-Serra
","The collaboration between Liam Neeson and the director Jaume Collet- Serra spans three movies : ""Unknown""(2011), ""Non-Stop""(2014) and ""Run All Night""(2015). Having seen all of them, I can certainly say that ""Non-Stop"" was the most enjoyable, at least to me. Although the plot is a bit generic, during the film some characters are given more depth and some twists happen. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson is Bill Marks, a ex-NYPD cop turned into a US Air Marshall. With an haunted past, Bill is a sour man who refugees himself in alcohol to continue living his life. <br/><br/>All the film takes place on a plane travelling for New York to London. When the plane is crossing the Atlantic, Bill receives a text message from an unknown passenger who threatens to kill one passenger at every 20 minutes if 150 Million Dollars are not wired to an account. Bill will do anything that it takes to protect his fellow passengers.<br/><br/>As I remarked above, the plot is a bit generic. However, the ensemble cast is very solid, turning this movie into something more personal than the usual action flick. Liam Neeson reprises the role he has been doing for the last couple of years : The Badass. Although and despite other movies, in this one his character is given depth and real emotions. Julianne Moore is quite god as Jen Summers, a passenger with a troubled past; Scott McNairy is also very solid portraying the deceiving character of Tom Bowen; Michelle Dockery and Lupita Nyong'o are remarkable as the two flight attendants; Nate Parker is a bit of a comic relief as Zack White; Jason Butler Harner was truly a revelation, as I had never seen him in other feature, as Kyle Rice. <br/><br/>The scenes are directed very cleanly and Collet-Serra strengthens the thriller with close-up shots and very well directed action scenes which happen on very closed spaces, almost claustrophobic (30 minutes in and will be astonished by one of those scenes). The soundtrack also provides the movie some more intensity.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Non-Stop"" is an excellent action movie with twists and turns and an amazing cast. I was quite surprised with it, never thinking it would so good.<br/><br/>Give it a shot and you won't be disappointed."

","Non-Stop is a very pleasurable action thriller.<br/><br/>Another one of those movies that I just liked immediately after it began. Some movies are like that, some, very few movies.<br/><br/>As long as you don't expect another Taken, (this is thriller-material) you will probably have a very good time. Sure, there are some plot holes, I did not notice any during the movie, but have had them pointed out, but we (well you) should all stop focusing so damn much on plot holes. As long and they are not right in your face, and/or really poorly explained away, they don't matter.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is good, as he always is. the movie is kind of tense, and pretty exciting. I love plane-movies, planes look so nice and cozy in movies. Relaxed me.<br/><br/>So there you have it! I don't need to say more. Non-Stop is a well made, entertaining, action-thriller."
"orourkec-292-269155","7","1","2","5 May 2015"," Mostly satisfying.
","I saw NON-STOP at the cinema and I loved it. To me NON-STOP was an astounding thriller with a strong build-up, tense setup, reasonable amount of tension and suspense, an overall solid screenplay and a noteworthy performance from Liam Neeson whose character you can easily care for and embodies a role that is absolutely compelling. Even Julianne Moore and the supportive cast was good. The characters are interesting. Talking about interesting characters and tense setup at the beginning of my review I have enormous difficulties understanding the critics consensus for NON- STOP on the Rotten Tomatoes site saying that NON-STOP wastes its cast, not to mention its tense setup and premise that hinges on a thoroughly unbelievable final act!!! I have enormous difficulties understanding it because in the movie I see the exact contrary: the movie doesn't waste its cast nor its setup or premise and it leads to a final act that is very believable so could someone please tell me why on earth is this critics consensus saying that!!! Anyways, moving on now. The fact that the movie included a 5 years old girl character who has never taken a plane before in her life and is scared of taking the plane and she suddenly and unexpectedly gets caught up in the midst of the horrible things that happen during the story made the film more important than what it already was. The movie makes yet another good job of making you haunted non-stop throughout the movie with this one question: ""WHO is the guilty person on this plane?"" However the movie bothered me a bit with its lack of style and plot which I didn't find was original. Furthermore, I thought that there was a bit too much or too much of ""I'm sorry"" in the film. Nevertheless NON-STOP is a ride I'm not ready to forget. My rating: 8.0/10"
"Leofwine_draca","7","1","2","29 November 2014"," Decent plane-bound murder mystery
","NON-STOP is another movie featuring Liam Neeson in his newfound 'hard man' role following on from the success of TAKEN. This time around, he's a boozy Air Marshall working a routine flight who suddenly finds himself caught up in a murder mystery involving ransom demands and some high-octane action. Pretty soon it's a race against the clock to stop the murderer from committing any more crimes.<br/><br/>I wasn't sure what to expect from this film, given the middling reviews; after all, Neeson's last film UNKNOWN was a disappointment. The good news is that NON-STOP is a lot better, a film that holds it together for the most part. The main thing is that it keeps you watching throughout with nary a slow moment in sight. Neeson is on strong form as the grumpy antihero and I particularly liked his brutal treatment of the suspects - no nice-guy pussyfooting around here, just blunt force when needed. Inevitably the scriptwriters throw in a few fight scenes to keep action fans happy and they all work very well. The script is tight and focused and kept realistic as possible, only becoming over the top in a few moments.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect, but the problems tend to be minor. I could have done without the SHERLOCK-copying on-screen texts, and I could have also done without the disappointing Julianne Moore once more forced down our throats in a role she really isn't suited for. In fact, not many of the supporting cast are that great, apart from maybe Linus Roache. Still, this is a film which is all about the plot and for the most part it works; I know I enjoyed it."
"jharmer","5","1","2","8 September 2014"," Starts with promise, loses plot at the end
","Non-stop is another Liam Neeson action flick, the type he surprised everyone with in Taken and is now wearing out somewhat! In this film, he plays Bill Marks (No, no, not Bryan Mills - pay attention) a washed up loser with tragedy in his past who has, luckily for everyone else, found employment as an Air Marshal. What could go wrong! The film starts well enough, the familiar drudgery of airport queues and security, then onboard the plane. (Note to the writers. British Aqualantic? Really?) There are clearly clues ongoing here, furtive glances between the crew, Julianne Moore's character managing to sit next to Neeson's etc. Once airborne, Marks' starts to receive threatening text messages on his unusually archaic looking smartphone, a person unknown is planning to kill a passenger every twenty minutes unless they get $150m pronto. As the story progresses, it works well, there is tension, puzzlement and a clever twist in the first death. Things quickly fall apart and Marks' finds himself at the centre of suspicion rather than the saviour of the aircraft, after more deaths, mutiny by the passengers, and the discovery of a bomb, another clever twist reveals the truth.<br/><br/>And then it all falls apart. The rationale behind the hijack makes no sense, the pair of hijackers do not seem to work together.<br/><br/>The plane manages to descend so that a violent explosion of the bomb doesn't destroy it, although it looks like it should, and then - as if tacked on as an after thought - an emergency landing is made as completely unaffected pieces of the plane fail. In an entirely unnecessary scene, a section of the forward fuselage fails, endangering a young girl who Marks heroically saves, thus vindicating his torment over his own dead daughter. It was a silly, unrealistic scene that, added to the poor CGI, was the undoing of the film.<br/><br/>In short, what was a pretty good mystery thriller for 2/3 of the film, fell apart in the last 1/3."

","I have to say, I was expecting this movie to be an all out Action movie. I don't usually enjoy Thrillers but this was absolutely amazing. I loved every second of it. Liam Neeson is a very convincing character and his characters background adds to the story. It was a brilliant movie, however it wasn't the absolute best. The storyline in the movie is pretty good and very gripping. I'd say this is a Thriller/Mystery film with some Action, which overall makes this a pretty interesting movie. I have to say it wasn't the most realistic movie ever made but it was pretty close. I've never seen any Liam Neeson movies before this, but this movie makes me want to watch more of his movies."

","This is straight from the heart of Hollywood because no film industry on the planet comes better than Hollywood in making action suspense movies. But with most stories these days the inevitable part, 'clichés' are present in the film but are fairly taken care of and executed. This is a one man movie that slips in every frame of the film till its end, the lead man Liam Neeson. The guy is suddenly on a rescue mission and the suspense starts to build around the bad guy who is mysterious. I have always liked Liam Neeson's style, serious, mature with an elegant face and to the point on his job. In this movie he delivers that job straight.<br/><br/>You know the movie from some point in the film (not initially) and some twists do turn the movie every minute. The bad part is, the background of the lead character was less built, his emotions were not precisely shown; well here he (Neeson) is not that kind of a guy either and then an average & predictable ending.<br/><br/>On and on, the suspense works fairly but the movie does not relate to its title, Liam Neeson's acting is again good and lastly its good 106 minutes if you don't have better choices in the shelf for now.6/10 stars."

","Liam Neeson in the movie 'Non Stop' has played the role of a father, a hunter and a cop well, as expected from a successful and experienced action star. Unlike his most of the films, Neeson(Bill) in the movie is more fallible than usual. He is not especially clever or resourceful, just honest. He fights well but not invincibly, but tries to do his best when needed. Although it is hard to swallow that he is an air marshal being an alcohol addict, but it is convincing given the depression in the past because of the death of his young daughter and the downward spiral of his life.<br/><br/>Most of the film takes place on a flight from New York to London. Midway Bill starts getting text saying passengers will die regularly unless he convinces the agencies to pay $150 million into an account - which turns out to be his own. Basically Bill was being set up as a desperate hijacker. From this point, Bill has to face both agencies and passengers on the plane itself, as he is now being considered as the hijacker. The sequence of deaths on the plane also troubles Bill as he is unable to convince rest of the passengers.<br/><br/>The story keeps the suspense till the end keeping the interest of the audience and gluing them to the screens. The suspicion also varies over different persons on the plane as the time passes and different twists and turns appear, confusing Bill and building a thrilling ending.<br/><br/>The revelation of who is behind this is a kind of a spoiler, but it has an exciting ending. The movie is fun and a must watch."

","The movie did well on delivering what it aimed to give the audience. It gave thrills, suspense, and mystery. The acting was done well though some of the characters lacked chemistry and line delivery struggled at points. The writing was good and the story had some originality to it. The real problem is with the ending which, like an airplane crashing, dive bombs from a high level of action and suspense to an unsatisfactory and empty ending. A good movie with a bumpy landing for an ending is an enjoyable movie that the whole family can enjoy! I am rating Non-Stop a 6 because the story and characters are engaging and it definitely adds suspense for the viewer! Yet it lacks re-watch ability due to lack of chemistry between actors, some bad line delivery, and crash landing of an ending."

We do not understand the full situation and are kept along with Marks as he progresses through different situations.<br/><br/>The action scenes were really well planned and put together.

Though there was this one point around the climax where I thought he was overdoing it a bit, but I guess that might have just been his character as he gets more desperate to find the criminal. Julianne Moore was great as well, but I feel that her character was a bit shallow. Last but not least, Michelle Dockery was fantastic, (I am kind of biased towards her as I love Downton Abbey) her facial expressions and her delivery were just spot on.<br/><br/>A few things I did not like: One, Liam Neeson's character seems to be able to defy the force of being sucked out of an aeroplane.

","A former cop Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who is now an air marshall is on a transatlantic flight from New York to London. This seemingly routine flight is interrupted when he gets a series of messages from an unknown person stating that he will kill one person every 20 minutes unless $150 million dollars is transferred into a specified account. However, with several hundred people on board the aircraft (nearly all of which have mobile phones), Marks finds himself in a race against time to try and find out who is sending these messages before this unknown assailant puts his plans into motion.<br/><br/>If you like films that are exciting, suspenseful and films that keep you guessing then this film will be right up your street. From the very first time Marks get a message from the assailant to the very end of the film, this film leaves the viewer in a constant state of suspense. The audience have no idea who is doing this to Marks, why they are doing it. Marks also has no idea who and why. He tries various methods to try and find the perpetrator - some methods are ethical, some not so. Whatever is happening, I, as a viewer, was constantly left guessing.<br/><br/>Neeson is solid in the role of Bill Marks and anyone who has seen the 2 Taken Films and Unknown will like his performance (some may argue that it is becoming overly familiar). Personally, I find myself in the former camp and happen to think that, not only is Neeson good in this type of role, but he's also well suited to this type of role. Julianne Moore was OK, although I know she is capable of much better. The rest of the supporting cast do OK.<br/><br/>Non Stop is not a perfect film and if you stop to think about it there are certain aspects that are hard to believe; this whole scenario existing post 9/11 is a tough sell. I think it depends how you look at it; if you look at it from a negative perspective you will dismiss it as a stupid implausible thriller with a ridiculous premise. However, if you look at it positively you will see a film which is potentially opening everyone's eyes to the potential dangers that can occur when a major breach of security occurs - therefore creating an utterly plausible scenario. From a personal perspective I can see both sides of the argument, but the way I look at it is that this film is billed on IMDb as 'Action' 'Mystery' and 'Thriller' and it blends all three elements superbly. In other words, I got exactly what I both wanted and expected so for that reason I enjoyed this film."

","Which kinda would be difficult since this plays in midair. Liam Neeson would obviously never have guessed he'd become an action hero this late in his career, but Taken did push him into things like this. There was also The Grey which felt a bit like The Thing from Carpenter but with different kinds of beasts. The question this raises is: Is Liam Neeson a beast himself (well the character he's playing)? Depending on your view on things, this may be interesting.<br/><br/>We get a few clichés, though I have to admit, I did not see one of the things coming. The guessing game is not a bad one, even though it does stretch the logic bit a little. But the movie is fast paced and has a thrilling edge to it, so it won't bore you. A nice thriller that does everything it is expected to do. More than good entertainment value. Nothing less, nothing (much) more"

","Non-Stop has Liam Neeson ('Taken') in a tailor-made role for him. Neeson has starred in a number of action films of late and has a steady popular following.

The plane he is on, to London, has someone perpetuating text messages attempting to nab millions of dollars. The threatening messages are sent to the air Marshall's mobile phone. He springs to action in an Agatha Christie style plot. <br/><br/>There is a build-up of suspense and suspicion and there is Julianne Moore as a feisty and friendly passenger, but is she trustworthy.<br/><br/>This movie hinges on paranoia, suspicion and intensity, and it doesn't quite come together.

","When an action film offers an interesting premise along with Liam Neeson as the leading man, one expects nothing short of an exciting and enjoyable experience, and Non-Stop does prove satisfying, even if somewhat nonsensical. In large part, the audience is exposed to great levels of unpredictability and very mysterious circumstances, as an air marshal attempts to save his fellow passengers on a trans-Atlantic flight from a terrorist attack. The film is gripping and thrilling throughout, with plenty of tense moments maintaining the feeling of suspense, however it certainly deserved a much more clever final act, rather than concluding as a conventional action film. Although Liam Neeson does again perform well in a leading action role, one cannot help but argue that the rest of the cast, which included such notable names as Julianne Moore, should have been utilized far better. Overall, Non-Stop comes across as an enthralling action film with a rather ludicrous storyline, which is initially well-developed but unfortunately seems to lack a fitting end."

"Robert_duder","7","1","2","23 March 2014"," Neeson fans may find this outing a little dry
","Liam Neeson has been a Hollywood heavyweight for awhile. He's a versatile and well known actor with the most debonair Hollywood vibe about him. But I don't think it was until Taken became a run away smash action hit that Neeson was catapulted (at 56 years old) to action hero bad ass. He followed that every year with another ""actioner"" type hit like The Grey, Taken 2 and Unknown. So Non-Stop was destined to be a hit. He is sort of mirroring the type of action career Bruce Willis saw in the late eighties following his Die Hard fame. Non-Stop is a decent film, but its far from great. It feels very rushed, was definitely put together to put out Neeson's next big pre-spring hit. His character is very flawed and that's okay but they really focus on his flaws. The mystery that is happening is okay but the suspects are everywhere and most of them feel a little forced and obvious. Its sort Wes Craven's Scream but in an air-plane. The pacing of the film is good and it isn't dull by any means. Considering the entire film takes place in that air-plane, it never feels confined except when they want it to. The mystery aspect could be compared to Neeson's other hit ""Unknown"" but I felt that mystery had much better writers and more thought put into it.<br/><br/>Thanks to Liam Neeson's undeniable charisma on screen he definitely keeps Non-Stop doing exactly that. While his alcoholic deeply disturbed character might be a little dark for this film, he pulls it off and you still root for him. A lesser actor would have made you not care whether he succeeded or not. Julianne Moore...ohhh Ms. Moore. Sometimes I just can't handle you. She's definitely on my least favourite actors list and yet sometimes she manages to surprise me (Carrie remake) but this was no exception. Moore is bland, boring, and she overacts a very simple character that was almost unnecessary. She is sort of the Sandra Bullock of Speed but with none of the chemistry, charisma or story. Moore is a waste and brings the cast down. The only other member of the supporting cast I feel is worth mentioning specifically would be Corey Stoll who plays an irate and macho NYPD officer who gets into Neeson's face a lot. His character is blatant, obvious, and not unique in any way but he does as good as he can with what the script gives him. Blink and you'll miss a tiny role from recent Academy Award Winner Lupita Nyong'o, a wide eyed deer in the headlights performance from Michelle Dockery (was there something more to her relationship with Neeson? It felt implied but never explored), and decent supporting roles from Scoot McNairy and Nate Parker.<br/><br/>Non-Stop is decently entertaining. It won't floor you by any means and it isn't anything absurdly unique but it is what it is...a thriller and it serves that purpose. Jaume Collet-Serra is a mostly new director but he did helm the absolutely brilliant horror/thriller Orphan and this is not nearly as smart as that was. But he definitely holds your attention and keeps you on the edge just enough. I think the biggest stumbling block for Non-Stop is the script. Its a little messy and unpolished and feels rushed. The writing team has very little credits to their names and the projects they have worked on are not anything like this. Still if you're in the mood for a popcorn flick and go in with mediocre expectations you'll come out feeling good. Its a far cry from Neeson's best but it works. 7/10"

The initial premise for this film is very clever but ultimately the twist fails to deliver and seems a little far from practical within the Universe the film creates. While I can quite easily forgive Liam Neeson taking on another middle aged man dealing with personal issues. These roles are clearly the best way for him to vent his own anger for the awful personal bereavement he himself has experienced, and why not, he plays these roles so well. Less forgiving is the film ultimately failing to deliver on the premise it sets up so well. That said, the film is never boring. The writing cleverly points and re points to the possible killer, even though I was pretty sure I knew who it would turn out to be early on and I wasn't wrong. <br/><br/>The supporting actors do a great job too, this is an enjoyable romp, nothing more.

"ctmanit-mittal","6","1","2","15 March 2014"," good movie
","In his late-age reinvention as an action hero, Neeson picks up from where he left in Serra's last film 'Unknown'. Here he is a federal air marshal aboard an aircraft where a passenger is threatening to kill those aboard one by one unless $150 million is wired into his/her account. The premise is interesting, and Non-Stop makes some effort to stretch the tension and to establish Bill (Neeson) as an unstable character – till invariably the invariables catch up. There is only so much action one can pack inside an aircraft – even with made- for-film larger aisles – there are only so many people Bill can haul rather cruelly for questioning, and there are only so many angles you can explore over phone calls and text messages. The 150 people aboard and their back stories could make a better film but Non-Stop is neither interested in it, nor even implies this from its name. Neeson's weather-beaten, frowning grimace is complimented by an irritatingly equanimous Moore, a solemn Muslim doctor who is called upon to redeem his faith, an air hostess who is here, there everywhere – unlike the non-existent Lupita (12 Years a Slave) Nyong'o – and a tangent that embarrassingly literally evokes the air marshal's dead daughter. And just when you think that the saving grace is that the ""terrorist"" only wants money, the film throws up more million dollar questions. Just the ones with no answers."
"tiffanyyongwt","8","1","2","13 March 2014"," The movie is almost an Argo...
","re you one of Liam Neeson's fans? I mean, he's almost every girls' dream dad ever since Taken (ok, at least for me). The movie is almost an Argo (like a 75% of Argo if you've watched the award-winning film). What I love146 passengers, 146 suspects.<br/><br/>It's like reading a mystery novel, it gives just enough hints for you to suspect the same person (if you are thinking or guessing when you watch) as Bill Marks, just about the same time he discover. The film doesn't give you hints to let you know right at the start, it made you sit on the edge, wanting to find out the murderer before the Air Marshall.<br/><br/>Bill Marks ain't the perfect nor predictable hero here. He had drinking problems, he smokes in the toilet (illegally) when he's nervous, he's in debts, he might even be a little crazy, to the extent where you might wonder if he was the delusional antagonist instead of the protagonist (especially after the first person was killed in the plane, exactly as planned/threatened). I like how the action scenes were handled (cleverly). A slight spoiler will be the tremendous fight sequence in the tiny airplane bathroom, where I was surprised how they could fight in a space so tight that punches could hardly be thrown.<br/><br/>The Disputable Scenes The suspicious, potentially a hijacker, characters were highlighted right from the start. Some say they are over-qualified to be in the supporting cast, with oh-too-little lines. This is especially so for ""Downton Abbey""'s Lady Mary—Michelle Dockery—as the main flight attendant Nancy, Lupita Nyong'o of ""12 Years a Slave"", who spouts barely five lines on camera, Scoot McNairy of ""Argo"" as the skinny nervous guy with glasses and Corey Stoll from Netflix's ""House of Cards"" as the evil-looking NYPD cop. Yes, I do agree they might have too little a screen-time, but I love how they acted with their body instead of lines. Their eyes and gestures were doing more acting (see Michelle Dockery's interaction with the co-pilot), they made the film amazing.<br/><br/>What Can be better Read more: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/02/27/non-stop-movie-review/"

","In similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on par with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest performance. The story itself was very cliché (e.g plane, terrorists, bomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go this one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern European. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy. Still if you are looking for a film with intense action, a minimal story line and Liam Neeson kicking ass, then this is the movie for you."

","Despite being almost totally set inside an airliner, the plot with many twists and turns, keeps every scene intense and interesting. Air Marshall Bill Marks is the hero we all imagine we would be in times of great group and personal danger. <br/><br/>Worse yet, the baddies are bent upon casting Marshall Marks as the real bad guy, perish the thought, we cannot let this happen! For anyone who ever had a moment of flying trepidation to those of us with white knuckles, the movie confirms our worst fears and then some. Guaranteed to keep you guessing to the very end, while you hang desperately to the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Neeson is a worthy heir to the Harrison Ford good guy genre. Maybe it was the real life tragic loss of his beautiful wife, maybe we just see Liam as the underdog refusing to lose. Whatever it is, the magic is working for him right now.

","Bish. Bash. Bosh. Kaboom. Bang. Get down, motherfu <br/><br/>That's Non-Stop. Don't gripe, don't bitch about it. If you want something cerebral, mind-spinning or morally and emotionally challenging, why not take a punt on Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac Volumes I & II? Predictably, far fewer cinemas offered me a chance of the latter, so mindless, fun Non-Stop it was! Non-Stop sees Liam Neeson escape Legoland and team up with his Unknown director, Jaume Collet-Serra, for the second time (their third outing, Run All Night, is already in post production) in another action thriller romp with guns, suspense and heroics aplenty.<br/><br/>Air marshall Bill Marks (Neeson) receives a text on his secure phone while on a transatlantic flight demanding a ransom of $150 million be deposited in an off-shore account within twenty minutes. Failure to deliver will result in the death of a passenger. Marks contacts his superiors but, viewing him as damaged goods, nobody believes him. Nobody, that is, except for air hostess Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and even she isn't quite sure.<br/><br/>Non-Stop begins like a 1970s disaster flick (think The Poseidon Adventure or The Towering Inferno) with a mini tour of the principal players including Marks' fellow passengers Jen (Julianne Moore), Tom, (Scoot McNairy), Zack (Nate Parker) and Nancy's colleague, Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o, fresh from her Oscar-winning turn in 12 Years a Slave) so that you know the villain has to be amongst them somewhere.<br/><br/>There are plenty of plot holes in Non-Stop, it's almost as unrealistic as Denzel Washington flying a plane upside down in Flight, and Collet-Serra cannot resist swimming in cheese in the final act, but for the most part there is enough tension and intrigue to keep the viewer alert and guessing. It is almost everything you want from a thriller with plenty or excitement in the confines of a small aircraft and, even though you know everything is going to be just peachy in the end, it's a ride of bumpy thrills that won't put you off your pizza.<br/><br/>Neeson has convincingly picked up the baton dropped by Harrison Ford and proves yet again to be an everyman hero and pretty good eye-candy to boot. There's nothing here to write home about performance wise and though you can evidently take the girl out of Downton Abbey, I'm not convinced you'll ever take Downton Abbey out of Michelle Dockery but she gets away with it here. As for Moore, she's providing the ham to go with the cheese.<br/><br/>No, Non-Stop isn't very believable but it is a most(ly) enjoyable romp for a Friday night after a week of brain ache.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","SPOILER FREE. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of Liam Neeson, but I won't let my opinion interfere with this review. I would give this film an 8/10. I like films that have action and a unique plot. In this case, Non Stop had both. It was a thriller, and it delivered a good thriller. The plot was constantly unravelling, throwing us new information. Since the plot was so ""mysterious"" I was constantly on the edge of my seat - trying to guess who the criminals were. It was definitely worth seeing because of its chilling music, atmosphere and insane plot (it really had a great plot). The film also had a very thriller feel, with jump scares and constant suspense. The plot was always surprising you, in a good way. I give it an 8/10. Not a 9 because there wasn't constant action, but at the same time, action isn't what a thriller is about. I didn't give it a 10 because no film - nothing is perfect. Since I'm used to films with lots of action, I removed a point, but I'm sure most people would give it a 9. Overall, a great film that kept me on the edge of my seat."

There was plenty of action in this 107 minute thriller of a film and I was satisfied with the film overall.<br/><br/>Ever since 9/11, there have been high alerts here in the United States and abroad when it comes to flying the not so friendly skies, so to speak. I'm not sure if the motivation of the real hijackers in this movie, who apparently served in the U.S. Military during Operation Enduring Freedom as depicted in the film, was $150 Million OR the sense that their service in the war was taken for granted. I'm guessing it was a bit of both and by setting-up ""Marks"" was their revenge against an ungrateful nation, which in the end ultimately backfired! <br/><br/>I also liked the scene where ""Marks"" helped the little girl on the plane, ""Becca"" played by Quinn McColgan face her fears of flying. As I mentioned, never liked flying, but had to do it when I was in the U.S. Navy! It sucked!

I won't explain why, but I will say that much of what has taken place in the previous 90 minutes won't stand up to close examination in the cold light of day.

I will not say if it will end in a good way or in a bad way, i will just leave you to watch it, and get thrilled by its scenes and ideas. a great mixture of thriller, suspense, intelligent tweaks, good story, and great casting. You just can't expect anything and you will be wondering and wondering what's happening, how it could happens, you will wait and focus entirely on the scenes and the actions. The director knew how to attract the audience to this movie, i just watched it thrilled, and with pleasure. i didn't felt bore, and all the tweaks and the actions intelligently make sense. What would you say, when an air Marshall is threatened that a person will be killed every 20 minutes, on an airplane that is 20000 feet over the Atlantic. it's an amazing story, with amazing acting and amazing scenes from the first and till the last of the movies.<br/><br/>Great work, i hope Run All Night (2015) will be this good also, it's for the same director and the same actor.

","I believe this is THE movie or the beginning of this year. Liam Neeson continues to impress and amaze on the big screen. His initial blockbuster it was Taken, and this surpasses it. Taken 2 was fairly weak and this made it look terrible. Non Stop, lone Sutvivor, Cpt Phillips, and Amercian Hustle are the best movies to come out recently. Overall I give this movie a solid 9.0. I would recommend it to ages 12+. It is superb and exhibits acts of heroism, yet suspense. Tis movie is mind twisting, action packed, and requires thoughtfulness and wits to figure out who did it. Was it the Marshall, or was it his passengers?"

I do not want to include any spoilers therefore I will sum up to say that the movie does not include any cliché moments that have recently started to appear on a regular basis in recent action thrillers. <br/><br/>All the events condense beautifully into a final stand off as expected, and though it seemed very obvious from the beginning that Liam Neeson would save the day, you walk away glad that he did manage to do it.<br/><br/>You will not see who the real villain is until who he/she is. Any person who mildly enjoys action thrillers will not regret watching this movie. Just go in with an open mind and not expect the movie of the century. <br/><br/>No outstanding acting noticed by either by Lupita, Liam or Julianne Moore.

""Non-Stop"" joins the ranks of those movies that leave me completely and utterly indifferent to its making and existence.<br/><br/>The movie starts out interestingly enough, but the second and third act just take on more and more preposterous aspects to the point that you just don't give a s*it! The one dimensional and clichéd characters sure don't help either! <br/><br/>Liam Neeson is his usual competent self, and you can see that he enjoys making these movies and this late-in-life action hero status!

","Liam Neeson, the guy whom I first remember seeing in Schindler's List, then as Qui Gon Jinn in Star Wars Episode I and later on as Ra's Al Ghul in Batman Begins and recently from a dozen other memes tagged with ""I don't who you are but I will find you and kill you"" . Liam has had the best of both worlds, Award-centric movies as well as mindless action movies. But thanks to 2008′s Taken, Liam has had a major face-lift, from a talented actor who could convincingly portray Oskar Schindler to a guy who could utter any dialogue with an unmatching intimidation that would make any guy pee in his pants. Don't believe me? Watch this!<br/><br/>So in Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays an alcoholic, jerk of an Air Marshall on a flight where things starts to go down the spiral. He gets a text on his encrypted networked phone where someone says that he'll be killing off passengers every 20 minutes unless he gets 'his' 150 Million dollars transferred and there on the nonstop action starts. Things are set in motion where people starts getting killed and keeps, you as well as, Liam guessing the 'whodunnit'. Its thrilling and manages to be a real nail-biter till the last 15 minutes or so but you gotta suspend your disbelief a lot. On paper the plot seems perfect and as for the screenwriters advantage it works well, but on film and as an audience you gotta admit that it might not end up exactly as its planned out to be. The world never works that perfectly where someone plans something and it goes exactly like that. Example? Passengers getting killed at every exact 20 minutes and every other covariant works out perfectly well and thats exactly what the facet is here.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is obviously bad-ass in this and he sports the same menacing attitude from his previous action movies but it works well. There were elements of vulnerability but when you've got a script that moves as fast as a plane that flies 500 miles per hour, there's little room for character building such as that. You have to admit he carries the plot on his shoulder and does keep you entertained. As for the supporting cast there's that guy who played Thomas Wayne from Batman Begins, Anson Mount whom I was sure looked a lot like Jim Caviezel, Julianne Moore as the annoying passenger who just wanna sit beside Liam Neeson and a couple of other familiar faces thrown around all for the question of doubt. As soon as you see one familiar face you start guessing ""Oh this guy, he's the one"" because thats how Hollywood works ain't it?<br/><br/>Considering its from Jaume Collet-Serra who previously gave us Unknown and the immensely entertaining Orphan, you know Non-Stop will be more than just watchable. As I said Non-Stop works out well till the end and you ARE definitely entertained for the movies' 90 plus minutes and thats when the mystery gets revealed and you go from suspensive mode to MEH. Especially when you find out who and why its done. For what its worth I did enjoy the tense moments and you kinda root for Liam Neeson as each step that gets him closer to solving the mystery gets thwarted by the 'man who plans'. Is this a movie that rockets him to more badassery? Yes and as evidently a Taken 3 is in the works as we speak. Though, for me give me The Grey 2 anytime."
"quinnox-1","6","1","2","2 March 2014"," Somewhat over-hyped thriller
","I became a Liam Neeson fan when he started his new turn as an action hero in the excellent thriller, Taken. But I think this newest entry in his recent action roles is more routine and by the numbers than what some of the enthusiastic response is giving it credit for. It is a ""bog standard"" action thriller aboard an airplane, and to me, it seemed a bit too goofy in places and overly contrived. It's not terrible by any means, but nothing special. I hope to see more interesting movies in this genre from Neeson in the future, because I still haven't seen any of his other action movies rise to the level of ""Taken"" yet.<br/><br/>As far as special effects and set design, the movie is strong in those departments. I think the movie is actually best in its first 3rd, there is a nice style and atmosphere built up, and the movie seems quite promising at that point. Then it slowly goes downhill at an increasing rate from there. By the time the ending rolled around I found it to have become very silly and a disappointment."

","Don't get me wrong, folks; I loved this movie, even though fellow movie buffs like myself will say its too much like Flight-Plan, w/Jody Foster. Here is what I would like all scriptwriters and screenwriters to take note of when composing a viable airplane in crisis movie: Never assume that you will always have GPS text messaging at 30,000 feet, because unless it is a military or govt. satellite phone, no one can text and receive messages till before or after landing. Maybe someday, but not currently. 2ndly: The cockpit door is always locked shut,simply because of 9/11. Some planes have a small lavatory opposite the jump seat utilized by a flight engineer or navigator, or off-duty pilot ""jumping"" from origin to destination w/o being a paying customer. I know for a fact, if anyone in that cockpit needs to come out to use the lavatory or take in sustenance, 3 flight attendants are required to shut down the kitchen/1st class lavatory bay and maintain a fire watch perimeter while that door is compromised...In this very exciting movie, you have to suspend your disbelief simply to enjoy the flow of the show, knowing that in real life, it would never happen this way. Oh, and for the record, your list of possible suspects that you think are the bad guys or bad girls w/in the first 30min.s???

Hands down. I might be a little pumped up right now because of all the adrenaline I got from this movie and my mind might not be clear at this very moment, but Non-Stop is truly Non-Stop thriller ride.<br/><br/>I am not going to lie here. I expected a very little from this movie. Come on, let's be honest. Who didn't ? We all know that since ""Taken"", Hollywood is trying milk Liam Neeson as much as humanly possible before his knees give in. We all looked at the poster, we all watched the trailers. It just seemed like the typical Hollywood airplane thriller. Well, you and I were both wrong. I was expecting very cliché & unoriginal story. Non-Stop absolutely took me by surprise. Let me tell you how. No spoilers, just bear with me here.<br/><br/>I am not being cocky or anything, but most of the time I can predict all the twists and guess who the bad guy is, when watching a mystery film. But guess what ? I couldn't predict a thing with this movie. That was me, maybe some of you guys will. I don't know. The point is you will may have 4-5 guys in mind who you think is the bad guy, but the filmmakers didn't reveal anything until the very end. And it is just impressive and glorious.<br/><br/>At first, it was kinda hard for me to adapt to the film's dark blue-ish tone but it was alright. As I'm writing this, I realized that it was intentional because it's exactly how it looks like in an airplane. Very smart choice of color. You could almost feel like jet lagged after watching it for all I know haha.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson was great, Julianne Moore was great, Lupita made an small appearance, rest of the cast also very solid. The music, cinematography ... yada yada.<br/><br/>The tension and suspense of this film is absolutely incredible. Honestly, my palms might have been sweating for the whole time. Anyway, the viewers will be on the edge of their seats from start to finish. Guaranteed. You just have to turn up the volume a little and enjoy the ride.

I personally would like to See him in something other than another 'Unknown' or 'taken' type picture. Don't get me wrong, he starred in my favourite film (Schindler's List) & I enjoyed 'Kinsey' & 'Michael Collins' but that was ten years or more ago. If you saw the trailer for this movie prior to viewing the film then you already know the plot. All that is left is to guess whodunit.

"littlewritingmachine","Null","2","7","25 February 2014"," Film Authority review of Non-Stop
","Liam Neeson has become a happy center for many a genre thriller, including Taken 1 and 2, Unknown and now Non-Stop, a traditional suspense drama which loses its head somewhat after a taut first hour.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bill Marks, a Belfast-born air Marshall whose trip from New York to London turns into a nightmare. A series of text messages from an unknown opponent promise to kill and passenger every twenty minutes until 150 million dollars are put into a secure account. With the help of fellow passenger Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), Bill tries to work out whereabouts on the plane the messages are coming from, questioning and occasionally beating up his fellow passengers as he races against time. Non-Stop's poster image, of Neeson firing his gun inside a diving plane, suggests much more action than Jaume Collet-Sera's thriller delivers, but the first couple of acts have plenty of tension in an old-fashioned who-dunnit style. Things get pretty silly once the mystery is solved, but Neeson and Moore both giving a convincing account of their characters. Non-Stop isn't a classic, but a reasonable time-passer for those who enjoy seeing a big movie star in a typically ludicrous scenario; when a newsreader mentions 'unbelievable plot twists', it's hard to imagine the audience not agreeing.<br/><br/>The Film Authority"

","This is a suspenseful film that keeps you guessing until the end and it had me biting my nails from the beginning. This plot starts with an air marshal named Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who is on a plane from New York to London. On the flight he receives a disturbing text that tells him, ""I'll kill someone every 20 minutes"" if Bill doesn't do what the person says. While trying everything to find the person who's sending him these messages, the passengers, crew and his boss start to think he's hijacking the plane. Even Bill starts to question himself. So with no one to trust and everyone against him, he must try to stop this anonymous character in this crowded plane. <br/><br/>With a plot like this, how can you not be somewhat interested? The movie keeps your attention and you really want to know what's going to happen. This movie's atmosphere is uncomfortable, which it's supposed to be. The wide angle lens is appropriate and makes the confined space even more real. The script is terrific! It's a perfect example of a movie where, once you watch it, you want to watch it again. All the pieces of the puzzle come together. There are reasons and evidence that lead you to the outcome without giving it away. That's a sign of a great mystery. <br/><br/>The acting in this film is fantastic and all the actors like Julianne Moore as Jen Summers, who had to act in these claustrophobic sets, do an impressive job portraying their roles. I enjoy Liam Neeson and fully appreciate his acting skills in this film. He shows why he continues to be a top rated star. <br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Bill thinks he's found and stopped the terrorist. For a moment Bill is relieved it's over. Then he hears his phone bing an incoming text and the music gets your heart racing. <br/><br/>The moral is, ""Honesty is the best policy."" The passengers and crew are against him because Bill's hiding the truth. As humans we automatically think the worse if we have to piece a situation together. Bill finally realizes that.<br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend this to 12 to 18-year-olds. There is smoking and intense moments that are not intended for kids. This is a investing and spine tingling film that is worth checking out. <br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST Film Critic For more reviews, go to kidsfirst dot org."

","I really enjoyed this movie. The acting was really good, the suspense was fine with me. It wasn't the best movie in the world, but from the negative reviews you can see many bigots watched and took offence at a Muslim not being the bad guy. An American was the bad guy, and they couldn't handle that. That makes this movie anti-American apparently. Whereas, when people from other countries are bad guys in other movies, it isn't considered anti- those countries by blind bigots. If a Muslim is the bad guy it's just normal and natural apparently (even though most of the crimes committed in America are done so by Americans). In y country when someone is the same background as me and committing a terrorist offence, I don't take it personally but you can see here that other people do."

","One day, Bill Marks who is a federal air marshal officer received email on the flight and it says if he doesn't meet the sender's request, one of the passengers will die after 20min, so he try to find the sender.<br/><br/>This film conceals the sender from audiences very well. Most of scenes are showed at Bill's view so I didn't expect who is the sender until last scene. Moreover, many times finding suspects effectively confused me. What I surprised most is Bill is being made out to be a terrorist by sender's plan naturally. At that scene, I thought the sender (the screenwriter of this film, actually) is truly genius. A flight, a security officer, and death, the story seems very common from these words, but this film is really great.<br/><br/>In addition, action scene is also good. Liam Neeson acted Bill very cool. Action scenes are not many in this film, but I think enough to fascinate audiences because that flight situation was used very well.<br/><br/>Thus, by concealing the sender and cool action, I enjoyed this film without any moments of boring."

","The biggest let down was the films direction and cutting. If your planning to confine the stage to a single cockpit you need to get even more creative than this. The story and plot was full of holes too. Maybe a low budget was the main problem here, yet could have added a lot more color to the cutting; to other scenes and the build up on the media or got to know a little more about the people you don't want to die before boarding etc. I can not think of one good scene in the entire film and do not recommend this film to anyone. I can not give examples of just how bad the plot is, because I hate writing spoilers. How did they get Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore to be in this, must have been were half the budget went, oh well."
"throwaway89101","10","1","3","14 February 2015"," Wow, this movie is AMAZING
","SPOILERS!!! This is basically ""speed"" but in the air. What I absolutely love the most about this movie is how Liam Neeson consistently man handles EVERYONE he comes in contact with on the plane. When he searches passengers to discover the killer and comes up with an INKLING that someone MIGHT be the bad guy, he immediately grabs them and starts breaking things (mainly body parts). Now admittedly, he's a little stressed, as we all are on long flights, but this level of brutality is just so unnecessary. I would have filed a police brutality report or at the least written a strongly worded letter to his supervisor once the flight was over. I mean, is this indicative of how he handles arrests or interrogations all the time? Thanks for saving the plane Liam, but you need to schedule an appointment with Bob in HR asap. Also, just on an efficiency note, Liam, you have a gun, you don't need to break everyone's nose in hand to hand combat, it seems really exhausting. Also, his name is Bill in this movie, henceforth I will call him Bill, as the internet does not recognize ""Liam"" as a properly spelled word as I write this review. Side note- there is a young girl on the flight (who I assume is supposed to tie into the background story of Bill who lost his daughter to cancer at a young age). Literally everyone on this flight throughout the movie, treats this kid like she's got aspergers. She's 7, she's a little nervous about the flight, not mentally disabled. Calm down flight attendants, we got bigger fish to fry in this movie. Speaking of Bill's dead daughter, the craziest scene in the movie (for me) was when Bill gave this long heartfelt monologue about his dead daughter and his inability to deal with her death that has impacted his life. This scene is crazy because 30 seconds before he gives it he discovers a BOMB in the bathroom which has been activated and is counting down. He is attacked by passengers and only is able to get them to let him go when he tells them about the bomb. So now, the whole plane knows there is an active bomb counting down in the plane and basically everyone has minutes to live. So what do they do? Let's all hang out and let Bill tell us a long story about his dead kid! What??? How about we use this time to discuss a plan not to die and Bill can tell us about his dead daughter at TGIFridays, later tonight? Bill and several passengers create a plan to allow the bomb to detonate at the back of the plane and move all passengers up front. BUT- this plan will only work if they can descend to 8000 feet because that's the point where the air pressure equalizes- remember that, b/c it will come up again. There are awesome fight scenes throughout this film, not to mention the ubiquitous ""flying through the air shooting in slow mo when the pilot violently diverts the plane"". Brilliant. Did you know this movie has comedy? Well it DOES! Spoiler alert here- There are two passengers who end up being the bad guys, they were working together the whole time and while one of them has a gun pointed at Bill he launches into a monologue to explain why they did it and what they want to gain (as we know all bad people do). Get this- they went through all this trouble and caused this kerfuffle in order to...wait for it...INCREASE AIRPORT SECURITY. Not joking, that's what the plan was the whole time. Now we come to what is hands down my favorite line of the whole movie, and possibly of any movie. I pray to the gods of the movie industry and sweet baby Jesus that Liam either wrote this line or improvised it. The bad guy gets done explaining his diabolical plan and Bill says ""You should have handed out pamphlets, much easier."" WHAT?? Liam- that is COMEDY GENIUS!! And what makes it even better is that Liam delivers the line the same way he made that threatening speech to the kidnapper in ""Taken"", it's very tersely said and a little scary. This man is an artist. So more fight scenes happen and the bomb goes off and blows a hole in the plane, stuff is being sucked out of the plane and the whole thing is falling apart. Then we switch to a perspective outside the airplane which shows the plane is right above the ground trying to land on the runway- yes, the plane is like 8 feet off the ground. They touchdown and its a really rough landing, and for whatever reason, (I believe it's because God hates children) a hole is ripped in the side of the plane but only for one seat- the seat the little girl is in. She is immediately in danger of being sucked out of the plane- which makes NO SENSE because they are on the ground- there is NO DIFFERENCE IN AIR PRESSURE HERE!! Think about it, Bill even told us we would basically be fine at 8000 feet earlier in the movie, but now physics don't apply anymore. If you were driving in your car and the door was removed, you wouldn't be struggling to resist being sucked out of the car, dear god, if that was the case no one would EVER buy a convertible! Spoiler- girl is pulled back in by Bill, which is a shame, because they could've made a bold choice there that would have totally changed the direction and feel of the movie, but whatever. 10 out of 10, will watch again."

","You can't go wrong with a Liam Neeson film, for the most part. In non- stop, he plays this down on his luck air marshal who is on this transatlantic flight he gets called on to ride. He doesn't really like to fly, odd for someone with this job. Anyhow, there was something that had happened to him and gave him a bad reputation. He's drinking, kind of a loner, down on his luck.<br/><br/>On board the flight he starts getting text messages that people will start getting killed unless he pays ransom. Then all sorts of crazy stuff starts happening, and the movie ratchets up the suspense. you are never really sure who is good vs bad, or why this event is even really happening. <br/><br/>Then you figure it out, and Liam Neeson gets to flex his tough guy skin again, like in Taken or some of his other recent films. Julianne Moore plays this quirky lady passenger, yep, again, Femme mysterieuse and maybe she's too weird for some reason? <br/><br/>The suspense was good, the acting was pretty good, and the film moves quickly. I recommend Non-Stop as a tidy, good thriller that you will enjoy."

","Those with a fear of flying might want to skip ""Non-Stop,"" an airliner- in-jeopardy thriller that could have you taking trains and buses for quite some time to come. <br/><br/>In another of his increasingly frequent action-hero roles, Liam Neeson plays Bill Marks, a U.S. air marshal who discovers that someone aboard a flight from New York to London is threatening to kill a new passenger every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into an account that has been set up for the occasion. The twist is that the mystery culprit is making it look as if Marks is the actual extortionist and may even be making Marks carry out some of the killings for him.<br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" works well enough within the limited confines of both the setting and the hostages-held-for-ransom genre of which it is a part. The whodunit plotting unravels at an appropriate pace, with a whole host of possible suspects for us to choose from, including fellow passengers Juliette Moore, Anson Mount (""Hell on Wheels"") and Corey Stoll (""House of Cards"" ), as well as Michelle Dockery (""Downton Abbey"") and Lupita Nyong'o (""12 Years a Slave"") as flight attendants who demonstrate grace and ingenuity under pressure.<br/><br/>The holes in the plot are probably large enough to fly a 747 through, but you really won't notice or care while you're strapped in for the ride. And to think, most airlines just provide movies as in-flight entertainment."

","I enjoyed Taken one and two but rate Non Stop way above these. The script is extremely clever and tight with no signs of laziness by the script writers. There have been a few of these airline passenger thriller genre movies now, but Non Stop still manages to emerge as a fresh, imaginative and very unique movie which packs a lot of suspense, red herrings and action galore. Liam Neeson plays a very realistic anti-hero and Julianne Moore reinforces our believing that these are real characters. It isn't a documentary, so the writers have stretched the bounds of reality at times, but not to breaking point. Suspect everyone! Major, major spoiler: I loved the subtle give away pointing to the bad guy when they did their seatbelt up just before the plane plummeted."

A tremendously entertaining, wickedly original, explosively tense and adrenaline-charged roller-coaster...

After being punched or hit with maximum force from various antagonists it's not easy to shake your head and brush it off. James Bond, maybe, otherwise not realistic.

"PStyles","7","1","3","18 June 2014"," Entertaining, but nothing you haven't seen before
","I don't know what it is about airplanes in movies, but their backdrop always seem to add to the tension and sense of enclosement that the viewer feels, regardless of the source material's quality. Luckily, Non-Stop contains a rock solid script reinforced by some good acting, which ultimately delivers an entertaining movie throughout. <br/><br/>I'm a fan of the action/mystery movies, despite the many mediocre films that unfortunately plague this otherwise interesting genre. Non-Stop was a film that kept me engaged from start to finish, and after the first 20 minutes or so, rarely lets up as the mystery unfolds before the viewer's eyes. In short, this movie centers around a misguided air marshall who is thrown into a rather precarious situation when he receives a text message from an alleged passenger threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if 150 million dollars isn't transported to a specified bank account. Sound familiar? It should, as this general synopsys has been beaten almost to death over the years. What separates this movie from the rest is a series of intertwined mysteries that occur as the plane takes flight over the Atlantic ocean. This film really does keep you guessing throughout as to whom the ""bad guys"" may actually be, as well as what their intentions really are. It's always refreshing when you are unable to guess who the perpetrator may be in the first 30 minutes of the film, and I would venture to guess many won't have a clue until they reach the third act of the movie. The red herring literary device is used throughout the script to good effect, misleading the viewer many times before the mystery is finally discovered. This, along with some solid acting from Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore, are what makes this film shine. <br/><br/>Now to the negatives. While I found Neeson's character interesting, I felt the part was a bit overzealous in certain situations that detracted from the overall credibility of the story. Certain scenes have Neeson's character beating the crap out of seemingly innocent passengers, and while the situation was certainly grave, I would find it hard to believe an air marshall, an alcoholic, grieving one at that, would be flipping people around aboard a commercial airliner like Steven Seagal. It is part action flick though, so perhaps im judging too hard here. Another issue I had with this film revolves around some holes in the overall plot. As you watch, certain parts of the mystery will begin to make sense, but some portions are completely left either unexplained or become irrelevant, which certainly detracts from the whole experience. Lastly, while the acting was solid, there are by no means any Academy Award winning performances. Liam Neeson seems to have settled right in as an action hero in recent years, and parts of this film have a very Taken-esque feel to it without the more intriguing setting or plot. Julianne Moore is solid, but her character is unfortunately pretty forgettable. The supporting cast performances range from good to below average.<br/><br/>The plot certainly isn't anything new or riveting, but that doesn't mean it wasn't executed well despite this. As I said before, the fact that it takes place on an airplane in flight adds to the excitement of the film, despite the plot holes and relatively mediocre characters involved in the film. I didn't find myself seriously engaged with any of the characters involved, yet I still enjoyed the film. The mystery factor really carries this film and is by far the strong suit of the script. The writers did a good job keeping me guessing and on my toes, and I give them immense credit for taking what should be a rather mediocre film and making it quite exciting at times. Non-Stop certainly isn't one for the ages, yet it delivers solid entertainment nonetheless. I'd recommend this movie for fans of the genre, and give it a solid 7/10."

","At 62 years old, Liam Neeson has managed to carve quite a niche out for himself within the world of action movies. He's spent the last few years of his career fighting, jumping, shooting, and rescuing his way on to movie screens worldwide at a time when most stars would be settling in to nice quiet roles as an elderly statesman or wise old man. ""Non-Stop"" sees Neeson fully embracing his hero side once again in a thriller that is equally parts mystery and thriller as it is disaster and adventure film.<br/><br/>Bill Marks is a weary air marshal on another non-stop flight from the U.S. to Europe. His worst fears are realized when he receives text messages from an unknown person on the flight claiming they will kill one passenger every twenty minutes until their ransom demands are met. Now he must figure out who he can trust to help identify the sadistic individual before they strike.<br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" teams up Liam Neeson with ""Taken"" Director Jaume Collet-Serra for another thrilling go-round at saving the day. Collet-Sera likes to helm movies that deal with controversial subject matter. It's obvious he wants people to walk away from his films not only entertained but with something to think and talk about.<br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action and violence, some language, sensuality and drug references. I can't think of a single moment of sensuality or drug references. Neeson enjoys his alcohol and smoking but I'd be hard-pressed to consider that ""drug references.""<br/><br/>I would be lying if I didn't tell you that ""Non-Stop"" does feel like an extension of ""Taken."" Liam Neeson's character might be a bit more hard- boiled, but he's in essence cut from the same pattern. If you can just get past that and enjoy a suspenseful hour or so of action movie clichés, get a first-class ticket for ""Non-Stop"" excitement. Do you see what I did there?"

","Air Marshall Bill Marks is a troubled man – an alcoholic, an underachiever as a parent, cop and man, and really just has little going for him. Assigned to a direct flight to London, Marks settles in but within a few hours of the flight taking off he gets a message on the closed network that one of the passengers will die n 20 minutes if he does not arrange for a substantial amount of money to be transferred to a bank account. With time ticking down, Marks tries to figure out what is going on, but when the first death comes he finds himself isolated in the air in a high-stakes game where he can trust nobody.<br/><br/>Although this film got pretty bad reviews I still wanted to see it since I figured that in fairness it is probably going to deliver at the low level I was expecting from it. In this regard it is actually quite watchable for someone who was recovering from a minor operation and just looking to have something to distract. The plot is as nonsensical as it sounds; I really wondered how they were going to make it all work, but the answer is that they don't. The writers seem to hope that you will not think forward or backwards in any situation and just focus on the moment, whatever is happening. This level of belief suspension is too much to ask though and the plot holes and narrative nonsense does come thick and fast at times, really just hoping you don't care enough to kick back against it.<br/><br/>And in fairness I didn't care – which is not a glowing recommendation but nothing about it all made me care one bit. What remains from there are lots of professionally mounted moments of tension, with Neeson doing his new tough guy thing and the closed location doing its bit to add to the tension. It works at a very low level but I would be lying if I said I wasn't at least slightly entertained by bits of it. The problem is that it is a big deal film with a big cast and presence, and it is not unreasonable to hope that it would have been better. Ultimately though it is undone by its own lack of interest in the plot – it is only ever about the tension of the moment and the writing is roundly poor, from plot points to specific dialogue. It distracts at a very low level but ultimately it is full of holes, laughable and forgettable."

However, given the number of SkyMall perusing, bored-looking Air Marshalls I've seen travelling on internal and international flights, I hope they don't see this film and try to reenact it to alleviate their mundanity. <br/><br/>Neeson is in 'Taken' and 'Unknown' territory again, here and he simultaneously always knows this is multiplex fodder while also avoiding completely phoning his performance in. There's no Bruce-Willis-on-NyQuil stuff here. Neeson attends to economy class stuff just as passionately as he graces business class fare such as the Dark Knight trilogy and historical dramas.<br/><br/>With Julianne Moore as a red haired herring and Neeson out-McClaning the Die Hard franchise, it's a fine blockbuster thriller in the old school tradition!"

In Non-Stop he once again plays the hard bitten divorced Dad figure who faces a personal and career crisis as he attempts to stop a hijacking onboard a transatlantic jet. Julianne Moore plays an attractive but vulnerable woman he sits next to on the plane.

That alone already won a high rating out of me, because that is what a great movie should do.<br/><br/>I can only think of 2 reasons for which critics give low ratings on this film. One is that although it has some cinematography, it isn't as artsy and as loaded in analytic cinematography, which is what many critics look for. The other is the tagline or the mindset of the villain. What the villain says is true, and although Liam eventually does maintain his hero status and saves the passengers, the logic and mindset of the villain are still strong enough to linger in the viewers' head afterwards."

The real hero was one more time Liam Neeson with a very strong performance. He is really on the top.<br/><br/>If you liked It I recommend Red Eye, Flightplan, Air Force One or United 93. My vote is 8/10."
"micahahall","7","1","3","28 March 2014"," Entertaining for What It Is
","I watched this movie only because my date and I had seen almost every movie currently in theaters. I expected nothing and found it remarkably entertaining. This film won't be winning any Oscars, and it isn't a remarkably original premise but, for a movie of its kind, it was fantastic. I have watched a couple other movies like this, where people are dying/disappearing on a plane and the protagonist must find them before they kill/kidnap someone again. They were all very dull and forgettable. This movie had twists I did not expect, an interesting conclusion, and it had consistent action, even through the mystery aspect.<br/><br/>There are better movies in theaters today, but if you really want to see a mystery-thriller-action movie that takes place in a plane, you have very specific desires, all of which will be entirely satisfied by this movie."
"davidgee","8","1","3","26 March 2014"," Where's the singing nun?
","There have been good and bad airplane movies, with CON AIR probably the best and some of the AIRPORT series among the worst. NON-STOP is somewhere in the middle, a bit up or a bit down according to your taste.<br/><br/>Air marshal Liam Neeson's bosses think he's gone rogue and is hijacking the flight. While Liam is trying to figure out which of the passengers and crew can be trusted, the passengers are quickly losing faith in him.<br/><br/>This is hokum, of course, but it's classy hokum, with Julianne Moore as the passenger sat next to Neeson and Downton Abbey's Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery) as the chief stewardess. (In the early days of British Airways, some air-hostesses were Honourables - and even honourable!). A few corny elements - Neeson's grieving alcoholic back-story, Moore's mystery-woman, a cute little girl travelling alone - but mercifully no singing nun. <br/><br/>The story has credibility-stretching twists, but the last half-hour is seriously nerve-shredding with special effects bringing to vivid reality every passenger's worst nightmare. Reviewing the original AIRPORT (1970), the great film critic Alexander Walker wrote: ""For sheer contentment there is nothing to beat the sight of constant catastrophe happening to others."" He was right!"
"Kicino","7","1","3","20 March 2014"," Exciting, thrilling and therapeutic amid a real plane's disappearance
","As I write this, the Australian satellite has spotted some large debris floating on the Indian Ocean but their planes cannot find anything related to the missing Malaysian airline Boeing 777 which went missing Mar 8 while en route to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur.<br/><br/>I watched Non-stop for two reasons. Firstly, it has been more than a week after we lost a huge plane with 239 people onboard. No trace of debris and no communications found so far. Hijack? Terrorist attack? Mechanical failure caused explosion or decapitation? Abduction? Just very mysterious. Watching this seems therapeutic and relevant. We might even get some insight on what could have happened. The second reason is of course the ever enchanting Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore. The third reason is perhaps as an occasional flyer, we may learn something new in preparation for our next flight. <br/><br/>Well, the first goal is easily achieved: we are well aware that we would be safe at the end of the 2-hour movie, however gripping it is. Imagine how long the real passengers suffer? I feel sorry for passengers on a hijacked plane who must be scared to death with all the tormenting uncertainty. Or the sudden and unexpected death in the case of a mechanical failure.<br/><br/>In this film, Air Marshal Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) receives text messages on the plane from an unknown person telling him one passenger will die every 20 minutes until $150 million is deposited into a specified account. Like our Malaysian airline, this place also diverted. Watching it was if we have a new perspective in deducing what could have happened in real life.<br/><br/>Marks cannot announce this info but has to make quick decisions to identify this person. Passengers are kept in the dark but are told to have their hands on the seats in front of them, or their hands up, or move to the back. It must be very stressful for them and the director did a great job in creating a prolonged suspense. It is like an Agatha Christie story in mid-air where we begin to suspect everyone. <br/><br/>It is very exciting to watch and yet comforting to know we are safe in the theatre. All the suspense is nicely built but the ending seems kind of abrupt and unconvincing. Then there are many plot holes and loose ends in portraying the flight situation and security check. But the excellent acting of Liam, Moore and the supporting cast compensated all these. <br/><br/>Not a great movie but a relevant and therapeutic one at the right time. May we locate and find out what happened to the missing Malaysian plane soon."

","From seeing the trailers this looked like it would be another great Liam Neeson action flick and it was just that. There were not that many surprises I found, to this film, other than that Lupita Nyong'o has a small role in this and it was nice to see her in this after seeing her win the Best Supporting Actress Oscar at the Academy Awards on March 2nd, 2014. Liam Neeson was of course great, and the rest of the cast really shined and worked to make this film as believable as it wanted you to. I will also say that this film was very intense and had my heart racing while watching the 3rd act played out. If you are a fan of the Taken films and are just a fan of Neeson in general, you won't be disappointed in the least."
"simonmilad28","4","1","3","9 March 2014"," Non Stop - errors
","Liam Neeson is great actor and also great as the action star too and I was looking forward to seeing Non Stop so I have and this is what I think of it. The movie is good but not great however it does have a few funny good scenes It is over the top but there's nothing with over the top as it's just a movie but certain things should be taken seriously and thought of more clearly as 2 things in the movie which I thought were silly and annoying. Smoking on airlines is strictly forbidden even one wouldn't be able to smoke in the toilet as that person would be kicked off the plane and maybe prosecuted and stewardesses wear fully sleeved clothing not sleeveless dresses. They might as well have had a jukebox on the plane. Obviously the film has other unrealistic moments but the ones I pointed out was just basic so someone obviously hasn't done their homework"
"quincytheodore","7","1","3","6 March 2014"," Non-Stop could have been a great movie, if not for its rather disappointing end.
","With Liam Neeson soaring high as a legitimate action hero and gradually intense plot, Non-Stop could have been great, but the asinine final act undermines its thrilling build up. The movie boasts many talented cast, its cinematography dances around in such tight space, and it produces a sense of inescapable situation well. For most part, the story holds together, weaving seemingly impossible feats of crime above the sky, only to falls later with far-fetch conclusion, perhaps inspired by older Samuel L. Jackson's movie of the same premise.<br/><br/>Concept of being trapped and threatened mid-flight is used in an intriguing fashion. Tension escalates nicely and in familiar small inescapable space, the struggle will be relatable to the audience. Characters are introduced swiftly with skillful editing, its cast does good job on keeping the exhilaration going. At most times, the movie ventures into psychological thriller realm, connecting riddle after riddle. In contrast of more action heavy movies Liam Neeson has done in recent years or what the poster may suggest, the action takes a backseat in exchange of more intellectual coping of the characters in the predicament.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, moves and acts with necessary vigor, he's a good action hero with reliance on mental fortitude instead of muscle strength alone. Julianne Moore does well as Jen Summers, an unlucky passenger who's caught up in Bill's unyielding search of the culprit. She looks very natural, quite a charming innocent bystander, yet peculiarly frantic enough at some times to arouse suspicion. The rest is decent, including rising star Lupita Nyong'o, they ensure a colorful personalities among the characters as they portray quite believable reactions, up to a point.<br/><br/>The director gives good perspective in confined rooms. Camera angle shows restriction, but still enough for the scenes to be enjoyable without feeling too clustered. At more ardent sequences the camera even makes continuous shot of the event, which is pretty impressive considering things can get hectic. Little details, such as floating HUD of cellphones or display of the surveillance cameras provide easy viewing for the audience, without having a protagonist narrates everything clumsily.<br/><br/>Its main problem is its ending. As the movie progresses with elaborate schemes, you'd be most likely invested in the story, thus hoping for a clever fascinating conclusion. Sadly, it is not so. The movies somewhat loses fuel in the end, even resorting to absurd plot twist as fume. This is a very hackneyed solution, one which decreases the excitement from the build up significantly. Non-Stop could have been a great movie, if not for its rather disappointing end."
"kluseba","6","1","3","4 March 2014"," A great Liam Neeson is starring in an average action-thriller
","""Non-Stop"" is a solid action-thriller with the extraordinary lead actor Liam Neeson. I watched this movie because of him and even though he doesn't beat his best performances, Liam Neeson is absolutely convincing as cold-hearted human wreck and sorrow-ridden air Marshall. It's sad that his character isn't more developed in this movie as we never get to know whom he was talking to on the telephone in the beginning for example.<br/><br/>The story itself is nothing new but could have been more convincing. The movie starts in a great way when the alcoholic chain smoking air Marshall gets text messages via a secure network on a flight from New York City to London, England. An unknown criminal announces that every twenty minutes a passenger will die if the air Marshall won't send 150 million dollars to an untraceable Swiss bank account. <br/><br/>After an initial suspense, the story gets a little bit ridiculous when the first victims die. The first murder could have never been planned that way by the terrorists. The second murder isn't well explained either and even the third murder feels random even though it makes more sense than the first two. These are not the only plot holes in here. At that point, the story is running in circles, though. People are dying every twenty minutes, all characters are judging too quickly and the air Marshall loses control all the time. After a promising start, one just waits for something spectacular to happen but there is nothing more to this.<br/><br/>Of course, we will get the so-called twist in the end and know who is behind the hijackings and killings. The solution though feels half- hearted and isn't really credible. It somehow doesn't make much sense to me. For me, this moment was a little letdown and the twist is (almost) more of a deus ex machina thing than anything out-thought.<br/><br/>What else is there to say? Liam Neeson's acting is good and some secondary actors are doing a solid job as well but the characters represent too many stereotypes. It's the same for the story that feels as if one had already watched a similar movie before.<br/><br/>The action scenes, special effects and the soundtrack are well done. The numerous text messages on screen get quite annoying and how could anyone write that fast as it's the case in the movie anyway?<br/><br/>In the end, fans of Liam Neeson should watch this movie without a doubt. Anyone else will get a tension filled action-thriller without any big surprises. It's an entertaining movie to watch but also the kind of film that you will have forgotten in a few months. It's nothing truly impressive but still a good average effort. Instead of showing more or less convincing Hollywood cinema, I'm asking myself why the North American and European cinemas are not showing us more memorable and poignant films from Asia, Europe or South America.<br/><br/>I was hesitating between six and seven points for this movie. The film is not overtly original but it's entertaining and it has Liam Neeson in it. Still, I was expecting more than this and that's why I went for the lower rating. Actually, 6,5 out of ten points would have been the perfect rating for me."

Every word I've written here is true, as you know if you've already given these Canadian character assassins your hard-earned American money for the ""privilege"" of viewing their insidious propaganda.

"lucasnochez","5","2","10","1 March 2014"," Review: Non-Stop/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","In 2009, actor Liam Neeson starred in Pierre Morel's surprise sleeper hit Taken, and what begun was an onslaught of early year/before spring Neeson action releases that solidified the star as playing aging, 'could-be real life' superheroes. Since then, there are only two things certain about early action film releases; there will always be one featuring kick-ass icon Jason Statham playing the younger, balder super human hero, and one featuring Neeson, usually playing a wrinkled, more seasoned action star who could very well be your father (or grandfather)–which was badass three films ago. Deep down I am secretly waiting for Hollywood to come to their senses and announce a showdown between the two action superstars. Now talk about a kick-ass early year action release that we kinda saw coming. With something as expected as a Neeson release, also comes the expectation for a clichéd, unoriginal, and purely entertaining action story line. Unexpectedly collaborating again with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson buckles up for an actioner set in the sky. Unlike the highly entertaining nineties guilty pleasure Air Force One, Non-Stop seems to steer more in the direction of the wholly disastrous Flightplan. After all is said and done, the film becomes a constant re-hashing of previous wind-cutting skyline action films without much original altitude.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-NYPD officer whose life has been riddled by alcohol and pity for his inability to deliver as a father and husband. Taking cues from 2012 Flight, the comparison between Washington's intoxicated and wholly unorthodox airline pilot Whip Whitaker and Neeson's drunken Air Marshal Marks is almost impossible to ignore–but with less satisfying results. As Marks boards his next plane, arguing with his superiors on the phone, he is on the look out for suspecting terrorists. Like most flights today, everyone who boards seem to be the same blend of miserable, occupied, exhausted and professional. As the flight takes off and Marks grips his armrest, he befriends his by chance, first-class neighbour Jen Summers (Julianne Moore). As they get to know one another, Marks receives an anonymous message via a secure network on his mobile device threatening to kill a passenger on the flight every twenty minutes. As the plane makes its way over the Atlantic, hours from the closest airport, Marks must figure out who is attempting to sabotage the plane and it's passengers, as well as frame him for a terrorist attack on the very plane he was hired to Marshal.<br/><br/>Screenwriters John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle had the potential to do so much with a script surrounding an Air Marshal in a post-9/11 world, yet the three seemed to diddle-daddle in familiar, mystery/thriller action territory. The characters are just about as interesting as the reasoning behind the terrorist attack. Neeson brings nothing new or special to the role, leaving all that talent behind on the runway. Obvious jabs are directed towards the only clear terrorist stereotype of the film, Dr. Fahim Nasir, played with poise by Omar Metwally, the only Afghan on the flight. Throughout the film, the other passengers questions Marks' quick and uninterested attitude towards Dr. Nasir, usually resulting in a face with raised eyebrows and a ""that's it?"", even from fellow officer on-board Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll). Non-Stop shows the ignorance and fear that people still carry with them while travelling as so many are still quick to assume terror with Muslims or Middle-Easterners. It was moments like these that make one question the integrity and intelligence of the writers; either they intentionally sought to bring to light this point, or they just felt the need to capitalize on an assumption they figured everyone would make. If you ask me, this alone would make for a much more interesting take on the affects of people on a non-stop flight than what was delivered instead. <br/><br/>The film is a truly safe, by-the numbers 'whodunit' with traces of unoriginal directing and half- assed acting. Marks watches his plane fill up with people with hazy eyes and blurry vision, insinuating his drunken state of mind. It's too bad the film serves nothing interesting once your strapped in and settled.<br/><br/>By the time the big twist comes and the baddies are revealed, there are only a few questions that are left running around non-stop; is there anything Moore can't be good at? How was Collet- Serra able to round out a cast that includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker and Lupita Nyong'o? And why the hell is Neeson so inclined to collaborate with his formulaic and unoriginal director a third time in the upcoming Run All Night feature that is set on February 6th 2015, where, as expected, much of the same uncreative action antics will surely take place?<br/><br/>Non-Stop may deliver cheap thrills, ludicrous revelations, and half-hearted scenes of redemption with much entertainment, but contrary to its title, things seem to move at a much slower rate than suggested. By the time the credits role, one of the questions I was continually asking myself was, why the heck wasn't I drinking during this turbulent, bumpy ride of a film?"
"vicarious_tool","6","2","10","18 February 2014"," An in-flight entertainer.
","If you're in the mood for an action-thriller but don't want to re-watch any of your favorites, this is certainly an option. It has the classic elements of the genre and decent performances by the cast. As the trailer suggests it's about an air marshal (with issues) who receives threats from a passenger on board a flight, can't trust anyone and due to his poor 'bed-side manners' nobody trusts him. <br/><br/>However, don't expect too much in terms of dialogues, and the plot builds up to a rather lame ending, lots of loopholes and purely run-of-the-mill, but if you're in the mood (or on a long and boring flight) entertaining nonetheless."
"tkrowka","1","1","4","15 June 2018"," As Cheesy as it Gets
","Simply just bad. Especially the last 20 minutes are completely unbelievable. I would never want to see it a second time."
"brianberta","4","1","4","10 December 2015"," Some parts of it worked, but many others didn't
","I think that Liam Neeson is a talented actor. However, I feel that he has just picked the wrong roles to star in most of the time. Most of the action films he has starred in are either average at best, mediocre, or bad. Sure, Schindler's List is a masterpiece. Also, The Grey, The Lego Movie, and a few of his other films are amazing. However, most of the films he stars in end up being average at best, mediocre, or very bad action thrillers. Non-Stop does a few things right, but it's ultimately brought down by a unbelievable final act and a seemingly incomplete terrorist plan which I felt needed more work.<br/><br/>Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) plays a U.S. Air Marshall who is on a flight from New York City to London. During the flight, he gets a text message from someone on the plane who says that someone will die every 20 minutes unless he instructs the government to transfer $150 million into an off-shore account.<br/><br/>Firstly, there are large aspects to this film that I like. The movie actually did a good job at keeping me guessing who the terrorist would be. The person who I thought would be the terrorist turned out not to be the one so the movie did a great job at hiding its plot twist at the end. In fact, I don't think that I would've ever successfully predicted who the terrorist would be even if I had all the time in the world to do so.<br/><br/>Also, the movie does a great job building up the suspense. It starts off quiet, but the movie slowly picks up pace as more things are discovered about the plane and what the terrorists are going to do. Also, the fact that the passengers start to suspect Neeson of being the terrorist adds a whole other layer of suspense to the film. It gives us another thing in the film to be worried about.<br/><br/>However, there are also large aspects to this film that didn't work.<br/><br/>My biggest problem with the movie is the terrorist plan itself. Large parts of it were unexplained. Firstly, the movie didn't explain how the terrorists were able to hack Neeson's phone. Also, it wasn't explained how they were able to get a bomb through airport security onto the plane. Also, it wasn't explained how they were able to know that Neeson was smoking in the plane bathroom (they could've used a camera, but the movie didn't mention one at all). Finally, it wasn't explained what they used to drill a hole in the bathroom wall which enabled them to kill the pilot with a poison dart. These aren't necessarily plot holes, but the movie didn't explain how the terrorists were able to perform these parts of their plan so the movie seemed sort of incomplete in these parts.<br/><br/>On top of the unexplained sections of the plan, there were also parts which seemed to rely on pure luck and coincidence. As for the first victim, how did they know that Liam Neeson would eventually kill the passenger in the fight they had. He could've just knocked him out or he could've just surrendered. Also, Liam Neeson could've been the one who was killed and their whole plan would've failed. As for the third victim, how did they know that Liam Neeson would pin him against the wall in the exact place where they hid the poison dart. He could've just pinned him down in the aisle or he could've pinned him against the wall in a different spot. The plan didn't seem that realistic and it didn't feel like any real terrorist would rely on luck based events and coincidences that small as was shown in the film.<br/><br/>Also, the final act fell apart and seemed thoroughly unrealistic. The way they landed the plane basically defied all laws of physics and science. The final act needed work. On top of the unrealism from the final act, the reveal of who the terrorists were seemed like an abrupt way to end the film and it seemed like they couldn't find a better way to introduce the final plot twist and ending.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this film has its strong parts and the first 2/3 of the film are pretty good since it keeps you guessing and it has a good amount of tension. However, there were still unexplained bits to the terrorist plan and a few luck based events which made the terrorists plan seem incomplete and unrealistic. You'll have to stretch your suspension of belief to the breaking point with this movie, but I can't say that this is one of the worst action films ever since it does do a few things right."

","This film was an absolute train wreck. The only thing it had going for it was the director's choice of actors as you really can't go wrong with Liam Neeson Or Julianne Moore. Aside from that, in this film you can spot plot hole after plot hole and the only way you can actually enjoy it would be to switch off your brain. After attempt three of switching off my brain and accepting all the random illogical situations, I gave up. I don't even want to go on about how many plot holes there are but this film made it look effortless to insert such nonsense. I really wanted to enjoy this film but could not and for that, I generously give this film a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but if you feel you're a bit on the unintelligent side or have a talent for tuning out an abundance of plot holes, by all means."

Bill mark is on a flight to London when he starts to get encrypted text messages. He is getting black mailed to move $150 million to an off shore account. If he doesn't someone on the plan will die every 20 minutes. The movie was estimated to make $ 50,000,000. It was shown on over 300 screens in the United States opening week.

","After seeing this films trailer a while ago. And have only been back home for less than a week from a holiday in America. I am glad this didn't happen on the plane I was on. It made me think, was there a air marshal on the plane I was on since it departed from Washington Dulles. Do they actually stay in first class like portrayed in the film?<br/><br/>When watching this I thought is was boring at first. When he got the text from the terrorist, first of all you had to read of the phone screen. However when the message was above the phone and bigger made it easier to see which was the point but was well used.<br/><br/>The action is the right amount. Not so much that you can't keep up but then not too less so that it is boring. When someone was recording it and uploaded it to YouTube. That would of probably of been what I would try to do in that situation. <br/><br/>The outcome of the situation when the plane landed. I thought that more police would be there. But during the flight finding out that piece of information about Liam Neesons character, would make everyone think he has lost it. <br/><br/>The people that I suspected was the flight attendants, co-pilot and the person NYPD person since he looked like he was acting strange. <br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie and I would recommend if you like action, hijacking, hostage thrillers."

"sunshinebeachcinema","6","1","4","19 April 2014"," An average thriller, but still engaging.
","Non-Stop (2014) Directed by Juame Collet-Serra; Starring Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery<br/><br/>Rating: 3/5<br/><br/>Modern day action man Liam Neeson is back in Non-Stop, a fairly generic mystery thriller set almost entirely aboard a transatlantic flight from New York to London where Neeson must root out a terrorist who has vowed to kill a passenger every twenty minutes until his demands are met.<br/><br/>Even if the plot is a little contrived, it does have unexpected twists and turns; including the methods through which the killer carries out his murders. There is plenty of suspense, and Neeson bring his natural gravitas to the role.<br/><br/>It may seem grandiose to apply such analysis to an obvious B-movie such as this, but there's something elegant in its adherence to the classical unities of drama, which are rarely explored in mainstream works. Indeed, the film is almost set in real time, each twenty minute increment of the film roughly corresponding to each twenty minute ultimatum given by the antagonist.<br/><br/>The initial sequence in the airport is an engaging opening; a collage of disorientating images which emphasise the disconnection Neeson's character feels from the world around him. Once aboard the aircraft, we are treated to a less subtle series of shots introducing us to the motley crew of passengers, who invite suspicion with their mysterious aside glances. You can tell already that these characters will later become the major suspects in the investigation.<br/><br/>Neeson's as forlorn and enigmatic as ever, though his character is unlikely: a jaded alcoholic US Air Marshal who's terrified of flying, when he really needs all his wits about him. In contrast to other films which cast him as an American with no explanation, Non-Stop takes a rare opportunity to justify his Northern Irish accent by listing his birthplace as Belfast, and even making a small plot point out of the revelation.<br/><br/>Indeed, despite the very American themes which ultimately come to define the picture, this is an inspiringly international affair. It was produced primarily as a French-American collaboration, but helmed by Juame Collet-Serra the Spanish director of Neeson's previous action outing, the Berlin-set Unknown (2011). In addition to the Northern Irish leading man, there's a British vein running throughout by virtue of the plane itself being a British staffed flight to London, providing the chance to cast some UK talent as well as some Americans feigning over the top faux accents.<br/><br/>When he's not working furiously against the clock, Neeson's character humanised with a few compulsive characteristics: a shameless tug at the heartstrings each time Neeson interacts with the terrified child aboard the flight, a weakness for smoking in aeroplane toilets, presumably as a stress relief, and a ribbon he ties around his fingers during takeoff.<br/><br/>Naturally, the latter provides an icebreaker, sparking a conversation with fellow traveller Jen (Julianne Moore). The ribbon is also an all important connection to the character's daughter, whose story will later become an important plot point, paralleling the sadness in Neeson's own life.<br/><br/>The cabin lights are dimmed, bathing everything in an ominous blue colour palette. The atmosphere is emphasised by the slow and intoxicating soundtrack, under which lies the heavy throb of the aeroplane engines. Though the wall of sound can become grating at times, this weaves an appropriate tapestry, undoubtedly highlighted by the complete absence of dialogue during this first stage of the flight as Neeson converses with his unseen adversary for the first time through an instant messaging conversation; a thoroughly twenty first century touch.<br/><br/>Non-Stop is nothing special, but it delivers a competent if uncomplicated thriller, even if it does take some liberties with our disbelief, and indulges in some eye-rollingly gratuitous slow motion action shots near the end.

","Seeing the official trailer for Non-Stop at the cinema my eyes were attached to the screen, every moment made me shiver with excitement, and as usual, I wanted to go and watch the film just 2 weeks after it was released. My expectations of the film were highly positive as I sat down at my usual back row seat, seeing that the main actor was Liam Neeson I doubted that the film was going to be a waste of my time, considering that he was such a good and successful actor. As the upcoming trailers passed, my anticipation grew more and more restless as those vital seconds counted down to the start of the film.<br/><br/>( May contain spoilers from here onwards )<br/><br/>When the film started, I was greeted by a nice introduction of the main character, followed by a lead up of clues that I would soon see and notice later on, such as the young child at the airport, ""How was she involved with the main character?"" I thought. And ""Those people looked suspicious who were getting onto the aeroplane"". When the film got to it's main spotlight, the atmosphere grew intense and restless, my eyes darting back and forth between characters, questions were formed in my mind. ""Who could it be?"" ""How did they get access to his details?"" ""Does the suspect know him?"". I had a fun time trying to guess who the culprit was on the plane, but all my guesses were wrong until near the end of the film. It was a great plot twist and I couldn't have known, shocking everyone, including myself at the cinema. I recommend that you watch and buy this film, it has amazing acting, sneaky clues and treacherous dangerous and decisions, a must see!"

","We went to the cinema to watch a film called Non-stop which had Liam Neeson in it everyone said that it sounded really good and I couldn't make up my mind what to do so in the end I choose to go to the cinema. Nick brought loads of sweeties first we opened the m&ms first Nikita and Gemma where eating a lot of them then I opened the minstrels and me and Janice were eating them and finally nick opened the malteasers and ate half the packet this was before the film had even started. But I got nick back by given him one of the malteasers that had been on the floor ha-ha.The film we watched was called non-stop and this is what happened in the film. Neeson plays an air marshal who receives a text shortly after his flight commences that, if a load of money isn't deposited into an untraceable bank account, a passenger will be killed every 20 minutes. The film is clever enough to make it impossible to guess - or, alternatively, you pretty much suspect everyone and hope like Hell they don't pull out the old Liam-Neeson-has-multiple-personalities-and-is- doing-it-himself twist. The story takes place 30,000 feet above the Atlantic Ocean inside of a plane traveling from New York to London. Bill (Liam Neeson) is a Federal Air Marshall with a troubled past. He is assigned to accompany the international flight when things take a turn for the worst and there is an apparent hijacking of the plane. The catch: Bill is being framed. Don't worry though, But, while it might sound like you have heard this plot 100 times before just in different settings, you may be in fact incorrect. During the half way interval we took some pictures while we were sitting down waiting for our drinks some boys from school came in Marcus, Dom , Cav and Tieago came in. I said to Gemma quick hide me from them. Then when they left me and Gemma were trying to predict who the hijacker would be but it turned out we were both wrong. Needless to say the first deadline does expire and then another and then another, but the clues all point back to Bill himself, casting suspicion on the very individual we so easily assume to be the one who saves the day. For Bill (and the rest of us who continue to believe that he is just being set up), there are plenty of possible suspects on board. Could it be Bill's chatty seat mate Jen (Julianne Moore) who seems to display an inordinate amount of concern for him? Could it be either one of the air hostesses air hostesses Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and/or Gwen (Lupita Nyong'o)? Could it be the co- pilot (Jason Butler Harner) who's never really trusted Bill? Could it be a hot-headed New York cop (Corey Stoll)? Or how about the thirty- something bespectacled dude (Scoot McNairy) who had tried to make small talk with Bill prior to the flight?<br/><br/>But if there's one thing that we know, it's that it cannot be the most obvious one of them all, a Muslim doctor Fahim Nasir (Omar Metwally) whom Bill regularly relies on to check the pulses and confirm the deaths of his victims. It eventually turns out that there is a bomb on board the plane. Bill finds the bomb in the briefcase full of cocaine he then demands that the briefcase be put to the of the plane and that all mothers and children be moved to the front of the plane. He also demands that the co-pilot drops the plane from 30,000 feet to 8,000 he said this will even out the pressure and give better chance of survival the bomb goes of mid air and it destroys the back of the plane the co-pilot makes an emergency landing in Iceland."

"darkness-07","10","1","4","7 March 2014"," Best since Taken
","Went yesterday and really enjoyed it, as did my brother. If you haven't seen the trailer already, I suggest you don't watch it. I feel it gave too much away with the plot twist: you will know what I mean after you have watched the film Lots of plot twists (there is only 1 major one in the trailer). Really kept me thinking ""Who is it?"". And it was interesting to see a struggling Neeson (as in alcohol and breaking the rules despite being the air marshal!). As others have said, there are a few plot holes, but the main and important thing is that the film was really enjoyable. Neeson's best since Taken. If you liked Taken you will like this, along with the other Neeson films (although not as good as this or Taken) For those saying it was Anti-American (one saying all Muslims are terrorists), seriously you are blinded by news coverage and stereotypes. The majority of Muslims, sorry for my extreme generalizing, but ""black people"" in general are not terrorists. Yes, the terrorists we hear about on the news do are often black or foreign-to-the-US, but that doesn't mean every single person who is black or foreign is a terrorist. Perhaps the reason they didn't make the terrorists black was to avoid offense and stereotyping terrorists. Maybe this is just a film made for ENTERTAINMENT not a political message. The doctor who was giving help throughout the film was originally a suspect of Neeson's, but after questioning him, seeing his phone and him being a doctor meant that Neeson trusted him. Plus Neeson needed his help as being one of the perhaps only doctors on the plane. Plot holes: yes there were a few things overlooked but it is still a very enjoyable film and that should be what matters, not little things that make no difference (like the temperature as someone said in a different review)"
"mdome-866-33007","10","1","4","7 March 2014"," A Non-Stop thriller
","Let's start out with the basics, this movie is one of the best thrillers I've ever seen! It has a great premise, even a little scary, and has a great cast. The beginning was slow (because it was supposed to be) and once the plane took off, it got suspenseful. Partially because you have a good idea in your head because of the trailer, yet the movie is filled with surprises. I had no clue who the hijacker was! My mom is not a fan of movie thrillers, but she loved this movie. She was scared at first because we are going to Spain this summer by air, but she thought it was amazing. There were some inappropriate parts ,which make sense because it's a PG-13 movie, but I think it is still good for any movie crowd. My personal favorite part in this movie were the phone-texting scenes. But, that's probably the only distinctive very amazing part of the movie for me. But it's a mix of action, suspense, thriller, emotion, and amazement. If you haven't seen it, GO TO THEATERS TODAY!!!!!!"
"mm-39","8","1","4","4 March 2014"," Non-Stop pounding of the senses.
","Non-Stop assault of the senses. Liam Neeson has another strong performance as a harden and jaded character. There is terrorism on a air flight if a $150 000 0000 ransom is not paid which will result in a passenger's death every 20 minutes. Air marshal Neeson must stop the plot. Non-Stop script and Neeson's ability to create intense moments causes a back and forth tension for the viewers. The viewer experiences excitement then calm. Non-Stop push the viewer into one direction and then teases the viewer into another possibility. I could never guess who was behind the plot/frame up. The climax surprises and entices the movie experience. A well directed, acted, and executed movie. Non-Stop is an eight out of ten."
"3xHCCH","7","1","5","4 March 2014"," Ticking Time Bomb on a Plane
","Beginning with ""Taken"" in 2008, Liam Neeson has really been going to town with his yearly action films which really hit the spot among movie fans. There had been no more projects of ""Schindler's List"" level, but his latest movies had been more shallow fun and excitement for the audiences to enjoy than for the critics. With the title alone, this latest film of his, ""Non-Stop"" follows that same successful trend.<br/><br/>This action-thriller is set in the claustrophobic confines of a passenger airplane in a trans-Atlantic flight. Bill Marks is a US Marshall. Mid-flight he begins to receive text messages in a secure line, demanding that he should get $150M deposited in a certain bank account, or else a passenger will be killed every twenty minutes until the demand is met. <br/><br/>Because of Marks' gruff demeanor and rough ways, everyone thinks he is the hijacker! This inaccurate impression of Marks is likewise spreading beyond the confines of the plane in the news media. But Marks still had to keep his wits about him as he tries to figures out who among his co- passengers is the real culprit as the timer of a ticking time bomb is quickly running out.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson really has flawed hero characters like Bill Marks down pat. He has the dramatic skills and the action skills to pull this off creditably and believably. This guy is really on a roll. He is incredibly busy for an actor his age (he turns 62 this year), having six more films in the works for this year and the next, including ""Taken 3"".<br/><br/>Playing his gallery of suspects among the passengers are Julianne Moore (a lady who wanted to take the window seat beside Marks), Nate Parker (a military guy), Scoot McNairy (a school teacher), Corey Stoll (a NYC cop), Omar Metwally (a Muslim neuro-scientist). The two stewardesses were played by Michelle Dockery and surprisingly, Lupita Nyong'o (who just won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for ""12 Years a Slave""). <br/><br/>You may need to suspend disbelief and not think too hard about the events as they transpire. You are bound to find a plot hole or two if you look too hard. Some behaviors of the passengers, and even of Marks himself, felt very unrealistic, given the situation. Actually, hearing the entire motivation behind the whole complex plot verbalized may be a downer for some people. <br/><br/>Overall though, the situation presented was very exciting. The suspense kept you at the edge of your seats. That is the most important in a film like this, and ""Non-Stop"" achieves just that. 7/10."
"coltonvaughn10","8","1","5","1 March 2014"," Taken on a plane with a mysterious tone
","Taken on a Plane, or Non-stop, is an action thriller that stars the Liam Neeson as Bill, an Air Marshal, on a international flight. It's not as action packed, but the who done it feel is well played and surprised me. Neeson kills his role again and it's no surprise either. It's like his agent is trying to find him roles like this constantly because Neeson is a superb action star and always brings his best to every role he gets. The supporting cast was alright, but Lupita Nyong'o was disappointing. I hope she is much in 12 Years a Slave (I haven't seen it yet). I loved the little girl and Julianna Moore in the movie. They are the high points in the supporting cast. There are actually touching moments in the movie, like when Neeson talks about his daughter, that got me choked up. All in all, this a must see. I would and will recommend it and buy it on Blu-Ray when it comes out."
"ben_mister_s","9","1","5","1 March 2014"," Non-Stop AWESOME!!!
","I've always been a big fan of Liam Neesson. After the first Taken came out, he became the kind of actor I would even almost cheer for. His action roles are very enjoyable. He has a kind of anti hero flair, but at the same time he'll go all Steven Seagal on the bad guys.<br/><br/>So much for the man in charge, this movie is another fine example of how I see Liam in character. His role as air marshal is comparable with his role in Taken. He has been through a lot in his life and he's trying to live through it all, whilst being forced to repel enemies.<br/><br/>The way this movie has been put together, one word: brilliant!!! The way they introduce characters on board of the flight is excellent. You keep guessing who the unseen terrorist(s) are. Your choices for this flight (no pun intended) are a Muslim doctor, a racist NYPD officer, the arrogant businessman, the annoying German, the paranoid Julliane Moore who sits next to Liam on board, the crew, etc. Everyone on board could have a potential motive to do what the bad guy(s) do on board of this flight. The way they let you keep guessing is just great. <br/><br/>To back up the element of ""who's doing it"", the movie is filled with great action sequences and enough tense moments. The fight in the lavatory is brilliant, Jason Bourne would probably have trouble doing this one, kudos for executing this sequence in a brilliant way. <br/><br/>Not to spoil anymore about this great thriller, just watch it. Great setting, great action, enough suspense en good characters. This is probably the best airplane thriller I've ever seen."
"CowherPowerForever","8","1","5","28 February 2014"," Liam Neeson on a Plane
","Liam Neeson is back on the big screen with another good thriller action film. Some call it Taken on a plan. I simply call it Liam Neeson acting normal. With an edge of your seat whodunnit and some nice action this is a must see film without a doubt.<br/><br/>Written by John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle we get a nice end of your seat thriller. There are times when the films slows down here, and there, but overall it sticks together nicely. Liam Neeson is a U.S. air marshal who is an alcoholic who lost his child to cancer when she was only 8 years old. Trying to keep his life and career on track we see how he has continued to live his life. It has not been easy for him over the years. But on this flight Neeson is meet by an unknown person sending him text messages on his secure phone line. As this phase of the film starts the games begin. Who is sending the messages, and who is the real terrorist. I'm not going to give that information, but for over an hour it is a game of whodunnit. With nice twists and turns throughout the film you really have no idea who it truly is until very close to the ending. Frankly I was even wrong on who the real terrorist was going to be. The writers here did a nice job of playing the characters nicely off of each other. In a film like this that is a much needed aspect.<br/><br/>Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who also directed Liam Neeson in another film, Unknown. This film is a step up from their last outing. The pacing of the film was done nicely with only a few minor hiccups here and there. Nothing that hurts the film, but there are gaps where the film slows down. When you have a film taking place nearly entirely on a plane that will happen most of the time. The action and fight scenes are truly amazing. Near the end of the film when the action truly picks up Jaume Collet-Serra shows just how great he is at directing an action scene. Thankfully we will get to see these two men work yet again on another action film in early 2015.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Top notch actors like Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, and Scoot McNairy round out this amazing cast. The actors gel very well together, and not just the top actors. The secondary actors with smaller roles do a very good job in the film. Over the years some have said Neeson simply plays the same character over and over again. The character being Bryan Mills from Taken. Neeson is a fantastic actor, and he pulls off the alcoholic divorced man very well. He is very believable and delivers his lines perfectly. Not to mention one of the greatest lines in film history with, ""I'm not hijacking this plane. I'm trying to save it!"". That line alone put me into the theater.<br/><br/>Overall for action and thriller fans this is a very good film to go out and watch in the theater. The visuals are stunning in the major action scenes and the acting is amazing. Some who hold the attitude that Liam Neeson keeps playing the same character over and over again probably won't like the film much. If you are in that boat waiting for a rental won't hurt you here. For the rest of us this is a must see film that should be seen on the big screen."
"trublu215","8","1","6","1 March 2014"," Turn your brain off and enjoy the ride
","Non-Stop pits Liam Neeson in yet another race against time, fight for your life drama and it pays off. This is just the type of film you'd expect to see in Feburary/March. It is fun, light and action packed. Liam Neeson plays a down on his luck ex-cop turned Air Marshall who is framed by terrorist and sets out to clear his name all while on a flight in mid-air, over the Atlantic Ocean. The film really does an excellent job of showing us just enough to raise suspicions for just about every character on the plane, including Neeson's character. This is a wild ride of a film and it comes as a real surprise considering this time of the year is dumping grounds for studios. Neeson, still bolstering off of the success of the Taken series and other films such as The Grey, really doesn't let his fan base down here. He plays a mean, surly, cigarette smoking badass and he does so with enough charisma that we don't really mind seeing him do the same thing over and over again. A nice addition to Neeson's performance is Julianne Moore. Moore isn't Oscar-caliber here (obviously) but she does just enough to keep the film going. The rest of the cast has typical action movie one liners that are corny and cheesy but for a film like this, it works beautifully. <br/><br/>The story progresses as a Hitchcock film with a Luc Besson-esque twist, utilizing its one area setting to create some massive tension in every scene. Overall, this is a fun movie that you can watch and just enjoy thoroughly. Do yourself a favor and give this one a shot."
"dmurilloroman","9","1","6","1 March 2014"," Liam Neeson, Please Don't Stop
","This film left me leaving the theater in a complete sweat because of all the intensity from the get-go. Even simple things such as a character taking a breath will force you to question their motives and it is basically a 100 minute roller coaster ride. Liam Neeson has reassured the public here again that he is both an action and drama star with a bit of comedy flair. The movie shouldn't be written off as a dumb and forgettable action flick because it's the complete opposite, there is a lot of entertaining action but is also a top ranking film when it comes to it's characters who all have multiple emotional layers to them, even ones in minor roles. This is then able to drag you into the scenario which will not let go until the very end. The story is actually very smart throughout, without making you feel as the script was trying to cheat or make plot holes. Personally, the cinematography was quite impressive mostly because of the constricted space allowed and also the dark complexion given to the picture. I am shocked to say that this is most likely the best film of 2014 so far that contains a twist that is not at all clichÃ©d which is a breath of fresh air."

Completely held to ransom by a series of anonymous texts, Leeson is slowly being framed for the hijacking of a transatlantic flight from USA to London. As always with these films it boils down to a basic whodunit, and I made several guesses along the way, some were correct but mainly I got it wrong. This was a good film, well written and sensitively cast with a good cross section of people on the plane. The plot was believable as were the effects.

","This action film is based on a threat against an airplane where an air marshall, in charge of protecting it, is traveling. It is very similar to many other terrorist and hijacker films, but it still does reasonably well.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson is an excellent actor and has a knack for action or thriller films. It is his strength as an actor and he makes this film with ease. The character did not bring any kind of challenge to the actor, and he supports the entire film on his back very well. Julianne Moore also appears, but has had very little to do other than get on the plane and have some more tense dialogues with Neeson. The same can be said of Linus Roache, Michelle Dockery and especially Lupita Nyong'o, who is demoted to a cameo.<br/><br/>Tense and involving, the film still manages to create an environment and build around it. Cinematography is very good and collaborates very well for this purpose, as do the rare but effective special and sound effects. The soundtrack is effective, but I confess that it was not in my ear. The end of the film was criticized at times, but I think it was not possible to do it any other way. However, it could have been rethought in several places where it sounds quite bad, such as dialogues and some situations: for example, how would it be possible for an airplane in such a situation to land at an airport that not even foam placed on the runway?<br/><br/>Despite having several flaws and losing qualities as it unfolds, it is a film that still proved capable of entertaining and involving most of the time."

","When it comes to action, this film really lives up to its title. The action is indeed non-stop. While the film is not without flaws and plotholes, it's got enough spirit and thrill to make up for it. (However, there is one genuinely sweet moment that was unnecessarily turned into a comic relief moment) I came in with my expectations high and left thinking the film was better than I thought it would be. Just imagine how much better this would have been if I had come in with my expectations low. There's twists and turns at every moment, some details that you have to really have to pay attention to the film to notice, (and you will be rewarded for doing so) and some bait-and-switch moments that will surprise you. The whole film feels like a game of mafia set on an airplane. A game in which the audience is constantly fooled. You will not be dissapointed if you see this film.

","This movie shows a lot parallels to Flightplan, (if I had to pick one I would choose the female power of Jodie, and because Non-Stop is slightly heavier on the action-side and Flightplan slightly more on the drama-side, but) both movies are fantastic and their biggest success is that beside being extremely thrilling, they show the pain and the powerlessness and stress when you know you know/speak the truth, but you are being manipulated in such a way that nobody believes you. And to people who think the plots are illogical/exaggerated etc. - well, I can only say: these people are the proof of the realism of the plot. Fates are different, and correspondingly ignorant and arrogant is some people's behavior. The people who think the plot is unbelievable are usually the ones who trust the bombers / blackmailers / liars and applaud them (they are not always bombers, but they are, for example, spiritual instigators and more often than not money is their goal as well) and the victims who do know the truth, they do not believe them, they disrespect and even blame them and make their life a torment. This is happening every day, and only the ignorant / arrogant / inexperienced and naive, who have always been lucky and have never experienced suffering and lack of respect and lack of support and never really had to fight hard, deny this - and they think their happiness is their own achievement alone - ha ha, how nasty and blind can people be (it is exactly these people who never had to struggle). And that these movies successfully address and show this phenomenon is a success of its own, and in addition there is the superb acting, and an extremely suspenseful production. Check them both out!"

This makes our Air Marshall perfect for framing. The action takes off from there ... Non-Stop! There are deaths on board, two being the second Air Marshall, and the Pilot. Everything looks bad for our Air Marshall, and because of his actions the passengers don't trust him. It also doesn't help that those on the ground believe the evidence that he is guilty of the crimes he is accused of. Everything comes out in the end with bumps and bruises galore.

","I am very surprised that Alfred Hitchcock's 1959 thriller North by Northwest doesn't get mentioned in reviews of Non-Stop. Here Liam Neeson plays a character whose situation is as maddening as that of Cary Grant in the Hitchcock classic. He is unexpectedly framed and treated by the world at large as a suspect for serious crimes. For most of the film, the protagonist of both films tries to sweat it out but has no clue whatsoever as to who is framing him and for what possible reason. Main difference between the films is that Neeson sweats in the confined but familiar environment of a transatlantic jet. No escape through the corn field this time! North by Northwest wasn't marketed as an action film, but by 1959 standards it was pretty much non-stop action. It is the mystery and the accompanying suspense that makes the film in both cases. True motives of the villains in the Hitchcock film have always seemed somewhat nonsensical to me, but who ever cared? In Non-Stop the point is who is pulling the strings, not really the why.

","As confirmed Liam Neeson fans, I settled down to watch this film as an off-chance discovery whilst channel surfing and with only the very short television synopsis to guide me.<br/><br/>There are so many aeroplane disaster films out there, that coming up with a unique and interesting storyline was always going to be difficult.<br/><br/>Having said that, I was uncertain about the identity of the 'baddie', until the big reveal close to the end of the film, which was all to the good and which raised the points rating.<br/><br/>The main thing in which I was a little disappointed, was that when the motive for the crime was eventually revealed, it just didn't seem very plausible, which meant that what started out as a good solid plot, with strong characters, turned into a rather weakened affair, with no obvious sense of purpose.<br/><br/>'Non-Stop' still offered good entertainment value and I didn't need to think too hard about it!"

","If you've ever read a review penned by me, you'd likely already know, I love Liam Neeson. That said, I really would have taken a connecting flight. This movie, although Liam doing his Liam thing that we all love, just plain sucked.* (See what I did there? ) Of course, you have to have 3 things to settle in with a Liam flick : A troubled past, a time limit, and an inevitable fight scene in a bathroom. In this aspect, Non-Stop doesn't disappoint. Although this matrix IS getting pretty old. Bill Marks, a down and out, troubled Air Marshall is seemingly called to duty on a non-stop international flight. The character is immediately likable, rough, tough kind of guy Liam Neeson plays best. Close to the vest, troubled past, true good guy. He didn't want to go on this ride either. That should have been warning enough. But noooooo, I chi continued. The ""co-stars"", for the most part, are B listers. Julianne Moore is the exception. But not a very significant one. Her character is so forgettable that, as I write this, her character's name escapes me. Annnnnnnddd, I really don't care enough to go look it up. This was not a pivotal performance, by any stretch. The film did its best to cast shadows and doubt throughout the film. Maybe it's that guy. Or what about that stewardess? But, pretty soon, I found that I simply didn't care. The every 20 minute death thing didn't feel right, timing wise. And, actually, it wasn't. But, there's the mark of a bored viewer. Timing the threat. Maybe it's because I'm used to this formula. Maybe it's because I'm psychic, whatever, I figured it out, long before I should have. Somewhere around the photo message. The backstory wasn't even well constructed. Marks says that his daughter, Olivia ""would be 17""...Sloppy. Overall, another gratuitous violence movie stretching to be something more. Trying to allow the viewer to displace their own prejudices, but not actually achieving that goal. Simply, it's not the best. Maybe I just should have stuck with the in-flight movie."
"moonspinner55","6","0","1","20 June 2015"," ""And, in an unbelievable twist...""
","Liam Neeson doesn't really act anymore--he performs, and that's not the same thing, particularly when he's constantly engaged in brawls (edited for maximum impact) or giving faux-impassioned speeches of the 'you have to trust me' variety. Screenwriters John W. Richardson, Chris Roach and Ryan Engle invariably understand if you call an action movie ""Non-Stop"" it better have non-stop action, and this one does. Neeson plays a distraught, withdrawn, alcoholic U.S. Air Marshal on a flight from New York to London who discovers there's a hijacker aboard the plane--one who is cleverly mounting an airtight case against Neeson as a purveyor of justice. Despite an overly-familiar feel to the scenario, the rampant suspicion and paranoia of the piece easily gnaws at the viewer, aided and abetted by the shameless director, Jaume Collet-Serra, and the scenarists, who even give us a good-natured New York cop with a busted nose and a frightened child clutching a symbolic ribbon of hope! The plot-holes and glaring implausibilities predictably stack up, yet the intensity of the disparate personalities in this confined space high in the air works the audience over smoothly until we are putty in the filmmakers' hands. Julianne Moore is a pithy, salt-of-the-earth type who makes a good drinking buddy for Neeson (no romantic sparks), while our hero makes enough snap assessments so right on the money that he doesn't even have any explaining to do at the finale. He and the audience both come out smiling. **1/2 from ****"
"Shad_Critic","7","0","1","2 June 2015"," Only good when you see it for the first time
","The first time I saw Non-Stop, I was very entertained because of the huge suspense in it. Very thrilling though. I walked out of the theaters and I was satisfied for the day. Months later, I bought a DVD copy of Non-Stop and watched it again for the second time. What I realized is that the suspense is absent because I am already aware who the threat in the movie is. That's what I found disappointing. It's not that kind of movie that is re-watchable.<br/><br/>Other than that, Liam Neeson did another great performance as a bad-ass character. What I find ridiculous is, is the bad guy's plan. Framing an air marshal from hijacking because of 9/11? Really ridiculous or maybe the bad guy is that just crazy. Anyway I still liked the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Non-Stop is great but not re-watchable. The movie is only good for people who saw it first time."
"filmfanperspective","6","0","1","5 May 2015"," Taken On A Plane (***)
","There may come a day when Liam Neeson can no longer play the same (or similar) role over and over and get away with it. Today is not that day. He's the sensitive yet menacing lead that audiences have warmed up to again and again (""Taken"", ""The Grey"") . He's a down- to-earth god (""Clash of the Titans""), a war captain (""Battleship""), and even a benevolent yet rebellious Jedi (""Star Wars, Episode I""). He's the go-to guy for films that need a front man who audiences trust to not be too risqué, yet deliver on chops. His latest action-fest ""Non-Stop"" happens to be a generic film, and I liked it more than I should have. I attribute that almost entirely to Neeson's presence, and the expectations that now come with it.<br/><br/>Neeson plays Bill Marks, a troubled, weary, alcoholic federal air marshal. I'm sure the United States government chooses nothing but top-notch candidates to be air marshals, but I'm also sure that many of them are likely worn out by their jobs. Bill sure is worn out by his, or perhaps it's because of his life (does it matter?). However, he keeps on keepin' on, albeit with a swig of booze beforehand. His latest flight is from London to New York (how's that for foreshadowing?), and luckily for him, he gets to sit right next to Julianne Moore. After all, if you're going to take a transatlantic flight, can it at least be next to her? She'd probably be game for a deep soul-searching chat, right? The problem here is that we know her, and if something goes awry, how can we not expect her to be involved? I'm sure this violates one of Roger Ebert's 'Movie Laws'.<br/><br/>I digress, for something does go awry once the flight is airborne, and we must get to that. Bill receives a disturbing message (spoiler alert- it's not Brett Favre's dick) on his phone threatening to kill someone on the plane every 20 minutes unless, you got it, money is deposited to a special account. Bill has a secure phone, so whomever is texting him threats must really be, well, threatening. Even worse, people begin to actually die, so somehow someone is sending him messages and making this all happen. Bill knows the lead stewardess (Dockery), and enlists her and Julianne Moore to watch everyone on camera to see who answers their text. This creates the air of suspicion, distracting us from the real troublemaker.<br/><br/>This film tries so hard to throw the audience off the scent by throwing in just enough recognizable character actors to generate reasonable doubt. It basically works, for at one point during the film I eliminated everyone on the plane from being culpable, and began to consider even spiritual angles. Bravo, plot. It's a contrived scenario, simply just to be contrived. I actually started thinking back to Occam's Razor (all things considered, the simplest explanation is likely the correct one). If only I'd begun with that, and went with my gut feeling that the one responsible was, in fact, responsible. After all, ""Non-Stop"" wasn't interested in changing the action-thriller game. All the usual suspects for a functional whodunit are present, and while effective, doesn't blow our minds.<br/><br/>Sure, the ending is unsatisfying, hammy, and abrupt. Sure, the would-be terrorist's reasoning is unoriginal, selfish, and delivered in typical 'villain reveals all motives for no reason' fashion. Sure, there's another angle the filmmakers could have gone with regarding post 9/11 paranoia, or the loneliness of people who live in the air. Sure, it's not ground-breaking. I really should hate this film for taking me on another unnecessary action-thriller ride, but I just cannot bring myself to do so. It's banality is just so complete, and I can't help but wonder- was Liam Neeson was really the only thing I drew me to enjoy this movie? The answer is basically yes, and that's fine. I would probably enjoy watching Liam Neeson simply sit on a flight and make strained facial gestures for 2 hours. Really, who needs a film where he takes charge of a flight and hunts down a terrorist? In fact, maybe I should write that script. (Better get to it before Michael Bay or Luc Besson does)"

","Once in a while you run into a movie which has you stuck to the edge of your seat all the way. For me, Non-Stop is one of those few movies. From the very start to the very end you are taken on a ride, wondering what will happen next. Personally I find this movie brilliant, extremely well thought out, especially because of its various plots and subplots. One moment you think the culprit is found, the next it seems he is not, but in the end it turns out it was him after all. Plus an unexpected twist to it as well! Not only that, but the movie also plays with very common preconceptions (e.g. one may be inclined to think the Muslim was the one, but he turned out not to be, quite the contrary - not all Muslims are evil, I have several Muslim friends myself), as well as the personal every day issues with the main character (alcohol abuse, etc.). Even though the entire movie (except for the start and end) takes place within the confined space of an airplane, it never gets boring, there's always something new going on to keep you excited and wondering what will happen next. I'll be honest, until a few hours ago I had never even heard of this movie. I decided to watch it, and am very glad that I did, it was the most entertaining movie time I have had in quite a while! I very rarely give a 10 to a movie, but for me this movie deserves top marks!"

","Liam Neeson starring himself (as always)! Yey!<br/><br/>Bill Marks, a former cop dealing with his daughter's death by drinking, is now a federal air marshal. While on a flight from New York to London, Marks gets a text telling him that unless 150 million dollars is transferred to an offshore account, someone will die every 20 minutes. Can he find the terrorist in time and save everyone?<br/><br/>So, whole story is pretty decent. At first, I wasn't looking forward for this movie, but not when I saw it, I can tell that it's pretty good action/thriller movie. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson acts same in every movie. Here he acted same, as well. I don't know, but in every single movie he was acting on, his family is always dying or is already dead (or he is saving someone who have something in common with his family). Also, he never dies. He is playing God in every movie. ALSO, he is always a cop (or ex-cop), but he always saves everyone or get justice for his family. Julianne Moore really surprised me. She is really good actor and in this movie she acted good as well. I wasn't expecting this much acting in this movie, but we get their best.<br/><br/>Special effects are well made. Plane crushing on runway is pretty cool. Also, I was enjoying those moments when they hit a ceiling of plane (because gravity or that kind of stuff).<br/><br/>Movie is thrilling and interesting, but there are a lot of clichés. I couldn't help myself not to notice them. Also, this movie is pretty predictable, but who is terrorist... no!<br/><br/>So, this movie is well made, it's really entertaining and I'm recommending it to everyone!"

","Non-stop opens with the slow-motion slosh of Bill's whiskey bottle. Eyes bleary and bloodshot, he touches a snapshot of a young girl, then gruffly makes his way through security to the terminal. As passengers for the New York-to-London flight wait to board, he watches them with the suspicion required for the job, but also with the cynicism of a miserable man surrounded by people happier than him. Bill makes vague small talk with his neighbor, Jen (Julianne Moore), and the only thing either reveals is they both fly often. As he white-knuckles through takeoff, he explains to her, ""Some things, you never get used to.""<br/><br/>Once the plane reaches cruising altitude, Bill receives anonymous text messages, which Collet-Serra visualizes as floating bubbles, like comic- book word balloons (unintentional foreshadowing for the silly finale, perhaps). The texter makes the standard demands: $150 million, or someone dies every 20 minutes. When Bill's supervisors on the ground learn the account for the ransom bears his name, his character and motives are called into question, although the audience will stand steadfast alongside him, for the most part."

","In similar style to taken 1 and 2 this movie is a non stop action featuring Liam Neeson as the films hero. Overall it was very exciting and kept you guessing right up to the end. Most of the acting was on par with this style of movie, Liam Neeson gave the strongest performance. The story itself was very cliché (e.g plane, terrorists, bomb, hero saves the day) but as far as typical action/thrillers go this one holds your attention throughout. It was a relief/refreshing to see that for once the terrorist in the film wasn't Arabic or eastern European. The main downside to the film was the ending which was very poorly acted and extremely cheesy.

The setting of this movie is a transatlantic jetliner bound for London. And this movie takes advantage of the setting because of the small setting we get to learn a lot of information about all of the passengers on the plane and we get to watch them develop as characters the movie makes you identify characters. It will make you figure out who the good guys and the bad guys are. Liam Nesson did a great job portraying a Air Marshal. And throughout the movie you are on the edge of your seat trying to guess what will happen this whole movie will keep you guessing. And overall it is one of my favorite action movies I did not see much wrong with it except for some scenes that lacked realism. This movie was definitely one of the most epic movies I have ever seen."
"thestarkfist","Null","0","2","27 December 2014"," Fast Paced But Laughably Ludicrous
","My summary pretty much says it all. ""Non-stop"" moves at a rapid clip once the story begins to really unfold, no doubt because, if the director lingers too long on any of the plot points, you're likely to realize just how ridiculous it all is. The movie is well made and Liam Neeson is as watchable as ever so your best bet is to not think about it much and just let the stupid wash over you. Thankfully it all gets over with quickly and the climax doesn't overstay its welcome like with so many other thrillers in the past 10 years. <br/><br/>In short the plot revolves around a ludicrously complicated scheme designed to allow the bad guys to either make off with a paltry $150 million dollars (hey, guys, got any idea how much the Walton family is worth?) and/or teach America that, even after 9-11, it's still not safe and secure. If they really want to steal a lot of money they should just do it the easy way and run for Congress and if they really want America to learn that it's still not safe from terrorist attacks they should continue to vote for a Republican president! It's so much simpler than all the nonsense the caper in this flick involves.<br/><br/>Side note to the hater reviews: If the kindly Liberals in Hollywood want to remind us that not all Muslims are fanatical terrorist murders then I think they should be applauded for doing so, not chided. After all, not all Christians are pedophiles now are they?"

","This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>Oh, that dreaded third act! It destroys many great works of art, be they books, plays, or movies. While Non Stop is no great work of art in anyone's mind, the curse stays with this nifty little mystery thriller. The musty old premise of this whodunit can go back to the superior puzzler, Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians: People are being systematically murdered, in this case, aboard a plane, and it is up to our hero to find the culprit and end this crime wave.<br/><br/>Liam Neesom again is typecast in this action role as an alcoholic lawman who is forced to solve this mystery. (At least, he brings some authority and gratis to his role as the air marshal aboard the plane.) But as the story evolves, so do the loopholes in the plot. The film sets up its red herrings as interesting suspects, but becomes more ludicrous and illogical until it finally disregards the mystery and resembles a pure action film with its far-fetched conclusion. The execution of the murders are strictly preposterous and it is never fully explained how the killer had the know-how and ability to act out this scheme.<br/><br/>Talented actors are wasted in this standard story: Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery, Corey Stoll, Lupita Nyong'o, and Linus Roache. That is the real crime afoot. That three people contributed to this screenplay (John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach, and Ryan Engle) is an even greater mystery. Direction by Jaume Collet-Serra is merely adequate, although he does keep the action moving. The special effects are routine but acceptable. The film was moderately entertaining and kept me guessing until its disappointing revelations unraveled with its dumb ending.<br/><br/>Non-Stop left me non-plussed.

","Starring- Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, Nate Parker, Scoot McNairy, Michelle Dockery, and Lupita Nyong'o<br/><br/>Non-Stop 7.5/10- Action movie+Liam Neeson= Awesome film. Everyone should enjoy Non-Stop. The trailer makes you believe it is just a decent action movie, but it is much more than that. Mystery movies are truly an unappreciated genre in film and Non-Stop is the closest thing you can to a solid mystery movie nowadays. It is not in the Murder on the Orient Express territory, but it is a great ""who done it"" type of film with action legend Liam Neeson at the helm. <br/><br/>Part of the reason Non-Stop looks so appealing to everyone is that we have all seen Liam Neeson in this type of role before. He has no clue whats going on, but he is smart, and can beat the crap out of anyone. This is without a doubt Liam Neeson's bread and butter movie. He could have carry this movie if he had to, but thankfully the movie actually brought other good components to the table other than an A-list lead actor. <br/><br/>Aside from the movie Flightplan, no other films have really taken place entirely on an airplane and the setting alone is a breathe of fresh air. Now to the plot, you know from the trailer that there will be a few twists and turns, but still the presentation of these twists and turns keep you on the edge of your seat despite the fact that you knew it was coming. You really have no idea who the person sending him the texts is going to be. You think you have it figured out, but then the director knew you would think that and eliminate that option and keep you guessing. No one in the theater knew it was going to be who it was, not even me. <br/><br/>The screenwriters must have known while they were writing the movie that Liam Neeson was going to be the lead role because they wrote in all of the advantages that Liam Neeson gives a film. Liam Neeson plays a federal air marshal who is just doing his job. Then, suddenly he has to spring into action after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfer $150 million into an off-shore account. The premise of this ""who done it"" thriller alone is an impressive, bold idea that everyone loves and has definitely paid off. Liam Neeson no doubt gave a great performance Agent Bill Marks and after seeing this movie you will definitely agree that no one could have done a better job. <br/><br/>Best action movie out right now.

(I would have ranked it lower, but hey, it's Liam Neeson.) <br/><br/>The dialogue was mediocre, events and reactions weren't believable, and what little romance is in the film was obviously injected as a matter of formula (but without thoughtful placement, these scenes fall flat).

Basically discharged NYPD officer Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is an alcoholic following the death of his daughter from leukaemia, he now works as U.S. federal air marshal, he is boarding a Boeing 767 non-stop flight from New York to London aboard British Aqualantic Flight 10, he is seated next to passenger Jen Summers (Julianne Moore). Midway over the Atlantic Ocean, while most passengers are sleeping, Bill receives text messages on his secure phone from an unknown caller, the stranger threatens to kill someone in twenty minutes, and this will repeat every twenty minutes, unless $150 million is transferred into a specific bank account. Bill breaks protocol and consults with Jack Hammond (Anson Mount), the other air marshal, he is discovered to be smuggling cocaine, they argue and Bill end up killing his partner in the lavatory, this counts as the first death, the twenty minute clock starts again, working with Jen and flight attendant Nancy (Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery) they look on the surveillance monitors to see which passengers use their cell phones when he messages the texter. The next twenty minutes expire, the second victim is pilot Captain David McMillan (Priest's Linus Roache) from poisoning, the situation becomes more tense as Bill alerts the plane of a potential situation, they and the public on the ground become convinced he is hijacking the plane himself, a passenger filmed and uploaded a video of him acting aggressively without explanation, and the bank account is in his name, the TSA instruct co-pilot Kyle Rice (Jason Butler Harner) to ignore Bill and land in nearest destination Iceland, he diverts the plane, but cautiously continues to trust Bill. Cell phone programmer Zack White (Nate Parker) helps by hacking the texter's cell phone to ring, Bill locates it with a passenger who claims to have never seen it before, after a fight this passenger dies in a similar fashion to the captain, looking at the bodies of of the captain and the passenger Bill determines they were killed by poison dart. The texter sends a message out that makes it look like Bill is suicidal and will detonate a bomb on the plane, a bomb is found in Hammond's suitcase filled with smuggled cocaine, passengers convinced he is a terrorist try to hold him, but teacher Tom Bowen (Scoot McNairy) helps him get them away with a gun, Bill finally explains the situation to the passengers. The bomb cannot be deactivated, so passengers take his instructions to place it at the rear of the plane, covering it with luggage bags, the plane will then descend to 8,000 feet to equalise air pressure, the explosion will be contained and there will be minimal casualties, as this is being done Bill watches the video of himself that was uploaded, and he spots something. Tom Bowen slipped the cell phone into the second victim's pocket, Bowen is the culprit, and White is working with him, Bowen's father was killed in the 9/11 attacks, he and White are ex- security, they want frame an air marshal as a terrorist which will lead to higher airline security, Bowen is prepared to die along with the other passengers if it leads to this change, he shoots White who is persuaded at a point to disarm the bomb. Following another fight, and the co-pilot in panic descending the plane rapidly, Bill shoots Bowen in the head, and defeated by him White is killed being close to the bomb blast. In the end Rice makes an emergency crash landing at the Iceland air base following the explosion, the fighter-jet escorting the threatened plane do not shoot it down as warned, the plane sustains great damage but no-one else is harmed, Bill is cleared as a terrorist and praised as a hero, and he and Jen start a friendship. Also starring 12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o as Gwen, The Bourne Legacy's Corey Stoll as Austin Reilly and Rendition's Omar Metwally as Dr. Fahim Nasir. Neeson does his usual hardman act well, Moore is okay as the frequent flyer assisting him, and some of the co-stars get their time alright as well, the cat-and-mouse game element works relatively well, as you play along and try to guess who is the bad guy or who will be next to snuff it, and being in a location thousands of feet above ground the claustrophobia is certainly present throughout, the dialogue and some moments are predictable and daft, but this is not a bad action thriller at all. Worth watching!"

","Bill Marks(Liam Neeson),a former cop turned federal air marshal, is on a flight out of NYC to London, when he begins getting text messages from a threatening blackmailer. The person sending the messages claims to be on board the flight too and threatens to hijack the plane unless 150 million dollars is put into a mystery account. Forty thousand feet in the air, knowing he needs to identify the blackmailer, not sure about the gender of the person making the threats; there needs to be a solution made before the killing of passengers, one by one, begins. Marks gets aid from fellow passenger Jen Summers(Julianne Moore), but can she be trusted? In a Neeson movie, you can count on action and violence.

","Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore and the ""we don't see enough of him""; Linus Roache make this movie a piece of art! From the beginning you are thrown into a contemplative mode whereby you are never really sure how stable the main character is. As the story progresses the 'cards' begin to stack up until finally, it's man against the World (well; crew and passengers!). The master plot (if that's what you would call it?) is woven into some smaller sub plots and they revolve around an underlying story of; ""what happens when your World falls apart"", which is actually true for more than one of the characters in this story. I would recommend watching this movie with a simple thought in the back of your mind: could this really happen?"

"jonathanluisdiaz","9","0","2","25 September 2014"," Intense thriller full of intense moments of pure shock and suspicion
","Jaume Collet-Serra's Non-Stop was intense thriller full of intense moments of pure shock and suspicion. From the moment the movie started it's fairly obviously that the cast for the movie has been chosen almost perfectly. We are introduced to a broken Bill Marks, portrayed by the one and only Liam Neeson, who portrayed almost perfectly a broken man. Neeson does a good job in this to give off a personality of someone who has been through a lot, someone wise. Along with Neeson's strong performance we have Julian Moore's accompanying and powerful performance complimenting Neeson's investigation, she adds on to the more emotional side throughout the intense flight. Non-stop takes place on an international flight, an Air Marshall named Bill Marks boards the plane and begins to receive messages from an unknown person. The individual begins threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes if $150 million dollars are not transferred to an account. As intense scenes begin to unfold the struggle of an investigation to find the unknown individual seems to be pointing to Bill as the plane hijacker. The plot keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing what really happens next, it takes pretty good writing to be unpredictable. <br/><br/>What really brought together the movie was Richardson and Roach's brilliant script. Throughout the whole movie I sat there trying to guess who was the bad guy, it was like everyone on the plane was in the wrong place at the wrong time and just made everyone look extremely guilty. It was almost like a clue version of investigation but on a plane. Anyone could be the individual even those who seemed completely trustworthy could suddenly look extremely suspicious. On top of this, watching the mastermind that carefully planned out the hijacking so Bill (Neeson) would appear as the real hijacker was brilliantly suspenseful. The brilliant script was accompanied by beautiful cinematography. Throughout the movie we witness very small details within the vast of action and shock, accompanied by close-ups of those witnessing in terror. At one point it seems like the whole plane is just going to crash and just for a moment it slows down and takes a look at the only child in the movie illustrating sheer terror in her eyes. It gave it not only a very intense feel but a more dramatic feel to the events occurring rather than having a bunch of clash of intense action scenes filled with mindless passengers with no reaction but screaming. When I began watching the film I was expecting another action filled thriller full of explosions and intense scares, but was pleasantly surprised to see that the movie was complimented pretty often by moments of pure connection. You can actually understand peoples despair and their motivations for what they do. Instead of placing the pasts of people out there blatantly and out of place, we see their real persona bleed through still giving us room for suspicion of who they are but yet more of an idea of what kind of person they are. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie that keeps you guessing, surprised, and shocked throughout the movie then look no further. I would even go as far as saying that this was one of the greatest movies of 2014. Not a completely mindless action film but rather one that actually requires you to pay attention to understand to everything is going on. It was a brilliant film and now after seeing the film I re-watched the film and noticed amount of details surrounding the plot put into this amazing movie. Non-Stop is a perfect example of what thrillers should be."

","Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is a federal air marshal on the job flying from New York to London. Then he gets text messages breaching the secured network threatening to kill somebody in 20 minutes unless he pays $150 million. Hammond (Anson Mount) is the other agent on the plane but he denies sending the messages. Jen Summers (Julianne Moore) is the woman who switched seat next to Bill. Nancy (Michelle Dockery) is a flight attendant. Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll) is a NYPD detective. It's a thriller and a mystery as Bill struggles to find the criminal sending the texts. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson has become the great intense leading man. It has good tension. Being stuck on a plane is always a good way to create tension. It's relying on lots of twists and turns. If the audience doesn't get bucked off, it's a fun ride. Sometime after the reveal, there is a build up of way too many crazy things. The little girl is one too many. It didn't necessarily buck me off completely but it came close. At least, it's a terrific fun ride for most of the movie."

","A smart action flick, which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout. Liam Neeson leads a surprisingly developed and interesting cast of characters, played by actors including Julianne Moore, Scoot McNairy, Corey Stoll, and Michelle Dockery. Unlike other films, Non-Stop establishes its tone and stays true to it till the very end. This film is for both action buffs and mystery lovers. There are some elements in the film that are relevant to social issues involving national security and how to maintain it. If you can overlook the convenience of how the plot unfolds, then I guarantee an entertaining time."
"SimonJack","9","0","2","13 September 2014"," New twist adds suspense and tension to air hijacking plot
","Just when one thinks that plane hijacking and air disaster films have about run their course, Hollywood comes up with a new twist. ""Non-Stop"" adds new mystery and tension to this sub-genre of mystery-action thrillers. And a stellar cast delivers plenty of excitement. <br/><br/>Liam Neesen is a believable U.S. air marshal, Bill Marks; even if the premise of his dislike or fear of flying is a bit hard to swallow. Julianne Moore is excellent in her role as Jen Summers, a passenger whom Marks trusts, then distrusts, then trusts again. The rest of the cast all deliver top performances. Watching this film, one had a sense of real fear among the many passengers. Perhaps the only weak spot in the film was the organizing of a few male passengers to overcome Marks. It didn't seem quite real – had a stagy feel to it. <br/><br/>The cinematography and special effects for this film were outstanding. It has a very taut plot that is well-scripted. It maintains good tension throughout – as a very good mystery-thriller should. And the title is aptly named for the action throughout, as well as for the flight's schedule."
"adamscastlevania2","6","0","1","12 September 2014"," Non-stop entertainment
","(60%) An intense thrill ride that hooks you in and doesn't let go until the very final reel. It must be said that this accomplishes all that it set out to do, and is very entertaining without being overblown or too dumb. Neeson has adapted into this fine popcorn entertainer and here he's playing a role not far off ""Into the grey"". The way that it suggests that almost anyone could be the killer is its biggest strength as paranoia looms over everyone until almost the very end, and that in itself is a decent trick to pull off. It's very much a movie that's well worth a look, and is a rock-solid rental or a matinée cinema ticket, but maybe not a full price as it's good, but not brilliant."

","I you like I are a fan of Liam Neeson and his brand of anti-hero acting then this is for you. This is a Taken but not quite sort of movie. I really enjoyed the feel and the way this movie was presented. <br/><br/>Liam is also really on form in this movie and the addition of Julianne Moore makes for an interesting counterpoint in terms of acting. <br/><br/>However even with the two great people in this movie the film feels too formulaic. It plods from one action scene to the next with not much else happening to keep the suspense. I am not sure if this movie is trying to be a suspense movie or an action movie. <br/><br/>The way that everything seems to be setup just right, he always has the right amount of information, the right amount of this or that, does the right thing etc for the movie to be able to move to the next scene. It feels a little clumped together and not smooth running. Shame, could have been a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>Worth a watch if you are a fan of action flicks or Liam but really only worth a once over."
"CMTiago","7","0","1","5 September 2014"," Thrilling ride with messy resolution
","Non-Stop is, without a doubt, one of the most thrilling movies of the year. Starring modern action hero Liam Neeson, we get a tale of suspense and suspicious thinking (a la Filghtplan). Neeson plays an air Marshal that drowns himself in alcohol in order to surpass the death of his young child and the consequent divorce. While on duty he receives a text message from an anonymous source saying that unless 150 million dollars is transfered to an off shore account, a passenger will be killed every 30 minutes. From then on, Bill Marks (Neeson) will have to work to keep the passengers safe as well as cope with the fact that all evidence points to him being the culprit.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson shows once again why he's at the top of his game when he does action. Of course he can do great roles in other genres, but here he handles the role very well and I would say you could not find a better lead for the film. Names such as Julianne Moore, Michelle Dockery and Corey Stoll make for a solid supporting cast and the roles are also brilliantly portrayed. As for the plot and direction, my only complaint can only be the conclusion. All the set-up that leads to the climax is done to a great extent leaving the audience guessing what's gonna happen. Personally I managed to guess the villain (sort of), but I won't go any further here. I'll just say I didn't appreciate the motive.<br/><br/>Other than the messy resolution, Non-Stop offers a great story filled with thrills and that will certainly please action enthusiasts. It is a well rounded film wit good acting and overall one of the most solid films of the year.<br/><br/>Rating: 7,5/10"

","More interesting movie that I originally thought it would be. The plot grows as it advances, and you really get into the whodunit of it.<br/><br/>But, why change Neeson's hands on several close-ups during the movie? Does he doesn't like his hands? Is it a decision the Director makes? Based on what? <br/><br/>Such decision brakes continuity and brings down quality of movie. <br/><br/>It's like ""photoshopping"" a photograph, or maybe it's worse than that. It might be very common to make such changes during production or edition (enhancing body parts, or bringing body models on certain close-ups), but when it's made cheaply brings the whole picture down.<br/><br/>Just saying"
"jdkraus","7","0","1","2 August 2014"," A good thriller with a great actor
","Enter Liam Neeson. From the opening shot of him sitting in a car alone, with the most devastated expression imaginable, we clearly understand the character he will be portraying for this movie. In ""Non-stop"" he is Bill Marks, an air marshal. He is burned out, struck by tragedy, and an alcoholic. His already harsh life gets worse when he gets a text message from an unknown individual, claiming that if he or she does not receive $150 million, he or she will kill a person within every 20 minutes until the demand is met. Matters grow worse when he is targeted as a scapegoat from the terrorist's antics. Bill has to battle the clock to disclose this person's identity, protect the passengers, and even save his reputation. This is just another adventure for the past middle-aged action star. What differentiates Neeson from other formulaic, action stars is his capacity to deliver excellent performances. Single-handedly, the opening scene supports his acting caliber. He can display so much without uttering a word. That is reason enough for me to consider him a favorite. He does more than well as Marks. <br/><br/>The screenwriter for the film thought out the story decently. There are twists, turns, unpredictably, and full-blast intensity. The viewer feels the paranoia of the central character as he desperately searches for the culprit. I tend to guess tend to guess in the end who is the bad guy, but not for this one. It is a roller coaster that shifts one direction for a moment and then takes another. When the revelation arrives though, it falls flat and feels downright pretentious. The ending is particularly rushed and pushes belief a bit too far. ""Non-stop"" is a good thrill ride with a great actor. It warrants a viewingtwo in my case."

He spends most of the film trying to find out who's the mysterious person is as much as we do. Throughout the movie, you keep trying to guess who the mysterious person is and it leaves you biting your nails.<br/><br/>This movie is filled with constant suspense and keeps you at the edge of your seat. Liam Neeson as well as the other actors and actress show off such good performances that you can almost literally feel their emotions and the intensity. In my opinion, Neeson deserves an Oscar for his role or at least some type of award.<br/><br/>One of the best action films of the year so far. 9/10"

","Non Stop is an action-thriller movie starring the ever-dependable Liam Neeson in a role very similar to Taken as in a one-man show. And Liam Neeson hardly disappoints howsoever improbable and absurd the movie plot might seems. Non Stop deals with an officer played by Liam Neeson trying to find a suspected terrorist in an airplane without creating any panic or suspicion.<br/><br/>Cast wise, Liam Neeson is perfect for the role. The fact that he is still able to carry an entire movie solely on his shoulder is testament of his immense talent. His role is very similar from performance perspective to the Taken series. He is ably supported by the support case.<br/><br/>The movie positives clearly lies in Liam Neeson, storyline and the ability to engage the audience till the very end, where the climax works as a negative aspect of the movie. I was hoping for a strong finish, expected from the amazing suspense maintained till the end. However, how-so-much you like the climax will decide how-so-much you like the movie overall. Having said that, if you like the Taken series, you will like Non Stop also. After all, it's Liam Neeson at work.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 06/10"

","Many airliner hijack stories have been put on film, some good, some not worth the bother. Non-stop is a good hijack movie because it keeps you guessing like a mystery while it shakes the crap out of you. I liked Liam Neeson in Schindler's List (1993), Taken (2008), Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) and Batman Begins (2005). He delivers another very credible lead role in Non-stop and makes it work. It might seem he's getting on in age for these roles but he's the consummate actor and well toned for the action. He can certainly hold his own in an intellectual parry as well, as his 60 Minutes Interview showed. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is, a murder every 20 minutes on the Auqa Atlantic not unlike A Murder On The Orient Express. Non-stop is a movie well worth the price to see. You will not be wasting your money."

Introduction to the story about ten minutes and then an hour and a half of tension, fear, paranoia, reversals and, most importantly, totally unpredictable. The film may have some little mistakes, but it is action, and this is easily ignored. Interestingly, filmed because the action happens 95% of the time on the plane.

"Reno-Rangan","7","0","1","8 July 2014"," A simple suspense-thriller that set in the altitude.
","It was an entertaining thriller set in a small surrounded area. I mean the whole movie takes place on a plane while it was flying above the ocean between two continents. As we know it was shot in a studio as much possible limited budget. Very well made movie with good support from the cast. Earlier I believed it was like the British movie 'Panic Button', except the limited passengers. If you had seen that, you would thought similar way. Anyway, it was lots better than that, except the pace.<br/><br/>Since the movie 'Taken' most of the Liam Neeson movie's were similar type. At least all his characters were portrayed close to each others and in this movie it was not spared. Of course, there have been lots of changes made. He played as an alcoholic air marshal in this. On his duty while his plane carrying hundreds of passengers to London from New York, he gets hinted that a man on board trying to threaten the safe journey. On the midway, over Atlantic ocean he's clueless, but must find him before everything he said turn into reality. So the game begins between the good and bad. Whether the plane safely lands its destination is the movie's finale.<br/><br/>''I always kind of liked flying, six hours in one seat and nobody can get to you.''<br/><br/>The suspense was better than I expected. It puts the viewers to engage in solving the puzzle. So the entertainment was promised till the twist come into play. Once the it explains its mystery that was carried all the way, at that moment I felt it was not cleverly done. Slightly not a satisfied solution for curiosity it created. Because it was simple and predictable once you come to know the truth. Especially the bad guys were weak in strength to handle the good guy. Julianne Moore role was looked kind of comedy to me. I would have not agreed to do that if I was her. Anyway the story asked for pawns to draw a confusion graph while narrating the main plot. A nice mystery movie, starts well, developed well in the middle, but did not end in similar fashion. To me the conclusion could have been a better, otherwise it would have not been an acceptable action-thriller.<br/><br/>6.5/10"
"bowmanblue","8","0","1","5 July 2014"," Surprisingly, more than just 'Taken (in the air)'
","Okay, I, like many, enjoyed Liam Neeson's film 'Taken.' And, like many, I thought the sequel was a little bit of a let-down/cash-in. Therefore, my hopes weren't that high for 'Non Stop' – a film where, from all trailers and promotional material, Neeson basically plays the same aging tough guy, albeit now he's an air marshal trying to stop a terrorist highjacking/blackmail plot.<br/><br/>Perhaps that's the secret to enjoying this film, i.e. don't expect too much, because, as it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised (and very entertained). Yes, Neeson's character isn't that different to how he acted in Taken, however, the story is executed in a different enough way to make it not feel like a cheap rip-off of the Taken franchise.<br/><br/>It's sort of a 'whodunnit' on a plane. One of the passengers is texting Neeson, threatening to kill a passenger every so often unless his (monetary) demands are met. This means that there are plenty of 'red herrings' to constantly throw the audience off the scent.<br/><br/>Naturally, with any sort of film like this, there are some moments where you have to suspend your disbelief and accept that – sometimes – things just happen to move the plot forward in the right direction.<br/><br/>So, don't think too hard about the (few) minor plot holes, just enjoy the pretty tense ride as Neeson proves that, once again, you don't have to be 'expendable' to be an older statesman of the action genre."

","When I first saw the trailers for Non-stop I thought ""Oh god, that looks awful."" Unfortunately my wife decided to get it through netflix and I must say, its not awful. Its certainly not good, but its not awful.<br/><br/>For most of its length the movie is a decent suspense thriller. Its not a great one, but once you shut your mind off to the plot details, you can get into the ""who's doing it?"" ""How are they going to get away with it?"" aspects. <br/><br/>Unfortunately with about 20 minutes or so to go the movie completely gives up any pretense of being decent. I won't give you any spoilers, but it goes from mediocre to just plain dumb. I mean, seriously, it lost a star just for that, it would have been a slightly more mediocre 6.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson does a good job of the role he's sort of slouched into, being angry punching people.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore was completely wasted. I have no idea why she was in this movie except to put another ""star"" in it? Totally under utilized and her character is, well it just feels like it was written in to give room to another name. <br/><br/>The best aspect of this movie is the director realized he didn't have 2 hours worth of material. He didn't even have the 1:46 of material, but still, in this day and age of every horrible film feeling like it needs to be 2 hours + having a mediocre movie clock in at 1:46 is a breath of fresh air. Another 15 minutes would have been painful. Honestly I think so many Hollywood films I've hated lately would benefit from just being 90-105 minutes long instead of 120-150 minutes long, but that strays from this already rambling review."

","The acting , the plot and the special effects are all very average. I was expecting a lot more from this film and was expecting more depth in the story line but it was all a bit silly in the end. There isn't any cliff hanger moments or big twists in the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the parts are just not well though out, like the fact he kills the first guy and they said someone would die in 20 mins. How did they know the other agent would react that way and pull his gun out ? Then the fact they use a Muslim as a possible target but it turns out he is a nice guy, even better a doctor that tries saving people, amazing haha. <br/><br/>I do love cheesy action films and am big into the 80s films but you can't make 80s films now, when I watch an 80s film with no substance it doesn't matter because other factors in the film made up for them, but this film didn't really have a saving grace and there's no excuse for poor special effects in this day and age. <br/><br/>It's probably worth a watch but if you're into plane hijacking films then passenger 57 or executive decision are much better."
"p-jonsson","6","0","1","5 July 2014"," Okay but not as good as I hoped
","Generally speaking I like Liam Neeson so when a movie comes out with him in it I generally get it without too many questions asked. It has been a somewhat varied experience. This one is somewhere in the middle of the range I would say. I did indeed have higher hopes for it.<br/><br/>The basic story is quite good but I never really felt very thrilled about the implementation and I more often than not felt frustrated by the various jerks not believing Bill and Bill's clumsy attempt at convincing people that he was a good guy not to mention controlling the passages. For being an air marshal Bill did not seem to be very good at it. I known he was supposed to be a former drunk but still It is still a decent enough movie though which rolls on at a reasonably decent pace. I never really felt compelled to pick up my tablet and start to read something while waiting for the boring parts to pass as have happened with a few other movies. Well, at least not very often. It is not really an action movie though and the scene at the poster is pretty much the only high-octane action scene in the entire movie which was also a bit disappointing. Sure, there are some quite good fights between Bill and various other characters but I would still put this movie more in the thriller genre than in the action one.<br/><br/>The media jerks and the way people seemed to control things outside, or rather not control things, the plane was also really frustrating. I would really have sued the arses of those media dicks afterwards given how they downright slandered both Bill and air marshals in general without any real proof. What happened with innocent until proved guilty. Oh, yeah right, I forgot, that has no meaning to todays media people.<br/><br/>Sadly enough the thriller part never got that thrilling either. I feel this is due to the rather clumsy way that Bill went about things most of the time. He never really gave a professional appearance. This goes for the cop that happened to be on the plane as well by the way. I felt he was really behaving just like some scared member of a mob rather than a trained professional. When the villain was finally exposed and the reasons for the events where explained. Well, let us just say that I went ""meh"" at that point. On the good side Liam Neeson did make a rather good performance given the kind of script he had to work with.<br/><br/>On the whole it is an okay movie though which is worthwhile to watch but, as I wrote, I had my hopes set a notch higher."
"leonblackwood","6","0","1","5 July 2014"," Neeson kicking butt, once again! 6/10
","Review: This is a average ""Who Dunnit"" type of movie about a flight Marshall (Liam Neeson) trying to work out who is hijacking a flight that he is on. I must admit, I didn't have a clue who was the baddie, which brought intensity to the film and it was well shot by the director. The only problem is that the storyline was a bit weak and the passengers became annoying after a while. Everyone was too busy playing detective, except for helping Neeson trying to stop everyone getting killed. Anyway, some of the action scenes were quite good and the expulsions were impressive, but the ending was really corny and it lacked a sense of depth. Average!<br/><br/>Round-Up: If you've watched Neeson in the latter part of his career kicking butt, then you won't be disappointed with this movie. At 61, he has shown that it's not only the young ones that can pull off some fancy Kung fu moves in a airplane toilet. Julianne Moore wasn't that amazing in the film. I was expecting her role to have a bit more to do with the plot, but she just turned out to be an average passenger. Anyway, it's definitely the suspense that keeps this movie going, along with the coolness of Neeson who keeps the passengers in check.<br/><br/>Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $200million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there action/thriller movies about a airplane Marshall trying to find out who is hijacking a plane. 6/10"
"niccixoxo","7","0","1","2 July 2014"," Not well tied up...
","I really liked this movie but I have to complain about the writers inability to tie this movie up and use details to their advantage.<br/><br/>As an example: At the end of the movie, the antagonists monologue was clear but not detailed enough to make me think he was the mastermind. To be honest, this character was just not strong to me. That's a no no. I mean, he SEEMED smart but I just didn't see him being the person behind this caper. And his partner in crime was not detailed enough to have been in charge of the bulk of the planning so I know they intended for the Tom Bowen character to be the ring leader. I mean, come on, this man rigged up the TV's on the plan to show news coverage on cue! His closing speech and behavior should have been fantastic! But it fell WAY short. To fit my theme of tying it up at the end, with this character being so weak and lacking a better detailed explanation for his crimes, I felt lost. Yeah, security sucks but was all this necessary? Yeah, you have some PTSD but whats your motivation? I also understand that some people are just crazy and don't need motivation but that should be clear.<br/><br/>Also, they tried way to hard to make EVERYONE look like a suspect. At the end I had a list of about 8 people who may have been involved (the real criminals were on that list also). Co-pilot, stewardess, NYPD, hostile black man in the cameo, Julianne Moore's character, and others. I know some people may disagree with me and call this a ""true mystery"" because of that but on a plane full of people and with the build up that they used and full plane shots of the passengers I didn't need to see everyone's nervous looks and shifty eyes 100 times, I know it could be anyone... I'm not stupid. Like the stewardess for instance, I just knew she was involved. She looked too nervous, she was too nosy, etc. But at the end, nothing, they didn't even give her a reason for looking so suspicious the whole darn movie! Again, they did not do a good job tying up the loose ends.<br/><br/>And just a little pet peeve I had, why did it take these people so long to understand that Liam Neeson's character was right! After the pilot died the co-pilot should have been right on board! I was upset because everyone wants to call this man an alcoholic and shun him but they can clearly see that he's right and they continued to bash him and distrust him. It took an act of congress to get them to believe him. That's annoying.<br/><br/>All and all I did enjoy this movie but I will probably not watch it again. I thought the passengers were a little to ignorant and I can't stand that! You can take denial only so far before it gets annoying."
"user-543-975655","9","0","2","2 July 2014"," ""Non-Stop"" Thrills
","I was wanting to see Non-Stop in theaters for a really long time, but I never got around to seeing it. Eventually I just forgot about it, and after that I saw how it came out on DVD and remembered how much I wanted to see it. I rented it before buying it, to make sure I liked it. I sure as heck did. I was on the edge of my seat for almost the whole movie. This is only because it was so original and fun to watch. One thing that goes along with the originality is the group of text bubbles that appear when a text is sent between Liam Neeson and the killer. Instead of having to look very hard at the screen of the phone and missing some of the text message, you could easily read all of the texts at the fast pace of the movie. Jaume Collet-Serra and the writers did such a good job putting this movie together that the 106 minutes just flew by. One of the main things that makes this a good mystery is that there aren't any flaws. As I looked back several times throughout the movie, I never noticed any goofs. There probably are, but I just didn't notice them. Well, maybe one or two, now that I think about it. But it was still an awesome mystery movie, and is up there with Neeson's other mystery/action movies, such as Taken. Another thing I like about the movie is that the plot is so original. I know I already said the movie was original, but I didn't say the plot was. I have never seen a plot or main idea like the one in Non-Stop. I never knew what to expect because of that, and that also helped the rating for me. There were several other things that kept the movie interesting for me, though. For example, the acting. With stars such as Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore, and Scoot McNairy, I had no doubt that the acting was going to be awesome. I was right. The acting is amazing, and the emotions displayed and the lines of the actors came together perfectly. The dialogue was another great thing about this movie, because cheesy lines were completely non- existent. For example, instead of saying ""I didn't do it,"" the character would say something that delved into whether or not they did it, including stuff like evidence and honesty (whether they are being honest or not, if that makes sense). That also made Non-Stop a fun movie. The music was sort of in the background, and you could not hear it that much, but it kind of went along with the rhythm of the story if you listen really closely. Another thing that made this movie awesome is the setting. Being on a plane full of innocent (most of them) passengers, small rooms and fight scenes really made Non-Stop a thrilling movie. In fact, that is another thing that made this movie original; it was on a plane. That is really all I have to say about Non- Stop. I hope you found this review helpful. Check out some of my other reviews. See ya!"
"RevRonster","6","0","1","2 July 2014"," Well, at Liam Neeson is in it...
","I'm pretty much at the point that if Liam Neeson is in the film, I will watch it no questions asked. That explains why I wasted my time and money seeing ""Battleship"" in the theaters. The guy is not only a great actor but with the action-based roles he's been taking it has pretty much cemented the idea that he is a legitimate tough guy. His gruff voice, intense stare and the fact that when he's chopping people in the necks with his hands looks like he actually is well versed in the art of hurting bad guys translates to an instant draw for me. Honestly, Neeson was the best part of the film.<br/><br/>For the most part, ""Non-Stop"" isn't a terrible film. The problem is that it just has too many factors that were working against my personal enjoyment for me to find it anything more than just an average, one-time-watching film. For example, the film has some great, close-quarters fight scenes, Liam Neeson is acting the hell out of his role, the premise had amazing potential to be exciting and the film starts off as a decent thriller that looks like it is building to something interesting. However, the suspense is abandoned pretty early for a more generic action film with no real mystery working for it and the bad guy is way too easy to predict. Finally, the motives behind the hijacking are lackluster and vacuous at best.<br/><br/>""Non-Stop"" has its moments and didn't bore me but it just wasn't good enough where I will find myself finding any desire to watch it again in my lifetime.<br/><br/>Greetings, good sir and/or madam! Feel like reading some more of my rants, ramblings, geek references, bad jokes and more movie reviews (like a more in-depth look at ""Non-Stop"" and films that don't, but should, contain Liam Neeson)?

"siderite","7","0","1","1 July 2014"," Reasonable action thriller
","I can't believe people saying this film was silly and unbelievable. Have you seen the other movies Liam Neeson did lately? :) Anyway, the story of an air marshal who has to fight against unknown mastermind criminals that are on the plane with him, manipulating people and devices to reach their goals is not as far fetched as decried by many commenters. As any blockbuster movie it does require suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays OK. It is probably a movie fashioned in order for him to star in it, so no problems there. A lot of other actors that we can recognize, mostly from TV, as supporting roles and Julianne Moore in the first role in ages in which she is not completely obnoxious. Yes, there are plot holes. Especially since the quantum of knowledge of the terrorist party was immense in order to pull everything off. But one can overlook them. The tension is maintained well, but it could have been an order of magnitude more just by pressing in the social element. Instead we has Neeson be the primadona for the entire film.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent action thriller, with more thriller than action, which feels good to me."

Well, the script is not fresh, with several moments seen in other so-called plane action/disaster movies, and unreal scenes, but thanks to various awards nominees Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore and director Jaume Collet-Serra, the intensity is maintained and the course of events is not annoying or yawning to follow. Pity only that talented character actors Lupita Nyong'o and Corey Stoll had unimportant roles to play. The ending could have been more interesting (= less predictable), but as I did not guess the person of the offender and his motives, I can't complain :)<br/><br/>Do not seek profundity, sit and enjoy the pace and performances!"

","The last true action hero, the towering elderly Liam Neeson returns to his recently found career path of on-screen macho in this hi-flying adrenaline rush. Neeson plays Bill Marks, an alcoholic ex-cop with family issues (doesn't he always?), who now works as one of the thousands of air marshals, hired in the aftermath of post-9/11 frenzy. Often unverified and with little to no background checks, various non- suitable personnel is let on-board aeroplanes (at least such is the premise of the movie) with an armed gun. Soon after start off Marks starts receiving enigmatic text messages claiming that sooner than later people will start dying on the aeroplane, unless funds are transferred to a given account. As Marks attempts to hunt down the perpetrator the body count starts to increase and soon doubts arise as to who the real culprit is...<br/><br/>Initially promising, especially given Neeson makes for the ideal off- beat antihero, the story shifts into a whodunit scenario, with paranoia rife as to the people responsible. As such the movie however lacks originality and seems like a laboured rip-off of ""The Flight Plan"", which at least managed to keep tension high and had the audience guessing as to the insanity of the main character. Here the tension is much less palpable, albeit the payoff is way less ridiculous, although still with a significant dosage of ludicrousness. Action sequences are nonetheless top-notch and watching Neeson (once again) combat in closed quarters never gets old. Looking past that the story never really seems mysterious, the identity of the culprits is never really feasible and its pretty easy to identify non-guilty parties, even if at one point in time the finger gets pointed at them. By the end the movie swerves into the realm of laughable resolution, not only with the appalling motivation of the baddies (so bad the actors had trouble with even phoning it in). On top of that we find layered mad-hatter plotting of the evil dudes and all sort of air flight procedures being thrown about in gibberish rants, but the characters seem all to happy to omit the real options at their disposal (such as armed fighters not allowing a plane to lower altitude despite the real threat of a bomb on board).<br/><br/>As good as Liam Neeson is, the story does syphon your intellect, leaving me ultimately disinterested. Obviously not as far fetched in idiocy as ""The Flight Plan"" or the cult favorite ""Snakes on a Plane"", but just enough on the wrong side of logic to derail an otherwise well paced high-altitude thriller."

With the plane in the air, Bill receives text messages over the supposedly secure in-flight network: get the airline to pay $150m to a numbered account or a passenger will die every 20 minutes.<br/><br/>To say much more – or to accidentally catch the spoiler-packed trailer – will ruin your enjoyment. And that's a crime because, basically, enjoyment is what this agreeably silly, 80s throwback, action-packed whodunit's is all about. Should you need more evidence of its testosterone levels, Non-Stop is produced by Joel Silver, and if that's not an indication of old school, ass-kicking fun, I don't know what is.<br/><br/>Neeson is, of course, as good as he has to be, and there's solid support from Moore as the one passenger Bill can trust, McNairy as a nervy passenger and Stoll as a holidaying NYPD officer. Elsewhere, there are a lot of underwritten roles – Dockery's insipid flight attendant, Nyong'o as a late replacement to the crew in particular – not to mention several moments of borderline painful dialog.<br/><br/>However, the twists are decent, Collet-Serra keeps cranking the tension and, best of all, there are just about enough clues on screen for the eagle eyed to solve the mystery. You'd be pushed to give this more than three stars but if there's a better, purer slab of three-star fun this year, I'll be very surprised."

","Some alcoholic guy named Bill who seems to be a wreck boards a plane. All sorts of suspicious people are on board and strange things happen. Turns out he's the air marshal. He's got a seat up in business class. Some lady insist she's got to sit at a window seat next to him. As soon as they take off, he gets text messages on the ""federal network"" demanding millions or else someone will die every 20 minutes. One of the suspicious passengers turns out to be another air marshal in coach. Bill confronts this other guy, a scuffle ensues and he kills him. Thus Bill made the warning come true all by himself. Bill is friends with the crew. He calls some federal agency but they inform him that the account number of the terrorist is under his name! That makes the government and the pilots think that Bill is the hijacker. Next the pilot dies mysteriously behind closed doors. Next another passenger starts foaming out of the mouth. Among the passengers is a NYPD, he starts getting frustrated and wants to take out Bill together with other guys. They end up fighting. Now a bomb appears on board and everyone settles down and tries to work together. Bill tries to start the bomb protocol but now fighter jets are escorting the plane and will shoot it down if it doesn't follow orders. Finally it's revealed who the villains are and we learn of their motivation for it all that comes out of nowhere but is actually pretty good.<br/><br/>If it weren't for all the A-listers in this movie, it would barely pass as an one of those Asylum movies based on an A movie. Asylum would probably have done a better job than this crew. For a script with 3 writers it's incomprehensible that they left so many gaping plot holes all over. Off course there's no shortage of lack of realism either. Direction is weak as well, despite the claims by all the actors in the behind the scenes feature claiming that the director, whoever he is, is so brilliant. Neeson's performance isn't convincing either at times when he's supposed to be all energized and taking charge. The script clearly had potential. It should have made for a very exciting movie. But despite the large budget, and Silver being the producer, they couldn't make this movie work unfortunately. Neeson isn't the right guy for the job. It shouldn't have take a whole lot of effort to fix what was wrong with the script and film this movie in a more dynamic and exciting way."

","I am a child of 1984, born in 1984, raised in the digital age of programing, html, and insta-communication. That said I really like this movie for what it was.<br/><br/>First, the cinematography and editing where top notch in my opinion. Movies have been made before emphasizing the digital communication realm in which we, as a consumer based society, live in. But this one accurately reflected it. <br/><br/>I wasn't expected the mystery hand to be dealt in this movie, but it was so issued, very calculated and well planned. It really does leave the audience wondering ""who"" it is. <br/><br/>The acting is good, not necessarily great, but one has to remember the dramatic tension of this movie. It really is a murder mystery of sorts.<br/><br/>My only complaint was the ending. I'm not going to leave spoilers, but in traditional Hollywood fashion, good guy wins, bad guy looses.<br/><br/>This movie really had a chance here to divert from the traditional storyline and give the audience a little more, whether it was a further storyline of the hero or better yet a scenario in which the bad buy escapes. I feel like that is an idea largely left untapped; in which the bad guy actually escapes or at the very least leaves the audiences in apprehension - bc everyone is used to the same old boring fairytale ending of good guy walks away scott clean.<br/><br/>Other than that, worth watching, if you are in the mood for a quickie suspense film that gets you off in your employers utility closet."

","Entertaining but requires a strong suspension of disbelief. Liam Neeson is great but isn't he always? They do a pretty good job with the red herrings, even if I guessed it a little earlier than I was probably supposed to. Well, I figured this person had something to do with it, whether they were THE bad guy or just an accomplice. But they did keep me guessing at least about whether they were in it alone or not. The motive behind all of it seemed a little forced, as well. I got the feeling the writers wanted to get far more political with it than they were allowed to. I'm willing to bet there was an earlier draft that was much whinier and soapboxier. What's in the finished product is nothing to get worked up over, though. It's a decent time-killer. For those wondering, the poster shot of Neeson leaping through the air firing his gun on the plane actually does occur in the movie. It's the timing of when it occurs that is the most priceless part. Oh, and since when are flattops back in style? Nate Parker looked like Theo Huxtable in this."
"burlesonjesse5","7","0","1","6 June 2014"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Non-Stop
","If you go in thinking that you're gonna see Die Hard on a plane, or Taken on a plane, or Passenger 57 (ugh), or whatever, think again. It's not that kind of a party. I mean, I wouldn't quite qualify what I just saw, a full-on action movie. No, Liam Neeson's newest winter release (he does a lot of those) kinda plays out more like a drama, or a thriller, or a more violent, less comedic version of 1985's Clue. Yes, I'm talking about the current number one hit at the box office, Non-Stop. Yeah, its got a couple of neck cracks and head butts. However, if you're set on seeing Neeson play action guru at an outrageously alarming rate, check that notion right at the door. For most of the way though, the proceedings grab you within the first 15 minutes without letting go. It's an old fashioned ride but it has a little bit of everything. Its got a little Twilight Zone in it, a whole lot of paranoia courtesy of Neeson, and a storytelling device consisting of cell phone texts as heightened subtitles (this was also used briefly and effectively in 2013's Fruitvale Station). Overall, Non-Stop isn't totally first class entertainment (get it), but as a cheeky, nous of a movie, it sure as heck gets the job done.<br/><br/>Taking place on a 747 flight from New York to London and featuring a slow moving opening scene consisting of the art of people watching, Non- Stop examines a jobless, alcoholic, air marshal in Bill Marks (Neeson). He comes off as sad, lonely, and disconnected (his daughter died of cancer at age 8 so what did you expect). It's not quite revealed why he gets on the plane but within a short time period, he receives text messages from a would-be terrorist bent on killing a passenger on board every 20 minutes (until said wacko gets a 150 million smackeroos). Neeson's Marks then decides to save the day by interrogating everyone on board until the culprit is rightfully found.<br/><br/>One of the passengers featured on British Aqualantic 10, is played by Julianne Moore as Jen Summers. Moore's role feels out of place in this thing as it did in last year's Don Jon. Her presence is a slight hiccup for me here but it's no big deal. Another passenger is a flight attendant played by newly crowned Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o. Compared to her turn in 12 Years a Slave, her screen time as Gwen Lloyd barely registers at all. The only reason I remembered her being in Non-Stop, was of course the funky Grace Jones-style haircut. Finally, we have Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery playing flight attendant Nancy Hoffman (another possible suspect and there are lots of them). She's solid in a role that involves a lot of reacting (which some say, is harder than actual acting).<br/><br/>Anyway, despite an ending that seems like cheesy, tacked on Hollywood smut (I was kinda hoping that there would be another twist to make the film a tad more exhausting (and that's a good thing)) and most of the players in the cast exhibiting acting that is at times, mediocre, Non- Stop still works for two reasons. Its suspense factor is completely off the charts because it's a whodunit. That's the hook. When you find out who the actual hijackers are, it seems like sort of a letdown because there are so many other juicy, suspicious characters to choose from. It doesn't matter though because almost 80% of the previous amount of running time is riveting, nail biting stuff. Well crafted in a Sherlock Holmes sort of way by Spanish director Jaume Collet-Serra, the second reason Non-Stop works is of course, Liam Neeson. Masculine, tall, and all grizzled up, he's still one bad dude. He's also in my mind, the coolest movie star on the planet. He slips into the role of Bill Marks like a comfortable old shoe. And basically, he could play this part in his sleep (or in a coma, I'm serious).<br/><br/>So without further adieu, you should get in your car, drive to the movie theater, buy a ticket, grab a big bucket of popcorn, and get settled in. Yeah, it's that time again, time to get ""Neesoned"". All aboard!"
"glk3022380","9","0","1","4 June 2014"," Great plots in a small space,the cabin
","The beginning mentioned something about security, something like it was impossible to realize even the government put all the budget into it.By that time I guess this could be a movie about hijacking. Things turned out to be uncertain since the first text came up, Neeson's reaction was just what the hijackers wanted.But we have no idea about what's going on until Neeson took out his gun and badge in the toilet.I was wondering whether the bad guys gonna be silly enough by wasting the time to text. Fortunately they were not, Neeson was on his own after the setup killing his partner. Plots from then became really appealing , everyone was guessing who gonna be the next victim and who was the killer. The scenery becomes a typical dilemma as SHERLOCK when we suspect every possible guy,including those we had trusted before. And mostly we have no idea about that at all otherwise it would be a boring movie ,we are just denying all the conclusion we made before...Interestingly that's why we prefer thrillers lol...The complicated situation on the plane nearly driven Neeson crazy and hopeless, even his boss didn't believe him. That's cruel for him,for a lonely old man regarding job as his only duty. It's very important for him that the attendants and the woman on his side still trusted him all the way till the end,which was all Neeson could count on during the tough time..The man with the glasses headed to Armsterdam saved Neeson in crisis to show he was a good man,well at least I bought it..As well as the smart-phone programmer ,seemed so trustworthy and reliable.However,it was just a setup over another setup waiting Neeson to activate.The trust crisis was choking us to make all the things like Neeson's illusion, a true hero's insanity. The copilot,attendant gave Neeson a hand in his very need.The attendant dared to stand out in face of the terrorists,and the copilot dared to go against typhoons' warning to drop to 8,000 feet.The emergency landing was made toughly but successfully,saving all the passengers on board. The plots were catching us all the time. Maybe Neeson is just an actor who is good at being an agent to save people. He can always move us more or less ,comparing to other action actors,coz he is just so charming with a sign of caring. The last smile between the woman and him means a lot. If we could know who blow the poison arrow to the captain,if we could know how did the man with glasses put the phone into the lawyer's pocket with his hand tied,if we could know whether the passenger get their free trips,if we could know why don't the terrorists bomb the plane without the delay if he never intended to escape? In all ,a good film by Neeson worth a watching..."
"troy-manatunga","7","0","1","4 June 2014"," The Suspense is just the right amount!
","Yet another must watch: An early release in 2014 finally has come out on Blu -Ray.<br/><br/>NON-STOP starring Liam Neeson is an action/thriller based on an ordinary day in the life of Air Marshall Bill Marks. On a routine transatlantic trip Agent Marks receives a series of mysterious text messages. Text messages that claim that there will be a death every 20 minutes onboard the aircraft until 150 million dollars is transferred to an unknown bank account. The identity of the sender in unknown. The Air Marshal is certain that the sender is onboard. The only viable clue he has is that sender of the text messages has access to a mobile phone. Everyone onboard is suspect!<br/><br/>Unlike his hit thriller blockbuster TAKEN this mission does not unfold comfortably. The Neeson we see who is very much in control and always with a plan in his famous thrillers struggles onboard. This alone makes NON-STOP even more intriguing. I kept telling myself that one will not expect anything less from a Neeson movie and one would not have expected the change in dynamic in the flow of the plot. Phenomenally written the plot in NON-STOP isn't rocket science, in fact the movie on its own is plain and simple. It's how the flow of suspense and thrills is concocted and put on screen that I find whimsical. <br/><br/>Many movies have been attempted in the confined space of a make believe aircraft. The closest successful parallel that I can draw is to Jodie Fosters FLIGHTPLAN. Starting his career in the Movie scene of Hollywood with HOUSE OF WAX (2005) Spanish Director Jaume Collet-Sera has since been climbing out from the bottom of the barrel leaving the mediocre horror flick behind. He has only become better over time. His first collaboration with Liam Neeson in UNKNOWN was a massive hit and likewise this too will follow? What Sera and Neeson did in UNKNOWN was spectacular and similarly this (NON-STOP) mystery keep building up from the moment Neeson first appears on screen. It is safe to say that Neeson has safely established himself as the go to action/thriller guy since the mega hit TAKEN and he executes this one with great detail; as much detail as the screenplay allows him to.<br/><br/>Indeed there are flaws. As always is the case the scales tend to tip in the positive and the flaws can be overlooked if the damage isn't that obvious. Maybe Juliane Moore's agent felt that she needed work. The 53 year old redhead looks absolutely ravishing but her presence in the movie on the whole is quite questionable since she literally contributed nothing coming from Hollywood royalty. I for one enjoyed seeing her on screen but I kept expecting more. A lesson to be learnt for all female leads is to never star besides Neeson in an action/thriller because Neeson will over power you at every turn. <br/><br/>I reviewed it; now you decide!<br/><br/>TITLE: NON-STOP DIRECTED BY: JUAME COLLET-SERA STARRING: LIAM NEESON & JULIANNE MOORE RATED: PG13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 106 MINUTES"
"peterp-450-298716","6","0","1","3 June 2014"," An unnerving, exciting and fast paced movie. It's a shame that the ending ruined it a bit.
","""I'm not hijacking this plane. I'm trying to save it!"" Not very original, but unnerving exciting at times. ""Captain Philips"", ""Speed"", ""Last passenger"" and ""Under Siege"". There isn't a vehicle that drives, sails or flies, and it has already been hijacked in a movie. It seems as if Liam Neeson really likes playing in action movies. And just like in ""The Grey"" he's a person who struggles with his past.<br/><br/>Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is an Air Marshal who actually has an aversion to flying. Because of the loss of his little daughter, he's a bit in the doldrums. The beginning of the movie shows a decrepit, not so fresh looking Marks, pouring a bit of whiskey in his coffee. A security guard with an alcohol problem who's about to get on board of a trans-Atlantic flight. That's asking for trouble. Shortly after the takeoff, he receives text messages via the secure network with the requirement to transfer $ 150 million to a bank account. If he doesn't meet the requirement, someone will be killed every 20 minutes. And so the search for the perpetrator among the 150 passengers begins.<br/><br/>All in all it was a highly entertaining film with a constant tension. It's a long time ago that I've watched a movie sitting on the edge of my seat and wondering who would be the one who's doing this. All the time someone else is a suspect what eventually makes it more fun to watch. There have been made ​​several thrillers that take place on a plane. It's the ideal location to make an exciting film. But there are quite a few strange twists in this film. I got the impression that Marks was on his way to London, to be dishonorably discharged. Looking at the conversations it seems like his superiors didn't have much confidence in him as a security guard. If he's so psychotic and unstable, why didn't they ask the second security guard who's on board to take over ? The news was also a bit exaggerated again. If such a tricky situation would arise on board of an aircraft, the news would surely be more discrete. And i would love to see somebody doing in reality something like Marks did, when he flies around in a free-fall and grabs his gun which is hovering around him.<br/><br/>Ultimately, these are only minor futile remarks that won't change the fact that it's a clever story. The claustrophobic feeling and the feeling that you are so vulnerable up in the air, is constantly present. The scene in which text messages are floating around Marks, are wonderful to see. Neeson shows again in a convincing way a resolute and alert agent, despite his personal misfortune and the allegations against him. The general feeling prevails that he completely lost control. He has such a stature that exudes confidence, despite its small imperfections. Julianne Moore is the cold-blooded Jen whom he met on the plane accidentally. A woman who, as we learn later , wants to have a window seat for medical reasons and thus ends up beside Marks. Jen eventually becomes his refuge and the only one Marks trusts. The supporting roles are reserved for some familiar faces like Scoot McNairy (Monsters , Killing them Softly , Argo , 12 Years a Slave) , Michelle Dockery (Hanna) , Nate Parker (Red Tails) and Lupita Nyong'o (Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 12 Years a Slave).<br/><br/>I haven't been bored during this film. It's just a hostage drama, but the pace of this movie makes sure you don't have the time to consider this. The only low point was the uncovering and the revealing of the motivation to start all this. The whole plan is so ingeniously put together, and then they come up with such an uninspired plot again. The compulsory dramatic part where Neeson informs the passengers about his misery and you see the embarrassed and sympathetic glances, was extremely clichéd. It seemed as if the lack of time made them come up with a quickly invented ending. Despite that it's still a nice thriller, but it won't leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

I like how the writer create the good guys, yet he's having problem with alcohol, family etc. and what makes me like it more that, no kissing or bed scene like almost every other Hollywood movies. <br/><br/>I don't know what else to say rather than two thumbs up for Liam Neeson, The writer, all the cast and the director.

","With a title like Non-Stop you expect non stop action but this is more a thriller with periodical action scenes to keep the beats going. After all Liam Neeson is in his 60s and cannot keep on fighting all through the film.<br/><br/>Neeson is an air marshal with personal problems and a fondness for drink. As the flight takes off he receives a series of text messages asking for millions of dollars to be deposited in a bank account or someone will die every 20 minutes.<br/><br/>The texts are popped on screen in the style of the TV series 'Sherlock' which is a blessing for the viewer.<br/><br/>Neeson now has to find the person making the threats, suspect all passengers and even the fight crew. On the other hand his warnings are not taken seriously and 20 minutes into the first threat the first person dies.<br/><br/>The movie is far fetched and convoluted.

","What does most successful action movies has in common? They all have a strong start, gripping midsection (thanks to the start) and a heavily predictable ending. Non-Stop fits the same formula but it works like a charm like some old medicine that cures sneezing over and over again. We all know what were gonna get but amused by it like it's the first time we see it. It's all because we are hungry for silver screen heroes and we are starving to see them succeed no matter how young or old they are. In Non-Stop Liam Neeson the 61 year old yet going strong action star does his job right once again and we the fans are amused. <br/><br/>Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) is an Air Marshal with a history which he is not very satisfied about. On a flight seems to be routine and nothing suspicious things become very strange when he receives some unsettling text messages from someone aboard the flight demanding for ransom. And suddenly Bill is left to seek for this terrorist who threatens to bring down the flight alone while the other passengers and the world left to believe that Bill is running the whole show hijacking the plane. Bill is having too much on his plate as you can see. And he has to gulp them all and survive a bad stomachache. <br/><br/>The plot of Non-Stop is far-fetched. There is no amusement there since no action movie was ever practical in real world. Not even the first 10 minutes. The challenge for the director (In this case of Jaume Collet- Serras) is to make the viewers believe that all this can happen. In Non- Stop so much has being quite successful. Well that's until everything is ruined by trying to explain what was going on all this time and then it becomes a soup. And then comes the landing part. I don't think I have to explain it further because we all have seeing ample jumbo jets land practically almost anywhere. <br/><br/>But the good thing is when the director decides to ruin it, it has almost reached its ending. So as fans we can be happy that at least the majority of the time we were enjoying it without needing to worry too much about who's the bad guy etc etc. Coz the plot is entertaining and the events are rolled out quite excitingly. I have to admit that for a movie that almost entire thing takes places inside a boring air craft and no shots fired till the very end it's very good."

","This is not a a very believable movie. There are a thousand things that you can nitpick about the plot, but at the end of the movie I had to look back and say, I really enjoyed that. It's almost non-stop suspense, and I will give the writers this nod, I had no idea who the bad guy was until he's revealed at the very end.<br/><br/>The only reason I watched this movie was that I have become such a fan of the Liam Neeson thriller, I like millions of others became hooked with Taken. When you look at other action stars, say Jason Statham, for instance, he looks like a bad ass. Liam Neeson looks, and has the mannerisms of an everyman, so when he goes into full bad ass mode it's such a wonderful surprise, even when you know it's coming.<br/><br/>This long and the short of it is, this movie is worth your time and I think you'll enjoy it.

It slowly, and I mean really slowly, builds up and manages to keep you interested for the most part. I didn't have a clue where the plot was going and that was a good thing. Unfortunately, the interest it had created in me started to fade away about halfway through, maybe a bit more. And the end result was really disappointing. It was a real bummer because initially the movie was looking really good.<br/><br/>Acting is pretty good. Liam Neeson does what he does best. Julianne Moore and the other cast was pretty good. There was this really cool scene where it is just one LONG shot and Liam Neeson is searching for the villain. I love nicely executed long shots.<br/><br/>Overall, an OK thriller flick, with LIAM NEESON. <br/><br/>6.5 (0.5 for Liam Neeson :p )"
"Beauq81","8","0","1","29 May 2014"," Good one
","I like Neeson, always have. He is a good, very dependable actor, who's had bad movies, but never by his fault. After great dramas, like The Schindler's list, Nell, Michael Collins and a variety of good thrillers, he is really becoming an action star, from Star Wars, across Taken, to Non-stop and it really suits him.<br/><br/>Julianne Moore was also good. Her character was a bit redundant, but still good enough. There was no forced romance and it suited me just fine, because the focus was on the manhunt, the action.<br/><br/>This is a really good suspense movie. It has enough of everything action, mystery, heartfelt moments. A lot of good supporting characters. No one is over the top, no one more than they should be and it is a pleasure to watch a movie like that."

","Old man Liam Neeson does it again. His hulking energy and imposing screen presence makes Non-Stop an excellent action thriller. At 61, post Taken, Neeson is enjoying his second lease of Hollywood stardom, and his first as an action star. Seems his purple patch has no end in sight.<br/><br/>Non-Stop is a murder mystery much in the vein of an Agatha Christie novel, set 40,000 feet in the air, within the confines of an aircraft. Neeson plays Bill Marks, a down in the dumps US Air Marshall who takes to the bottle whenever he can to overcome his perpetual grief over the loss of his daughter. When at work in a non-stop flight from New York to London, he suddenly starts receiving threatening text messages demanding $150 million. Failure to meet the demand means someone in the flight would be killed every 20 minutes. <br/><br/>The person making these demands seem to know Marks well, at the same time looks like he is sitting in the plane itself. Bodies start to drop, and when Marks tries to find out the killer, he finds out that he is being set up. The airplane offers a wide array of characters- a drug dealing fellow Marshall, a NYPD cop, Julianne Moore's chatty friendly co-passenger, an Arab doctor, and a mobile software expert, among others. It is a claustrophobic scenario, and committing murders in front of everyone borders on the impossible. The magic of Non-Stop, then is to make all this believable. <br/><br/>Director Jaume Collet-Serra who has established himself with the 2009 horror flick, Orphan, and has directed Neeson earlier in Unknown, has shot 95% of the film is within the confines of an airplane, but he does so with style and pace, including a manic fight in a lavatory and a crazy emergency landing. He knows his star well, and uses his appeal to the max. As the gruff, flawed, and increasingly desperate hero- Liam Neeson currently has no equal. As the movie progresses and his character's tragic past is revealed, it comes to light that he will actually do anything it takes to save the people on the flight. <br/><br/>There are a lot of loopholes in the plot, but the thrill, intrigue, suspense, action and a star in full flow makes Non-Stop a highly recommended film- 8/10"

","Would be a pleasure if you check my former noobish criticisms here - http://iamalekhya.blogspot.in/<br/><br/>Non-Stop just as the title advocates is strictly an around-the-clock action packed thriller movie. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson crews up with the Unknown director, Jaume Collet Serra. I am a huge fan of his action thrillers like Taken series, Unknown, The Grey, The A-team etc. He is in his sixties now but he looks great as always.<br/><br/>The movie is set on a plane from New York City to London, when the protagonist being a former NPYD and a current Air Marshall gets coercions on his secured line about transferring $150 million in a bank account or a person deceases every 20 minutes. As time goes by, we get to more about his life and chain of increasingly improbable plot twists. <br/><br/>It's truly a rock-hard plot as it is purely innovative and I haven't seen a story in the recent whiles. The opening minutes are firm as the director introduces us to the main characters that we will be spending the majority of our period with including Julianne Moore who was keen and a hostile traveler. The show goes pretty fine as it keeps the audience guessing till the pre-climax where we have some unforeseen twists and turns which was fairly bare. Though I enjoyed the climax but could have been more exciting like the total plot. The action is really incredible especially the climax gun shot.<br/><br/>Acting – Neeson as Bill Marks is one of the greatest reasons for such a great victory of the film. He plays a role of bothered man who gets himself in such a situation. He verifies that he is indeed a great performer and an excellent action hero. Moore is more or less okay in her own way. The backup cast has done a pleasant job.<br/><br/>Director – He has done a terrific job by generating a silence, nervous atmosphere throughout the whole flick. He preserved the movie's pace; leaving no room with needless plasters that tends to slog the story. There are a few plot holes here and there, but the stout performances relief a lot to keep the movie intense and attractive.<br/><br/>Music – Marvelous Exertion! Flawless Soundtrack for such a movie! <br/><br/>Largely a great 1 hour 46 mins journey filled with great suspense, thrill, action, tragedy and few gags. It was overall a fascinating experience with the strong acts creating it a must watch for all action- thriller lovers :)"

","I enjoyed the movie. It's been quite a while since I've been capable of watching an entire movie from start to finish without giving in to boredom. This movie keeps your attention and allows you to escape reality for a bit.<br/><br/>Nearly all of the movie takes place on board an airplane so there isn't any eye candy. There is just enough action and it's not over done, which can be refreshing.<br/><br/>There are good hand-to-hand combat scenes and plenty of suspense.

","If you've seen Taken or Unknown, you know the kind of movie that this is going to be. And if you're okay with that, you will enjoy this. If you expect more, then prepare to be disappointed. I wanted something fun and interesting, and I got it. <br/><br/>Liam Neeson gives a good performance playing a character whose story isn't really original, but somehow makes it pretty interesting. The story itself can be interesting too, if you let the occasional movie cliché slip by every now and then. I actually expected more cheesy scenes, but there were nowhere near as many as I thought. It will keep you guessing throughout, but I would say it is kind of possible to figure out the gist of what's going on, so don't go patting yourself on the back thinking you're a genius if you do. Also, there's not as much ""action"" in this as some might want. It's more filled with tension and twists that make you think a little. I enjoyed that, and I think it works here. I also personally kind of liked the visual style. It can be plain at times, but little things like the way they display the text messages on screen I really liked. <br/><br/>As I said before, if you're a fan of Neeson's films like Taken, check this one out and enjoy it. If you expect this to absolutely change your outlook on cinema, don't watch it. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but it's a fun popcorn flick."

","There have been quite a few movies based on planes, and this was definitely one of the better ones. As a man who has been classified as a paranoid alcoholic myself, I felt very strongly for the character Liam Neeson was portraying. The confusion and paranoia was evident throughout the movie, as the minutes ticked by, and more people died. Right up to the very end, you didn't know how it was going to turn out. Considering the whole movie was set on a plane, the director, actors, and script were all excellent in giving us a mystery, as to who or what was involved. It reminded me in a funny way of a film noir, or cold war thriller, the paranoia was very real and intense and the enemy was unseen and mysterious.I gave this movie a nine, for very close to perfection."

","I've never played poker but I'd assume a good tell (or bad one...depending on whose perspective) is when a player grips his cards a little too close to his chest. We know that when a director flashes a character on a screen for a nanosecond (/clear throat\) that's probably going to be someone we want to remember later on. Although Non-Stop gives it's tell very early in the game, it is still worth the fantastic ride.<br/><br/>The cast is solid. Liam Neeson gives us more of what we've come to expect in his latest winning streak resurgence of action hero roles and he doesn't disappoint. Julianne Moore, although wonderful in coloring grey in her character's allegiances to Neeson, seems to have been added to the project from a producer's desire rather than from a story's necessity. Not to mention Lupita Nyong'o and Michelle Dockery who acted as beautiful mannequins on vacation from their more demanding roles from which they're popularly known.<br/><br/>Although the plot holes abound which leave you smirking in action thriller cynicism, the pacing of the ever-increasing threats more than makes up for it. The director did not waste a second in getting right to the point: a hero is framed for a hostage crisis. We are reminded of this fact every 20 minutes (story time, not real time) and the action heats up to a boiling (or blowing) point which finishes with a chilling message about America's post-9/11 years that should satisfy even the most jaded movie-goer (/clear throat again\).<br/><br/>You may not remember Non-Stop months afterward but years from now you certainly will remember how good you felt. I couldn't tell you what happened exactly in Flightplan (2005), Executive Decision (1996), or Air Force One (1997) but I sure know they were entertaining films despite their faults.<br/><br/>Book the flight. Enjoy the ride."
"JustBo","6","0","3","4 April 2014"," Like opening a Highly anticipated Christmas Presents to find out you got ugly socks.
","Non-Stop is the latest thrill ride action movie starring Liam Neeson. I will keep this review short and straight-forward, something I wish the director had done as well.<br/><br/>This film is not bad, but it certainly has some problems. It's almost as if the writers suddenly ran out of ideas, and decided to throw darts at the very high list of suspects in order to just end it all. The film's main strength is the fact that it does a remarkable job at building up the suspense. It really does keep you guessing all throughout the movie. Everyone is a suspect, it's entertaining, suspenseful and it works like a charm. It reminded me of the old-school Hollywood mystery thrillers. The action was certainly there, but none of it was over the top or too silly at first. So far so good. By the time the ending comes along though, the plot is slapped together in a half-assed, rushed and very unimaginative way. The main motive behind all of it was weak, didn't make sense and felt like a rushed, lame and very standard way to tie things together. By the time Liam Neeson starts fighting someone with an oxygen mask, I was done with this film. As stated above, the main strength is the anticipation, rather than the actual pay-off. Like a big Christmas present lurking from under the tree. You see it, envision it, the anticipation and excitement is overwhelming. And then you open the present.....And it's barely so-so.<br/><br/>The movie is not without merits either. The acting is good, mainly from Neeson, Moore and Dockery. Lupita is great as well but her character added nothing to the film. In fact, most secondary characters added nothing to the film. Some characters are used as a plot device but mostly they come across as filler, which makes you care less about any of them. On the flip side, the acting is very good all-round. The director keeps things steady for a good run. In the end however, as the chaos on the flight progresses, so does the chaos behind the camera.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was, for me, quite forgettable. Not good, not bad, just so-so. But by all means, see this in the cinema. It's still an action flick on a plane. You could do worse."

","""I'm not hijacking this plane. I'm trying to save it!""<br/><br/>Despite its shoddy CGI shots of a bogus jetliner plunging earthward with two fighter jets flanking it, the film qualifies as an extremely preposterous but thoroughly entertaining airborne mystery- thriller.<br/><br/>At 61-years of age, rugged Liam Neeson stars as troubled U.S. Air Marshal William Marks. Not only has Marks survived the death of his cancer-ridden, adolescent daughter, but he has also experienced a devastating divorce along with the loss of his 25-year job as a New York City Police Department detective. Meantime, the unshaven Marks has deteriorated into a guilt- ridden, nicotine-addicted, alcoholic plagued by memories of his grim past.When he starts getting text messages in flight to the effect that someone is going to start killing people aboard the plane every 20 minutes, his day couldn't get much worse. Except it could. And does.<br/><br/>For whatever reason, this plane never feels cramped and the tight spaces only come into play with the aforementioned lavatory fight scene, and even that seems like the most spacious airplane restroom of all-time. Even the multiple drop-dead deadlines aren't really played for full effect, and the decent supporting cast isn't given much to do, save for looking suspiciously at Neeson.<br/><br/>You may need to suspend disbelief and not think too hard about the events as they transpire. You are bound to find a plot hole or two if you look too hard. Some behaviors of the passengers, and even of Marks himself, felt very unrealistic, given the situation. Actually, hearing the entire motivation behind the whole complex plot verbalized may be a downer for some people.<br/><br/>The screenwriter team wrote an exhilarating story that really captures the audience attention from start to finish and Jaume Collet-Serra directed a solid plot that kept the movie's pace going strong, leaving no room with unnecessary fillers that tends to drag the story. There are a few camp and corny moments here and there, but the acting was realistic and believable enough to keep the movie dramatic and engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a great action film that is full of twists and turns that will make you glued to the screen and have you guessing the unpredictable outcomes. This is one of Liam Neeson's better thriller films, coming 2nd to his original Taken film. For these reasons Non-Stop gets a 7/10."
"martinrobertson300482","5","0","1","31 March 2014"," Crash lands near the end
","Some Hollywood exec somewhere, really wants Liam Neeson to be taken seriously as an action hero. We all loved him in ""Taken"" (and ""The Grey"" was actually pretty good) but after ""Taken 2"" and erm, that other one where people all forgot who he was or whatever, are we willing to except yet, that ""Taken"" was a one off? In all fairness. ""Non-stop"" did actually look pretty good. Which is why I went too see it. I was hoping for a modern whodunnit. With Neeson kicking some ass on the tight confines of a plane. But what we have here is just another addition to the many mediocre action movies, that have used this setting. ""Non-stop"" could of just as easily starred Steven Seagal, Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, or even Jodie Foster. Does anyone really remember the similar movies all off these guys were in? OK, maybe Harrison Fords ""Airforce one."" That was awesome! It goes without saying that anyone expecting another ""Taken"" from this will be no doubt disappointed. After all, how much action can you really have taking place on such a crammed setting as a full up plane? For what it is though, ""Non-stop"" starts off fairly effectively. Its far from straight forward, and is at times a complex, sometimes thrilling ride, full of twists and turns. This makes it even more unfortunate though, when it crash lands near the end. ""Non-stop"" really starts to fall apart if you think about it too much. If your going to make a complicated movie. It has to actually make some sort of sense if we're putting a bit of extra effort in, to try and follow it."

Its less obvious who the bad people are on the plane. There is good chemistry between the leading actors Moore and Neeson.<br/><br/>The movie does have some violent scenes but is not very violent by today's standards with no nudity.

","I've seen reviews on this film talking about how it was a very good action movie. I have to agree that the movie was good but personally wasn't AS good as some people are saying it is. The storyline had a interesting concept but over a period of time become boring due to how repetitive it was. Neeson is an amazing actor, however going off the storyline again it seems that his character always has the same background. It was very noticeable in this film that Collet- Serra dumbed down the character developed of Neeson and the supports because of its similarity to other movies. <br/><br/>Stepping back from that the movie visually and for action contents, it was very well done. With the small set of an air plane Collet-Serra and Labiano were able to get some really beautiful angles. The action in the movie was intense and was well performed, again amazing for the tight spaces of the set. <br/><br/>Would recommend this movie to others to view, but keep you're expectations low and understand it's a very typical Liam Neeson film."
"estebangonzalez10","6","0","2","27 March 2014"," Liam Neeson doing what he does best
","""We're midway across the Atlantic. How do you kill someone in a crowded plane and get away with it?""<br/><br/>That is the same question I asked myself before going into this new Neeson thriller. The premise sounded a bit silly, but the trailer had me at Liam Neeson. I will watch any action film he stars in nowadays. Neeson plays a very similar character in every one of these films (Taken, Unknown, The Grey) and they simply should've made a franchise with all these movies similar to what they did with James Bond or Mission Impossible so people will stop complaining he plays the same role (and at least this time there is an excuse for his Irish accent). Non-Stop is a fun mindless action film as long as you don't stop and analyze the plot. For the most part it really worked for me because Neeson delivers and keeps your mind off some of the plot holes, but once the final act arrives there is not much he can do to save this film. The final ten minutes are a huge let down and it almost ruined all the fun I was having during the rest of the movie. I still enjoyed this film more than Neeson's previous collaboration with director, Jaume Collet-Serra, Unknown. The cast is strong enough to carry this film past all the plot holes, and I'd rather see Neeson in a mindless action thriller over pretty much any film that has been released this year. <br/><br/>Non-Stop is John Richardson and Christopher Roach's first film screenplay which stars Liam Neeson as Bill Marks, an air marshall who is going through a depressive and alcoholic stage. What appears to be a routine flight from New York to London ends up being a nightmare for Bill as he begins receiving threatening messages on his secure phone line. The message states that a passenger will die every 20 minutes unless 150 million dollars are transferred to a specific bank account. Bill decides to talk to the other air marshall, Hammond (Anson Mount), who tries to calm him down by telling him it has to be a prank. When 20 minutes go by, Bill realizes this is no prank and with very few people on the plane he can trust he has to enlist the help of the flight attendant, Nancy (Michelle Dockery) and the person sitting next to him on the plane, Jen Summers (Julianne Moore), to help him locate who the terrorist might be. <br/><br/>The premise might be a bit silly, but for the most part I was still enjoying this thriller thanks to the interesting cast. The action scenes were also entertaining and for a movie that takes place almost entirely in a plane it was engaging. If you aren't demanding a film with logic, you might enjoy this mindless action film as much as I did. It's a shame that Lupita Nyong'o didn't get a heavier role because she proved in 12 Years a Slave to be a very talented actress. In this film she doesn't get to do much, but it's OK because we get to see Liam Neeson doing what he does best for most part of this film. The way its audience receives the weak final reveal at the end is probably what makes the difference in this action thriller. It is very far fetched, but as I mentioned above, it is much better than most January or February releases. I enjoyed this film because despite it not making any sense it was still an engaging and fun ride. The truth of the matter is that Neeson is the one that holds this film together and doesn't allow it to crash."
"lasttimeisaw","5","0","2","18 March 2014"," Neeson's another action flick
","My first cinema-going in Cairo in a rather mini-screen room downtown, my big-screen attendance needs to be revived, but in this arid season, the only credible choice (for me at least) is this Liam Neeson's action flick, very pertinent to the current mystifying tragedy of Malaysian airline's missing Boeing 777-200ER, and not the least because my goddess Moore is in it too, returns the favor to Neeson as a red-herring-and-the-possible-love-interest in it after their largely overlooked collaboration in Atom Egoyan's erotic thriller CHLOE (2009, 7/10), oops, spoilers alert!<br/><br/>The premise is smart and efficient enough to pique audience's interest in this airplane-bound whodunit hijacking, Bill Marks (Neeson), an air marshal with alcoholic problem and a heart- rending past, tries to expose the mastermind who extorts $150 million to an account abroad by claiming to kill one fuselage-confined passenger (or crew member) every 20 minutes inside a transatlantic vehicle. What is more insidious, the plot is divulged to frame Marks as the fall guy, and with some inexplicable twists and three body counts, it almost works.<br/><br/>But no one should pick on Liam Neeson, overtly the most bankable action star over-60 presently (TAKEN 2008, 7/10; THE GREY 2011, 7/10; TAKEN 2 2012, 5/10), take that Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis! Reunited with Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of UNKNOWN (2011), he is forlorn and desperate to outstrip his unidentified enemy, but he will catch the culprit under any circumstances. So we all embark on the shot in the dark with Bill, deducing by appearance, physiognomy, utterance and of course, ethnics, but the film firmly sticks to the political correctness. The message communication between Marks and the unknown terrorist who hacks the specialized network inside the aircraft plays a major part in conveying information essential to audience's own judgment and slickly props up the storytelling along the riddle until a time-bomb is uncovered. Then one negligent boo-boo will betray who is the extorter. <br/><br/>It is a challenging task to round up such an original scheme and offer a satisfactory explanation, so the finishing-up process is cursorily executed (especially the motive and the preposterous set pieces involving several key characters' conduct), it is understandable but the thirsty of a plausible closure has never been properly quenched, maybe they are working on a sequel due to its rosy box office achievements, hope Moore's role can be excavated (from the huge scar on her chest) much deeper since she could be the big boss behind all the catastrophe. <br/><br/>Neeson is formidable and vulnerable alternately, he certainly enjoys the exploitation of the typecast lone-hero fashion, but one does hope he can return to his character-actor realm during the breaks, he is much overdue for some serious recognition besides these cash consolation after the ski tragedy killed his wife Natasha Richardson. The rest of the cast is borderline passable, glad to see Dockery manage to grab a decent role on big screen out of her DOWNTON ABBEY property. But Nyong'o doesn't need this on her filmography at all, I will not spoil too much, nevertheless a big relief for me is that she survives instead of being written off hastily with her Grace Jones hairstyling."

It has an interesting premise that would make people guess and curious on what happens at the end while actually it ends disappointingly. The ending of the film ruins the tension they had built from beginning and added a non-sense moment in it. Also the hijacking purpose is quite silly and not explained clearly. Luckily there's Liam Neeson who more or less has secured this action flick for not falling into a disaster even though Bill Marks' character seems having similar personality with Bryan Mills' in Taken. Overall Non-Stop is good enough as entertainment and the thrilling thing quite works but don't expect smart storyline could come from this movie cause it will disappoint you."
"joey-ziemniak","6","0","2","14 March 2014"," Non-Stop is about as generic as they come, but don't let that stop you from enjoying this well-crafted thriller
","Non-Stop brings nothing new to the action-thriller genre. It is about as standard as they come, but Liam Neeson commands the film with intensity and urgency that keeps it from ever getting boring.<br/><br/>Non-Stop has a simple premise, yet it keeps the audience guessing throughout. One look at the poster and you'll know what to expect. From the beginning, you're wondering who is sending air marshall Bill (Liam Neeson) these text messages threatening to kill someone every 20 minutes. This interesting premise gives the film the liberty to do what it wants with the plot. You won't guess what happens, because there are so many twists and turns. While at times very unbelievable, Non-Stop is still really enjoyable.<br/><br/>This is due in part to Liam Neeson, the recent king of action movies. Dubbed ""Taken on a Plane,"" Non-Stop is better than his recent films, and he takes command of the role and keeps audiences invested. Supporting roles from Downton Abbey's Michelle Dockery, Argo's Scoot McNairy, House of Cards's Corey Stoll, and 12 Years a Slave's Lupita Nyong'o only makes you miss them in their most well-known roles. None of them are really standouts, not even Lupita. But since Neeson is the star of the show, you won't mind.<br/><br/>Like I said, Non-Stop is nothing new. A decent thriller with some twists and turns that keeps it from getting boring. Some laughable emotional background gives at least some dimension to Neeson's character, but by the end it just feels like a cop-out, typical of recent thrillers. But the action and suspense is first-rate. The final act in particular is especially thrilling, with plane parts flying everywhere and suspense building until the end. A smart thriller that keeps you guessing, Non-Stop shouldn't be passed over, but just don't expect anything special."

","Bada$$....The word thats become synonymous with Liam Neeson since his unpredictable action hero turn in 2008 with the now cult favorite ""Taken"". I often ask myself how Neeson arrived at this status but that kind of ruins a bit of the fun for me if I over think it.<br/><br/>The action hero is a bit of an endangered species in todays Hollywood. I mean, action films are still getting made but there aren't many good ones and if there are some solid action films being made, we aren't seeing the same one actor appear in them and that is what has separated Neeson from the rest. When you think about it, Neeson and Tom Cruise (50 years old himself) are the only consistent ""action heroes"" that are constantly churning out action films that are actually quite entertaining (except for Jack Reacher...take a mulligan on that one Tom). <br/><br/>Non-Stop is the perfect cure for the post-Oscars theater blues as for the most part during the first month or two after awards season we are treated to a major garbage-fest. Non-Stop has that familiar Liam Neeson ""Taken"" feel to it and it keeps us alert and entertained throughout the whole ride. These films are not only good for us to watch Neeson kick a$$, but these films also serve as opportunities for somewhat unknown actors to showcase their skills and get their faces out there (Corey Stoll from ""House of Cards"", Scoot McNairy (12 Years a Slave, Killing them Softly, and Lupita N'Yongo fresh off her Oscar win in ""Slave""). These actors are hoping to use films like these as a jump start and to hopefully go from unknown to not necessarily star but at least get to the point of being recognized as ""that guy from that thing"".<br/><br/>Julianne Moore was kind of pointless here. She is (was?) a star and a 4- time Oscar nominee but her role could have been played by an unknown. It was almost distracting seeing someone of her caliber just kind of randomly thrown in this role as she wasn't even promoted with the film. You just see her and it's like, ""Oh crap, that's Julianne Moore I didn't know she was in this"". Then again, would knowing she was in it beforehand make you want to see a movie like ""Non-Stop"" even more?...probably not. <br/><br/>What makes Neeson so great in these roles, besides his a$$ kicking prowess and the fact that he is bound to have a classic ""corny"" action line (""Your arrogance offends me"" from Taken is still my all time favorite action line), is that he knows how to utilize his voice and facial expressions to make these characters who seem unstoppable also display a sense of vulnerability and inner turmoil that makes us care about them.<br/><br/>In the end, Non-Stop"" doesn't take itself too seriously. It is a fun movie that entertains from start to finish and that alone warrants the ticket price."

","'NON-STOP': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>61-year-old Liam Neeson stars in another B action film, in this one he's an alcoholic air marshal dealing with a plane being held hostage (for a 150 million dollar ransom) by a mysterious text messaging criminal. The former Academy Award nominee is also joined in the movie by another former Oscar nominee Julianne Moore and recent winner Lupita Nyong'o! The supporting cast also includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker, Corey Stoll, Michelle Dockery, Anson Mount, Shea Whigham and Linus Roache. It was directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (who also directed Neeson in the 2011 action thriller 'UNKNOWN') and written by John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle. I found the flick to be fun while I was watching it but ultimately forgettable. <br/><br/>Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-cop who's now an alcoholic U.S. federal air marshal. He recently lost his job as a police officer, had his wife leave him and lost his eight-year-old daughter to cancer. So he of course drinks a lot to cope. The story takes place aboard Aqualantic Flight 10, a flight from New York to London. We learn Marks is also afraid of flight takeoffs as he explains this to the friendly passenger sitting next to him, named Jen Summers (Moore). Things really get exciting for Marks when he starts getting text messages from a mysterious stranger who's watching him. The texter threatens to kill a passenger every 20 minutes unless Marks can have $150 million delivered to a special bank account. Things become even more complicated when it turns out the account belongs to the air marshal. <br/><br/>Neeson is once again exceptional in the lead action hero role, he's of course above films like this but it's still a lot of fun to watch him. Moore and Nyong'o are of course above material like this too, so is the director, but their talent makes it so much more entertaining. It's the type of movie that I know I'll forget most of within a year or two; like I'll probably forget who the bad guys are and how it ends but that doesn't mean it's still not worth watching. A good time is a good time regardless of whether it's high quality entertainment or not and I for one love wasting time watching dumb movies like this.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs"

The plot that is being played out is so evened out that you wont see it coming. The main goal is to figure out who the blackmailing criminal is but the whole plot and characters is so played out that its so hard to guess who it is and that you'll end up saying its everyone! The way the movie depicted each character builds the suspense on to who it actually it. The movie breaks down character by character till there's one left but swings the other way to a whole nother-level. The movie sets out characters to be the person but don't believe it!

","People seem to have forgotten how to review films like these nowadays and whereas many would chastise this film for being a big dumb action movie, Non-Stop is a throwback to the 90s thriller. Liam Neeson's nearly unthinkable career transformation into a major action star (the most surprising since Leslie Nielsen turned Comedy icon with Airplane!) continues and the results are silly but vastly enjoyable. For a good majority of the duration, this hijack Thriller plays out like a Marple whodunnit meets Air Force One, before descending into chaos (albeit not jarringly so).<br/><br/>If you come in craving a realistic story of hijacking, you will leave frowning but the fact is that Non-Stop fulfils its requirements as a genre movie. Neeson once more anchors the film, handling the tidbits of action (a well staged toilet cubicle scrap in particular) and suspense with professional verve. The supporting cast, though some are wasted, also lend their full commitment and it all concludes to a ridiculously good night at the movies. Even when the mystery is revealed and logic has gone out the window, you are not dispirited because the entertainment value persists.<br/><br/>This is not classic cinema but it is well made, gripping, fun, boasting a selection of standout moments. It lacks the ruthlessness of Taken and the ideological underpinnings of The Grey but it matches Collet-Serra's last film Unknown and outdoes the (at times) haphazard Taken 2. You'll leave entertained and remembering that zero-G gunshot- which has internet meme written all over it, ironic really as this is a 90s flick through and through."

","So, I just watched this movie not expecting too much and it gave me a good surprise! I jumped a few times in shock at some (loud) events which I did not saw coming! The movie was really good. It was not too dense nor too mindless (things just made sense). It had very interesting plot twists that kept the story going and it really does make you itch to find out who is the real enemy, whether it was Bill Marks (Liam Neeson) who has gone mad or it really was some terrorist(s). However, before nearing the climax of the movie, the build-up was too slow. Things were happening and Bill was trying hard to find the terrorist(s) but somehow I felt like nothing much was going on and the passengers reaction to Bill's panic was constantly questioning Bill's sanity and I felt really impatient. My mind was already drifting and thinking of walking out of the cinema hall to get a good sandwich but I waited longer and boy, was I glad not to have walked out and missed the terrific climax of the movie! Like I said, this movie has some really amazing surprises. Next, there was the scene which involved Liam Neeson and a gun and the baddie and I went, ""Everyone forgets that Liam Neeson is GOD."" Well, he got his good revenge for everybody not believing in him. Also, the other characters in the movie are intriguing enough and they make the movie very interesting. Overall, do watch 'Non-Stop' if you have not! Just make sure you have some snacks and chill out in the beginning of the movie."
"Seraphion","7","0","1","5 March 2014"," A new take on suspense thriller
","Okay, the first and foremost I'd say is that I was fooled by the poster art. The poster depicts high intensity of action, yet I fact the movie is more dominant in mystery and thriller region of a genre. But it is to no disappointment because the movie is indeed good in terms of suspense thriller.<br/><br/>The story is of typical action, a hostage ransom situation, with the initial twist that the perpetrator is invisible, as usual. But then as the conflict starts, there is no stopping, literally non-stop. Yes we have seen movies like ""Flightplan"" that do this kind of suspense build, with extra action sequence on the ending, yet ""Non-Stop"" gives us another take of that particular build.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson's acting is great as usual. His facial expressions are kept consistent to the emotions Bill Marks should be having at all the times. Julianne Moore is just a complementary act all the way to about seven tenths of the movie. The other cast, which are mostly TV series cast did quite a good job being paired with Neeson and Moore. After seeing 2014's Oscars, we won't expect to see Lupita Nyong'o to have such a small role, yet she did in this movie.<br/><br/>The pace of story building is kept in quick steps, yet it is still in a thriller suspense style. It makes you stay at the edge of your seat right from the conflict started. For a seasoned movie goer, especially suspense or thriller or mystery and detective stories addict, this film presents viewers with a lot of points and details that left you wondering, is this thing gonna be important as the movie nears its end? For instance, the stewardess, the co-pilot, and some of the suspicious passengers.<br/><br/>The screenplay is great, every thing that happened has major consequences to the continuing scenes and baffles us the viewers even more about who the real perp is. And with every five or ten minutes, the pressure in the lead character gets more and more immense.<br/><br/>The climax is served with a good twist, although the story of the climax is rather mediocre. I'd give it a 7 out of 10 score and definitely recommending you to see it. But expect to see dominant action. Think of it as ""Flightplan"" with a lot more nerve."

","Another year another Liam Neeson thriller (usually released between the Jason Statham ones) This year the high concept is ""air marshal threatened by mysterious texter threatening to kill a passenger aboard the transatlantic flight every 20 minutes unless $150.000 is paid into his account. Who is the mystery killer? Who can he trust? What is the bigger picture behind events?"" <br/><br/>The trailers say it all really, and the whole thing is strictly of a B- movie standard, a Euro-thriller released by a US studio (as in fact are most Neeson movies including ""Taken"" and ""Unknown"" with whom this shares a director) Apart from Liam and Julianne Moore (who it is great to see back so busy on our big screens) most of the rest of the cast are Brit thespians of high quality, especially the flight crew which is made up of ""Downton Abbey"" star Michelle Dockery,""12 yrs a slave"" Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o, Scoot McNairy and heading them all the wonderful Linus Roache, the RSC headliner who occasionally brightens up movies with his consummate skill. The name of the game is ""guess who?"" And to that end we are fed a line up of shifty individuals who may or may not be the mystery attacker/s. Thriller making is rather like Magic and the secret is misdirection and sleight of hand, and director Jaume Collet-Serra does an OK if not spectacular job. Action is naturally limited given the environment but they do use the tightness to create impressive close quarter combat between Neeson and various opponents that would make Steven Segal proud. The special effects are quite ropey though, especially the cartoon airliner and Typhoon fighters which look more like something from a safety information video rather than a major movie!<br/><br/>The villains motivations, when revealed, are quite interesting if somewhat lacking in logic, but to their credit they are damaged individuals and so deserving of some pity as well as a pass for their poor scheme! Some have complained about the fact that a Muslim doctor is shown positively while the terrorists this time are not Islamic, but in its defence a real Muslim terrorist would not have gone through all this twisty turny misdirection plot stuff but would simply have blown the plane to bits 10 minutes after take off, which though more realistic frankly wouldn't have made for much of a movie!<br/><br/>Reminiscent of those mostly forgotten airliner thrillers from the early- mid 90s, this will doubtless share the same fate but may amuse for now, and Liam Neeson still looks and moves great for a 62 year old! (And Moore isn't so bad either!)<br/><br/>PS - Hollywood writers, please please impose a moratorium on using ""I lost a child boo-hoo crying over cute photos and stick drawings"" as a substitute for actual characterisation! It drags any movie its used in down and covers it piping hot cheese! Be frakking original, its what you're paid so much to do!"

","Liam Neeson has become a very marketable action movie superstar since the hit action thriller Taken. So whenever a movie trailer shows Liam Neeson beating up bad guys, people immediately anticipate its release. Non Stop may seem like a great mystery action thriller, but overall it's an entertaining yet disappointing film as a whole.<br/><br/>Non Stop has very simple plot; An air marshal receives random text messages and lives are threatened. Only problem is, after every twenty minutes, a passenger is killed, unless, $150 million dollars is transferred to an account off shore. That's basically it, but what keeps the film going is the classic ""Who done it?"" formula.<br/><br/>The film does a great job at building tension, but it fails to hold it throughout the film, and the pacing just doesn't balance well. At some moments the film begins racing at 100 km/h, and then suddenly it slows down to 5 and goes into autopilot. There's also only three action sequences, with the first one placed late within the first act, and the last two in the final act. The end fight will come off as underwhelming, but at least it was there. The acting was fine, but some of the cast were heavily underused.<br/><br/>All in all, Non Stop is an entertaining but sadly, flawed, disappointing and forgettable film. If you took the tense bits of Die Hard, added all of the boring bits of Under Siege, throw in the plot of Unknown and have the setting in the plane, this would probably be the outcome. Non Stop isn't a must see, and I'd prefer to rent it on a rainy day.<br/><br/>6.6/10"

The suspense starts in the beginning and you always wonder who is trying to kill people. Lots of things happened and the thrill is great. The characters are great, the sounds are very nice and you can't predict how the movie will end.<br/><br/>I loved everything about the picture apart from the end.

The director of this movie made some pretty good casting choices. For example, I can't see anybody playing the role of Bill Marks that isn't Liam Neeson. He makes this character a beast, and is probably the best part of this movie. Julianne Moore as Jen is very charismatic and believable as a character. Just reading the texts keeps high amounts of suspense in the air. The suspense was something about this movie that I really enjoyed. Although I give this movie praise, there are still problems with the movie. Everything is so perfectly timed, it would be impossible to pull off in real life. The killer's motives- as revealed in the end- are kind of lame. Neeson's speech halfway through the movie is slightly forced and cheesy. Also, 3/4 of the way through, the suspense looses some of its steam. If you want to enjoy this movie, you will have to suspend your disbelief. This movie is something I will definitely buy on DVD.

It is exciting and well- acted. Most of all, it's fun to watch. It all strains credibility at time. It's interesting to me that the denouement is not so much to stop the board on exploding but to get the plane down to an elevation where the pressure has a chance of stabilizing and minimizing the loss of life -a different twist. The way in which Neeson becomes everybody's prime suspect and then recovers - which is the bulk - of the film is clever and suspenseful. If you like Neeson and you lie heroic action-suspense movies - especially in the theater -yo will enjoy this. If you like neither Neeson nor his version of the genre which always calls for you to suspend a bit of credibility, then why did you bother to see this anyway?"

","I first saw the trailer for Non-Stop while looking on the internet. I had never heard about it, but it starred Liam Neeson, so, in my mind, it was a pretty good incentive to watch the trailer. So I saw it, and I got super excited. It looked really intense, and that's exactly what I was hoping for walking in. So, did this movie satisfy? I'd say yeah. The movie satisfied pretty well. In Non-Stop, Liam Neeson plays an air marshal, who's taking a flight to London. On this flight, he gets a message from someone in a disclosed network, saying that that person will kill someone in the plane every twenty minutes. And then, lots of suspenseful happenings ensue. I use the word ""suspenseful"" for good reason, because this movie has exactly that. Non-Stop does a great job instilling tension throughout the movie, always leaving you guessing throughout. You never feel at ease throughout the movie, and the movie does well capitalizing on that. I also give props to Liam Neeson in this movie. He does splendid being an awesome, albeit broken, character. And I don't mean broken as a bad thing. I mean broken as he has struggles in his life, and he clearly shows it in the movie. Everyone, as a whole, does good in this movie, like Julianne Moore, but Liam Neeson is the real star. While there aren't many throw downs in this movie, the action is still exciting to watch. You feel every hit, every gunshot, every slice (yes, slice); it's all intense. Despite all this, there are a couple of things that bog the movie down from greatness. First is your suspension of disbelief with this movie. There is a lot in this movie that just seems unrealistic. There's no possible way for this guy to kill someone on this plan every twenty minutes exactly. I saw this movie with my dad, and even he joked about it. He said the message should've been, ""I will kill somebody on this plane every twenty-ish minutes."" Things like that kind of take me out of the movie. Also, there's nothing really that memorable about this movie. Sure, it builds tension well, but there's no scene that really stands out. I have a feeling that this movie will be easily forgotten in the future. Overall, this movie was good. It wasn't quite the ""hijacking thriller"" I was hoping for, but it was pretty darn close. Do you have to see this movie right now? No. But I would suggest you see it, because it is an enjoyable movie."

","Non-Stop deals with an air marshal springs into action during a transatlantic flight after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account. <br/><br/>We're used to know J. Collet-Serra in horror films, indeed, he directed House of Wax (2005) and Orphan (2009). For his second action movie the director of Unknown (2011) pays a tribute to the old plane catastrophe movie of the 70's such as Airport with Burt Lancaster directed by George Seaton. There are a pronounced Hitchcokian atmosphere which have an outrageous 90's style. The investigation is thrilling, the murders are, clever, the plot is well formulated and the atmosphere is oppressive in this flight-constrained area. Every twenty minutes someone die, and in between the pace is pretty good, especially when we can see Liam Neeson kicking ass. In fact, Liam Neeson could ad credibility to just about anything, he could even sit on a bench and look at a bird saying ""I'm an air marshal, come here now!"" I will probably enjoy it. But in this film he's actually not just a mindless action hero. Julian Moore provided some good supporting work as well, she brings some humanity in Neeson's character, he reveals himself to her. Each one of the characters look suspicious and at some point you could find yourself thinking ""Oh it could be him - or her - or him with the sunglasses and the cap"" and even the seven years old girl looks guilty. Which is pretty exciting, and mind-blowing. Plus as the film is in a constrained area I've had this feeling that i was in the plane as well, searching for the terrorists and looking at each one of the passengers. However, Non-Stop is not realistic at all. Nothing makes sense. It's cheesy, but fun enough to be kind interesting and enjoyable to watch around. I believe if a film is written, played and filmed with enough passion and at one time everything fall into place, a movie that is even endlessly implausible and doesn't always makes sense; I think it could be good. Non-Stop is that movie. That one movie that comes along once in a while. <br/><br/>A basic but efficient plane thriller, supported by really good actors."

Nobody can get to you.""<br/><br/>So you ask me to recommend a film after the Oscars and before the better summer fare. Ordinarily I'd tell you to wait until then because this time of year traditionally offers mediocre or worse movies. Now I can recommend an enjoyable experience with all the thriller tropes in good form and a hero to be admired: Non-Stop with Liam Neeson. Contrary to the above quote from Jen, somebody ""gets"" everyone associated with this flight.<br/><br/>Neeson's Bill Marks is an alcoholic air marshal who doesn't like to fly and gets caught in an electronic terror aboard a transatlantic flight to London. He's trying to find out who aboard is sending texts calling for a passenger death every 20 minutes until the airline puts $150 Million into a safe account. Marks is himself a suspect (the off-shore account is in his name!), and he has to kill to remain in the game.<br/><br/>Wait, waitâ€”it gets more fantastical, from a number of suspects the director, Jaume Collet-Serra, has planted in various frames, as any respectable thriller would, to the big red LED lights ticking off explosion time. But what makes it all believable is the unbelievably adept acting of Neeson, who looks heroic with his solid tall frame and crooked nose.<br/><br/>Non-Stop does not stop giving the audience faces to put behind the terror, and Neeson turns out to be as resourceful as Denzel Washington's drunken pilot in ""Flight."" The director also deftly careen's through the cabin with Bill to relieve the imprisoning small space feel all planes give, even in movies.<br/><br/>Working previously with Neeson, the director knows how to coax the credible out of him, keeping his uncharacteristic smiling for a final scene and not too much of it. Well, who can blame Marks, when troubled but helpful passenger Julianne Moore is the object of that good feeling? <br/><br/>Like all air trips, Non-Stop has its dull moments yet enough action to help moviegoers through the movie dead zone to better flights in May.<br/><br/>By the way, don't see this film if you fly regularly to London."

","Ciaran: When i saw the Non-Stop trailer a week ago, i didn't have overly high expectations for this movie. When i watched the movie, i had a mixed opinion. So the movie begins at an airport, where we see Bill Marks, an alcoholic air Marshall heading to London. Once on the plane, he receives messages about a threat on the plane, the man messaging Bill explains he will kill one person on the plane every 20 minutes, we see Bill interrogate people one by one, eventually only 3 people are killed. This was the story i wanted to see and it was done nicely, but then a bomb was put on the plane- this decision in my opinion ruined the whole movie. Although just after Bill finds the bomb, he says that he thinks that he was never actually meant to find the bomb- i believe this was the original idea the script writers had, that the bomb would just go off- but that probably wouldn't have worked with the general audience. But one of my biggest questions is 'where did the budget go?', i mean the only set they had to construct was probably the inside of the plane and the only other place we see is the airport, so where did the budget go?, i can tell you that it didn't go to the special effects team. Talking about the special effects- i have to say they looked good at the start of the film, but then when we eventually get to the end it looks as if the team slipped a little. Overall i felt Non-Stop was okay, but sadly we have seen this type of movie before, as an action movie it was good to watch, as a mystery i found it a bit too predictable and as thriller it wasn't that good, so i feel my final verdict can only be a 6/10."

","Liam Nelson, his heavy voice, his acting style, and his dialogue delivery have never disappointed me; I have been a fan of his most movies and went to watch this one, stepping over my date night at the 'Lego Movie'; <br/><br/>my reaction on seeing the movie was below my initial enthusiasm and I should give you my reasons why, for both good and that- could-be-better traits for the movie (all are my personal opinions and not some i am not a professional critic:<br/><br/>that-could-be-better: <br/><br/>1) Storyline: at couple of points I felt the NYPD police officer's role was made more of a joke; who gets up in the middle of flight and shouts just as all other people, as to 'is someone going to tell us whats going on?' I mean should not a police officer just go and talk to the air marshal and not react so much? that patience and intelligence makes you a cop is not it?<br/><br/>2) Air Marshal declared terrorist on public TV, before any move being made by the ground staff: even if, the air marshal was declared a terrorist by the cops on the ground, does it make sense to declare that on public television when it is clear that people on the plane can see that TV? and get even more panicked?<br/><br/>3)Romance: Well, un-necessary romance in action movies does not make me happy; I mean the pilot just took down a hijacked plane safely, he could have died and so could all others; the transition of the pilot romancing (or the start of it with Nancy, the air hostess, immediately after the plane crash landing, was not smooth at all<br/><br/>4) Liam Nelson's coming out the plane - it is shown that only one official knew he was not the real terrorist; no where in the movie it was shown that others don't know him as the terrorist; an arrest should have been shown at least<br/><br/>5) Could the money be just transferred in the bank account sooner as Liam asked? that money could have been withdrawn, once he landed (i mean, why wait till the last moment and let people die instead - i know part of the reason was that cops believed Liam to be the terrorist, but that does not justify ""enough for me"", the not-transferring of the money a lot sooner<br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>1) awesome suspense: I did not/could not guess at all as to who the real terrorist would be; that came as a def surprise 2) short movie with no time for nonsense; I like that in an action movie; short and crisp, and straight to business of making a great thriller 3) Nice acting by all others; usually the support actors do not act really well; here they all acted really well.<br/><br/>Over all, i would say, a good movie, but with some questions, requiring answers for me.<br/><br/>A DEFINITE (IF NOT MUST) GO MOVIE!"

","I saw ""Non-Stop"", starring Liam Neeson-The Taken movies, Darkman; Julianne Moore-Carrie_2013, The Big Lebowski; Scoot McNairy-12 Years a Slave, Bones_t.v.; Michelle Dockery-Downtown Abbey_t.v., Hanna and Lupita Nyong'O-12 Years a Slave, and this one is her second big screen movie.<br/><br/>This is a perfect Liam Neeson movie, with lots of tense action and he gets to grimace a lot, as only Liam can, as he delivers his lines. Liam plays an air marshal with problems. He had a tragic incident happen in his personal life and has become a bit of a drinker. He is also smoking pretty heavily so this makes him appear a little irrational at times. His latest assignment is on a transatlantic non-stop flight from America to England. About mid-flight, Liam starts getting text messages from a fellow passenger saying that they will kill someone on board the plane every 20 minutes unless he gets 150 million dollars in a Swiss bank account. Liam tells the pilot and even his air marshal supervisor but they don't believe him and think it is just a prank. Of course, they think differently, sometime around the time that the third body pops up dead. Julianne and Scoot play fellow passengers that fall under Liam's suspicions as being the terrorist and Michelle and Lupita are stewardesses. It is rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language, drug references and smoking and has a running time of 1 hour & 46 minutes. I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"Quietb-1","7","0","4","28 February 2014"," Not quite non stop action.
","The term suspension of disbelief required here.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson plays a character flawed Air Marshall. He disables the lavatory smoke detector. Julianne Moore becomes the side kick. (Sandra Bullock would have landed the plane.)<br/><br/>The movie resets the clock every twenty minutes as those aboard the plane are killed on schedule. Soon you wish they were killing people on a ten minute schedule. Maybe they needed to illuminate the ""fasten your seatbelt"" sign to stop the killings? The one plane location gets a bit claustrophobic. Some scenes look like they were shot on a cel phone.<br/><br/>Any flight you walk away from is a good flight. So what if the plane blows up and crashes. So what if the movie is unbelievable it is a good time while watching. Get a boarding pass and take this flight."
"ChristianLeFeuvre","6","0","1","28 February 2014"," Not as 'Non-Stop' as the title would suggest
","Just returned from seeing the new thriller 'Non-Stop' starring Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore.<br/><br/>There are films which you definitely have to see in the cinema and some which can easily wait till they arrive on Sky or TV. This film, I'm afraid, comes under the latter.<br/><br/>Liam Neeson stars as US Federal Air Marshal Bill Marks who, on a flight to London, starts receiving texts from someone on board threatening to kill passengers unless millions of dollars are paid into a specific account. When, in a roundabout way, the texter makes good their threats Bill has to do all he can to find out who it is and protect the other passengers.<br/><br/>The title describes the flight they are on more than the action in the movie, as it was surprisingly sparse. There were though some good moments and some clever visual effects, especially as the text messages being received are displayed on screen.<br/><br/>Following his success as an action hero in Taken and it's sequel, Liam Neeson does a good job in this movie too however the action is not as gripping as one would hope. The resolution and discovery of who the 'texter' is a bit of an anti-climax actually and it doesn't leave the viewer leaving the cinema still thinking 'WOW, I didn't see that coming' as a good whodunnit/thriller should, it actually made me think 'Oh really, is that it?' Unfortunately the story makes little sense especially when the texter's identity and motives come to light.<br/><br/>There are a couple of good fight scenes and Liam Neeson has taken the role of 'action-hero' pretty well.<br/><br/>In all Non-Stop isn't non-stop action or a clever whodunnit style thriller either, having said that it isn't a total bore either."
