"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","98","106","23 November 2003"," I'd put it in with the Disney classics
","Aladdin is such an awesome move that still gets me excited to this day, I remember when I was 7 and I saw this in the theater and I just had so much fun. I am such a dork, I still love a lot of the Disney movies that I loved as a kid, but I think the reason that I love Aladdin so much is because this is one of the last Disney movies that was hand drawn animation, the reason I love hand drawn animation is because it feels more personal and that the crew put their heart and soul into it, you can tell by watching it. They got a great cast of voice actors including Scott Weinger from Full House and the always entertaining and hilarious Robin Williams. Robin was just a perfect choice for Genie, he brought a lot of energy to the movie and makes the genie a great character. Who knew that a kid's version of the Arabian Nights tale could be so great? This is a great Disney movie that I guarantee you're going to love.<br/><br/>On a dark night, when Jafar attempts to access the Cave of Wonders, a magical cave which holds treasures beyond the wildest belief, above all is a magical oil lamp containing a genie is hidden. He and his talking parrot, Iago, learn that the only one who can enter the Cave of Wonders is the metaphorical ""Diamond in the Rough"". Meanwhile, in the palace of Agrabah, Jasmine, the beautiful teenage daughter of the Sultan, must be married before her upcoming birthday, but she rejects every prince she meets, as she wants to be married for true love and not merely for wealth. Later, Jasmine, frustrated with having her life lived for her climbs over the palace walls, and sees the marketplace for the first time, where she meets the street urchin Aladdin and his monkey, Abu, and the two young people are seen to be falling for each other. Jafar uses a machine to see that the ""diamond in the rough"" is Aladdin. Jafar sends a group of guards to capture Aladdin while Jasmine is still with him. Jasmine tells Jafar to release him, but Jafar lies and tells her he is already dead. Jafar, disguised as an elderly man, releases Aladdin from prison and leads him to the Cave of Wonders. They are told by the tiger-shaped head of the cave to touch nothing but the lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and encounters a magic carpet before finding the lamp. Abu tries to steal a ruby and causes the cave to start collapsing, but the carpet helps them to the entrance. Jafar takes the lamp from them and tries to kill them but Abu takes the lamp back and bites his arm, causing him to knock Abu back into the cave just as it collapses. When Aladdin awakens, Abu gives him the lamp which he had snatched from Jafar. After rubbing it, a genie is unleashed, revealing that he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin dupes the genie into freeing them from the cave without using up a wish. While contemplating his wishes, Aladdin asks the genie to make him into a prince so he can marry Jasmine. Iago later steals the genie's lamp back and brings it to Jafar, who becomes the genie's new master and uses his first wish to become sultan. Jafar then wishes to become a powerful sorcerer, Jafar then keeps the Sultan, the Genie, and Jasmine as his slaves. Aladdin must figure a way to save all of them and make things right again.<br/><br/>Aladdin is just a great movie that I promise you'll love, it has great characters, beautiful animation, and a terrific and catchy soundtrack that you'll be singing all day. This was one of the rare Disney movies that you pretty much loved ALL the characters, even Iago who is voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, the voice is a bit much but he is great as well. I personally love both the carpet and the genie. Who knew that a carpet could have so much personality? I absolutely adore the ""Friend Like Me"" scene, it was incredible to watch and had terrific animation! If for some odd reason you haven't somehow seen this movie, I highly recommend that you do, this will probably go down in your favorites as well.<br/><br/>10/10"
"British_Aussie_chick","10","131","147","13 May 2005"," This film is so good!
","I grew up watching this film and along with Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella it is one of my favourite Disney films. I love it! Robin Williams is so good in it. He's hilarious. This film isn't just for kids but for the whole family. I think I was about 5 when I first saw it and at 14 I still watch it and so do my parents. I haven't seen the sequels because I heard that Robin Williams wasn't in them and decided that they wouldn't be as good without him. He was made for the part. The songs are amazing. I love singing along to ""A Whole new World"". I'm hoping to get the soundtrack soon. I also love the film because I have the same name as the princess in it! I would definitely recommend it to everyone. You're never too old to watch a classic Disney film."
"MR_Heraclius","10","36","38","21 February 2020"," My favorite animated movie.
","From start to finish, Aladdin is timeless classic! Very funny, very exciting and intense, amazing visuals, and excellent pacing! The story is also amazing, as are the characters. Holy crap do the characters in this movie rock! They all play a very important role in the movie. You have Aladdin and Abu as two fearless adventurers/thieves, Jasmine as one of the best and most charming Disney princesses of all time, Jafar as the highly cunning, intelligent, and awesome sorcerer and one of the best Disney villains of all time, Iago, who has to be the best henchman of any villain in any movie (he and Jafar are the best together), and of course, the Genie. From his design to his style to pretty much everything there is about him, he absolutely steals the show! From the moment he appears during the movie, he is just seems so much like the the star of the movie. Robin Williams as the Genie is one of the best performances in any animated movie. Aladdin is such an awesome movie that I can't give it anything other than 10 out of 10"
"Boba_Fett1138","9","82","94","23 October 2004"," Great songs and a good villain make ""Aladdin"" a Disney classic.
","This movie has three elements that are important for an animated Disney movie: Great songs, a good villain and a great sidekick.<br/><br/>The songs and music in general are just great and very memorable. Jafar is a great villain mainly because he is voiced by Jonathan Freeman who has got a good and scary voice. But what is maybe the best element of the movie is Robin Williams as the blue genie. The blue genie is like a jokemachine that once it is started can't stop again and keeps you laughing.<br/><br/>The story is good and the pace is high. ""Aladdin"" is not too short and it's not too long, it's not too immature and it's not too mature, it's a perfect movie for the entire family with a wonderful love story (even though it's no ""Beauty and the Beast"") and good animations with some good looking early computer effects.<br/><br/>9/10"
"ElMaruecan82","10","19","20","19 December 2011"," Forever a favorite of mine ...
","I will never forget the first time I watched ""Aladdin"", I was with a group of friends waiting in the airport for the plane that would take us from Orlando to Paris at the time when ""Aladdin"" was the 'big thing' in the USA while some previews of ""The Lion King"" were starting to screen. ""Aladdin"" will forever be associated to that wonderful week I spent in Disneyland, and it's only fitting if the movie is my favorite Disney film, slightly edging-out ""The Jungle Book"".<br/><br/>I know I can get all rational in this review, analyzing what makes ""Aladdin"" such an appealing film and using the expected words of 'Disney Renaissance' and a comparison with the glorious Best Picture nominee predecessor. I can also talk about the animation, the music, the extraordinary multi-vocal performance of Robin Williams as Genie but I don't feel like getting rational. I love the film for personal reasons that are essentially due to the excellent timing of this film in its penetration of my pre-adolescent life. ""Aladdin"" took a forever cherished place as one of the last treasures that enriched my childhood even playing a pivotal role in the way I would start enjoying cartoons.<br/><br/>""Kid's day in the USA!"" was the motto of the week that was celebrating the 65th birthday of Mickey Mouse, and for a kid who never traveled outside his country, going to Disneyland was the most unexpected destination, the most extraordinary trip I would never have dared to dream of. This is when I discovered ""Aladdin"", through the 'Prince Ali' fanfare endlessly performed during the parades, through the films' images aired on TV; something was strangely attracting me to the film. And I guess the fact that I knew the story helped a lot: I grew up with a French cartoon from 1969, titled 'Aladin and the Magic Lamp' recorded in an 80's videocassette, a movie I can recite (and sing) by heart, and there was also an obscure Manga 'Aladdin' film we watched at school before the summer holidays.<br/><br/>Needless to say I was already familiar with the story, and seeing it translated into Disney language was something I was excited to see. Would they talk about Aladdin's deceased father Mustapha? Would he live with his mother? What kind of roles would Genie play? Well one thing matters apart from these questions: I knew the story and I could understand the film even if I didn't speak English at that time  it wouldn't have helped me anyway because the airport was very noisy, so I just sat on my luggage, eating some candies, and I could understand who was who and what was everyone's scheme: obviously, Aladdin wanted to be a prince to marry the princess and Jafar to marry the princess to become the prince, and between them, the Genie would come to fulfill their dreams. So, I saw the film and I loved it.<br/><br/>And for one year, before I would see it again, the music of 'Pince Ali' and 'A Whole New World' was the musical remembrance of that magical week in Disney World. And when I saw it again, it took another dimension: I finally understood the subtleties of the stories, I learned all the songs after repetitive viewings, and for months and months, I was transported by the 'Prince Ali' parade and its climactic conclusion and the romantic 'A Whole New World' and its beautiful opening, when Jasmine jumps on the carpet and the zoomed-out Rajah looks smaller and smaller, watching from the balcony. I saw the film so many times during my pre-teen years that I would never forget the first sensations it immersed me into, with an unexpected awkward one.<br/><br/>I must confess that Jasmine was one of my first movie crushes and my idea of the ideal woman as a kid, I don't know why but the way she looked during the 'love at first sight moment' hypnotized me and the moment where I always melt occurs in the carpet ride, when Aladdin gives her the apple, when you understand that she understood who the Prince Ali is, there are no words to describe how incredibly sexy she looks at that very moment. The crush didn't last of course, and as I grew older and was disappointed with the 'Return of Jafar' sequel and the TV series, my interest for ""Aladdin"" declined and it was reduced to 'kid's stuff I used to like'.<br/><br/>And then 10 years later, as a student, I saw the film again on my computer, eating a pizza, and something magical happened when the 'Whole New World' music started during the closing credits, my heart was inundated by a nostalgic torrent, so immense that I couldn't stop crying because it reminded me of the privileged place the movie occupied once in my heart. The magic was back, and whenever I was spending a good time with friends, we were having fun listening to these old Disney songs, and the clip of 'A Whole New World' was a must-see  and how glad I was to discover that I wasn't the only one who 'liked' Jasmine.<br/><br/>I feel so concerned by this film and so deeply attached to it, that I don't want to spoil this review with critical or ecstatic reviews, the film is just thrilling, romantic, adventurous, and features certainly the greatest cast of supporting characters without it being the counterpart of a dull hero or heroine, there's not a single minute of the film that seems pointless and wasted and certainly not with a character like Genie. That's the best I could do to rationally 'explain' my love for ""Aladdin"".<br/><br/>But maybe because loving a film can also depend on external factors that influence your judgment, in the case of ""Aladdin"", everything contributed to make this my favorite Disney film ... for sentimental reasons yes, but who ever said they were wrong?"
"taeweth","10","65","77","11 January 2006"," Great movie!
","Simply a classic. The movie Aladdin is hilariously told with many many MANY funny moments. The genie his an all-time high in this classic film about a street rat and a princess. A great movie for young kids, but even adults will love the wonderfully amusing lines throughout the story. <br/><br/>The songs in the movie are well-known and catchy. I even had a guy since one of them to a girl at a school dance! Everyone recognizes them, and it is our duty to make sure the next generations continues to appreciate such a wonderful work of art.<br/><br/>A great movie for the entire family to sit down and watch together, it's good sometimes to take a blast to the past and enjoy some of those good ol' movies."
"ccthemovieman-1","10","50","60","12 January 2007"," Robin Williams, Great Songs Make This One Of The Best Animated Films Ever
","I can think of three quick reasons why this has remained one of the best animated movies ever: 1 - Very good, very catchy songs that still sound good 15 years later; 2 - excellent, colorful visuals; 3 - the unique humor of Robin Williams, who seems to spout a joke-a- second. In fact, you have to pay close attention to hear Williams' lines because they come so fast and furious. Actually, at times they are too fast. You hardly have time to laugh or digest what he just said when another line hits you. Williams' genie character doesn't appear on screen until after the first third of the film is over.<br/><br/>Without all those jokes - and the great visuals that go with those gags (things popping up like Saturday morning cartoons), this would just be a routine Disney animated film. Part of the normal Disney fare includes a hero who is a good guy but a liar and a heroine who is the typical wasp-waisted beauty who is rebellious against the rules of the day. The villain is an ""Oil Can Harry"" mustached dastardly employee of the king who desires king-like powers. His scenes, however, are tempered with humor thanks to his New York City-sounding obnoxious parrot, who provides most of the movie's slapstick humor.<br/><br/>Maybe the best attribute of this film is simply how fast it moves, meaning it's very, very entertaining."
"aesgaard41","10","87","110","5 September 2001"," Vintage Robin Williams
","I did not care to see this movie, but I was such a big Robin Williams that I rented it long after it stopped playing in the theaters. From the first few scenes I was spellbound by the voices and the script.I can still mimmick nearly all of the Genie's themes as well as see myself play Aladdin in a live action version of this movie with Paula Abdul as Jasmine and John De Lancie as Jafar. Jasmine in this movie has the same sexual innocence as Ariel the Little Mermaid and Krysta of Fern Gully. The songs are infectious, especially ""Friend Like Me"" and ""A Whole New World."" The whole movie is one big roller coaster ride augmented by the raucous wit of Robin Williams and his own talent for mimmicry and improvisation. Ten Stars way up!"
"dcldan","8","43","53","15 January 2006"," Fantastic!
","Magic, adventures, laughs, love... This film has everything mixed, and the result is quite good! The film is about the classic tale of ""Aladdin and the magic lamp"", so the story is well known by everybody. Despite it is for children, the quality of the characters is very good, the story, though predictable and typical, results interesting and, which is more important, it males us to spend a good hour and a half. The songs (typical in Disney) never are boring, and are surprisingly well mixed with images. In addition, action scenes are well ended and most characters are very charismatic. Aladdin is sympathetic form the beginning and most secondary characters are simply perfect. The ""acting"" of the Genius is superb in his strangeness and absurd, and Yafar is well remembered as one of the ""best"" bad ones of the history of cinema. It exhales an immense aura of evilness hardly ever seen in a movie... To sum up, one of the best (maybe the best) Disney film made, which everything to have a nice afternoon with your children or just spending a nice time laughing and remembering when you were a child."
"gazzo-2","Null","39","48","16 October 1999"," great fun
","This movie was the biggest film of '92, and it's easy to see why-a lotta fun, as a terrific Robin Williams performance carries it to heights it otherwise would not have gone to. Great animation, fine songs, a decent plot--what is there not to like? I will admit some of the Arab characters seemed to be stereotyped-but no more so than in Mulan or Tarzan or whatever; animation seems to stereotype Everything.<br/><br/>A great movie, ***1/2 outta ****, a fave then and now."
"Atreyu_II","8","12","13","24 July 2007"," A whole new world. A new fantastic point of view...
","The 31st animated Disney classic is one of Disney's best known movies. It also takes us to a whole new world, a new fantastic point of view. This one takes place in Saudi Arabia. I've always liked this movie.<br/><br/>""Aladdin"" is very entertaining and great fun. It is hilarious, creative, imaginative and romantic. It isn't a faultless movie, but it's a little difficult not to like it.<br/><br/>I'll start by talking about the characters. The blue Genie is, without a doubt, the most amusing, hilarious, imaginative and genial Genie ever created. Robin Williams steals the show as the Genie's voice. With his incredible talent to do voices, he's hilariously awesome and fantastic as the Genie's voice (and also as the voice of the enigmatic merchant that appears at the beginning, who happens to be an interesting character).<br/><br/>Iago is the funniest character of this movie, along with the Genie. Nobody better than Gilbert Gottfried to voice the sarcastic parrot. Iago is simply hilarious! He's rude, grumpy, sarcastic, hungry for power, malicious, obnoxious and foul-tempered. He has an irritating voice but in a funny way, as well as a great talent to perfectly mimic other characters's voices. However, deep down inside he has a heart. I also love his hate for crackers. I don't see why does he hates crackers so much, but that also makes him so funny! Besides, a parrot with teeth?? lol!<br/><br/>Jafar is a great villain. Although often calm and humorous (for example, he keeps calling ""Prince Abooboo"" to ""Prince Ali""), he also represents the worst and most ambitious kind of villain and he is one of the most dangerous Disney villains. And he does possess a snake-like tone of voice sometimes.<br/><br/>Princess Jasmine, what can I say? Have you ever seen a more beautiful Disney princess? She's just gorgeous! Despite her strong and challenging personality, I like her anyway.<br/><br/>The Sultan is a funny dude. The Magic Carpet is lovable, one of my favorite characters from the movie. Aladdin himself is a nice guy, poor but kind-hearted (although dishonest, immature and selfish sometimes).<br/><br/>Abu is funny mostly because of his vocal sounds, very Donald Duck-like. The Cave of Wonders is an amazing character. It is a giant tiger's head with an absolutely fantastic and brutal deep-throat voice.<br/><br/>""Aladdin"" is a festival of magic, special effects, bombastic humor and jokes.<br/><br/>By the way, I absolutely love the song ""A Whole New World"". The version sung by Aladdin and Jasmine is great, but the original version of Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle is better, deeper and more romantic and classic. It's a very romantic and joyful song, which is always a pleasure to listen. ""Arabian Nights"" is a nice song as well...<br/><br/>I'd only wish that ""Aladdin"" hadn't become a victim of its own success. It inspired 2 sequels and several stories with these characters.<br/><br/>This should definitely be on Top 250."
"grahamsj3","7","65","86","7 February 2001"," Hilarious
","I think this is one of the funniest films that Disney has ever done. This is due entirely to Robin William's brilliant voice of the Genie. He is wonderful in this role. I think the animation is pretty fair although I dislike the ""generic"" people that Disney's shop is putting out these days. They all share the same basic facial structure and eyes, so there is not much difference between any of the characters. It's not like Sleepy, Doc and Sneezy, who all looked very different. Still, this is a great and funny film. It is totally clean and not very violent so it is appropriate for every member of the family. Give this one a try and you'll have a great time watching it!"
"mig28lx","8","77","117","15 June 2005"," Random Thoughts on ""Aladdin""
","Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin.""<br/><br/>I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion."
"veeleen","10","10","12","18 November 2015"," Aladdin may be the best Disney film of them all
","The film opens with a merchant's tell-tale song, performed by the classic Robin Williams. It begins the (inaccurate, but good) story of a boy named Aladdin, who has the power to open the Cave of Wonders, a place that holds magic and wealth. We don't meet Aladdin yet, as it first introduces us to the villain of the story, the well-written ""Jafar"". Jafar is cunning and witty. He is a classic villain, with a terrifying look and an evil laugh. We are shown Jafar and another man trying to open the Cave of Wonders. Since the other man is not Aladdin, he cannot go into the cave and come out unharmed. Jafar grows angry after learning this fate, and hatches a plan to find Aladdin.<br/><br/>Now, we center on a scraggly boy in a marketplace, stealing bread. There's the beautiful singing of Scott Weinger that immediately grabs your heart. Guards are trying to catch Aladdin for stealing. Through this song, you realize the boy is a poor orphan unable to afford food. He owns a pet monkey named Abu, who has an attitude of his own. Aladdin escapes the guards with an allusion to a magic carpet as his escape method, and lands in an alley, while the guards land in manure.<br/><br/>Now, one may think Aladdin deserves to be caught for stealing. It's at this moment that Aladdin notices two starving children and gives his own bread to them. Abu does the same, with a little persuasion. <br/><br/>I won't give everything away, but what I will say is that this film is something I hold very dear to my heart. Throughout the past 20+ years, it has touched the hearts of many. It's got a great musical score, amazing character development, great voice actresses and actors (including Robin Williams!), and a story that you can't forget. This movie truly is magical."

","Aladdin is a key piece to the comeback of Disney. Before Aladdin, Disney was still struggling after a long period of fail animated block-busters films. The biggest blow to the company, came in 1981's The Fox and the Hound when long-time animator Don Bluth left Disney, taking 11 Disney animators with him. Disney came back with 1989's Little Mermaid and 1991's Beauty and the Beast, but with the success of Aladdin, Disney spark the era known as the Disney Renaissance, that continue until the early 2000's. These film restore public and critical interest back into Disney. Aladdin was a very controversial choice for a kid's movie when it came out. Aladdin is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp. It's still unknown if Aladdin is not actually part or not part of the 1001 Arabian Nights stories. The tale of Aladdin was somewhat violence and had various forms of erotica. The original story had Aladdin, with the help of his magical ring full of Djin, kidnapped Jasmine on her honeymoon. How romantic, a kidnapping movie! Glad, they change the plot somewhat from the original tale. One of the verses of the opening song ""Arabian Nights"" in the film had to be altered following protests from the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) due to its violence lyrics about cutting ears. There is also protest raise by another scene where Aladdin is mistaken by critics due to the line, 'Good Kitty, take off' which the critics thought he was saying 'Good teenagers, take off your clothes'. Because of the controversy, Disney replaced the phrase with ""Down, kitty"" on the DVD release. People have also took noticed with the similarities between Aladdin and Richard Williams's film The Thief and the Cobbler AKA The Princess and the Cobbler (1993). Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler was started much earlier in the 1960s, so they have been dispute who rip off who even up to today. The film story is about Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weigner) a poor but kind-hearted Agrabah thief who finds himself arrested for thievery. Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) promise him a reward in return for retrieving the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, a mysterious magical cave. Jafar tries to betray him for the lamp, and Aladdin find himself trapped in the collapsed cave. In the collapsed cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unexpectedly unleashing Genie (Voiced by Robin Williams), who reveals he will grant Aladdin three wishes. Seeing this as his way out, Aladdin created a new life as Prince Ali to get closer to the princess Jasmine (voice by Linda Larkin). Jafar starts to question Prince Ali believing him as the poor thief that he betrayed and start to make plans to steal the lamp once and for all. The movie has a great message for the children about being yourself and not allow yourself to be imprisoned. Glad they didn't go with the Greed is good message. The animation is great. Even today, I have to say when the Cave of Wonders, Sand Tiger come alive, it brings chills down my neck. The magic carpet ride through the cave was collapsing was intense. I can't help thinking of those scenes, even now. The music to the film is ground breaking good to hear. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice were praised for creating a soundtrack that is amazing. I love 'A Whole New World'. One of the best love songs of the 1990's. It has an amazing melody that complements the scenery very well. I too love how the song speeds up, giving it a very romantic yet magical and adventurous feel to it. The other songs like 'Friends like me', 'Street Rat', 'One Jump Ahead' and 'Prince Ali' also work. I do have to say the 2004, Special Edition released kinda ruin it, by having a new song ""Proud of Your Boy"", performed by Clay Aiken which I thought was mediocre. Now there has been a couple of fan theories that goes with this film, that I like to address like The Merchant is the Genie. Both look very similar, and it seems to make sense because Robin Williams voices both characters. Another variation of this same theory says the man made the whole story up to sell the lamp, so Aladdin wasn't really a true story. The last theory is the most outlandish. Some people think that Aladdin takes place in a Post- Apocalyptic future where technological marvels had been long forgotten and been taking as magic. Some critics even think the Magic Carpet is a time- traveling device. The Genie proves this theory by making impressions of ancient, long-dead celebrities like Groucho Marx, and Jack Nicholson. Still, it can make sense that the Genie is an all-powerful being who can see into the future, so he can make jokes like those, but why would he make jokes that Aladdin wouldn't get. The truth is, Robin Williams was making cultural references jokes to get more people to see the film. Much of Robin Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed and it was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters for animation to work on. It was no surprised that the film has so many in-jokes impersonality as Robin is known for that at the time. This was a new type of Disney humor that wasn't in much kids movies at the time. Disney would later use this type of humor in other animation films like 2001's Emperor New Groove, and 1997's Hercules. In an odd way, Aladdin also take place in the same period as Hercules, so a crossover was used in later projects. Check out, Disney's first direct-to-video sequel, 1994's The Return of Jafar and the TV Show. 1996's Aladdin and the King of Thieves was OK so check it. Overall: Aladdin is a great nostalgia movie that takes us back to when we were kids. Worth watching."

"suspiria10","7","8","12","17 April 2005"," S10 Reviews: Aladdin (1992)
","Disney animation strikes pay dirt again with ""Aladdin"". Aladdin is an orphaned ""street rat"" who, with his cheeky monkey Abu takes what they need to survive the harsh reality of their situation. All with a song in his heart. But Aladdin gets mixed up in a nefarious plot by Jafar (and his hilariously funny foul-mouth parrot Iago) the adviser to the sultan. Like most of the cinematic madmen Jafar has hatched up a glorious scheme to bring the world to its knees but there is a catch. A person pf pure spirit is the only one who can grab a mystical lamp which is the heart of his plan. When things go wrong for Jafar (thanks to that quick monkey) Aladdin discovers the secret of the lamp and the comic hilarity that lay inside. Aladdin gets three wishes from the *ahem* Genie in the bottle (voiced by the perfectly cast Robin Williams) and Al's life will never be the same. Will Aladdin fulfill his deepest desires or will he rescue the princess and take a magic carpet ride into the sunset? ""Aladdin"" is a beautiful melding of computer generated and standard animation that paved the way for Disney's best feature (The Lion King). Wonderfully magical story with some seriously crazy comedians at work, ""Aladdin"" is great fun for the whole family."

","Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion."
"ar-thur","10","5","7","28 September 2006"," Disney's second best
","This one is another example of the Disney guys' ability of traducing even the darkest stories to the screen. Aladdin is originally one of those dark stories with complicated language and plot, but directors Clements and Musker look beyond the obstacle and, once again, produce a great animated movie for children and adults. This film is wonderful. From the beginning, when a mysterious merchant sings one of the greatest ""onde upon a time"" songs ever, passing from the romantic moment, you are so fascinated with colors, camera movements and great voices, you can't take you eyes off of the screen. Incredible characters, a strong villain, good songs and breath-taking soundtrack and scenes, it has everything a Disney classic needs to be great. And this great would not be so great if Robin Williams wasn't the genie. What a talented guy. Jonathan Freeman as Jafar is not far behind, he helps the making of the best Disney villain. The characters animation is soft and beautiful, uninterested, the way the directors like. No matter the climax concludes with a (kind of) inexpressive phrase, it's only a minimum detail, and minimum details is for Kirk Wise and Gary Trousdale (Beauty and the Beast), who seem to only care about that. Clements and Musker are a lot of steps ahead because they are the ones who inherited Walt Disney's magic. Let's hope they stay active for a good time."

The songs are very good and memorable (favorite has to ""Friend Like Me""). Many pop culture references are here and even if you do not notice them, they are made very hilarious by Robin Williams.

","Aladdin is a brilliant movie. Sure, it isn't as good as Beauty and the Beast, but I think it is definitely one of my favourite Disney movies. It is beautifully constructed, with some of the best animation sequences of recent times. The music score is just delightful. How can I ever forget the animated sequence to ""A Whole New World?"" Perfect. Jafar is one of Disney's finest villains, voiced with relish by Jonathan Freeman. Unfortunately, like Shere Kahn, he was another Disney villain that was ruined by a DTV sequel. Aladdin and Jasmine's romance is so believable, and while people have said they are bland, they do appeal to you soon enough. And for me Jasmine along with Esmeralda is one of the sexiest female Disney characters. I actually found it hard to tell what was computer animated, whereas there have been some movies that make a mess of that. I want to guess what is computer animated. The best aspect of this movie, is a hilarious performance from Robin Williams as the Genie If he hadn't ad-libbed so many of his lines, the script could have won an Oscar- that said his genie was a perfect match and fitted with the story very well. Some people say the movie starts off slow. But with the songs and animation, that really isn't an issue. The movie also spawned the best DTV sequel, the King of Thieves. 10/10. Bethany Cox"

"Spleen","8","7","12","30 September 1999"," One of Disney's weaker recent efforts
","`Aladdin' caused a few ripples of shock in animation circles.  It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased.  It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.<br/><br/>I beg to differ.  Warner Brothers cartoons are under-characterised, talky, brash WITHOUT being energetic, and they don't age well.  They fail to be comic despite the fact that every other virtue is sacrificed for comedy's sake.  I wish it to be said that none of this applies to the very fine efforts of Chuck Jones.  SOME of his cartoons are masterpieces.  But some - the Pepe Le Pew series, for example - are dreadful; and what has happened here, I think, is that he has been poisoned by the Warner Brothers style. So too has `Aladdin' been poisoned.  In another decade everyone will have forgotten why Robin Williams was meant to be so funny and we will watch the genie only for Eric Goldberg's animation - which is technically superb, but a bit too literal, and too willing to follow Williams's lead.<br/><br/>There are a couple of other flaws in `Aladdin' that will become more obvious as the years roll.  For one thing, the computer generated images just don't fit the other images.  (The Cave of Wonders is a visual debacle, which is sad, considering how good the rest of the art direction is.)  More importantly, Aladdin isn't an appealing hero.  Get this for shallow: he refuses to free the genie from servitude in order to perpetuate a deceit practised on Jasmine because of a crisis of confidence that, so far as one can tell from the opening song, he doesn't really feel.<br/><br/>Of course we all know the film was a huge success, and it's not hard to see why: it offered the best character animation in the world, expertly staged songs, an uncynical look at an old story - all of the usual things, with a luscious princess thrown in.  Like ALL of Disney's recent animated films it's easy to enjoy.  But consider the other two of these films worked on by the team of Musker and Clements: `The Little Mermaid' and `Hercules'. `Aladdin', as much fun as it is, clearly lacks the heart of the former and the energy and technical brilliance of the latter, without offering a value-for-money trade off.  But don't let this stop you watching it."
"MovieAddict2016","Null","6","10","30 June 2004"," One of my favorite films, and I'm not any sort of Disney enthusiast
","Aladdin the street urchin (voiced by Scott Weinger) finds a magical lamp that unleashes the power of the blue Genie (voiced by Robin Williams) who grants him three wishes. Unfortunately the evil Jafar plans on using the genie to his own will and wreaks havoc on Aladdin's newly-found life (he wishes to become a sultan in the hopes of earning the love of his life, Princess Jasmine).<br/><br/>This is simply a wonderful story with bold animation and a truly terrific vocal performance by Robin Williams. It's the movie's adult humor -- such as the Ah-nuld and Woody Allen impersonations done by Williams -- that make it equally enjoyable for all ages. When this was released in 1992 I was fascinated and used to watch it all the time; now, as an adult, I still enjoy the film for many different reasons, while still managing to appreciate the utter joy of the story.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a bit politically correct with Princess Jasmine's strong will against her father and the representation of certain ""careful stereotypes"" (Disney is careful not to come across as racist and in the process cast Americans to do the voices!) but I like it this way. Without Williams the film would be a total bore, to be honest. With him, it's one of the greatest films ever made, which is something I thought I'd never write.<br/><br/>5/5"
"bblack1-699-968577","7","4","6","15 June 2014"," The Clements/Musker Team
","""Aladdin"" is brought to us by the same team who made ""The Little Mermaid."" So, of course, this movie leaves me a little baffled. There are some things I like and some things I don't.<br/><br/>ANIMATION: The best thing about the animation is the color of the look of Arabia. I didn't see this movie until last December; before I saw it, I heard about how great the colors and the lights were. Everything pops, it's bright, and it's great.<br/><br/>SONGS/MUSIC: Sadly, this was the last Disney film to have Howard Ashman's work in it; he passed away before ""Beauty and the Beast"" was completed. Fortunately, he left us some really good songs in this movie, along with Alan Menken and Tim Rice. Not every song in this film is memorable, but they almost are. Of course everyone knows and loves ""A Whole New World,"" which both does sound nice and contributes greatly to the movie; we really see our main characters fall in love. My favorite song is ""Friend Like Me."" Not only are the lyrics, music, and animation great, but Robin Williams gets just as animated as the animation.<br/><br/>ROMANCE: I mentioned our main characters' romance a bit earlier, and, again, you believe they're in love. Though, have you noticed this is the same romance we had in ""The Little Mermaid?"" The protagonist sees their romantic interest and falls in love. They save their life and admires them, but the two of them are kept apart for some reason. Then our protagonist has to take on a new form/identity to get their romantic interest to fall in love with them, the villain eventually tests their relationship, but they wind up being together again in the end...Huh. I don't see the downside in disliking their relationship, though. It still seems genuine. At least Aladdin has more time with Jasmine before he becomes a prince than Ariel did with Eric before she became human.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS: Most of the characters are OK. Aladdin, Jasmine, and the Sultan are OK. Iago and the Magic Carpet are a little annoying, but they're not that bad. In my opinion, the Genie - again, voiced by Robin Williams - is the best character! When I was watching this last December I said to myself, ""This film is OK, but why was it a hit during the Disney Renaissance?"" Then the Genie came on the screen. He is the most entertaining thing in this movie! Robin Williams puts so much energy and passion in playing this role. I like that the Genie isn't just a funny, pop-culture referencing character; he actually has development to him. That makes him both likable and relatable. I don't like Abu, I think he's too annoying and too selfish. The character I can't figure out is the villain, Jafar. People have said he's one of the greatest Disney villains...Really? I'm glad you see that, but I don't. To me, he's not consistent. Based on what I saw of Jafar in the beginning of the movie, I didn't expect him to be the type who would dress as a crazy old man or have witty remarks with a parrot. That's not to say that Jafar can't be funny, but did you really think the guy we saw in the beginning of the movie would speak as he did throughout the movie? Not only that, but his power is weak! Did you notice the Sultan did not fall under Jafar's spell when he tried to hypnotize him before the ""Prince Ali"" number? Why? What made him come out the spell so easily? He did it TWICE! Jafar's victims can decide when they'll be hypnotize? And why is his evilness so obvious, yet so hidden from everyone else? Out of all the times he's hypnotized the Sultan, NO ONE NOTICED?! Aladdin realized something was wrong the first time he saw it happen - no one else in the palace ever saw it?!<br/><br/>STORY: The story is OK, I guess. One thing bothered me, though: in the beginning, Jasmine tells the Sultan she doesn't want to be forced to be married, she wants to marry for love (Blah, blah, blah, we've heard it before). At the end of the movie when Aladdin and Jasmine come together, the Sultan decides to let them marry. ""Am I Sultan, or am I Sultan,"" he asks. ""From this day forth, the Princess will marry whomever she deems worthy."" WHY IN THE CRUD DIDN'T HE DO THAT BEFORE!??! He could have stopped this whole thing from happening...MUCH LIKE ARIEL IN ""The Little Mermaid!!!"" Gosh! What's up with the Clements/Musker team?<br/><br/>CONCLUSION: I couldn't go into too much detail, but you get the gist of it. There are some things I really like, some things I'm indifferent to, and some things I don't like. Overall, I still like this movie, though. I surprisingly find myself attracted to how entertaining this movie is, even the weird Jafar moments. I like it, and hopefully you will too. BOOYIKA!"

","This, to my mind, is a terrific concoction. <br/><br/>It has no story to speak of. Oh, there's some motion and noise but they are only there to give us something to look at while the three main notions, all of which are magically competent.<br/><br/>There are the songs. Disney can do this extremely well. At least they can recognize strong talent, manage and exploit it well. These songs by themselves carry the whole thing. This is not a cinematic experience, it is a musical one. You could enjoy this as well and perhaps even better by just listening.<br/><br/>The second component is Robin Williams. There seem to be parallel contradictory histories about whether he was extemporizing or not. It hardly matters. He has narrative energy that at the time was unmatched. It's faded now.<br/><br/>And the third thing? Well, this third thing has increased tremendously since 9-11. I saw this with ""Man on Wire.""<br/><br/>Disney is the absolute expert at character design, so long as the characters are women. For some reason, male characters are not as rich and mineable. This project was the result of them building a map of female characteristics and structuring projects around them. Why this is so novel is that it is likely the last American film to have an Arab beauty in my lifetime. Now that Arabs are politically demonized by the bushies, it becomes impossible to treat these women as human and therefore appealing.<br/><br/>Here we have a snapshot from the era before that became impossible. Of course, at the time it was essentially and insulting stereotype: exotic, superflat belly dancer tummy and ""orientally"" kinetic real end. There actually was at the time a Disney real end specialist. I met her.<br/><br/>Now this is translated into forbidden fantasyland.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","If you have any tolerance at all for these animated Disney musicals, this one is sure to be a hit. The plot is good, develops throughout, and manages to be accessible to kids, whilst not talking down to adults. The humor has moments for both groups, as well, entertaining those with two digits in their age with pop culture references and clever comedy. The characters are well-done, interesting and credible. The voice-work is quite good. None of the actors really do badly. Jafar comes across as smart and menacing. Gilbert Gottfried portrays his part well, and his voice works rather well for Iago. Robin Williams... he's great. Some of the best material in the film is his, and he delivers it impeccably. Beyond reproach. Unless you can't stand him and his act, he's sure to get you laughing. The songs are good, well-performed, meaningful and more often than not, catchy. The pacing is spot-on, throughout. The color scheme is full and the animation, with its mix of 2D and 3D, is a pure joy to behold. The energy, creativity and, yes, even emotion, is impressive. The DVD offers, among other things, two commentary tracks(one for directors/producers and one for animators), and a pop-up trivia track, all of which are worth watching for those interested in such things. I recommend this to any fan of the actors and/or Disney animated features. 8/10"
"OllieSuave-007","5","9","20","30 October 2013"," Not very timeless.
","I believe this is the first of the more recent full-length animated feature films to lose the ""Disney touch."" For some good points first, the animation is great and story had potential, about a poor street urchin named Aladdin who meets a princess in disguise, the palace-fatigued Jasmine, on the streets. They fell in love with each other afterward, but the only problem is that Princess Jasmine can only marry a prince according to palace standards. Thrown in the mix is the evil vizier Jafar, who wants to control the land, and the slapstick Genie of the Lamp. And, the music is great - ""A Whole New World"" is breathtaking and ""One Jump Ahead"" is very catchy.<br/><br/>However, I do not believe the screenplay/story is very captivating, lacking the charm and uniqueness that was found in previous films like ""Beauty and the Beast"" and ""The Little Mermaid."" The movie was told in a way that resembles a teenage-bop love story. Some of the characters, particularly that of the Genie, was very over-the-top. Robin Williams did a very overzealous voice acting job for the character and he seemed too comedic and nonsensical. He made too many modern-day references, considering this movie is supposed to be set in ancient times. And, the character of Aladdin took on too much of a ""surfer dude"" personality - not very genuine.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll admit I'm probably in the minority, at least on IMDb, for negatively critiquing this movie. But, ""Aladdin"" ranks as one of my least favorite movies from Disney.<br/><br/>Grade D+"
"San Franciscan","Null","7","15","8 June 2003"," Umm... no, thank you.
","This movie was being hyped up the wazoo in all the newspapers in its day by critics all proclaiming that it deserved to do better than BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Why they all thought that, I honestly had (and still have) no idea.<br/><br/>I wanted to enjoy this movie. I really did. But when it came out in theatres, I found it only merely passable as ""Saturday morning cartoon"" entertainment and haven't been able to enjoy it since.<br/><br/>After doing such huge leaps of art and faith which finally reached a powerful zenith with BEAST, which deserved to win Best Picture that year and was every bit as deserving of all its praise... what does The New Disney do next? An ""over the top"" cartoony film, a movie given over almost entirely to Robin Williams, and also... in all honesty... the beginning of the end.<br/><br/>
I had at first thought that this movie would be a brief ""detour"" for the studio in terms of comedic and artistic style, but everything in this movie has been rehashed by Disney so many times in an attempt to copy its success to the point of on-the-nose-predictable formula that it's safe to say ALADDIN completely destroyed the Disney tradition of lyrically beautiful animated films from the mouse house for good. We would never get another BEAUTY AND THE BEAST ever again.<br/><br/>Want to feel alone in the world? Try saying you are unimpressed with ALADDIN. Try saying you don't like its songs. Try saying you think its animation looks cheap and unappealing. Try pointing out that there's no point to the nararrator at the film's beginning if he's never brought back to wrap things up. And, the biggest offense of all, try saying that you were un-wowed by Robin Williams' performance here despite the fact that you had usually enjoyed his work up to this point.<br/><br/>I didn't care for all of Genie's modern-day references in a story that I had loved dearly as a child. I didn't like the self-conscious humour of everything else in it, either. And I also didn't like the sloppy inconsistencies in the art direction regarding the character designs.<br/><br/>Now to be fair, maybe my disappointment had to do with the fact that The Denver Post's reviewer actually gave away the entire dramatic climactic surprise of this movie with the phrase ""My favourite part is..."" (I later wrote in a complaint to him at the paper saying, ""Thanks a heap for giving away the whole surprise ending in one sentence""). That might have taken all the tension out of the finale and such for me. That may be, but, given my reaction to the rest of the movie as a whole, I doubt it.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, don't mean to step on anyone's toes, but I honestly just don't care for it that much."

The characterisations of Jafar and the Sultan from The Thief Of Bagdad are perfect, while Gilbert Gottfried also has a tour de force performance as the voice for Iago the brash parrot. There's the occasional dark moment which may scare the very young and me but it all adds up to a wonderful family film for children of all ages from 2 to 102.

","There was a period during the early 90's where it appeared that Disney could do no wrong. Many of Disney's modern classics such as The Lion King and Beauty And The Beast were released during this period, and Aladdin can stand proudly alongside those two masterpieces. <br/><br/>The main reason for this is Robin Williams' outstanding turn as the genie, which must surely rank as one of the best voice-over performances ever. Williams' genie steals every single scene he is in, thanks to the boundless energy and enthusiasm he brings, and he is big reason why adults will enjoy the movie just as much as their children. Apparently, Williams improvised a huge amount of the material and it is obvious from the moment Aladdin meets the big blue guy that we are in for something special. The nature of the character allows Williams to play around with impersonations, voices and in one or two scenes, some real emotional depth as well. <br/><br/>He is undoubtedly the star of the show but that's not to say that the genie is the only good thing about Aladdin; the animation is fantastic, with one scene in which Aladdin must escape from a crumbling cave on his magic carpet being a particular highlight. We also have, in Jafar, one of Disney's most despicable and diabolical villains and many of the songs will have you tapping your feet and humming along. Like most of Disney's animated fare, the story is pretty straightforward and involves Aladdin trying to rescue his beloved Princess Jasmine from the evil clutches of Jafar, with the genie being his ace in the hole. It serves its purpose and manages to throw a few surprises in along the way, but the main attraction here is the genie, and he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>One of Disney's, and Williams', finest hours. Aladdin is a masterpiece of animation that you will enjoy again and again."

Emerging with the many other well-done Disney films of the 90's, ""Aladdin"" stands out as my personal favorite because it has literally everything I look for in a good Disney movie: a good story, a likable male lead, a beautiful and equally likable female lead, a hilarious comic relief character, a memorable and intimidating villain and, of course, numerous catchy songs. ""Aladdin"" has all of these. <br/><br/>For those of you who, somehow, don't know the story, this movie centers around a young man named Aladdin. Aladdin is a homeless thief living in the fictional Arabian city of Agrabah and is constantly ducking the guards. One day, he comes across the beautiful princess of Agrabah, Jasmine, who has fled the palace because she is tired of never having any freedom. The two meet and instantly begin to hit it off, but shortly after, Aladdin is captured by the town guard. <br/><br/>Whilst in the dungeon, Aladdin is greeted by Jafar, the royal adviser and secretly an evil sorcerer. Jafar tricks Aladdin into going into the mystic Cave of Wonders to retrieve a magical lamp, but Aladdin's monkey friend, Abu, attempts to steal a giant ruby, causing the sentient cave to become angry and collapse. While trapped in the cave, Aladdin discovers that the lamp contains a magical genie that will grant him three wishes. Aladdin uses the wishes to try to win the princess's heart and prevent the evil Jafar from gaining ultimate power. <br/><br/>What really can I say about this movie? It's just a blast to watch. The songs are all catchy and will get stuck in your head, the characters are all lovable and not at all annoying, the story is engaging and coherent, the action sequences work, and the Genie, played by the late Robin Williams, is absolutely hilarious! I'll be honest with you, I can't find any downside to this movie, to do so would require some major head-scratching and nitpicking. If you haven't seen ""Aladdin"" yet, you definitely should, it's one of Disney's best."

Whether it's his monologue when Aladdin first releases him, his Jack Nicholson imitation, or anything else, you're in for something hilarious.

Unfortunately, when Jasmine does fall in love with Aladdin he discovers he could become the next Sultan, this means Aladdin will not be able to use his final wish to free Genie. Robin Williams (who won a Special Award at the Golden Globes for his vocal work) as the Genie is just pure genius, he does all the best impressions, e.g. Jack Nicholson. The family will love this film. Two sequels followed, The Return of Jafar and King of Thieves, and a TV series.

","""Aladdin"" . . . not only the best movie in the exalted Renaissance period, but also -- along with ""The Jungle Book"" -- Disney's best musical. Seriously, this soundtrack is chock-full of earworms and none of them are filler.<br/><br/>Everyone knows what this movie's best feature is (and I'll get to that in a second), but the level of quality in its animation is staggering. The color saturation is purely eye-candy, and it makes Agrabah a memorable Disney kingdom. Even the characters (some of the whitest Arabs ever put to film) have personality in their movements that you just don't expect.<br/><br/>These assets by themselves make this a worthwhile movie, but it's Robin Williams who blasts it out of the park. His overstimulated execution leaves an indelible mark on this company's history, and the lion's share of laughs come directly from him. It's a gifted, delightful and energetic performance, and it's easy to lay the movie's vast appeal at his feet.<br/><br/>But honestly, the whole thing is wildly entertaining."

","One of my favorite Disney Classics, I remember as a child this was the movie that made me truly love Robin Williams, his portrayal of the Genie was hilarious. The movie has a great message and I remember as a kid not really understanding it completely, but as an adult, I truly appreciate that I was being bombarded with messages like the one this one presents. Also, Jafar is an extremely intimidating antagonist and the character is done to perfection, especially the whole snake sequence...still gives me the creeps.<br/><br/>Love this movie and will definitely watch it again."

","Maybe it's just because I have a serious case of ADHD, but I LOVE this movie. I love everything it has in it. I love the animation. I love Jafar's slimy personality. I love how annoying Gilbert Goddfried was as Iago. I love the chemistry between Princess Jasmine and Aladdin. I love how much personality Frank Welker brought to Abu with zero dialog. And I absolutely LOVE Robin Williams as the Genie. I think he's the best celebrity casting choice since they got Vincent Price to play Ratigan in The Great Mouse Detective (great movie, by the way).<br/><br/>The story isn't that original, but let's face it, no one watched Aladdin for the story. They watched it for all that stuff I mentioned. And even though they added a lot of pop cultural references to the Genie's dialog that are a bit dated, you really don't need to know what they're referencing to enjoy the character. The Rocky Balboa reference in ""Friend Like Me"" doesn't detract from the song, neither does Williams' impersonation of Jack Nicholson when he's trying to talk Aladdin into telling Jasmine the truth about himself. They're just there long enough so that if you get them, you will, and if you don't get them, you won't mind, because the Genie's just such an enjoyable character.<br/><br/>Give this film a watch if you haven't already. It's easily one of the most entertaining Disney's ever done."

","Aladdin, a street urchin, accidentally meets Princess Jasmine, who is in the city undercover. They quickly grow to love each other (as happens in movies), but she can only marry a prince.<br/><br/>Disney's second golden years were 1989-1992, which were unfortunately quite brief. Of course they had hits before that and after that, but for these few years every film was an instant classic. ""Aladdin"", with its excellent music and the inclusion of Robin Williams, just hit home so hard (and spawned multiple sequels and a television show).<br/><br/>How do you critique a film that everyone loves? You simply do not. I guess if I was forced to say anything negative, it would be that Aladdin and Jasmine look a tad too similar and some think they are siblings separated at birth -- and that would not be right. When Aladdin tells a guard that Jasmine is his sister, it seems plausible!<br/><br/>One thing about the film is how it has aged in a way that was unexpected. In 1992, terrorism was not what it is today (2016). Although the film is innocent and there is really nothing offensive about it, one wonders if Disney could have made a film about the Middle East with characters who praise Allah in today's climate."
"khanbaliq2","8","2","3","26 April 2012"," A rollicking, bodaciously choreographed fantasy.
","The film is floridly beautiful, shamelessly derivative and infused with an irreverent, sophisticated comic flair. A street urchin (Scott Weinger) discovers a magic lamp which allows him to win the favour of a princess (Linda Larkin).<br/><br/>Aladdin is a splendidly spry and enjoyable romp, a return to near-peak form for Disney which lets loose Robin Williams's improvisatory flair in the role of the Genie, while showing off some great animation. But it's a shame about the songs. The film was followed by two sequels released direct to video: The Return Of Jafar (1994) and Aladdin And The King Of Thieves (1996)."
"Lejink","8","2","3","26 December 2011"," How the genie got out the bottle...
","A great typical family-oriented Disney feature gets a lift by giving Robin Williams pretty much the run of the place as a genie with a) an attitude and b) a gift for improv. So you get all the expected heart-warming romantic stuff and exciting chases and surprising intrigues but with that soupçon of the unexpected and, deal with it, belly laughs to boot. At a stroke, it broke the mould for countless Disney / Pixar films to come which appealed as much to kids as to adults, by catering to the would-be adults in all the kids and of course the universal kids in all the adults. If I was being critical, perhaps the background-settings could have wowed me a bit more, especially with the fabulous source-material and the vocal characterisation of the evil Jafar a bit more strongly delineated bu I'm probably nit-picking. As someone whose first book was the ""Arabian Nights"" at age 5, and whose only experience of the Aladdin story since has been mostly in local pantomimes down the years, it was great to see Disney's modern but traditional take on the story. The songs are good too, skilfully worded and not over-populous. Interesting to conjecture about the fact that this Hollywood production from 1992 was made at the time of the U.S. involvement in the first Gulf War plus I like the way it, if gently, challenges the notion of female roles in Arabian society, sadly still a topical subject almost 20 years on. Very funny, mildly subversive entertainment you can take your kids to - now that is a rarity in modern cinema."

This film has all the heart and humour that a Disney film should have with a great voice cast making the story come alive. There are jokes for all the family and the story can be enjoyed by everyone. The songs are mostly timeless and the film is as beloved today as it was when it was first released.<br/><br/>Robin Williams as the genie steals the whole film and is as funny as Williams has been in any live action film past or present.

","In this Disney family animation, street thief Aladdin runs into the princess and falls in love with her, but she can only marry a prince.<br/><br/>It has been some years since we have seen a classic 2D animation as we enter a stage in film where everything is about visual effects rather than the narrative, and thankfully we have these wonderful films to look back on with a good solid plot, which is funny, strong and consistent throughout, and which is proper entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>With brilliant characters with their own issues on their shoulders does the film achieve depth and variety for viewers, such as Aladdin wishing for more, Jafar wishing for power and Jasmine wishing for love. And its through these goals does the film become inspirational and enjoyable, and the one character who breaks all the boundaries is the genie.<br/><br/>Robin Williams (Good Will Hunting) is the only person who could have made the genie what he is with a simply outrageous performance as the blue hero, with great magic, catchphrases and sing a longs. Easily the funniest character in Disney history in my personal opinion, the Genie has great charisma in helping others with his own personal life a sweet and soft moment for the film.<br/><br/>There have been numerous times when I have watched this film and not noticed something different and it somehow seems to get better with every watch.<br/><br/>Though does run on a few clichés there is no question that it does so in a very sophisticated and sentimental way which makes it feel more real and believable.<br/><br/>The situations used and the ideology of good vs evil make the plot intense and exciting throughout. The use of magic was a very powerful device and makes the story even more special and brilliant.<br/><br/>The film also has a terrific Oscar winning music score, which includes the outstanding song ""A whole new world"" which is possibly one of the best used songs in animation history.<br/><br/>With a magical tale, great characters and a beautiful music score, Aladdin is a fantastic family animation and one of Disney's best."

","In a far off city called Agrabah there lives a young thief named Aladdin who wants people to respect him for who he is. But when he meets the princess Jasmine, his life is turned upside down. Jasmine is tired of people telling her how to live her life, and her father the Sultan wants her to choose a bride by her birthday, which only gives her 3 more days. Jafar, the Royal Vizer to the Sultan, wants to overthrow the Sultan and rule over Agrabah himself. So, disguised as a beggar, he asks Aladdin to go into the Cave of Wonders and retrieve a magic lamp. Aladdin winds up with the lamp instead, and unleashes a magic Genie, who grants him 3 wishes. This gives Aladdin the chance to win Jasmine's heart. Jafar is angered, and tries to stop Aladdin. But, Aladdin wins, and marries Jasmine.<br/><br/>When Disney struck gold with their excellent BEAUTY AND THE BEAST, they tackled the classic Arabian Nights story and wound up with another winner, which was a box office hit, and 2 Academy Awards (Best Score and Best Song for ""A Whole New World""). The voices are excellent, with Scott Weinger (TV's ""Full House"") as Aladdin, Robin Williams as the hilarious Genie, and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago, Jafar's pet parrot (also hilarious). The backgrounds are well-rendered, and the songs by Howard Ashman, Alan Menken, and Tim Rice are some of the best songs in a Disney film ever. Followed by two direct-to-video sequels and a TV series. Recommended. 10/10."

","Aladdin is a superb Disney movie. I found the story to be interesting, if somewhat hectic at times. The characters had personality, they were funny, they had CHARACTER. Robin Williams does an amazing job as Genie. The music is my favorite part of the movie, though. When I heard ""One Jump Ahead"", I loved it. When I heard ""Prince Ali"", I loved it. And then when ""A Whole New World"" came along, I was like, ""oh my god"". It is an amazing song. If I were to knock any points off it would be for the animation, which doesn't seem on par with Disney quality at times. But other than that, this is one of the best Disney movies ever released. It is much better than any of the new stuff Disney is releasing (Brother Bear, Home on the Range), and I would say it is even with Beauty and the Beast and Hercules. So overall, I would give Aladdin 9/10."

The story is good, Robin Williams is outstanding, Pixar blew me away with the back drop, and the supporting cast Disney until after this movie was famous for rocked. Abu and carpet were predictably better written for than the main cast, and Gilbert was made to play Iago. The movies only downfall that I can think of was its love song - the typical Disneyesque cheese "" A Whole new World"". It takes a bottle of Drano and a toilet brush to get that song out of your head. A true animated classic to show your kids and grandkids. Too bad Disney thought 3 outstanding movies (Mermaid, Beauty and Beast, and Aladdin) were enough and started dealing out the slop it is known for today (at least until Pizar came along and stole the show)."

","This is a typical Disney treatment of an old story, contemporized for the 90's with dozens of pop references and sensibilities.<br/><br/>The voice actors do a wonderful job creating believable characters with one exception. While Gilbert Gottfried as Iago may irritate some, at least he is in character as a schemer. On the other hand, Robin Williams as the Genie is like getting a filling at the dentist without Novocaine. His vaunted ""stream of consciousness"" improvisational skills never click (if they ever did), and it detracts from the period of the story.<br/><br/>The songs are wonderful, and in this even Williams' showcases aren't too bad.

"patrick_dunne","7","2","3","20 October 2005"," Aladdin is a fine children's cartoon.
","Aladdin is one of the many Disney Classics. Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.<br/><br/>One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.<br/><br/>Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a ""street rat"" named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline. <br/><br/>However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?<br/><br/>Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.) See it.<br/><br/>6.5/10<br/><br/>Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment."

It's something Aladdin fans can be proud about.<br/><br/>Everyone talks about these movie trilogies, but the one we often forget about is the Aladdin one, which is also very underrated. Each of the Aladdin movies, including the original one, are successful movies, and probably the best Disney movie trilogy going around.

","This classic Disney film is centred on the eponymous Aladdin, a street urchin in the city of Agrabah. Here he survives by stealing food, along with his monkey, Abu. His life is about to change because of two people from the palace. One is Jafar, the scheming Royal Vizier, who needs a 'diamond in the rough' to retrieve a magical lamp from the 'Cave of Wonders'. The other is Princess Jasmine who must marry in three days but hasn't found a suitable princely suitor. Fed up with the restrictive life in the palace she dresses in peasant clothes and goes into the city, where she meets Aladdin. Events lead to him being captured and forced to enter the Cave of Wonders; here he finds the lamp and releases the genie inside... it offers him three wishes. There are a few catches so Aladdin must use the wishes wisely... he must also avoid Jafar who wants the genie's power.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this Disney animation. The story provides a fine mix of thrills, romance, comedy and solid songs. Aladdin himself is a likeable male lead and Jasmine is a good female lead. Jafar is a great villain, menacing without being too scary for younger viewers. However it is the genie, voiced by the Robin Williams on great form, who steals the show whenever he is on screen. As one would expect the animation is of a high quality; with 2D characters impressively immersed in 3D scenes. The songs are so good you'll likely find yourself humming them afterwards. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of quality animation."

I don't remember any story or scenes but the only thing I remembered was that I thoroughly enjoyed it. Years later, when I was watching TV I was checking the info of coming programmes in a movie channel and I saw there was Aladdin so I thought to check it out that time though I never had any idea of the 1992 film. And when I started watching I got surprised to see those same cartoon characters I saw in my childhood. Looked like my childhood came back.
The biggest plus point of Aladdin is its mesmerizing and fascinating hand drawn animation which transports you to another world. The next plus point is its humor and light hearted treatment. All the characters shown in this film I love a lot. Charming Aladdin, stunning Jasmine, cute like a Teddy bear Abubu, cunning Jafar and his idiotic sidekick iago, greedy but lovable Abu, helpful magic carpet and the wholesome entertainer Genie(thanks to the super energetic Robin Williams). Last but not the least to mention is the songs which goes well with the narrative. I love all the songs especially Arabian nights, friend like me, Prince Ali and whole new world.

I was overwhelmed from the first second by the world of the colors of the music
Usually I skip the songs in Disney movies because you just do not need them to understand the movie here I wanted to hear the music and here you really miss something if you should skip the music. There is a song that I have not listened to either in the movie nor in any other way because I just do not want to hear now but I could listen to Robin Williams as the genius for days.
May the man rest in peace he was definitely a legend who left us something big, but even so, it is a unique film with a unique display of unique animation and unique everything<br/><br/>One thing I can not get over today is that Aladdin might have had a wish or that some of Jafar's stuff is not cleared up but every time I see the movie I do not care because I just want to be kidnapped by this world because it feels so good and looks so good.<br/><br/>Of course, many things have changed but this is a movie you have to change some things because the same things do not work in different media and of course the movie is more based on the indian rather than the arabic culture but this is a fairy tale and no docu anyone who can Coin takes anyway is too stupid to enjoy movies decently.<br/><br/>Some of my story problems are changed and clarified in the play, but we're talking about the film here and rate the movie as a whole

","Aladdin, a small thief from Agrabah, happens to stumble upon a charming young woman in the marketplace with whom he seems to fall deeply in love. Fooled by an old man, Aladdin gets his hands on a magical lamp which contains a magical genie who can grant any three wishes to his master. Thus, he will have to use all the help he can get to win his beloved's heart, especially from his new blue friend.<br/><br/>This classic Disney movie presents the life of a young man who struggles with poverty but is determined to do whatever it takes to improve his situation and ultimately be with the one he loves, although she seems out of his league. It's a magical story which presents the main protagonist's struggle, his way of making hard decisions and his fight with a new enemy gained along the way. It's ok for the most part, but unfortunately, it isn't spectacular either. It is rather predictable and although it has one or two twists up its sleeve, it isn't able to maintain a high standard throughout. It even tends to be superficial in some aspects, especially regarding solving the main problems, but as it is targeted towards kids, I guess it's ok as it is.<br/><br/>Its characters are quite stereotypical (the good guy, the evil one, the princess and so on) but manage to provide a good time, especially through the genie which as far as I'm concerned, represents the core of the movie. He's the one which brings colour into the picture, who makes you laugh out loud many times and puts a smile on your face with every apparition. Robin Williams has done a truly impressive job voice acting this character, making it one of a kind. I should also mention Abu, Aladdin's trusty monkey which is always there when he needs assistance. It's also very charismatic and even cute, sending plenty of emotion towards the viewer.<br/><br/>In terms of entertainment, the movie has plenty to offer. You get many action sequences in which Aladdin proves his abilities, you get a lot of musical moments which are always welcome and you even get plenty of jokes, especially with the genie around. The visual part is also a big plus, looking very good even today, judging by the fact that it has over twenty years and counting.<br/><br/>To sum things up, it's a classic story which almost every kid knows, which brings plenty of good time with everything it does, even after seeing it multiple times, but if you ask me, it could have done a bit more in terms of story. Nevertheless, it's a very good animation which made a great impact when it first came so its merits will always be appreciated."

","No question Robin Williams delivers in a trademark role here as the wise cracking, ad-libbing Blue Genie, but I also got a kick out of Gilbert Gottfried's voice work for Iago the Parrot. And that's saying something, because otherwise, in a take it or leave it situation with Gottfried, I'd always leave it. The story is classic Disney, colorful and song filled, with an interesting balance of villains and heroes. The back and forth with the magic lamp gets a little played out after a while, but I thought the ending had an ironic twist with Sorceror Jafar (Jonathan Freeman) wishing to be the most powerful genie in the world. In effect, he got double whammied by the law of unintended consequences and a severe lesson in 'be careful what you wish for'."

","Aladdin is about a young Middle Eastern homeless guy living on the dusty streets of Agrabah. Aladdin, the main character, owns a monkey named Abu. Early in the movie, he, by chance, ends up meeting the princess, Jasmine, who is in disguise because she wants to get out of the palace where she lives and experience life on the outside in the real world. She doesn't like it in the palace because it is confining and she is not able to make her own choices. For example, she must find a husband by her next birthday per the local law. While they are hanging out, Aladdin is arrested for stealing bread from earlier. He is taken to the dungeon. Her pleas to let him go fall on empty ears because the palace guards are under the orders of Jafar, an evil sorcerer who works for the King, Jasmine's father. They do not disclose to him or to her whether they are there specifically to arrest him. Later, while Aladdin is in shackles, Jafar sneaks into his cell disguised as an old peasant donning a gold tooth and hobbling around on a wooden cane that looks like a giant corkscrew. In exchange for Aladdin's assistance in finding treasure, this magic lamp, Jafar says that he will help Aladdin escape. He begrudgingly agrees. What else is he supposed to do?! Aladdin goes with the disguised Jafar to Cave of Wonders where, inside, he finds the lamp. Find out what Aladdin does with his 3 wishes and how he tries to win over the princess's heart."

","This is part of the Disney winning streak of wonderful animated films. It is the familiar story of the young boy who finds a magic lamp that allows him to converse with a genie. What an amazing choice for the genie as Robin Williams struts his stuff. The genie is the star of this show, but a good villain is also thrown in there. As they battle Jaffar, Aladdin is forced to use all his resources to become what he was intended to be. He must somehow become worthy to marry the princess. He is seen as a poser because of his humble upbringing. He woos her with the song ""A Whole New World,"" which is an apt title for what he has to offer. The best animated features have an edge to them, and this is no exception. The animation is fabulous and the story is well conceived."

","This is one of the films that I have liked since I was a child. Recently, I watched the play ""Aladdin"" by Shiki Theatre Company. I like it so much. Aladdin is a poor but honest man. Jasmine is the princess of the country. There is the difference of rank between them, but Aladdin gets the magic lamp and his life changes. With Genie's help, he tries to be a man meets Princess Jasmine. It looks just like a story of love and magic, but I think the backgrounds that the main characters have are remarkable points. Aladdin, Jasmine and Genie are very different, but they have one thing in common. It is the desire for freedom. Aladdin wants to stop his poor life. Jasmine is tired of the castle life and hopes to see the wide world. Genie wants to be free and not to be follow his master anymore. They have the impossible desire, but I think this common point is the key of the story that makes them close and makes their impossible possible."
"datautisticgamer-74853","9","1","1","3 May 2016"," Peace be with me for always enjoying this film
","My grandparents have had, for a very long time, the Classics VHS release on hand at their house alongside Snow White, The Jungle Book, and The Fox and the Hound, and when I was a toddler, I remember seeing each of them and having the most memories of watching Aladdin. Even today, I still laugh at the jokes (some of them are a little puerile, but they don't rely excessively on them, unlike The Emperor's New Groove, and plenty of them actually triggered me to chuckle), immerse myself in the songs and beautiful animation, and with all of that, I know I will eventually see it again. My one complaint would have to be that while the songs are among the best you will find in a 1992 movie, you may have to watch the film or clips of it constantly in order to make the songs memorable, because even though I last watched this before I even considered becoming an IMDb reviewer, I still couldn't remember some of the lyrics to top-notch songs like A Whole New World. That doesn't change the fact, though, that this movie is a must-watch for anyone who appreciates Disney, musicals, early 1990's films, or films set in the Middle East (I heard that Persia is the specific setting for this film, but I am not an analyst in that regard. I analyze like any typical IMDb critic.)"
"C22Man","8","1","1","15 October 2015"," Las Agrabah
","With Beauty and the Beast receiving a best picture Oscar nomination, Disney's appeal was at a high and they were eager to build on their acclaim. Aladdin was the perfect film for this and took a very different approach for the studio, but they didn't forget what had made the previous few films so successful. It took an old-fashioned, solidly set-up story and gave it a much more modern feel with broader humour. You'd think that this would clash, yet it works brilliantly and gives the film a unique edge. It's a fine balancing act and I'm not sure many other Disney films could have carried it off, but this is one where nearly everything tried works no matter how madcap it may be. <br/><br/>The film focuses on street urchin Aladdin and the princess Jasmine, both being fed-up with their lives and wishing for something else. After a chance meeting with the princess, Aladdin is roped into finding a lamp for sorcerer Jafar only to keep it and unleash a Genie that gives him three wishes which he uses to try to win over Jasmine. At its core it's a story about two people wanting different things and connecting because of that, just with a lot of comedy and many obstacles put in their way. It's nothing complicated, yet it's a storyline that people can easily get behind and they want to see the arc that both people go through. The romance takes up most of it, but enough time is given to develop Jafar and even the Genie's own dilemma.<br/><br/>Aladdin and Jasmine aren't the most interesting characters, but they are very likable and as a result always keep your interest. Aladdin is street smart and Jasmine is adventurous, but both are very warm and easy to like individuals. The Genie is what most people remember and he kind of is the star here. Most of that is down to Robin Williams, whose witty improvisations and mile-a-minute comedic stylings are just brilliant here. Genie is just such a fun character as a result, with a numerous jokes of all kinds and he makes pop culture references that are genuinely funny. The Sultan is enjoyably absent-minded, while the characters that don't talk like Aladdin's monkey Abu and the Magic Carpet do provide some funny moments.<br/><br/>Another positive is the villain and Jafar is just fantastic. His menacing design looks great, he manages the difficult task of being sinister whilst also having subtle comedic moments and Jonathan Freeman's eloquently dark voice works to perfection. Not only that but his motivations make sense and his grudge towards Aladdin is set-up excellently. Gilbert Gottfried as his Parrott Iago also offers some good laughs. The animation is truly outstanding. I picture a lot of beautiful reds and golds when I think of this film, it is always very visually appealing and the landscape designs just look lovely. The animation on the Genie is very impressive just by how fast it is and a lot of the movements here flow well despite the rapid speed most of it goes at. It also lends itself to some very effective tense moments, I think the climax in general is superb.<br/><br/>The music is very good. All the songs here have very catchy melodies and are memorable, from the serene 'A Whole New World' to the energetic 'Friend Like Me'. None of them get in the way of story and the work well with the animation. The romance impressed me as well because there was a believable bond between Aladdin and Jasmine, they do have chemistry and you do get drawn into their struggle. There are some clichés hanging over some areas, but I don't think they affect things too much. As said the comedy is very modern and filled with pop culture references. Some people might fine this distracting, but like I said I think it gives a different twist on the formula.<br/><br/>On the whole I'm a big fan of Aladdin. The ways and means by which they tell this story are very out of the box, but I think that is a big part of its appeal. This is a fresh take on a story that could have been quite dull and as a result is does place it aside as something very different for the studio. As said I really liked the main characters, I thought Jafar was an excellent villain and Robin Williams is simply a whirlwind of comedy. The animation is as impressive as ever and I don't think there is a song here that isn't at least good. I'd have to say that this is easily one of Disney's most entertaining pieces."

Most Disney films have a standard format and let's be from, get a little silly, annoying and cheesy. Now while this has all of that the characters are excellent, the songs are brilliant and the whole film really is enjoyable. I would say this is probably my favourite Disney film and that's saying something.

"devonnewman","9","1","1","23 September 2015"," Summary of Aladdin with all spoilers
","Aladdin was one of the best animated films of all time! Or at least, that is the opinion of this very entertained film critic. Disney has lead me it often misses the mark when trying to properly adapt fairy tales. I along with many other critics, have been their biggest faultfinders. However, Aladdin is clever, funny, has amazing themes, a beautiful soundtrack, and is a very satisfying movie.<br/><br/>The film is set in place resembling the Middle East. Aladdin is a young boy who lives in the streets. Princess Jasmine (his future love interest), lives in the castle and is heavily restricted by her father. Princess Jasmine leaves the castle one day and meets Aladdin. The two have an immediate bond! As the story develops, they fall in love. The evil secretary Jafar, tricks Aladdin into going to retrieve a magical lamp for him. Aladdin rubs the lamp and sparks a friendship with the genie (Robin Williams). Because princesses are only allowed to marry princes, his first wish is to become a prince. The two begin to fall in love. Jafar steals the lamp and becomes very powerful. Aladdin tricks him in to becoming a genie and he is sucked into a lamp. Seeing that Jasmine and Aladdin are in love, the king changes the law and allows them to get married. The storytelling and pacing in the movie is amazing. This movie is an adaptation of the Arabian Nights story. There have been many fairy tale adaptations such as Frozen, Tangled, and The Princess and the Frog. Because of when Aladdin was made, the only thing it lacks are the high definition qualities. However, the complex story leads away from lack of production!<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie took some very interesting risks that turned out amazing. Normally for Disney movies, the protagonist is obviously good guy. He does everything right, and is a model citizen. This is not the case for Aladdin, who if you pay attention, is actually a criminal. He is a common thief, but despite this, Disney is able to make us root for him. He is a very relatable character and uses his wishes to help him find love. The movie also does an amazing job portraying Jasmine. Instead of making her a ditsy princess and a very minor character, they dig deeper. She isn't just Aladdin's to be won, she falls in love with him too. In the movie, she recognizes him immediately as the boy she met in the streets. It is revealed that she loves Aladdin for who he is and does not care if he is a prince or a petty thief. We also get a very developed character in Genie, who provides the comic relief in the movie. The film is never able to hit a dry spot because he constantly makes us laugh. The decision to get Robin Williams to voice the genie was a smart one, as his charm seeps through the character.<br/><br/>The underlying theme from the movie seems to be to just be yourself. Instead of going the easy route and having Aladdin become a prince, Disney decided to have him stay the same. Children needed to see that being themselves was always the right answer.<br/><br/>As if the characters and story weren't enough, Aladdin had an astounding soundtrack. As of today, I still find myself singing ""A Whole New world"". This song was truly incredible and won a Grammy for Song of The Year. This is universally seen as one of the best movie soundtracks of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin was an amazing movie and one of Disney's best in my opinion. If you have not seen it, I would greatly recommend it! You will find yourself thinking about it weeks later and be happy you did!"

","This movie is as fun as a movie can be. It was hard to believe, coming after Beauty and the Beast, that Disney would slam it home again, but I still remember the feeling of satisfaction of seeing this in the theater. Animated movies, which had been such a big part of my childhood, were officially great again. And the movie holds up. It's another one that finds a way to get your interest early and maintain the excitement right on through. None of the songs are personal favorites, although the short reprise of ""Prince Ali"" is deliciously demented. The animation is beyond world-class, obviously the product of an insane level of work. But the movie also continues to influence family films, for better or worse. Just like Jaws and Raiders of the Lost Ark ushered in the age of the quick-cut short attention span blockbuster, Genie and Iago made sure every animated kids production had to have sarcastic, wisecracking characters spouting off insults that usually went over young viewers heads'. Movies like Pulp Fiction, Forest Gump, and Aladdin brought in the age of irony, and pop culture has pretty much resided there ever since."

He is easily my favorite part of the entire thing. Jafar is another amazing character in this movie. He's easily one of my favorite Disney villains. He's so utterly despicable and he knows it. It is so much fun watching him on screen. The music freaking rocks too. All of it is catchy and memorable and it makes me want to buy it.

The addition of extra characters and razzle-dazzle make the journey even more worthwhile, adding a charm to this old story without diluting what made it a classic in the first place. Much excitement despite being lighthearted. The voice actors fit their animated characters perfectly, with Robin Williams easily stealing the show with his grand performance as the Genie.

","The early 90s were a great time for Disney with Beauty and the Beast, Lion King, and Aladdin. Of all of these popular Disney movies, Aladdin has the least punch to it. It starts out slow but once Robin Williams shows up as the Genie, it gets kicking. Robin Williams is a tour de force in this feature, basically carrying the whole film. The casting of Williams was genius. Roger Ebert wondered in his review which came first - the drawings or the voice, because Williams improvisational skill is shown off impressively here. <br/><br/>The rest of the film is unfortunately predictable. Boy meets girl. boy can't get girl b/c he thinks he isn't good enough. Boy tries to be someone he isn't. boy loses girl. boy saves the girl and wins her back by being himself. Oh and there is a cute sidekick and a mean villain too. <br/><br/>For the kids, it's a great movie and they will want to watch it over and over again.

","Aladdin is one of the best films that Walt Disney has produced so far, and it can still makes me sing along with their catchy song numbers, appreciate the hard work put into it from various artists, and the talented voice actors. The movie's charm has lasted for this long since the 1992 release, and is special still just for that fact that everything was hand-drawn!<br/><br/>Artists from all over the world were gathered to help create this fantastic piece of work. To capture the bagginess of Aladdin's pants, for example, animator Glen Keane looked up videos of the popular rapper M.C. Hammer. How crazy is that? Even something as simple as the magical lamp had to be created over and over on paper before getting what the Director wanted for the movie. There is a lot of effort into creating a fantastic film like this, and could take a few years to complete. If someone were to mess up a background painting for the city of Agrabah, they would have to redo the entire painting. There was very little room for messing up, and sometimes whole scenes were scratched out in the storyboarding process before actual drawings were produced.<br/><br/>I love the songs in this film, especially ""Prince Ali(Reprise)"" sung by Jonathan Freeman as Jafar. His voice just takes the happy Prince Ali song from the beginning of the film, and then uses it in a mocking way towards Aladdin and Jasmine. He reveals to her and the Sultan that Prince Ali is just the street rat Aladdin. Jafar's creepy laugh at the end of the song, when he sends Aladdin off to the northern reaches of the Earth, is one of the scariest and wildest maniacal laughs in the Disney Films as a whole."

","Like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Aladdin"" holds some of my fondest childhood memories. Like the other two, I watched this in the theaters (even vividly remembering how I was annoyed that the princess was given a modern name). What's great about ""Aladdin"" is that Disney didn't try to duplicate ""Beauty"", which was arguably a huge hit. Instead, it's the complete opposite of Beauty: a quirk-filled comedy owned almost entirely by the Genie (Robin Williams). Artistically, it's also a departure from its predecessors. Aladdin doesn't look like your typical Disney film. Every object in the background is rounded, like the characters, and the style is more loose and cartoony. The music is a notch down from ""Mermaid"" and ""Beauty"" but ""Prince Ali"" and ""A Whole New World"" hold up pretty well. All in all, another winner from Disney. The Platinum Edition DVD is still available in most markets outside the US, so grab one while you can."

There was never a moment where I wanted to turn away from watching this hugely entertaining picture of wild improvisation, stunning animation, subtle-comedy, and scene stealing characters. Robin Williams played an excellent jet fuelled Genie and until now I never thought of him as much of a singer, but he really had me kicking to the beat of ""Never Had a Friend like Me"". And that was just one of the many songs I loved in this movie. I also enjoyed that song ""A Whole New World"" It had a very beautiful motion to it, I can see why that won an Academy Award. And what about that guy with the twisted beard and the staff, Jafar I think it was, he was such an awesome villain, he had all the qualities of a perfect bad guy, and his genius was well backed up by that sarcastic loudmouth sidekick Iago, he cracked me up. Aladdin is one of those movies that you never get tired of watching. Sure it doesn't have that heart-warming storyline that made other movies like ""Beauty and the Beast"" famous.

Of course we all know that ""A Whole New World"" is a fantastic song that really gets stuck in your head. The animation on characters isn't as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"", but it makes up for that with extremely epic moments like when they are trying to escape The Cave of Wonders. Characters aren't the greatest Disney has done. That is except for Genie. Robin Williams delivers a funny, energetic, and extremely entertaining performance. You can ask anyone on the planet what their favorite part of Aladdin is, and they will all answer Robin Williams. The Genie in my opinion is definitely one of the great Disney characters. The romance (just like the animation) is not as good as it was in ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Still the romance is filled with all the good old mushy stuff that little kids always turn their head at.

","Disney was on a roll when ""Aladdin"" was on its way out, with a string of successes behind them (""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Oliver & Company"", ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""), creativity was coming back to the Disney studios and entertaining films were once again coming out. These films mostly soared above the efforts from the 70s and 80s (""The Aristocats"", ""Robin Hood"" and ""The Black Cauldron"" in particular) and they showed that animation could be very successful. Happy times for animation fans and Disney fans.<br/><br/>""Aladdin"" keeps that tradition going. Adapting the Arabian Nights tales, ""Aladdin"" depicts the title characters' attempts to win the heart of Princess Jasmine, who must only marry a prince. Aladdin gets the help of an outrageous Genie in a lamp that evil Sorcerer Jafar is in pursuit of.<br/><br/>In terms of animation, ""Aladdin"" has some stunning use computer animation. Otherwise, the film is rushed. Of course, back in the early 90s, these films were rushed to meet the release date, as Eisner & Katzenberg wanted to crank out one animated feature a year. Because of this (along with ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast""), ""Aladdin""'s animation is rather sloppy on some scenes. It is miles above most other animated features, but it can't come close to the best of Disney animation. (see Walt Disney's first five films, ""The Lion King"" and ""Tarzan"") The songs are great. The Genie steals the show with ""Friend Like Me"". ""A Whole New World"" is a classic Disney love song. ""Arabian Nights"" is good, and ""Prince Ali"" is a celebration song (much like ""Be Our Guest"" from ""Beast"" or ""Festival of Fools"" from ""Hunchback""). The film is very funny, although a lot of the jokes are dated. This may explain why DVD sales weren't so hot in 2004. Who knows? One other complaint I have is the similarities to Richard Williams' long-in-production, but never finished ""The Thief and the Cobbler"". Both plots are similar: Evil Grand Vizier who is also a Sorcerer (Zig-Zag to Jafar) wants to take over and marry the Princess. Also, Jafar looks like Zig Zag, and so does the Genie. Williams' film was in production at the same time and was stopped because of this film. However, Disney was not the thief, because the idea was started back in the late 80s because lyricist Howard Ashman suggested Disney to adapt the story. It might have been the animators Williams' fired that went on to work for Disney.<br/><br/>But whatever the flaws may be, ""Aladdin"" has a good story, great characters and it's also very entertaining. A 9.5 out of 10."

","Well now back in the early ninties Disney released the classic retelling of Alladin and the Genie from the classic stories told long ago about a man finding a magic lamp with an even more magical genie that will grant his master anything that he chooses.<br/><br/>This adaptation was really well done and I must give Disney props for actually taking the male hero in the tale and making him into something more than a two dimensional prince character. The songs are enjoyable and the voice acting is very good. Robin Williams excels and the Genie and truly is the biggest of the stars in this film. The other voices are well done and fairly well memorable and the movie itself is a great enjoyable fun.<br/><br/>If you are wanting to make a Disney Collection the one is not complete without this film."

","I feel lucky to count myself among those who grew up watching modern masterpieces such as ""Aladdin"", ""The Little Mermaid"", ""Beauty and the Beast"" and the like. Nowadays they just don't make 'em like that anymore. Sad but true. (I'm not keen on the Pixar flicks, sorry). I vividly remember going to see each and one of them (starting with ""Mermaid"" in the spring of 1990) on the big screen. Those were scarce moments of true childhood innocence. Times that you take with you forever, and Disney has done just that to almost every kid in the world during the last 70 years. ""Aladdin"" came out at the peak of Disney's third golden age that started in 1989. The company released a number of films which broke new ground in animation and were huge artistic and commercial successes as well. Although it broke a few records when it came out on video in 1993, for some odd reason, this DVD release sold a meager amount of copies, catching everyone at the studio by surprise. Nevertheless, ""Aladdin"" remains as enjoyable as ever and much better than most of its successors."
"Mightyzebra","8","1","1","7 August 2008"," A very fun film, better for older people!
","I do not want to insult anybody or let anybody take this statement in the wrong light, but: I think this film is a great deal better for people aged 12 and over. Why? Because I think that there is so much ""adult"" humour to be enjoyed in this film that little children do not need to watch it. But I am not saying they should not! Little children will like the characters, the adventures and the songs, which is perfectly hunky dory, but they will miss the humour, which is perhaps the best part of this film. The humour is provided mainly by Robin Williams who voices the genie and Gilbert Gottfried, who voices Iago the parrot. <br/><br/>In this very good animated Disney film, we meet Jafar, the Sultan's evil adviser, who is trying to find a magic lamp, with a genie which will make him Sultan. We also meet Aladdin, a street rat, with no money and stealing everything he needs. We meet Jasmine, princess Jasmine, who does not want to marry any of the suitors her father, the Sultan, is offering her to marry. Soon enough, an adventure will begin between these characters - and more...<br/><br/>I recommend this to anyone who has a sense of humour and to anyone who likes Disney films. I will say this: Anyone of any age can watch this film, but people who understand more grown-up humour will enjoy this more. Enjoy ""Aladdin""! :-)"

","My Take: The sort of cinematic magic Disney has come to offer. <br/><br/>After spawning success with their LITTLE MERMAID, the studio's latest work in many years, Disney proceeded with ALADDIN, which comprises another witty and enjoyable charm drawn from colorful animation, enjoyable characters, swift bits of action and solid bits of comedy. Some of the humor falls flat (lets face it, when the humor doesn't come from Robin Williams' Genie or Gilbert Gottfried as the noisy wisecracking parrot, the humor falls a little flat), but everything else fits so perfectly, and it all clearly shows what kind of success Disney spawns.<br/><br/>The first half, where Aladdin (voiced by Scoot Weinger) and his life as a ""worthless street-rat"", falters a bit at times, but it practically catches up in the second half, mostly from the introduction of Williams' manic Genie, who not only fits Williams, but also fits his personalities and manic humor, mostly including nods to Williams' comic impersonations of stars, from Robert DeNiro to Jack Nicholson. If just for Williams, ALADDIN is a true delight for the adult audience. But Williams isn't just the only delight in ALADDIN. Characters of various colors and musical numbers of sheer delight all come together to create a true family movie delight.<br/><br/>Directors John Musker and Ron Clements (the magicians behind MERMAID) has brought together this enjoyable affair, complete with appealing characters that would act as a trademark for future Disney enterprises. From a straightforward lead of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) to the nifty effective villainy of Jaffar (voiced superbly by Jonathan Freeman) and his meddling parrot companion (voiced by Gilbert Gottfried), the film gives us characters we can root for, and characters to be delighted from, good or bad guy. The animation is a true delight, ranging from an active foreground to an elaborate background, ALADDIN delights with sheer colorful brilliance. This is Disney at top form, and what instant classics are made of! Sit back, and enjoy this magic carpet-ride into a wonderful enterprise best be described in three simple words: Shining, shimmering splendid.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","Disney's 1992 animated feature is a triumph of wit and skill. The high-tech artwork and graphics look great, the characters are strong, the familiar story is nicely augmented with an interesting villain (Jafar, voiced by Jonathan Freeman), and there's an incredible hook atop the whole thing: Robin Williams's frantically hilarious vocal performance as Aladdin's genie. Even if one isn't particularly moved by the love story between the title character (Scott Weinger) and his girlfriend Jasmine (Linda Larkin), you can easily get lost in Williams's improvisational energy and the equally entertaining performances of Freeman and Gilbert Gottfried (as Jafar's parrot)."

","It's been nearly fifteen years since the theatrical release of ""Aladdin,"" and every time I watch it I am transported back in time to when I first saw it in theaters as a child.<br/><br/>""Aladdin"" is a magical film; wondrous, exhilarating, and beautiful. While it may not be the BEST Disney film (that goes to its predecessor, ""Beauty and the Beast""), it's the most fun.<br/><br/>The story is loosely based on the ""Aladdin and the King of Thieves"" tale (or so I'm told). I'm not that familiar with the source material, but the movie begins with Aladdin, a street beggar who finds a magic lamp and becomes a prince. Complications ensue when the sultan's adviser, Jafar, tries to get it too, and Aladdin has to deal with mounting pressure and guilt from the fact that his princehood isn't real (which is a problem since the princess can only marry a prince).<br/><br/>Anyone who talks about this film is bound to bring up Robin Williams sooner or later, and rightly so. Williams dominates this movie, and it shows. The genie is the most entertaining character to watch, as it's paired with William's boundless energy and nonstop imitations (that change in a flash). Williams elevates ""Aladdin"" from great to absolutely brilliant, and nonstop entertaining.<br/><br/>Fortunately, the rest of the movie matches up to William's performance just about evenly. The rest of the voice-overs are great. Scott Weinger is perfect as Aladdin, making it easy to sympathize with Aladdin. Brad Kane's singing voice is almost indistinguishable from Weinger's, which is in and of itself impressive. Linda Larkin/Lea Salonga are great as Jasmine, as is the rest of the cast, which includes Gilbert Gottfried as the sarcastic, wisecracking parrot Iago (who, interestingly enough, is elevated to more than just the villain's sidekick).<br/><br/>While I'm on the subject of the voices, I have to bring to light another member of the voice cast. That is Jonathan Freeman. He is tremendously talented, and creates the most vile villain ever to grace a Disney film; so much so that the likes of Ursula, Gaston, Hades and, ugh, Radcliffe, all pale to the likes of Jafar. With his thin figure, large, twisted smile, and vicious eyes, he's absolutely chilling. In a good way, of course.<br/><br/>Like the rest of the Disney musicals (the weak ""Pocahantas"" aside), the music is vibrant and infectious, accompanied by stunning visuals. The script is more intelligent than the majority of the more ""adult"" films, and it is wildly entertaining. Definitely check it out."
"Electrified_Voltage","10","1","1","4 October 2007"," One of my childhood favourites, and still impressive now!
","This was one of many Disney flicks that I watched as a kid in the '90s, but I watched it more than most of the others (if not all of them). From what I remember, I enjoyed every Disney animated feature I saw in those days to a certain extent (with the exception of ""Pocahontas""), but for a while, I was pretty much obsessed (I don't know whether that's too strong a word or not) with ""Aladdin""! Since rediscovering animated family films about a year ago, I have seen ""Aladdin"" again twice, and have found that it's still very enjoyable!<br/><br/>Aladdin is a street urchin in the city of Agrabah, who has to steal food in order to eat. His only friend is a monkey named Abu. However, his life is about to change. Jafar, the secretly evil grand vizier of the good Sultan, wants to get the lamp from the Cave of Wonders, so he can get the power he longs for! The vizier learns that the only one who can get this lamp from the cave is the ""Diamond in the Rough,"" which he discovers is Aladdin! Meanwhile, Princess Jasmine, the Sultan's daughter, is tired of being pressured by her father to marry, so she runs away in disguise, and goes to the marketplace, where Aladdin sees her and quickly falls in love. These two factors are about to lead Aladdin on a life-changing adventure, where he has a lot to learn!<br/><br/>There are several things that make ""Aladdin"" memorable. One of these things is the amazing animation, probably some of the best I've ever seen! The movie also has a memorable bunch of songs, starting with ""Arabian Nights"" at the beginning, followed by the likes of ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Friend Like Me"", ""Prince Ali"", and the Oscar-winning ""A Whole New World"". We certainly can't forget the humour, starting during the opening scene, with the merchant who introduces the story, followed by so many other funny (sometimes hilarious) scenes, sometimes slapstick (like in the ""One Jump Ahead"" sequence). The Genie, voiced by comedian Robin Williams, is a huge part of the humour, acting like a maniac and doing many impressions! Iago, voiced by Gilbert Gottfried, another comedian, is also notable. Aside from all that, ""Aladdin"" is an excellent adventure overall! In brief, this is one memorable film for animation fans of all ages!"
"buddhadan-1","9","1","1","18 September 2006"," Hilarious piece of animation
","This movie is truly hilarious and it appeals to both children and most adults.<br/><br/>It isn't only the comic genius of Robin Williams as the Genie, or Gilbert Godfried (sp?) as the parrot, but it's the little subtle bits of humor like facial expressions, inside jokes, one liners, and the humor of the overall scenes themselves.<br/><br/>But, if the humor wasn't enough for you, it's got a very addictive soundtrack, much of the music is very catchy and I found myself singing along to a few of the songs after watching it for the first time. I think that the Prince Ali song is my favorite, mostly for the song, but partially because of the parade format of the scene.<br/><br/>If the humor and the music wasn't enough to suck you in, we also have some rather amazing action scenes (yes, I know it's animated, but it's done so well that you get pulled right into the scene itself) having something to do with what appears to be a mixture of old fashioned animation and computer animation.<br/><br/>See this movie, you will not be disappointed."

","I loved this movie, not only is it my favourite Disney film but it is one of my fave films altogether.<br/><br/>The setting (Agrabah) is beautiful and the characters are a joy to watch and listen to. Within five minutes you become gripped and long to see more There are some equally joyous and poignant moments in the film that determine the ups and downs of Aladdin's journey from a poor street rat to a romantic lover. You feel personally involved with the main characters (Aladdin and Jasmine in particular) when they go through their complex emotions, but also the Genie, who longs for freedom The songs are fantastic, whether you seek tradition ('Arabian Nights') or romance ('A Whole New World').<br/><br/>Spectacular fun for the whole family, not to be missed!"
"SevenStitches","8","1","1","12 May 2006"," Disney, where have you gone?
","This really is something special. As a kid, this was an amazing film; hilarious, thrilling, engaging and definitely on par with Disney's best. Coming back to it after so long and little has changed. However, there were a few things that detracted my present experience from that of my childhood. The first half of the film is overall a little on the boring side. Other than the unveiling of Robin Williams' show stopping Genie, the music, visuals and Jafar, the rest of characters weren't as compelling as i remember. The main protagonists and their romantic endeavour isn't the most magical in Disney's history (compared to say ""Lady and the Tramp"" it's desperately shallow), which is a shame since they take up most of the plot. Jasmine is still gorgeous with a fiery personality trying to break free of a restrained life, but Aladdin is quite a standard underdog, his plight not really drawing great sympathy, despite the fact he's a swell guy and all with a heart of gold. So really, Jasmine's attraction to him comes of quite ""same old trick"" sort of thing, both individuals having the same ""trapped"" feeling in life that brings them together.<br/><br/>Saying that, ""A Whole New World"" is still a breathtaking number, and that entire scene at least gives the romantic plot a more than satisfactory feeling. And that's Aladdin's key. It's last half is fabulous. From the transformation of Aladdin into Prince Ali to the very end, it's hard to find a glaring fault. For some reason everything just comes together. You care for the protagonists, Jafar just keeps getting more evil, and the animation is the definition of top draw (always is). In the end you just know you've seen something great and you don't care how it happened but your glad it did, like you've really been in a whole new world for an hour and a half (almost). The slowish first half just dissolves into memory, until you watch it again (you will), and once again, the second half will drag you back into it all and you'll love it even more.<br/><br/>It's also worth noting that the one absolute constant in all of this is the Genie. Once he appears with the classic ""Friend Like Me"", every scene he's in comes alive due to Williams' blinding comic momentum, plus the animators' endlessly imaginative play. He's definitely the most engaging, sympathetic character in the film and you really feel for him and his own wish to be free of the lamp.<br/><br/>Aladdin is, and always will be, a Disney classic in my books. It's difficult to pinpoint how it does it, but it just does. A shining testament of what the company was and still is capable of when they really put their soul and time into something they really want to do, instead of something they think they need to do, which sadly seems to be to keep the company on it's feet so they can make even more money. There was a time when art, entertainment and dreams trumped everything else, the reason why ""Disney's Folly"" as it was dismissively called so long ago, became the pioneer in one of cinema's most magical medias. That was the idea that gave birth to films like this and a whole lot of others they did themselves (right up to as recently as Tarzan and Lilo & Stitch), plus the gems that everyone else have achieved. Lets hope the company gets through this dry spell and returns for another go round. They did it before, they can do it again."

","I just recently watched Aladdin on my DVD. I enjoyed the crystal-clear, completely restored picture and the movie itself was very enjoyable. Young Aladdin plays a ""street rat"" who must steal to get his food but still has a good heart (in one scene we see him give his hard-earned food to some hungry little children.) When he becomes trapped in a cave of wonders, he meets the goofy genie who can grant him three wishes, and I don't want to spoil it for you if you haven't seen it so I'll leave it at that. The voices, especially the Genie's (done by Robin Williams) and Iago the parrot (none other than Gilbert Gottfried- I think I spelled that right...)are good and the story is a very enjoyable one. The songs were very catchy. One thing I didn't like was how on the DVD they have all these extra features- on the second disk there is tons of stuff about how the movie was made and the characters were designed and things like that. However, I'm sure some people might find these things interesting so it's up to your opinion. I did like the deleted songs and scenes and when they gave reasons for why they didn't put them into the film. All in all I recommend this movie because (here comes the corny part) it has potential for becoming a family favorite in your household."

","Aladdin is one of the best animated movies that has ever been made. Featuring the voice talents of Robin Williams as the Genie, Scott Weinger as Aladdin, and Gilbert Gottfried as Iago the parrot. <br/><br/>The villain, Jafar, has an evil plot to get his hand on a magic lamp, which contained a genie that would grant three wishes to whomever set him free. <br/><br/>The princess, Jasmine, is being forced to marry within three days by her father. Her father means well, but she had had enough with all the bragging rich princes' that had come to court her. <br/><br/>Through weird circumstances, Aladdin gets hold of the lamp, thanks to his pet monkey, Abu. The genie is a fun-loving guy who takes a liking to Aladdin right away. He has a great sense of humor, and he told Aladdin that if he got a wish, it would be freedom. Aladdin promised the genie that after he makes his first two wishes, he'll use his third wish to set the genie free. Theyt shake hands, and the genie grants Aladdin's first wish: to become a prince. <br/><br/>Eventually, Jafar gets a hold of the lamp, and tries to get rid of Aladdin but not before he Aladdin returns, gets rid of Jafar and Iago for good, and then the Sultan changes the law. Aladdin finally fulfills his promise to the genie by wishing him free.<br/><br/>This is a great movie. My Score: 9/10."
"adymad44","9","1","1","13 February 2006"," One word.....Genie-ous
","Aladdin is genie-ously scripted, (pun intended), and it would be silly of me not to class it in my top 3 animated films. It follows the story of a street rat named Aladdin who longs to be something more. After being thrown in cell he comes across a mysterious old man who lets Aladdin in on a secret - a secret cave in the desert that contains riches beyond Aladdin's wildest dreams. Little does Aladdin know, he is the ""diamond in the rough"", the one person that can enter this cave and retrieve the lamp that this old man, whose identity will be revealed in the film, is after. It follows the magical and extravagant life of Aladdin alongside his trusty monkey friend Abu and his new friends, Carpet and Genie and with Aladdin trying to catch the eye of the lonely Princess Jasmine all sorts of mischief can happen. Feel your heartbeat race as you watch this exciting storyline unfold with all sorts of twists and turns on the way. Robin Williams is brilliant as the genie and a fantastic soundtrack, which I own, makes this Disney movie an absolute classic. I recommend this to Lush people who want an enchanted afternoon film. A Whole New World is now a classic and could only be improved with someone like Kelly Clarkson and Mark Pakula's vocals but that's a different story."
"russem31","8","1","1","4 December 2005"," Hilarious!
","Although not as good as its animated predecessor Beauty and the Beast, this is a really well done and extremely funny film. It follows the story of Aladdin, a street urchin, who finds the Genie in the Bottle who grants him three wishes, which has to do with meeting the Royal Princess Jasmine. What really makes it great is the laugh-out funny performance of Robin Williams as the Genie. He continually pulls all the punches and makes the strong script and dialogue even more so funny. On top of that, there are the great songs and score by Alan Menken (who also did the wonderful score and songs for Beauty and the Beast) and top-notch animation that makes this Disney outing worthwhile to watch on any day of the week. A strong 8 out of 10."
"The_Void","7","1","1","6 November 2005"," A massive highlight for Disney
","To be honest, even as a kid I didn't really like Disney films all that much - but there was one exception to that rule; and that was Aladdin. Maybe it was the characters, maybe it was the plot, or maybe it was simply the massive amount of fun that the film is; but something clicked then. And, upon seeing the film again as an adult; I can say that, despite the bar being raised for animation by the likes of Toy Story, Aladdin has lost none of what made it great upon release  and the fact that I enjoyed this film as much as my younger sister shows that Aladdin is fun for all ages. Because of the fact that animation has largely moved to 3D, there doesn't seem to be a lot of classic animation about; and that's a shame if you ask me, because I'd rather watch animation like this. The plot is, of course, based upon the classic story of 'Aladdin'; only it's been spruced up by all of the classic Disney elements. The characters are all overdone, there are lots of songs and there's lots of humour; but the classic yarn about a street urchin happening upon a magic genie lamp remains intact.<br/><br/>Critics raved about how well done the characters in Finding Nemo were, but Disney's best characters can be seen in this film. It's amazing how well thought-out they are, and while their motivations are mostly simple - all of the characters behave as you would expect them to do, and it's easy to get carried along with the emotional ride as well as enjoying all the songs and stuff. Speaking of the songs - they definitely give the movie most of it's highlights. I'm not a fan of musicals, but the songs here are extremely catchy and the images put in with them make the film memorable. I hadn't seen this flick for around eight years, but I still knew what was coming in most scenes just because the movie is so memorable. Of all the classic yarns, Aladdin is definitely one of; if not the, best as it has everything; lust for power, rags to riches, a romance, magic and more. The way that it's told will mean that younger children will enjoy it without bothering with the story, while the themes carry Aladdin through into a movie that can be enjoyed by older kids and adults. As mentioned, I don't like Disney much; but I make an exception for this film."

","by Alise Beverly<br/><br/>The movie that I am reviewing is Aladdin. Aladdin is a Walt Disney production. It in general is usually classified as a movie for children. In this movie there are a lot of main characters. Aladdin, Jasmine, and their friends. The story line goes something like this: There was once a poor man who lived off of stealing bread and finding a place to sleep each night. He dreams of living in a palace and having the things that he doesn't have. This character is Aladdin. On the other hand there is a princess who wishes she was normal and could leave the palace walls to be treated like an everyday person. So she does. She sneaks out of the palace one day and bumps into Aladdin on the streets. Neither one of them know each other's identity, but they finally find out. Through a lot of hard times throughout the movie they finally meet again and fall in love.<br/><br/>And who is to blame for them meeting up again? The Genie, of course! Aladdin finds a genie in a bottle that can grant him his every wish. One of which is to cast the evil Jaffar out of the palace and into a genie bottle so he cannot take over and marry Jasmine. She is not in love with him; she is in love with Aladdin. And so the story goes. To find out all of the adventurous details in this movie, go rent it, or buy it. Trust me it will not be a waste of your money!! :)<br/><br/>My opinion of this movie is that it is a GREAT movie for any age! It is exciting and fun to watch. This movie will keep you going and on your toes to see what will happen next. It also has a small love story plot to it, too. Now, of course, fairy tales aren't true. But if they were this is the just the sweetest thing ever! A magic carpet ride, being a princess and meeting that special someone just by coincidence. This is a great movie that I have enjoyed my entire life and I know you will enjoy it just as much as I have."

"goodkarma2","10","1","1","23 October 2004"," The Genie's jokes are outdated, but who cares?
","There are already so many reviews for Aladdin that I could hardly state anything new, but now that Disney has released the movie on DVD - and they did a great job doing it - I felt like I need to comment on it too.<br/><br/>I first watched Aladdin when it was in the cinemas in 1992/1993 at the age of 9. You know, like most of my friends too I just LOVED Aladdin. It was such a beautiful love story (the ""A Whole New World"" scene and the ""Kiss the Girl"" scene in The Little Mermaid are the most romantic moments in animated history, I'm sure)and the settings were simply enchanting. This movie made me want to go to Agrabah myself - although I never had a thing for desert landscapes.<br/><br/>Plus, let's not forget, Aladdin is Disney's sexiest character!! That's what I thought back then and I haven't changed my mind ever since :-)<br/><br/>Of course, the Genie is hilarious and it's true that Robin Williams' jokes and parodies are outdated now, but keep in mind that the movie was a worldwide success, although most of the people he imitates are not well known outside the US. I didn't even recognize Arsenio Hall, since I only know him from ""Coming to America"" with Eddie Murphy. Sure, it's even more fun if you actually know whom the Genie is making fun of, but it's also great fun if you don't.<br/><br/>So I would love to say it's THE best animated movie ever, but Disney has released so many masterpieces in the 90s that it would be unfair to say that this one is the best. Anyway, if you're reading this to decide if you want to get it on DVD, I can only recommend it. Disney did a great job creating the special edition 2 disc release.

","I love Disney films. They portray an innocence that is sadly lacking in society today.<br/><br/>Despite myself being 18 years old I still get excited when Disney release another songs and end up dragging some poor soul from my Biology course to see it.<br/><br/>The songs are a major part of this film and 'A Whole New World' sends tingles down my spine. After hearing the the song 'Proud Of Your Boy' was cut from the film after its writer died, I felt that this song was tribute to the writer and the whole song team. It was simply amazing.<br/><br/>When people tell me that they find Disney films stupid it worries me that they have lost that tiny bit of childhood that exists in us all.<br/><br/>Aladdin was one of Disneys masterpieces and may their ability to produce such films long continue.<br/><br/>I just hope they stick to the drawings compared to the computer animation.

","This movie didn't only entertain us but it made us go back for more. The music is great and the dialogue is put together very well and the moral and plot are very strong as well. It has comedy, drama, action, romance, adventure, mystery, and everything else including in all genres of all movies. I include this to be one of my all time favorites for the fact being that I went to the theaters 3 times to see it and I could not stop watching it on video after. One of my top ten best Disney movies...hands down! I definitely recommend this movie to all Disney fans and to anyone who has not seen it yet because honestly you are missing out on one of the greatest animation movies ever filmed. I especially love the nude scenes with the genie and aladdin."

","This one Disney best film to watch. Aladdin is not childish or grownup for a child to understand. It is a excellent animated movie that everyone could enjoy. There are catchy tunes and jokes through the movie in which you never get bored of seeing. It definitely worth to watch for children and adults."
"Lady Jasmine","Null","1","1","14 June 2002"," Another gem in an already glittering (although swiftly tarnishing) crown
","Ranking even above the classic Little Mermaid, but not quite level with the enchantment of Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin came around when Disney was still breaking in it's new, smoother animation process, and it came with a splash of typical Disney glory.<br/><br/>Aladdin is a wonderful movie, handling an old story with a new twist and fresh sense of humour. The casting is well done, though there is a distinct lack of accents in the main characters (perhaps merely for understanding purposes. Arabic accents are difficult to decipher sometimes).<br/><br/>
Despite all the action, adventure and romance in this gem of a family film, there is one thing that sets it again apart from the rest...the music. The score in this film is one of the better I have heard, it is quite beautiful, especially the various love ballads. Only one Disney film in my opinion can top this with an entire score (others can maybe top one or two songs, but not the entire school) and that is Beauty and the Beast, which stands, in my opinion in a musical class of it's own which has yet to be topped by any Disney movie past or present.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin is a wonderful family experience with elements that can appeal to everyone that will live on with a select others rather than fading into the abyss.  However, one word of advice, avoid the sequels at all costs...they are a waste of film degrading to the original classic."

The anthropomorphic artistry was a joy! Finally, the eye was kept forever occupied by the constant shifting of scenes between indigo blue and red/gold.I wa personally kept quite happy by that alone! As an aside, this is the only thing I have ever been able to stomach Gilbert Gottfried in, and he is actually very funny as Iago!<br/><br/>The songs were mostly catchy and effective, with clever lyrics...I wonder if any uncredited input could be given to Robin Williams.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd have to say I still prefer ""The Little Mermaid"" for msic,choreography, and being the first of the new wave....Then, possibly ""Mulan"" for characters, and Eddie Murphy, who just cracks me up as ""Mushu"". A nod, also, to ""The Emperor's New Groove"" which, while giving the impression of having been put together from stuff left on the cutting-room floor manages to be the freshest thing the Disney studios have put out in years.

","I think, of all the Disney movies from the early 90's, ""Aladdin"" is, hands down, the most enjoyable.  It's got the perfect mix of humor, action, and romance.  Most interesting of all, however, is the fact that Disney hasn't ever got this mix right twice.  ""Hercules"" was intended as another ""Aladdin"" and while that's a fun little movie, it's not nearly as memorable as it's predicessor.<br/><br/>I think the reason is that, for once, Disney chose to lighten up while making ""Aladdin"".  They allowed the characters to look and act more offbeat than usual.  Visually, the artwork is fantastic and the psychedelic color scheme comes very close to putting ""Yellow Submarine"" to shame.  The memorable characters are another highlight of the movie.  I don't think you'll find a better sidekick than Genie or a more endearing hero than Aladdin himself.<br/><br/>Absolute perfection."

","Don't get me wrong, trendiness and pop culture humor do not a good movie make. In ""Aladdin"", though, it just worked. Robin Williams pulled it off really well. I love the movie through and through, but I'll say that he was the best part about it, even though it did take me a while to realize who all the people he was impersonating were. It wasn't only Robin Williams, though, so don't think that's what I'm saying. The music was also really good. I tried to learn all the songs from the soundtrack, but I never quite got them all. I just love the movie as a whole. <br/><br/>My fondest memory of it is when two of my friends and I tried once to act the whole movie out, but we never got past the scene where Aladdin sings ""One Jump Ahead"". I was the shortest, so I always played Iago and Abu. Not even ""Beauty and the Beast"", my favorite Disney movie, has such nostalgic value to me. It's only too bad that neither of the sequels was worthy to carry the Aladdin name."

","Aladdin is a very fun movie and one of the few I enjoy watching again and again.  It has many of Disney's most entertaining characters, and you gotta love that Genie!<br/><br/>I also like how it combines drama, romance, and different styles of comedy into one picture.  Many have said this film won't stand the test of time due to it's current events nature, but there is enough comedy of a more general sort to make the film watchable many years from now.<br/><br/>P.S.  In regards to the comments by those accusing the film of using American accents for the good guys and ""Arabian"" accents for the bad guys. I just don't see it.  Neither of the two main villains (Jafar and Iago) have anything remotely resembling an ""Arabian"" accent, and even the mean palace guards are accentless.  The only character I can think of as having anything that could be construed as an ""Arabian"" (of course, there are many different types of Arabian accents not just one, but I digress) accent is the narrator, and he certainly is not a bad guy."

","With Aladdin, Disney continued it's hot streak after The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast were amazing box office successes in every sense. And while Aladdin was less inspiring than those two, Robin Williams' magical touch made the movie 1992's most successful film and a top-seller at video sales. It is not that something in Aladdin is not on a par with its two predecessors, it is just that it wasn't as fresh and magical. It's not that the animation was better, nor the songs, and the characters weren't on a par with the first two, but inspite of it, Aladdin remains a winner all the way. Thanks for the animation (don't misunderstand from what I wrote, the animation is definitely on a par with Mermaid and Beauty), the award-winning songs and the sophisticated humor. Nevertheless, it's one of the best from recent years."

"MartinHafer","7","3","7","8 January 2020"," Very good...but Jasmine?
","Everybody seems to love Disney's ""Aladdin""...and it is a wonderful film. However, one aspect of it bothered me long ago and still does....Jasmine. Think about it for a moment. Her people are poor, hungry and being oppressed. However, at the same time, she's living in complete luxury...nearly all of her wishes being granted. However, despite that, she wants to run around Baghdad pretending she's poor and hanging out the 'little people'! Doesn't this sound a bit like Queen Marie Antoinette? Such a selfish and annoying girl...in an otherwise enjoyable Disney cartoon. This and Aladdin's propensity to lie, lie, lie make it a film that is problematic and I just didn't enjoy it as much as many viewers. Still, it is worth seeing...with lovely animation and catchy songs....despite an annoying Disney princess."

","Arabian Nights tale via the Disney people, presented in the much-missed, regrettably vanquished hand-drawn era of animation. The Sultan's daughter must marry a prince in three days or be forced to wed her father's version of a concierge, who drips with disdain and evil; meanwhile, young rogue Aladdin and his pet monkey have been allowed into a hallowed cave of treasures where they rescue a manic genie from a magic lamp. In-jokes aside, the movie visually borrows from other Disney product (particularly ""Sleeping Beauty"" towards the end), not to mention ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". It doesn't seem to have much spirit of its own apart from Robin Williams and his vocal hamming (which was seen as a tour-de-force in its time). There are funny bits and pieces, beautiful designs and scene transitions, and the romance between the young people comes off well. It's a little screechy and a little staid, with illogical rewrites to the Aladdin legend which do nothing but prolong the inevitable; however, the Disney magic is in evidence and the film is satisfying on a non-think level. **1/2 from ****"

","This film tells the story of Aladdin, a vagabond who will use the Genie powers to win the heart of Jasmine, the daughter of the Sultan. Directed by Ron Clements and John Musker, who also ensure the script, it has voice actors as Scott Weinger, Robin Williams and Linda Larkin. With a soundtrack written by Alan Menken, it won two Oscars, for Best Original Song and Best Original Score.<br/><br/>This film, visibly inspired by ""Arabian Nights"" and the Islamic ambiance, is one of the best Disney movies before they started opting for computerization. The script is excellent and is based on the classic impossible love of rich girl with the poor guy. Romantic and original, this film was, for many children, the first contact with a love story. It conveys an important moral maxim: love can overcome all barriers and bring people together.<br/><br/>The characters are deeply interesting: Aladdin is the typical vagabond of humble origin, who knows survive on the streets but has a good heart. Jasmine is a stubborn princess, full of personality. Jafar, the villain, is the Sultan's minister and only thinks of taking power by the easiest possible way. Genie, the genie of the lamp, is a magical character who can do almost anything. Destined to spend eternity serving those who find him, only grants three wishes and is the largest comic element of the film.<br/><br/>The work of designers is excellent, at the level of the best that Disney has ever done. Colorful, with soft but realistic lines, its visually appealing and pleasant. The voice actors did a great job but Robin Williams, who voiced the Genie, deserves a special positive highlight. The soundtrack fulfills her role with great brilliance and stands out over almost the entire film, with musical moments of great quality. One, perhaps the most famous, is ""Arabian Nights"", which comes early in the film. But the most acclaimed by the critic is the song ""A Whole New World"", sung by Aladdin and Jasmine, hoping to discover together the world around them."

","Disney has so many classics, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, but one of the greatest is Aladdin with flying carpets, magical Genies, giant talking sand monsters. Aladdin is beloved by me along with millions of others and it will be loved by many more with this new Diamond DVD. <br/><br/>Aladdin has so many jokes that it makes you laugh, but also has quite a few dramatic scenes that keep you on the edge of your seat with relationships sprouting into wonderful romance. And, it is all wrapped together in one fantastic adventure.<br/><br/>The story begins when a Middle Eastern princess decides she had enough of being stuck in her palace and goes out into the city for once in her life. She goes to the market and gets in a little bit of trouble, thanks to a poor young man named Aladdin. Sadly, he is accused of kidnapping the princess. Now in jail, he and another man manage to escape to go find a massive treasure and most importantly - a Genie bottle. The Genie (our favorite Robin Williams) comes out and grants Aladdin three wishes - now Aladdin can decide what he wants to do.<br/><br/>Aladdin is such a fantastic and entertaining film. The animation is just mind blowing. How good it is, considering that it was made over 20 years ago, how full of emotion the voice actors ate, it is quite different than many other famous Disney animations. With such a famous cast, it is truly a masterpiece. And, quite nostalgic to hear Robin Williams' so recognizable voice as this is one of his most iconic roles. It really shows how he entertained the world with laughter for so many years. The soundtrack in Aladdin is incredible. Each song is catchy and kind of gets stuck in your head (I will show you the woooorld!) and so many of them are now classic songs that people of different generations sing.<br/><br/>This special Diamond edition of Aladdin comes with quite a few bonus features. In one of my favorites, conversations with the casts, I found out a lot of interesting facts such as Scott Weinger, the voice of Aladdin, actually didn't know how to sing when he auditioned for it at the age of 15! There are also several deleted scenes, showing how different they originally planned the film and even a deleted song that was done by Jafar, (Jonathon Freeman)!<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Aladdin releases Genie for the first time and he quickly gets out of his small bottle (he is rather big). I love his first line, ""10,000 years will give you such a crick in the neck!"" I love this scene because instead of ranting about something, he just does his first line as a pretty funny joke, which forever brought this lovable special character into our lives.<br/><br/>Aladdin has something similar to the other Disney animated films in that they are meant for the whole family. So, I recommend it for ages 7 to 18. I wouldn't show it to kids younger than seven because there are a few dramatic scenes that might be frightening for then. It isn't exactly bright and fun throughout the whole film. I give it five out of five stars because this is truly a classic and I love every aspect of it, especially our wonderful Genie who we miss every day.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Gerry O. KIDS FIRST!

","Differentiation between two lovers calls artists and storytellers internationally to express creativity in order to create something revolving around this topic. It's even happening in kids movies as Disney takes this story every American has heard of called ""Aladdin."" Aladdin is a young man in a Middle-Eastern or Moroccan environment who lives in poverty with his monkey Abu. The two steal in order to survive. Princess Jasmine gets tired of being forced to remain in the palace that overlooks the city, causing her to sneak out to the marketplace where she meets Aladdin and forms a friendship that may even be love. Under the orders of the evil Jafar, Aladdin is thrown in jail and becomes caught up in Jafar's plot to rule the land with the aid of a mysterious lamp. Legend has it that only a person who is a ""diamond in the rough"" can retrieve the lamp from the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin might fit that description, but that's not enough to marry the princess, who must by law marry a prince. The plot is pretty sophisticated for a kids film. Children need to understand that this film is about how no matter how much wealth, power or ability you have or don't have, you can still achieve many great things. It also shows how anybody can fall in love no matter how different the two are. What's kind of interesting about ""Aladdin is how controversial it is due to being ""offensive"" to Arab nations due to the dialogue in various songs and the production design of the film. In 1992 The United Sates was just getting off the Persian Gulf War, causing fear of the entire Middle East due to stereotypes and poor judgment. ""Aladdin"" made controversy for portraying the Arab world as dark and cruel but it also showed the beauty of the Arab world and taught us how there is nothing to fear. With all the fine storytelling, were stuck with obnoxious singing and voice overs that never end. Every song is irritating and don't want to end. The plot is also pretty continuous and a bit long for Disney. It feels a lot longer than it is. On top of everything, there are just to many better animated films out there that are handled and directed better than ""Aladdin' and serve a better function."

","Watched this Disney's optimal animation in its BluRay form, a stock-in-trade family crowd- pleaser which has been engineered with an impeccable technique and what's more impressive, it oozes an unceasing force of genuineness to edify both children and adults, no condescending doctrine nor feckless naivety, and Robin Williams' voice-performance as the Genie is a great bonus and plays a big part in the film's classic status among its genre. <br/><br/>To enumerate Genie's potpourri of imitations alone could be cogent enough to showcase the finesse both for the animators and the voice cast, Robin Williams is deadly hilarious, the motormouthed omnipotent servant, massively steals the thunder from everyone else. But it is not a pejorative remark to other players, on the contrary, it has the most effervescent ensemble including a usually trite class-defying mutual attraction between a princess with a lower-status prince charming. Jafar and Iago pair is another hoot apart from Genie, laughters galore!<br/><br/>The plot line entwines pretty much in Disney's safe pattern, a romantic encounter, an abrupt departure, a reunion under the pretense as a legitimate suitor, fighting the evil enemy and happy forever ending, while it really pushes Aladdin to the edge of the cliff since Jafar's invincibility seems to be unbreakable, and the eleventh hour turnover is nothing less than a satisfactory one. <br/><br/>2D animation surely has been largely outcast from the lucrative market, but one can never ascertain there will be a wave of coming back in some years ahead, like Black and White films, their unique aestheticism is the wellspring of their vitality, after watching ALADDIN, it perfectly suffices to originate great mojo of satisfaction for an adult first-time viewer, so the last rites seem to be unnecessary, but a niche market-planning should be conducted for the sake of the laborious craftsmanship. <br/><br/>The film currently sits at No.2 at my top 10 film of 1992, and Williams earns him a fifth slot in the supporting actor race, the one and only voice-performance on my own Oscar list!"

","Aladdin is my favorite movie because of three reasons.
First, the kindness of Aladdin. The most impressive scene is that Aladdin gives poor children bread which he managed to steel. Aladdin is a true gentleman because he is also poor and he doesn't have enough money and food but he did such lines behavior.
Second, the appeal of Genie. I love the scene of Genie's entrance. He comes out from the lamp and starts talking with his pace. And you ciuld be involved in his strange world with his singing and using many magics rhythmically. It could make you happy and smile.
Third, the friendship between Aladdin and Genie. The best scene you could understand the friendship is that Aladdin fights with Jafar and put him into a lamp forever. In this scene, Genie's master is not Aladdin but Jafar. So, Genie couldn't help Aladdin. However, he seems to want to help Aladdin. Finally, Aladdin win the fight with Jafar. I think the key of the victory is the best friendship of them. Aladdin really wants Genie to be free so, he come up with the great idea to win Jafar.
Aladdin makes a last wish that is not for himself but for Genie to be free. He could do that behavior because of his kindness and their friendship. And Aladdin could marry Jasmine without Genie's power. I think someone who is kind to others will be very happy someday. This movie tells you what makes you happy is not money but kind to others."

","Spoiler Alerts: I saw this film three times in the theater, then bought the VHS tape, then the DVD, then the Blu Ray. Yes I am one of those people from the time before cell phones and computers. LOL. I have found this film to be magical on so many level. I always felt there was a tremendous message about being who you are and loving who you are no matter where you come from. I have always loved the music and song of the entire film which is very rare for me. I love that the film was humorous, touching, and highly entertaining. Princess Jasmine is not a typical Disney princess of the past ""looking for a prince to rescue her"" as her character has a voice and is strong and not dependent on a ""man"" to save her. Robin Williams is brilliant as the genie and wonderfully over the top. Aladdin is my all time favorite character who is representative of someone who wants love and happiness as we all do and he learns that ""money"" does not buy that. There is so much in this film about truth, honesty, and integrity. When he frees the genie as his last wish I cry every time."
"Ryan_Barbakins","9","0","0","25 May 2019"," A Dazzling Place of Wonders
","Aladdin is such a fantastic, energetic, exciting, romantic film. The characters are all very lovable and zany in their own fashion (especially Genie).
The 2 main reasons I love this film are, 1: Aladdin's arch in this film is very intriguing. He goes through the journey of changing who he is to impress someone, but finds out that she preferred the unfiltered Aladdin, not Prince Ali. This is not only a great message to children, but also a very compelling journey to be a part of.
And 2: The Genie is Excellent! He is so jumpy and hilarious. He might actually be my favorite Disney character. No other person than Robbin Williams could have made him who he is.
My one complaint with this film, is that Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love with each other after being together for one day. I know it's a love at first site kinda thing, but if they gave more time to develop their relationship, then there would be a lot more hard-hitting moments in the film.
Also this film has A Whole New World. Do I even need to explain?"
"msbreviews","9","0","0","23 May 2019"," Rating: A
","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Aladdin is one of Disney's most adored classics, being the indisputable favorite of many, many fans. The Lion King will always have that spot in my heart, but I also visited this story set in Agrabah dozens of times. Now, with the 2019's remake about to premiere, I rewatched it last night and, once again, I fell in love. Honestly, I didn't remember how funny and entertaining it is! It still holds up incredibly well, even though the film was released almost 30 years ago. The animation still looks stunning and fluid, but it's the musical numbers and the voice work from the cast that makes this movie one of Disney's best.<br/><br/>As it's known, Robin Williams shines in a role that stands out from his brilliant filmography, as his career-best interpretation of an animated character. Genie is one of the most versatile figures of Disney and Williams spreads out his wings of creativeness and imagination, delivering a phenomenal voice performance of the hilarious blue entity. From his seamless imitations to the simple yet extremely difficult tone changes, he gives everything. Genie appears every time the film most needs him, which is when the pacing starts to drop and needs something to pump it back up while moving the plot forward. He could merely be a plot device, but thankfully the writers gave him an unique personality with his own motivations, making us not only laugh with him but genuinely care about his destiny.<br/><br/>That's the other main attribute of this movie: its writing. The dialogues feel realistic, grounded, and there are no real exposition scenes, besides the musical sequences, which are also meant to serve that purpose. Aladdin and Jasmine lived utterly opposite lives, and both wish to change. Each wants the other's life experiences and adventures, which provides some amazing moments between these characters. I still wish their relationship had more time to develop (something I hope the remake will do), as well as Jafar's motivations. It's 1992, and it's an animated film, but the cliche villain who wants power because ""I'm the bad guy"" never quite worked. However, the menacing and dark voice of John Freeman sells this character. In addition to these protagonists, Abu and Iago are two comedy sources that perfectly work, all the time.<br/><br/>Musically, there is no way of denying the cultural impact that the Aladdin songs had. From Arabian Nights to A Whole New World, every song is filled with rich lyrics, great rhythm, and a beautiful tone. Not only are these able to develop the character or move the plot forward, but they also help the story never to break its fast pacing. Almost 30 years later, the animation quality still looks striking, and there are so many memorable backgrounds and visually outstanding settings. Disney's 90s decade is an absolute treasure in movie history: Beauty and the Beast, Toy Story, The Lion King, Pocahontas, Mulan, Tarzan, Aladdin and a few more animated diamonds (in the rough) that went a bit under the radar.<br/><br/>All of these will definitely get a live-action remake (some already have), and I welcome all of them. Stop trying to boycott something that will only help the new generations to fall in love with the same characters that we did. Live-action isn't here to offend our childhood or produce cheap copies of our favorite films! It isn't here to replace the originals but to honor them instead by delivering modern takes on stories that impacted us on a deep emotional level, and that will try to do the same for our children, grandsons and nephews. Are they going to be better than the source material? Worse? It doesn't really matter as long as they keep the original's essence and the traits that made us adore these unforgettable characters. And, please, stop the ""they're doing these remakes for money"" argument. That can literally be said about every movie in the history of cinema. Unfortunately, entertainment is a business, it always was, and it always will be. Move on.<br/><br/>All in all, Aladdin is a beautifully passionate story about how two incredibly different people with two completely different lifestyles can come to love each other by who they truly are. Robin Williams is a perfectly polished diamond and his scenes alone superbly elevate this film. One of Disney most impactful classics, filled with memorable songs, well-written characters, and stunning animation, which holds up remarkably still to this day. Despite some nitpicks regarding Jafar and the protagonists' relationship, Aladdin is undoubtedly an unbelievably precious gem which continues (and will continue) to be loved by newer generations all around the world."

","The US-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee protested over the pro-Western display of Aladdin and Jasmine, who is always without a veil, over the fact that all the characters with the turban are bald, and that all the villains are caricatured personifications of prejudices about the Arabs. But the fiercest protests were caused by a verse from the song ""Arabian Nights,"" which opens the cartoon. The verse now reads ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home"". In the original version, the verse read ""Where they cut off your ears if they don't like your face, it's barbaric, but, hey, it's home"". This provoked such an alarm that the film was placed among the most controversial achievements of all time.<br/><br/>Personally, I find this information quite interesting, but totally irrelevant, because the animation is excellent, the music is beautiful, the story is quite solid, and the film that stars Robin Williams by default can not fail.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The beginning of the ""House of Mouse's"" renaissance era was probably the best few years since their conception. Aladdin contributes to that significantly, with its memorable songs and outstanding voice acting. A street rat is fooled into entering the Cave of Wonders and finds a mystical lamp that summons a genie, granting him three wishes. It's a simple yet effective story of the poor wanting to become wealthy, and soon transforming into something they are not.<br/><br/>Presenting themes of envy and greed through Disney's signature animation style and huge amounts of character development. Almost immediately, each individual harness their own unique personality that make them stand out. Aladdin is this confident homeless man who remains envious of the rich. Jasmine despises the way of life she lives, not wanting to be forcefully married. Jafar, well, he's just the embodiment of evil. And the Genie is the perfect comic relief for what is an often engaging love story. The voice acting alone doesn't get enough credit, mostly because one particular actor steals all the credit. But let's address that, Robin Williams is the Genie. His comedic timing, energetic voice work and all round perfection ensures that he is the only choice for the role. What assists in his memorability are the plethora of songs that this musical boasts. Nearly every single one of them is catchy and instantly recognisable. From the romantic ""A Whole New World"" to the grandeur and flamboyancy of ""Prince Ali"", they all ingeniously progress the story through inventive lyrics. I'll be damned if you don't stand up and burst into ""Never Had A Friend Like Me"" whilst imitating the Genie's exotic dance moves. The hand-drawn animation remains stunning with the occasional CGI object, such as the cave's entrance, complementing this style.<br/><br/>The story itself is well paced and quickly develops during its short ninety minute runtime, however the third act unfortunately runs out of wishes. The showdown with Jafar, the Genie's release from captivity and the inevitable happy ending were all too rushed and concluded the film in an unmemorable way. It was as if Clements and Musker ran out of ideas. Still, for the most part Aladdin exhumes a magical adventure filled with romance, personality and some of Disney's best songs. My hopes for the live action even remotely coming close to this, are slim..."

The top winners (in my opinion) are Mulan, The Lion King, and Atlantis: The Lost Empire. Not only do we get Robin Williams (in one of his best roles along with Mrs. Doubtfire), Gilbert Gottfried (this movie was the first time I'd heard of him), Scott Weinger (Candace Cameron's TV boyfriend from Full House); we also get voice veterans Jim Cummings (of the many 1990s cartoons) and Frank Welker (G1 Megatron).<br/><br/>I did not pay much attention to the Middle East before this film and even though there is some misinformation involved, it's still a somewhat accurate portrayal of the old days in that part of the world. The original Aladdin story took place in Western China (which I later learned has a large Muslim population) but that didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film. But hey, if you want a dose of the 1990s era of Disney this is one of the best. Take a good, long look."

","Aladdin is the story of a poor thief (or Street Rat) he's struggling to make ends meet, but he dreams of the beautiful Princess Jasmine.
The villainous Jafar aims to force Jasmine into marriage so he can rule over Agrabah, however Aladdin discovers a Genie who can grant him wishes, together they aim to stop Jafar.<br/><br/>Starting in '89 with The Little Mermaid Disney was making classic after classic.
Aladdin was definitely one of their best. It was definitely there funniest.
There are several comedic characters, such as Iago, Abu, Magic Carpet and the Sultan.
But none are anywhere near as funny as Genie.<br/><br/>On top of being funny Aladdin also boasts a great soundtrack. Almost every song in this film is great!<br/><br/>While I do feel like it was predictable, telling a story we're al very familiar with. It tells it in such a funny and bright way that's easily overlooked.<br/><br/>Aladdin deserves it's spot on the Walt Disney Animated Studios canon!
Two thumbs up!"

","I like this movie a lot, because it does something for a Disney animated classic, which still holds up: The comedy! <br/><br/>Well, I have listed the great stuff in the headline, but let me just for a moment say about the comedic aspect of this movie. Casting Robin Williams as the Genie was brilliant. In many of the other classics fro Disney I have grown a little out of the comic sidekicks, but not the Genie! <br/><br/>Moving on to the other stuff. Jafar is also a great villain with just the right amount of slimy arrogance to his voice and also a devilish sidekick of Gilbert Gottfried! Brilliant! <br/><br/>The only issue I have is the Arabian and setting and Aladdin's dialog. He is a likable character, but once in a while his cool guy attitude is a little distracting, but it does not ruin the movie. <br/><br/>You know the songs, they are just memorable and catchy. No more, no less. The visuals are also pretty amazing. Watch it, you won't be disappointed."

","Aladdin is a Disney cartoon with a character that we all wish we had as friend, the genie. Aladdin is filled with endless thrills, table turning plans and music that you can't help to like and sing along to. The movie's intro is in form of a narrative, where a merchant tells us the tale of Aladdin and his magic lamp.<br/><br/>This 1992 Disney classic is based on an Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. The idea to make the movie was pitched in by the Late Howard Ashman (who died before the film's release) Ashman has been behind a lot of Disney classics from Oliver & Company, Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast. He was a writer, lyricist and producer and he was the lyricist for ""Arabian Nights"", ""Friend Like Me"", and ""Prince Ali"" used in this movie.<br/><br/>Aladdin's story is about a street boy, who runs into a princess named Jasmine who escaped the palace to see what life was outside the palace walls where you are not told what to do. While they were together Aladdin gets captured by soldiers under the orders of Jafar, the Grand Vizier to the Sultan of Agrabah (Jasmine's father).<br/><br/>Jafar needs Aladdin to retrieve a magical oil lamp containing a genie from the Cave of Wonders.<br/><br/>The movie's story now grows on what happened when Jafar didn't get the lamp but Aladdin did in an attempt to read the inscriptions on the lamp, released the genie and he is given 3 wishes.<br/><br/>As the song goes, you never had a friend like me So it has been, because all through Disney toon history we never found anyone more appealing to have around, Genie is just the best person to have in at corner.<br/><br/>The movie's screenplay explores fantasy, world travel, fireworks and action scenes.<br/><br/>Aladdin was a box office hit, making over $ 500 million dollars in its theatrical run and also gave birth to two direct to DVD sequels and a TV series. Aladdin won numerous awards, especially for its music, it won only two Academy Awards, Best Original Score and Best Original Song for ""A Whole New World"" and it also won four Grammy Awards, Best Soundtrack Album, Song of the Year for ""A Whole New World"", Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal for ""A Whole New World"" and Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media for ""A Whole New World"".<br/><br/>Like it or not, Aladdin boast of the best of the best music, and it was also funny and fun to watch, so if you don't own this DVD you Disney collection is not complete yet.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"

","After making me vote their animated version of ""Beauty And The Beast"" the previous year as ""the worst film that I have ever seen"", Walt Disney Pictures follows up on that flop with their animated version of ""Aladdin."" ""Aladdin"" was a little known fairy tale before the old mouse house popularized it. The story has to deal with the decisions that have to be reached by various characters. There's Aladdin, a young streetwise beggar who has to steal food from the marketplace in order to survive. There's Princess Jasmine who has to find herself a permanent suitor before her next birthday and there's Jafar, a wicked royal vizier who is obsessed with his ambitions to become sultan. These three characters eventually come together and it's not an entirely pretty sight. However, all of this is secondary when compared to the hilarious genie whom Aladdin and Jafar both fight for the ownership of and then there's Iago, Jafar's hilariously smart aleck parrot sidekick. These two characters are the highest points in what a basically just a minor improvement over ""Beauty And The Beast."" As for the rest of it, the songs and other supporting characters are a little weak."

But the animation cannot be actually be called beautiful or the like, and the story is hasty and has no substance, the villain a stereotype, and the ending, as the whole story, predictable.<br/><br/>I guess the only good thing is the genie, and Iago and the flying carpet perhaps. You see, the minor characters are to a certain degree funny and amiable, if you can call genie a minor character, but Aladdin, Jasmin and Jafar are shallow and kind of boring.<br/><br/>Therefore four out of ten stars (quite clement), paying tribute to genie and the music."
"Chromium_5","5","5","21","25 March 2005"," Not that good, actually...
","I don't consider this a Disney ""classic."" I consider it the exact point where Disney started going downhill, and they have yet to come back up (with the exception of ""The Lion King,"" which was great). It is worth noting for the early computer animation, and the excellent voice work by Robin Williams, Gilbert Gottfried, Frank Welker, and Jonathan Freeman, but on the whole, this is nothing but a big Saturday morning cartoon. For one thing, the 2-D artwork is absolute crap. The characters look like they're off of cereal boxes, and even the backgrounds are shoddy. The animation is technically very good, but good animation isn't all that impressive if the characters are crudely drawn to begin with. Compare this to stuff like, say, ""Pinocchio"" to see the huge difference in effort and talent on the artists' part.<br/><br/>For another thing, the songs in this one are horrible. Sure, the tunes are catchy, but has anyone taken time to listen to those LYRICS? ""Arabian nights/ Like Arabian days/ More often than not/ Are hotter than hot/ In a lot of good ways."" Wow, incredible. And how about this moving line: ""Would they see a poor boy? No siree. They'd find out there's so much more to me."" Seriously... ""no siree""!? I can't believe people get paid to write junk like that.<br/><br/>Add the fact that Aladdin and Jasmine, our main characters, are bland and unlikeable, and you have a really bad movie. I remember loving this movie when I saw it in theaters as a kid, but there was a time when Disney movies didn't lose their charm after you turned 13. With the start of movies like ""Aladdin,"" that time is long gone."

Excellent animation - let's hope they keep making 'flat' (traditional) animation as well as the 3D computer-generated pictures.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, this is worth a watch. Really.

"hudsonclarksmith","7","1","2","13 November 2016"," One of Disney's Best
","""Aladdin"" was released in 1992, at the height of Disney's cinematic era. Disney had just made the two greats ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast."" Because of this, it might have been hard for Disney to create a film better than their previous ones, but ""Aladdin"" is so well-made with such great performances, namely Robin Williams as the genie, that it can be compared to such classic Disney animated features like ""Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."" ""Aladdin"" did not start Disney's 'Golden Age', but it did have a lasting impact on animated films still to this day.<br/><br/>Aladdin is a ""street-rat"", or so the movie calls him, that one day falls in love with the princess Jasmine. As with the classic Disney formula of the '90s, he can't marry her because he is not a prince. It seems unoriginal now, but back then it was one of the first times a movie had done that. Jafar is the assistant to the King, and he is a generic secretly evil Disney villain. The movie is interesting enough, until you get to the genie. Once you get the Robin William's genie, the movie explodes into a joyride that you can't take your eyes off. Robin Williams gives one of the best performances of his career as the voice of the genie. Take the genie out of the movie, and it is just another Disney film with a generic plot following the same formula. The genie shows how big a supporting character can be. Although he is only a supporting character, the genie turns ""Aladdin"" from a good movie to a Disney classic. Robin Williams took the genie and made that role his. No one else could have done what Robin Williams did with that character. I hear he ad-libbed so much of his lines that they couldn't even submit the script to the Academy for Best Adapted Screenplay. This goes to show how brilliant of an actor Robin Williams was. The ending is a good one for a movie like this, it is very clever and appealing.<br/><br/>I'm sorry for the short review, but Aladdin is a short movie while still being one of the best Disney animated features of all time. The villain is a bit dull, but the characters are interesting. The genie is by far the highlight of the movie, and the film is worth watching just for Robin William's performance as the genie."

Lion king is best because not so much disappointing as Hercules. However I expect more from Aladdin. P.S this movie shows some graphic images like trying to cut of some one's arm and this movie needs lot of upgrade it's too unsatisfying because it didn't match to lion king and Hercules. if I see the movie I would be less uncomfortable but not so bad as Sailor moon. one thing I like about this movie was genie who is hilarious but Aladdin is not that powerful or smart as Simba who kicked Scar.

"Vartiainen","Null","1","2","20 October 2015"," Animation entertainment perfected
","Aladdin has a long and illustrious legacy. It was a massive hit upon its release, garnering critical acclaim and box office successes one after another. It's still considered to be one of the finest animated films ever made, probably even the best Disney film of all time if not for the film that came directly after it, The Lion King, and it also carries the dubious honour of being the unofficial first Dreamworks film. At least in spirit. Because really, think about it. The jokey mood, the pop culture references, the scope and size of the songs. Aladdin even has that abominable Dreamworks lead character smirk on his face.<br/><br/>Not that any of this lessens the quality of the film in any way. This is a magnificent, huge film, one of my ultimate favourites. I love it, I absolutely love it. Everything in it. Aladdin, Jasmine, the fact that they're the best Disney couple by a comfortable margin. They just click instantly and the bazaar scene with the apple is probably one of the finest in the whole film, and that's saying something. And the rest of them as well. Genie, the carpet, Jafar, the whole crew. I also really love that back then they could make movies such as these. Could you imagine them doing a movie like this, with an all-Arabic cast and setting, nowadays? It'd be a horror show.<br/><br/>The story is also probably the finest adventure story I've ever seen in an animated film, in any film really. It establishes its premise and basic story effortlessly, is immensely enjoyable and easy to follow, yet contains massive depth through its hinted backstory and its characters. A film you can watch over and over, and still enjoy it just as much as you did the first time. And you know we did watch it, over and over again, as children. And yet it's just as good now, when I rewatched it as an adult. Better even, because you finally get why Aladdin and Jasmine click so well, why Aladdin's final ploy against Jafar was the only one possible and oh so very clever, and why the Genie is such a good, tragic character.<br/><br/>You all know this movie. You've all probably seen it multiple times already. But, if you haven't watched it recently, if the last time you saw it was as a child, do rewatch it if you get the chance. You'll be surprised at what you're going to discover within."
"karagoraymond","9","1","2","18 March 2015"," A great film that sums up the career of a great actor
","Not only is Aladdin an incredible stand alone, motion picture, it is also (in my opinion) the greatest performance by an actor we lost too soon. Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Williams as the Genie, made the film, the fact that he improvised so much and left over 16 hours (more than a day) worth of recording just show how much he made the character his own and I love it when actors do that. This is one of the few films where I felt that a supporting character left a greater mark on the film, he was just so animated and probably the funniest Disney character of all time. The sentimental moments between Aladdin and Genie also got me tearing up, particularly at the end.<br/><br/>The other characters were awesome, I honestly believe that this is the Disney film where the two leads have the most chemistry. They just go together, and the fact they are oblivious to whom the other one is but still fall for each other just shows how well they go together. Also, Jafar!!! By far one of the greatest Disney villains of all time. He was funny, menacing and had a devious voice and the contrast between him and Iago A.K.A. The Gilbert Gottfried bird, just made all the more awesome.<br/><br/>The music was good, the three songs ""Friend Like Prince Ali "","" A whole new world and Me"" are all classics, the rest of the songs were unfortunately forgettable.<br/><br/>Overall, Aladdin is great fun, emotional and came at a point when Disney was at its strongest (The Disney Renaissance) and, 22 years on, the Disney magic still holds today."
"Prismark10","7","1","2","22 August 2014"," The Blue Genie
","Two decades on and the animation looks nothing special, the story is rather so-so with the typical Disney flourishes but the Robin Williams voiced Genie is still infectious and makes the movie stand out.<br/><br/>Williams is the heart and soul of this film, his free wheeling manner with rapid fire patter and impressions provided a new benchmark for guest star vocals in cartoons. You almost feel that Williams was ad libbing.<br/><br/>The songs with 'A friend like me' and 'A whole new world' are endlessly hummable, the film has enough pizazz with despicable villains, animal or bird sidekicks but it reaches a higher gear whenever the genie turns up.<br/><br/>Its nice to know Aladdin will in the future enchant a new generation of kids and these kids will hear the hilarity of Robin Williams humour through his characterisation of the genie."

","Aladdin (1992) is one of the finest Hollywood comedies of the 1990s. Not only is it brightly colored, well-animated eye candy, but it's a fun ride, a comic interlude of sorts in-between the grand romance that was Beauty and the Beast (1991) and the epic The Lion King (1994).<br/><br/>Some of the pop culture-based gags have dated, but luckily, this classification of joke does not dominate the film. The humor is well-paced and timed, and no matter how many times you see this film, they never grow stale. The voice-acting is top notch and the songs are all memorable, magnificent, and at times, touching.<br/><br/>After The Emperor's New Groove (2000), I would say this is the funniest Disney film of them all, certainly among the best of the Disney Renaissance of 1989-1999."

","Aladdin is one character I've grown up watching & enjoying when its TV show used to air and it was one of my favourite cartoon series. But only later did I find out that it was the feature film from Disney that started it all. So, there's no doubt that I approached the film with high expectations & yet it managed to deliver on such excellence note that it was a straight shot into my favourite animation films & is one of the finest features to come out from the Disney Renaissance Era.<br/><br/>Set in a fictional sultanate of Agrabah, the film tells the story of Aladdin; a street urchin making his living by stealing foods with his pet monkey named Abu. One day, he accidentally bumps into Princess Jasmine who's disguised as a local civilian, the two fall in love but Jasmine can only marry a prince according to the law. Aladdin soon finds himself arrested & involved in Jafar's (Sultan's attorney) evil plan to retrieve an ancient mysterious oil lamp but the plan goes for a toss when Aladdin unravels the secret about the lamp earlier.<br/><br/>The entire sultanate of Agrabah is beautifully drawn & it looks gorgeous on screen. Every character is wonderfully fleshed out from Aladdin, Jasmine, Abu, Genie, Jafar n others & each one has a vital role to play here but my favourite amongst all was Iago; Jafar's sarcastic, foul- mouthed pet parrot, who was an absolute show-stealer. The beautiful Arabian-themed music & truly enchanting songs also make a strong contribution to the story plus the opening song that commences the film couldn't have done so on a more imposing note.<br/><br/>More than 2 decades have passed since Aladdin first came out but it still hasn't aged a day. It remains as fresh as it did the first time I watched it & is as impressive a story as it is nostalgic for me. On an overall scale, Aladdin is one of the finest animation films from Disney that scores high on all filmmaking aspects & is full of interesting, intriguing characters whom you just can't hate. Although I feel that almost everyone has seen it but in case you haven't, then do yourself a favour & go check it out."
"Stompgal_87","9","1","2","14 March 2014"," A mostly memorable Disney Renaissance feature from my childhood with a great soundtrack
","Alongside 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Peter Pan' and 'Cinderella,' I enjoyed watching this film as a child and I can even remember a lady who used to work with my siblings and me when we were younger giving us a copy of the video. I also received the Musical Masterpiece edition on DVD that came with a free lyrics book a few Christmases ago. This film also has one of the best soundtracks that is on par with those from 'The Little Mermaid (my mum's favourite Disney film and one of mine),' 'Pocahontas (my sister's favourite and also one of mine)', and 'The Lion King (one of my housemate's favourite Disney films as well as this one)'. My top three songs here are 'A Whole New World (the version in the film itself and also the closing credits version plus its beautiful matching incidental music version),' 'Friend Like Me' and 'Prince Ali.' The opening song 'Arabian Nights' was the most authentic-sounding of them all. The rest of the incidental music by Alan Menken was tense and poignant at the right moments if somewhat generic. While this film is memorable for the most part, I found certain scenes and the song 'One Jump Ahead' forgettable, which are some of my only complaints.<br/><br/>Gripes aside for the time being, this film has many positive aspects such as the animation being fluid, detailed and smooth, some stunning backgrounds such as the Cave of Wonders, the palace and its surrounding garden and a mixture of funny and serious moments, the former including antics from the Genie, Abu and Iago and the latter involving Jasmine disagreeing with the rules about marriage. I also liked the fourth wall joke of the camera coming too close to the man introducing the story at the beginning - that really cracked me up. The climax with Jafar, one of Disney's most menacing villains, turning into a snake was creepy yet outstanding. Further to the rest of the characters, Aladdin is a handsome hero, Jasmine is beautiful, sensitive and a bit tough whilst becoming Disney's first non-white princess, Sultan is a strict yet supportive father figure to Jasmine, Abu is mischievous yet cute and funny while the Genie and Iago are as comical as their antics. I also liked the humanistic animation on the magic carpet when it is first introduced. As for the voice acting, Scott Weigner as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, Jonathan Freeman as Jafar, Gilbert Gottfried as Iago and Douglas Seal as Sultan all did respectable jobs with their roles but the standouts were Robin Williams who was humorous as the Genie and the prolific Frank Welker, who provided realistic vocal effects and minor speech for Abu and a sinister, growly voice for the Cave of Wonders. Like the scenes and songs, most of the script is memorable despite including some clichÃ©d moments such as Jafar yelling, ""No!"" when he realises he no longer has the lamp he snatched from Aladdin whilst disguised as an old man (reminds me of the Queen in Snow White disguising herself as an old hag) and the playing of the 'liar revealed' trope when Jafar reveals 'Prince Ali's' true identity to Jasmine; however I like the script including references to other Disney films such as 'The Little Mermaid' when the Genie pulls Sebastian out of a recipe book and possibly 'Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs' (as I already mentioned earlier) and 'The Sword in the Stone' just before Aladdin grabs the magic lamp. The pace is just right as well - the songs just made it fly by.<br/><br/>All in all this is a very enjoyable Disney Classic from my childhood with stunning animation, a superb soundtrack and some funny moments. 9/10."

The boy ends up with a better life, as he finds a beautiful young girl and a Genie too. We seen these Eastern tales so many times, but Disney spices it up with funny pop culture and some high drama too. Jafar and Iago are some of the memorable villains.

Aladdin is the one who possesses this kind of quality, feeding the street children, making justice for them, saving the princess from blade, and did not be beaten by desire. That is what I thought the most significant quality individual should have.<br/><br/>Finally, I want to say, although it is a little bit old animation, please let your children watch it, learn from it, that's the worth of a film like this."
"avsroxbronxfan","10","1","2","8 November 2012"," Truly Disney at their finest.
","Like most kids, I also grew up with Disney films, and Aladdin came out the year I was born. However, that did not stop me from watching this film many times during my life. Ever since I was little, this was my favorite Disney movie. This is an excellent film. It teaches great morals, and executes them very well. The story is about Aladdin falling in love with Princess Jasmine, but finds out she can only marry a prince, due to the law. He acquires a lamp with the Genie inside, and he wishes to become a prince, or should I say, look like one. This is my only problem with the film, but this can be overlooked. Why can't he wish he WAS a prince instead of looking like one? But it moves very well into the moral, so I can excuse this. After finding out he would become Sultan after marrying Jasmine, he decides to try and tell her the truth that he's not actually a prince. It's actually before the villain fight and not at the exact end where we have a moral. I like that. He learns that he needs to be truthful, and was trying to tell Jasmine before Jafar exposes him for who he really is. He also learns to keep promises. Before his first wish with the Genie, he promises him he would use his 3rd wish to free him, and even at the end, the Genie tries to talk him into wishing into a prince again, but Aladdin still frees him, despite unlikely being able to marry Jasmine. Nice guy. That is a fantastic way of telling your morals.<br/><br/>Not only are the morals amazing, but so are the characters, especially Aladdin himself. He starts off as a homeless person on the streets of Agrabah, but he has very impressive smarts. Not only for thievery, but anything in general. I mainly say this because when he defeats Jafar, he says that the Genie has more power than he does, and he can take away his powers. This convinces Jafar to use his third wish to become a genie himself, but gets stuck in his own lamp. I love this guy. He is the textbook definition of genius.<br/><br/>Speaking of smart characters, we also have Jasmine. Her father, the sultan of Agrabah, is trying to rush her into getting married, and tries to bring in many princes to marry her. She hates every single one of them. She doesn't care about the law. If she is to marry, she wants it to be for love. She won't marry anyone. She has to actually care for them. I wouldn't marry someone who attempts to whip little kids either. She also nearly figures out Aladdin not being a prince after the Whole New World song, and Aladdin figures out a good excuse. She's another smart and enjoyable character. I also think she's very hot, but I digress.<br/><br/>The most important part of this love story is that the two have great chemistry. They have things in common, and want to help each other out. Not only that, but when Aladdin is Prince Ali, Jasmine actually hates him at first. However, Aladdin builds up the relationship again, and gets Jasmine to fall in love with him again. This may not be on quite the level Beauty and the Beast was with building up a relationship, but it works fine here. Jasmine does suspect that it's actually Aladdin and not a prince before the carpet ride, and she already cared for him, so this is not rushed. It does well for its own love story, but the film is not just that. It's also an adventure, especially since Jafar tries to kill Aladdin a lot. He tries to in the Cave of Wonders when Aladdin is hanging off a cliff and he gets the lamp, he tries to when Aladdin is with Jasmine, and he does after he becomes a sorcerer, along with after Aladdin returns to the palace.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the film has many things to like about it. It has many great elements in it, and focuses on them in a very coherent manner. It has a great love story, great adventure, great characters, amazing comic relief, and wonderful animation and colors. This is something you can truly call a masterpiece."

","when I was young, I stayed away from this movie. the genie freaked me out like a lot. Now he's a hilarious, giant teddy bear. Jafar's voice used to creep me out too.

I'm glad that I did. The voice acting is fantastic (I just realized that stew from full house did the voice of aladdin-fangirling right now)! The voices are so rich and well timed.

","Aladdin is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and an outstanding voice cast. It is without a doubt one of my favourite Disney films, I loved it as a child and watching it today I still throughly enjoy it. The characters are great and the music is superb, I don't think I will ever forget the lyrics to Whole New World or Friend Like Me. The highlight of the entire movie is without a doubt the Genie, superbly voiced by Robin Williams, who was given the rare opportunity of improvising his lines in an animated film, and that made it turn out so well, the kind of crazy lines delivered by Genie never would have happened if they just got Williams to read from a script. Really fun and a true animated classic, I would recommend Aladdin to anyone looking for a good film for the whole family to enjoy. <br/><br/>A young thief is given the opportunity to be with a princess he is in love with when he finds a magic lamp with a genie that will grant him three wishes."

","I never get tired of this movie - with is excellent animation, brisk plot and, of course, the genius of Robin Williams in his portrayal of Genie. No other Disney movie even comes close to this combination of childhood fun and adult humor like Aladdin. There are more memorable lines in this movie than I can count - ""Exits are here, here, here, here, everywhere!"" - ""I can't believe it, I'm losing to a rug!"" - and the songs are especially memorable, even for Disney. ""Magic Carpet Ride"" and ""Prince Ali"" will get stuck in your head for weeks after. I can't say enough about Aladdin, except I wish Disney still made movies like this! A true ""diamond in the rough"" in the Disney catalog and animated features in general."

But what make's this movie really great is, Robin Williams performance as the comedic, blue Genie. He really steals the show and does a really funny job as he impersonates celebrities including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. He also does a great job doing the singing voice for Genie.

I first saw this film when the two-disc platinum edition came out, I rented it for a weekend at Blockbuster, and had you been around me around that time I would've been watching this movie, or browsing the special features.<br/><br/>This film is so much fun, it has so much action, a lot of laughs, and tons of memorable Songs. I love this movie it's not only my favorite of the Disney animated Features, but in my top 20 favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, Aladdin finds a lamp that holds a genie played by Robin Williams who grants him 3 wishes. One is to become a prince so he can marry Princess Jasmine. Unfortunately the evil Jafar wants the crown too, and he's willing to steal the lamp to do it.<br/><br/>This is a great movie."
"lisafordeay","10","1","2","20 September 2010"," Robin Williams makes this movie the way it is
","OMG I loved this film since I was a kid. I bought the DVD of it 2 years ago and I was so glad that I bought it. The story is about a commoner who stumbles across an enchanted lamp that holds a hilarious blue Genie who grants him 3 wishes. Aladdin falls in love with an Arabian princess who's father wants her to marry but she doesn't want to marry someone that she doesn't love so one day she disguises herself as a commoner and as the people at the marketplace think that Aladdin is a street rat she is smitten by him. I could go on but I am not giving away too many details as some people mightn't even see this film before. Packed with great music and a great message for people who are commoners and that is 'Accept a person who isn't from a royal background and don't pretend to be a prince(which Aladdin did as he was in love with Jasmine and he thinks that she doesn't date or marry nobody's) and that you just have to be yourself. The chemistry between Aladdin & Jasmine is absolutely fantastic and I love the A Whole New World Scene because its so magical. The real star to this movie is of course Robin Williams who was so hilarious in this movie I laughed so hard every time he impersonates someone e.g Jack Nicolsen or that guy that plays the terminator Arnold (I don't know the surname) but having said that he is the best comedian of all time along with Jim Carrey. The animation is very well done and the ballad A Whole New World is so cute. A friend like me & Prince Ali which is both sung by Robin Williams(yes folks he can sing) are so funny I loved it. Aladdin is my 4th favourite movie of all time along with The Little Mermaid, Beauty & the Beast & Enchanted.<br/><br/>Worth watching for all you Disney lovers like me."

","I love Aladdin it has always been my favorite Disney film. It had excellent animation, great voice actors, songs were amazing, and really good characters. I loved every moment of watching it The animation is excellent. When Aladdin came out, they thought it was going to be a huge flop because of the success of beauty and the beast earlier that year. Well it did very well even the animation was great. who ever thought Disney could create excellent scenery for a sandy dessert, a tiger talking cave, a market place, and a flying carpet? Great voice actors all i can say. This proves that Disney doesn't need a list celeberties to play their characters. Yes Aladdin had Robin Wiliams and Scott weigner (steve from FullHouse) and most people probably knew the voice of Iago (forget how to spell his name)and the rest weren't very well known however you don't need well known voice actors to create great characters.<br/><br/>Aladdin has great songs to. Though in my opinion not as great as the lion king songs( because i like Elton's music) it still had great songs. It was also Howard Ashman last music he worked on (though he only did 3) which makes it much more memorable. My favorite songs from Aladdin are A whole new world, One jump ahead, and Friend like me.<br/><br/>I love the characters in Aladdin. They had a handsome lead(Aladdin), a well developed sidekick (Genie), a spunky princess (Jasmine), and a very good villain (Jafar) as well as a great supporting characters. I love Jasmine shes my favorite Disney princess of ALL time. No one can top her.<br/><br/>Aladdin is my personal favorite Disney flick of all time. Though not the best (The lion king is) it will be always be my favorite movie of all time.<br/><br/>9/10"

"Larry41OnEbay-2","7","1","2","31 December 2009"," Rewatchable? Consider the dizzying, elastic miracle wrought by Robin Williams!
","ALADDIN premiered November 25th of 1992 and was both produced and distributed by Disney. It was their 31st animated feature coming right behind THE LITTLE MERMAID and BEAUTY AND THE BEAST and just before THE LION KING. It is based on the Arab folktale of Aladdin and the magic lamp from One Thousand and One Nights. As of today there are actually 27 film versions of this story. Movie buffs point to the 1924 silent film THE THIEF OF BAGDAD starring Douglas Fairbanks Sr. and the 1940 version which had Sabu & Conrad Veidt as two of the best. Back when Walt Disney was still alive and doing his own casting he never wanted to meet the actors face to face before the role was cast. He would stay in his office and have the actors audition into a microphone in another room and have the sound pumped thru speakers into his office so he could only base his judgment on what he heard. This way he could select the best voice to fit the animated characters as he saw them in his head. During script and storyboard development, the writers were already considering Robin Williams for the role of the Genie but had not approached him for the project. In order to convince Williams to do the role, Eric Goldberg animated the Genie doing several minutes of Williams' stand-up routines and screened it for him. Williams was so impressed that he signed almost immediately. Directors Musker and Clements created the Genie with Robin Williams in mind; even though John Candy, Steve Martin, and Eddie Murphy were considered. Unusually for an animated film, much of Williams' dialogue was ad-libbed: for some scenes, Williams was given topics and dialogue suggestions, but allowed to improvise his lines. It was estimated that Williams improvised 52 characters. Eric Goldberg, the supervising animator for the Genie, then reviewed Williams' 16 hours of recorded dialogue and selected the best gags and lines that his crew would create character animation to match. Most critics' praise went to Robin Williams' performance as Genie, with Janet Maslin of The New York Times declaring that children ""needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is"". Warner Bros animator Chuck Jones even called the film ""the funniest feature ever made."" Robin Williams was born in Chicago and educated at Julliard but this stand-up comedian became an over night sensation on TV's Mork & Mindy before going onto acting in films. He has been nominated for four Oscars and won one Academy Award, so far. Roger Ebert said, ""All of the film's best moments come from the genie and the other supporting characters, which include a plump little sultan, his scheming vizier, an angry parrot named Iago, a chattering monkey, a friendly flying carpet, and even a magic cave that turns into a fearsome face so that Aladdin has to venture down its throat. Ever since Jiminy Cricket first danced onto the screen, Disney animators have created entertaining supporting casts, and the magic carpet is one of the most ingenious: with only tassels and body language to work with, it somehow possesses a complete personality, whisking Aladdin on terrifying swoops around the kingdom. The scene-stealing monkey Abu (with noises supplied by Frank Welker) is a particular treat, as when he jealously mimics the Princess or otherwise comments on Aladdin's adventures."" Janet Maslin of the New York Times said, """"Master, I hear and obey,"" said the Genie in the storybook version of ""Aladdin,"" and his comments seldom went further than that. For an exercise in contrast, consider the dizzying, elastic miracle wrought by Robin Williams, Walt Disney Pictures' bravura animators and the Oscar-winning songwriting team of Alan Menken and Howard Ashman in ""Aladdin,"" the studio's latest effort to send the standards for animated children's films into the stratosphere. What will children make of a film whose main attraction -- the Genie himself -- has such obvious parent appeal? They needn't know precisely what Mr. Williams is evoking to understand how funny he is. And the crazily antic pacing of the Genie's outbursts will be utterly familiar to small viewers, even if they can't identify a lightning-fast evocation of ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" What will come through clearly to audiences of any age is the breathless euphoria of Mr. Williams' free associations, in which no subject is off-limits, not even Disney itself."" But this film is not with out controversy: In the opening credits song ARABIAN NIGHTS a line is sung, ""Where they cut off your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home,"" in the original release to video release changed the line to ""Where it's flat and immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but, hey, it's home."""

","Aladdin is the best of the Disney Films. I love this film and truly consider this one of the best films ever made as well as probably the best animated film I have ever seen.<br/><br/>Aladdin is a street rat who must steal in order to make a living. He falls in love with the princess of Agraba, Jasmine. However only a prince can marry a princess. However when the evil sorceress Jafar must use Aladdin to go after a magic lamp, things start to change for Aladdin.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is awesome. The artwork is phenomenal, and the music is legendary. ""A Whole New World"" has to be one of the best songs ever in a film.<br/><br/>Aladdin is a character whom people can get behind. Everybody loves seeing a rags to riches story and this definitely qualifies and makes it that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, is outstanding beyond belief. Williams performance as a voice actor is so epic that the character of Genie actually acts like Robin WIlliams and uses his style of comedy. I have never seen a voice actor perform a character so well that the voice actor actually makes the character act like them. But this is one of those rare instances. I think that is one of the main reasons why this film stands out and it did start the trend of getting big name actors to do voice over work however no celebrity I believe has done it as well as Robin Williams.<br/><br/>Jafar is also a great villain. One of the best of Disney and one that really makes the audience hate him.<br/><br/>Frank Welker also gets to star in this film both as Abu and the Cave of WOnders. THat is great because he is my favorite voice actors.<br/><br/>The action is phenomenal. Comedy is great. Characters are awesome. Highly recommend this film."
"insomniac_rod","9","1","2","4 April 2009"," Simply fantastic!
","Aladdin should be considered amongst Disney's most complete films. The idea of having a movie set in Middle East territories was excellent mainly because Disney knows how to print it's unique style on different cultures around the world.<br/><br/>Aladdin starts powerful with the super ""Arabian Nights"" song, and since then, it gets your attention but most important, sets the mood for the movie. More than half of the movie's atmosphere deals with Robin Williams's marvelous comedic performance. I mean, how could an actor deliver an extremely funny performance as an animated character? Only a talented actor can do that.<br/><br/>The Genie character steals the show as the most charming character, sure; but without such an effective villain like Jaffar, a likable hero like Aladdin, and a very charming and sexy heroine like Jasmine, this movie wouldn't work completely.<br/><br/>Apart from the spectacular and beautiful settings, the movie relies it's success on supporting characters (very likable), a magic and fantastic plot, and best of all, tremendously catchy and quality songs.<br/><br/>The ending will leave you breathless mainly because of it's intensity (loved the Jaffar cobra and master wizard of evil!) and positive message. As it should happen, good triumphs over evil.<br/><br/>This is one of Disney's best and just paves the way for the brilliant and masterpiece ""The Lion King""."

","Disney's Aladdin is a charming animated classic with an inspired manic performance by Robin Williams. This is probably Williams's best voice-work after 'Good Morning Vietnam'. Here he is matched by the remarkably fluid animation. The film is compact and there are no dull segments though Scott Weinger and Linda Larkin are a bit bland as Aladdin and Jasmine. Jonathan Freeman is suitably menacing as the scheming Jafar while Gilbert Gottfried makes a memorable sidekick.

","What an entirely enjoyable family film. ""Aladdin"" is actually pretty close to perfection. The plot is typical for most Disney movies of its type, similar to films such as ""The Little Mermaid"" or ""The Lion King."" As usual, of course, what makes these films great is not the plot but all of the little details throw in to make it fun. In ""Aladdin,"" it's Robin Williams as the Genie that makes the film so great. He steals every scene he is in, moving quickly from one great joke or imitation to another. The reason I like this film so much is because of these scenes. I don't believe there's another actor besides Williams who could have voiced this role so well. Williams fans young and old alike will be entirely delighted and joyful after seeing his performance. This film also has several great original songs, including the Oscar-winning ""A Whole New World"" and ""Never Had a Friend Like Me."" The only real reason the film comes off as less than perfect is because of the last few scenes. I hate snakes, and I think Jafar's transformation into a giant snake toward the end is far too scary for the young audience the film was intended for. If the film hadn't taken this unnecessary step, it could have been perfect in my book. Nevertheless, it is still tons of fun, and one of the funniest and most enjoyable Disney films you will probably ever see.<br/><br/>***1/2 out of ****"

With Aladdin, I expected a completely different film, but being a fan of Robin Willaims, I was not surprised how good it was. I was depressed when they canceled plans on re-releasing the film to Imax like they did with Beauty and the Beast and the Lion king. The film creators found who i think is the best villain actor of all time in Jonathan Freeman(Jafar).

"chrisbishop5000","10","1","2","11 July 2006"," A Whole New World! Beautiful and unique from every angle!
","Nothing on earth could ever compete against this enormous Disney blockbuster. The animation is outstanding, not only are the hand-drawn cartoons rich and detailed with the use of very striking colours but the CGI is incredible as well. The way the Beast has been created that guards the Cave of Wonders looks so real and sinister that it transported me into an entirely different world just sitting in my bedroom and watching it on the telly. It's surprising that it was never shown at IMAX cinemas, but then again, this was 1992 and I shouldn't think IMAX was around then. There is not a single sign of boredom, silliness, cruelty or any other bad points in a film, it's fantastic all over. The characters and the natures of the characters were very well considered and put into deep thought. Aladdin is a carefree young man who is poor and homeless who seems happy and perhaps the sort of boy who is up-to-no-good sometimes but deep down there is a feeling of insecurity and we are able to see how sad he really is. Jasmine has an incredibly strong mind (for a Disney Princess at least) and loses her temper quite easily but deep down she is sick and tired of having her ""life lived for her"" and with these two things, she is charming and rather funny. Jafar is quite different to ordinary Disney villains who'd normally yell ""I'll get you yet! Ha-ha-ha!"" He's dark and mysterious and witty with it, looking at him he looks like he's psychologically poorly when he plots evil schemes and people like that need medical help not being banged up in jail for god's sake! Think how hard it must be for them! I'm sure he's insecure too, at heart. The Genie has got to be the funniest supporting character Disney has ever come up with. Robin Williams, I have to say, was the perfect choice for this bundle of giant, hilarious fun. The Genie looked as if he'd gone a bit off his rocker in some scenes - but that's all the better. Irritating Aladdin, in one or two sequences, had me in hysterics, dressing up as pretty ladies and funny-looking men was side-splitting comedy and there are lots more gags from the Genie that'll always leave me giggling after the film. The Sultan is a rather eccentric, gullible character who tries to find Jasmine her perfect match but doesn't seem to be doing very well as she gets it clear to him that she wants to make her own choice of man, and he also, is very funny, especially when he pinches Aladdin's cheek and a slobbery kind of sound comes from out his mouth. The storyline is very interesting. A golden lamp is hidden in a mysterious cave but only one person may make their entrance and Jafar, to his dismay, is not that person. Who could it be? You guessed it! It's Aladdin! Jasmine escapes her Arabian palace so that she can lead her own life and then accidentally bumps into Aladdin, the man she truly loves. The palace guards arrest Aladdin and Jafar lies to a heartbroken Jasmine that he thought that the street-boy captured her against her will and he has already been put to death. Jafar dresses as an old beggar and takes Aladdin to the cave and promises him a grand reward if he fetched the magic lamp. Aladdin soon becomes trapped in the cave and now he has the chance to find out what is so special about this old, dented lamp - a big genie with a massive personality will answer that question! But despite the fact that his plan has failed Jafar is not going to give up getting his hands on the lamp! Soon enough Aladdin is powerless to put constant stops to Jafar's schemes. If ""Fantasia"" took you on a breathtaking adventure then you really ought to soar away from the normal world with this incredible film-experience. This is just too good to miss! Take it from me, you'll love it."

","'Aladdin' is probably my favorite animated movie of all time. The best thing about the film is that no matter what your age, you'll love this movie because it has everything that makes a great film. It has great voice acting, awesome action, very funny jokes from Robin Williams, a classic story, and a classic romance. Scott Weinger's voice is near perfect as Aladdin. It blends so well with the character, almost seamlessly. The hilight of the film is Robin Williams as the Blue Genie. His jokes are nothing short of hysterical, and there are some jokes that only adults will get. He does an impressive array of impressions including Jack Nicholson and Rodney Dangerfield. The only fault I have is Linda Larkin as Jasmine. She just doesn't seem right, but it isn't that big of a deal. The songs are absolutely spectacular, the best being 'Whole New World'. The film is still as good to me at age 17 as it was at age 7, because it is just so magical and lovable. It's a classic through the ages that I think everyone should watch.

After a wicked alchemist named Jafar - who seeks nothing but power - tricks Aladdin into getting a Genie's lamp out of the ""Cave of Wonders"" (for his own selfish benefit); his plans go awry, and Aladdin winds up keeping the Genie (played by the brilliant Robin Williams).<br/><br/>Trying to win the heart of the beautiful Princess Jasmine, Aladdin asks the Genie to make him a wealthy youth named, ""Prince Ali"". With the Genie's help, Aladdin becomes a hit, and everyone likes him (except Jafar).<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, Aladdin discovers that Jafar has stolen the lamp and had been using it to gain the Sultan's power.

","Aladdin/1992/***1/2<br/><br/>Main Stars: Scott Weinger Robin Williams Linda Larkin<br/><br/>The start of ""classic films"" is exciting. I've done many reviews so far and doing even more is exciting. I've seen a lot of ""classic films"" for my age including a film which I didn't think was so classic, ""Jason and the Argonauts"" (1963). I know for the timeframe that special effects were not too good but I still laughed at how fake the effects (done by Ray Harryhausen) were. Especially when the main character Jason had to fight a dragon and the dragon was pathetic! It looked like clay attacking this horrible actor. Actually, all the acting was horrible in the movie. Great, I wandered off again. Back to the movie I was supposed to review; Aladdin is a great, hilarious, well-acted movie. The only thing wrong with it was that it was too short (at least to me it was). They could have easily made it longer with more comical, great scenes. Don't get me wrong, it was a great movie but I thought some extra scenes could have been added. You're probably thinking that I saw this just to make the review and never before; but actually, I have seen this movie many times before this review was typed. I won't tell you too much, but this movie is about a poor peasant boy (Scott Weinger) who discovers a lamp and the lamp beholds a Genie (Robin Williams) that grants three and only three wishes. Aladdin meets this beautiful princess named Jasmine (Linda Larkin) and wishes to become a prince and marry her. But someone named Jafar and his stupid annoying parrot (voice of Gilbert Godfreed) keeps delaying him. If you haven't seen this movie yet (I doubt it), you should see it now and laugh at the comical scenes and also cry at the songs (""A Whole New World""- by Alan Menken & Tim Rice) but I really didn't cry at the songs at all. Movie directed by John Musker and Ron Clements."
"Catherine_Grace_Zeh","10","1","2","25 November 2005"," Pure Disney classic
","ALADDIN, in my opinion, is a pure Disney classic. If you ask me, Jafar (voice of Jonathan Freeman) was truly diabolical. On the other hand, Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) and Princess Jasmine (voice of Linda Larkin) were truly meant to be together. However, if you ask me, the Genie (voice of Reobin Williams) gave the funniest performance of everyone who acted in the film. I really enjoyed the music, especially ""A Whole New World,"" by Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say everyone involved in this film did very well. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this film that's pure Disney magic to all of you who haven't seen it. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."

They did a tremendous work with brilliant animators in binging Aladdin to Disney.<br/><br/>As like all other Disney movies it has a good story, good script and a great music. Scott Weinger did a tremendous vocal works for giving life to Aladdin. He himself lived in that character. Also Linda Larkin was marvelous as the voice of Jasmine. I liked Gilbert Gottfried's comic villain Iago.<br/><br/>But the man who steals the show is ROBIN WILLIAMS, I can't believe he was the man who did that dominant voice-over for Genie, a true genius! <br/><br/>And music, the soul of Aladdin was created by Alan Menken with the help of Dennis McCarthy. It was the music that gave Aladdin the magical life. With the memorable lyrics of Howard Ashman and Tim Rice summing with those catching tunes how can any one forget the title song, ""A Whole New World"" and ""Prince Ali"" with the top-notch vocal talents of Brad Kane, Lea Salonga, Regina Belle, Peabo Bryson. <br/><br/>But it was Robin Williams whose creativity in this project makes those works extraordinary. His comedy timing and musical talents really shined in every second. It was sad to know that he was paid low in return for his hardships.<br/><br/>For me it's a GREAT Movie in every means.

","Hey I was just kidding there but seriously, Aladdin is one of the best Disney movies ever made. Its my all- time favourite movie and I never tire of watching it millions of times (I'm 17). Every moment is 'red-letter'!!!! I love it so much that I can't even express how good it is right now, but I'll give it a go. Firstly, its totally original and not the stereotypical 'fairytale' like previous Disney films. Its fresh and modern and simply fizzes with energy and light humour. The animation is really special, because the style is unique, too. All the characters are voiced so amazingly that you adore all of them, even the villain Jafar but particularly the Genie- he's a champ. The music is one of Disney's best as well- every song is a favourite of mine, particularly 'A Whole New World'. Aladdin is definitely one of those movies where you know and recite along to all the words and songs because it feels natural that way. So if you haven't seen it yet, don't just sit there reading this, actually buy it!!! You won't regret it- the second disc has stacks of great special features- you have to check it out and see for yourself because its definitely worth it."
"r_torenstra","9","1","2","30 January 2005"," The last true Disney film?
","First of all, I have waited years for the DVD to come out. This is one of my all-time favourite Disney movies, so I was thrilled when it finally arrived. It took a while before I understood why it's one of my favourites, but I think I have nailed it down to a few key points:<br/><br/>Drawing and Animation. It's a clean animation. True old-style Disney, in the sense that there are no straight lines. Everything is curved. Also, the thickness of the drawing line varies, which is not often seen these days.<br/><br/>Plot and character development. It's cute, and that is what it should be. The most dramatic event in a Disney film should be something like Dumbo not being able to reach his mother because his trunk is too short; I dislike the later movies where characters even die.<br/><br/>Sound and music. Many people have mentioned the great voice overs, but I'd like to mention the music. The film is centered around the songs, like the great Broadway musicals. This is pleasing, and what great songs they are! It is without a doubt personal preference, but that is the way I like them. Other Disney favourites include Jungle Book, The Aristocats and Snowwhite, all of which have excellent music.<br/><br/>There are some scenes in the movie that might make it less timeless than other Disney films - Genie impersonates some well-known actors and the like. However funny at this point, it might fade a bit when time goes on. However, I still think this is one of the Disney classics. A true one, because the studio would have you believe that all their movies are classics after a few years have passed, which they are not.<br/><br/>Recommended."

It's worth it because it has so many special features over 2 hours! maybe even more! It's one of the best Disney movies.

","Aladdin. It came out when I was 13, and I have always loved it. Its by far the funniest Disney movie, its got the best music ever, and the one of the best Disney villains too. I had to watch it 9 times in a two day period at work, because they were playing it in the electronics section...I didn't mind, what a treat!!! The music is fantastic, every song is funny, and great to sing along with. (Ive got the lyrics memorized.) Some of the most memorable characters are Jafar, hes so delightfully evil, and that smart-alec parrot Iago, who is annoying, but has such great lines and keeps getting flattened. I also love the Sultan, Jasmines father. Hes cute, and very typical of a worried father, and he is quite funny. The best character IS of course the Genie. This movie has great effects, even for back in 1992, lots of adventure, and I highly recommend it!"

","I saw this movie and loved it when it was released, but when my family and I sat down to watch the 2004 DVD release last night, it was interesting to view this movie in the light of 2004.<br/><br/>The movie itself is good frenetic fun -- very fast-paced, due in large part to Robin Williams' ADD-afflicted Genie. The one-liners and pop culture references fly so fast it's hard to keep on top of them. Still, my kids liked the music and the quick tempo of the movie. I could do without the love ballad ""A Whole New World."" Sounds too dated Disney saccharine these days.<br/><br/>What added a strange sort of twist to the movie was viewing it for the first time in a post-9/11 world. The two primary male characters, Aladdin and Jafar, have distinctly Semitic sidekicks (Gilbert Gottfried as the parrot and the Genie himself, whose delivery is frequently borscht-flavored). Ironic, that. Also, there are quite a lot of references to beheading, and that gave me the heebie-jeebies."

"tiyusufaly","10","1","2","18 October 2002"," Absolutely Amazing.....
","Better than even Beauty and the Beast. Though not as meaningful to me as The Jungle Book, Aladdin is still one of the greatest Disney films I've seen. Amazing music, beautiful scenery, and without competition the greatest Disney villain of all time, Jafar (He could kick Ursula's, Gaston's, or Scar's butts in a second). <br/><br/>Everyone talks of how funny the actors, especially Robin Williams, are. I agree, but people need to realize that Scott Weinger as Aladdin, Linda Larkin as Jasmine, and all the others were great as well. They are all just as good as Robin Williams, but in a different, more dramatic way.<br/><br/>
As usual, the plot of beggar Aladdin and Princess Jasmine fighting for their love is incredible. I can understand how some people would complain that the same old love story is being shown over and over again, but remember, Aladdin was one of the first ""modern"" Disney movies that implemented the love story. Therefore, do not blame this film, blame Disney for creating the same thing year upon year after this pioneer came along (Though personally, I still enjoy some of the love story flicks).   Whoever dislikes this film needs a brain scan done on them.<br/><br/>P.S. My Top Ten Animated Disney Movies of all time: <br/><br/>1)The Jungle Book 2)Aladdin 3)Beauty and the Beast 4)Peter Pan 5)Mulan 6)Tarzan 7)The Lion King 8)Pinocchio 9)Robin Hood 10)The Little Mermaid"

"thousandisland","Null","1","2","10 September 2002"," Good work, though it is starting to look dated.
","I hadn't seen this one in some 4 or 5 years and decided to revisit it... Unfortunately it doesn't hold up well over time, as a lot of the ""pop culture"" references are already outdated.  (Remember when Arsenio had his own show? Remember when Jack Nicholson was thin?) A lot of Genie's impressions of Golden Age actors and TV stars, and even the more recent ones, are showing their age and will probably be wholly obsolete within another 10 or 15 years.  As I watched this movie again I found that the funniest moments were those that didn't exploit the ""present day"" to get their point across.   Iago saying ""NOT!""?.. Ugh.  Does that smack of the early 90s or what?   (Very unpleasantly reminiscent of Little John's ""That's a Gas!"" in Robin Hood..) This will not be one of those timeless movies your grandkids will like 30 years from now, and that's a shame because they could have made it funny *without* branding it with ""1992"".  .. Still, it's enjoyable for a romp nowadays, especially among young adults who actually *remember* when ""Not"" was the height of fashion. (And, by the way, it wouldn't surprise me a bit if the Disney suits decided to just edit that out in future releases of this film...) It's a very colorful movie, too, action packed and almost neon-bright, with CGI that's obvious and glaring and even *more* fun for the people old enough to remember when CGI first came on the scene in animated films.. And later when everybody was so excited about the Ballroom Scene in Beauty and the Beast?  And then everybody started using CGI everywhere and they didn't even bother to blend it in with the rest of the movie because people were so excited about it that they didn't care that it looked obvious?  Remember that?   Yeah, it was right around 1992, wasn't it..?<br/><br/>The animation in 'Aladdin' is nice, but it's another one of those examples of how much LESS energy is put into Disney's yearly releases, as compared to earlier films like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, etc.. Even in 'The Jungle Book' and '101 Dalmatians', both of which are handpainted and ""sketchy-looking"", you can see the difference in quality without even trying.  Hands down, they just took the time to put in more drawings per second, to yield much smoother action.  Some moments in Aladdin look positively cartoony...With Genie especially, the drawings sometimes get a little too loose for comfort.<br/><br/>Some saving graces in 'Aladdin,' though, are the songs and the delightful Magic Carpet, who manages to be funny and quirky-cute without saying a word... (Mercifully so, as the writers would probably have him yakking more damning but wannabe-funny '92isms if only he had a mouth.  ""Carpet's in the HOUSE, Yo!  On the floor!""  Ugh.  (Shudders.)  Carpet is a curious character to find in a movie like ""Aladdin,"" exactly because his charming mannerisms are a relaxed and timeless joy amid the frantic pace and pop-reliant humor of the rest of the film.   I'd wager that, in the future, he and Abu will garner more of the adoration as Genie's shtick starts to go gray.  And please.. PLEASE!!  No more Jim Cummings!!  Please make it stop!"

The new ones aren't the same as the coloring is now done by computer, whereas from 101 Dalmatians (1961)up until The Little Mermaid (1989) it was all done by hand. Lea Salonga does a great duet with Brad Kane in the Academy Award winning song 'A Whole New World' which is definitely the best song in the film, closely followed by 'One Jump Ahead (Reprise)' sung beautifully by Brad Kane, who I hope will do more singing for Disney and other company's, apart from the sequels to Aladdin, as I believe he has the most beautiful male singing voice in the world.

","This was the only Disney movie I can remember, except perhaps for Snow White, which I loved on first viewing AND had an insatiable desire to watch over and over again. Without the Genie, this would be little better than average. Throw in this collection of blue smoke, along with his lamp, and Robin Williams, and you get a very good film.<br/><br/>The inclusion of the Genie makes even the parts without him hold together. Aladdin early on has the attention, and Jafar, as the villain, turns in a creditable performance throughout. The other characters have their moments, but are too reminiscent of other Disney good-guys, even Aladdin sometimes. Disney could at least have made half an effort to be authentic and give all the characters bar the genie Arabian voices, instead of only the bad guys!<br/><br/>The genie allowed Disney to be creative, as he has PHENOMENAL COSMIC POWERS and can do anything, including be very funny. Indeed, his effect rubs off both on Aladdin and his monkey/elephant.<br/><br/>The climax at the end is well set up, as is the fact that someone else (guess who) gains access to the magic lamp. A very strong point is that Disney managed to give the good guys victory WITHOUT killing off the bad guys (I won't say how for those who haven't seen it).<br/><br/>Yep, Disney succeeded with this one: 8/10. Now a word of advice:<br/><br/>DON'T WATCH THE SEQUEL! It was enough to make me stop watching the original (if you want to find out why, read my review for 'The Return of Jafar')."

Williams is in rare form as Disney seems to have let him do whatever he wants, which fits since it is a genie who has been bottled up for so long.

"pvilleguy","5","3","14","8 August 2006"," Perfect illustration
","Many of you have probably read that one of the problems with Disney's animated films after about 1965 or so is the too-great reliance on well-known actors doing the voice work. ""Aladdin"" clearly illustrates the problem. Instead of using the script and skillful animation of facial expressions and other movements to give the characters personality, the current generation of Disney animators relies on identifiable actors to supply the personality for the characters in the process of the voice over. Thus, the Genie, voiced by Robin Williams, overwhelms and dominates the film as Williams tends to do in any film he's a part of. The Genie becomes a fast-talking hip comedian. Great, though it seems more than a little out of place in the context of the general story of Aladdin and his lamp. A similar observation can be made about the parrot, Iago, voiced by Gilbert Gottfried. Of course this is a children's film, but it seems to me that the presence of Williams and Gottfried dumbs this story down rather significantly, turning a story intended to be about the mysteries of the Middle East into a western pop culture fest geared toward short attention spans. I guess Disney studios has a rather low opinion of kids these days, or maybe a low opinion of what they need to inject into films to entertain the parents taking their kids to see these movies."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","2","8","30 December 2009"," Surprised by all the positive comments
","I found this Disney re-working to be an incredibly pedestrian affair, with the animation itself the only truly laudable aspect of the whole affair. The story is changed from the tale of old, and although I don't have a problem with that, the Americanisation of the character Aladdin and the endless spewing of anachronistic pop-culture references by Robin William's hyper-kinetic Genie give the film a plastic, manufactured feel.<br/><br/>If Robin William's manic style of delivery isn't your cup of tea you're going to hate this film. While his character is intensely annoying, he does at least lift the film from the lethargic mire into which it had settled before he makes his belated entrance. The story is boring and predictable, the jokes weak and the songs mostly forgettable. The film's uneasy blending of modern-day materialistic preoccupation and Arabian Knights mythology doesn't work, and its sniffy dismissal of foreign cultures and positive assertion of Western aspirations borders on racism. Only the evil vizier Jafar, reminiscent of Basil Rathbone at his most villainous, scores as a memorable character..."

No! This movie's horrible. I don't understand why it is considered to be one of the best Disney movies ever made, it is just really bad. I've never seen a Disney movie so bad as Aladdin next to The Nightmare Before Christmas & Oliver & Company. Stay Away! It's overrated.

","The daughter of the Sultan must get married soon and she won't pick any of the princes her dad is choosing for her. Meanwhile she sneaks out of the palace and falls for a peasant named Aladdin. Not long after that an evil man named Jafar disguised as an elder convinces Aladdin to do him a favor in return for riches. There is a secret dungeon where only a certain person may enter and inside Aladdin is sent to retrieve a lamp, but after getting the lamp he find the old man won't help him out of this cave and he is stuck inside with the lamp. Soon he find this lamp contains a genie who will grant him three wishes. He must now decide what he wants and what he needs to get him out of that cave, in the eyes and heart of princess Jasmine and in the honor of his new friend the genie.<br/><br/>I have never cared much for this film, for Disney in general to be honest, at least not since the early 80's. I think Robin Williams was the only selling point for me, and he is rather annoying here, as he did most of his lines ad-libbed. I found the story to be rather boring as we'd all seen Aladdin in other movie versions throughout the years. Gilbert Gottfried is perhaps the most annoying human being alive and we have to put up with him here as the parrot.<br/><br/>The movie is flawed through and through, I do like the color and production value and the fact they use c.g.i. and 3-d effects along with their standard animation. I hated the stupid songs, I hate corny songs in Disney films and could've appreciated the film had it not been so over the top and kid like. It could have aimed a bit at kids and adults alike and been more likable, but who am I kidding the movie was a huge success, it just isn't my thing...nice attempt, and good for kids I suppose.. 3/10 stars."
"m-ozfirat","7","1","3","22 November 2015"," Good for Children's entertainment only
","I have to admit though not scrupulous this is none the less an enjoyable film for children that is fun, exotic and entertaining but being Disney uses a classic story to also teach American values in a clichÃ©d format. Being a children's film the characters are well developed and the story line is simple relying on comical humour that children will like and is recommended for the Primary school age group and is a good Disney film. <br/><br/>However despite being a Disney epic I would not say it is a classic film or one for family entertainment as I have seen other Aladdin films that would be better for a more mature and broader audience such as the elegant Japanese version made in the early 1980 as it keeps the story authentic and historical which is important from a cultural and educational standpoint. Despite this the Disney version could of been marketed more as an Eastern Adventure rather then one based on a particular story. <br/><br/>The characters in the Disney version represent Iranian Americans epitomised in the fictional setting of Agrabah and does the story in a superficial manner some examples being Aladdin in the original is not a destitute underdog but a shrewd rogue, the princess is called Badral but Jasmine sounds more American, The story is not set in Iran but in Xinjiang Province now in Western China, Jafar is two characters rolled in to one the haughty vizier and the chief antagonist who is a West African magician."

","I cannot make it any plainer than this: Aladdin is not just a great film, it is one of the top 5 Disney films EVER. Most everyone knows the story: Aladdin, who is a peasant meets and falls in love with Princess Jasmine, who by law can only marry a royal. Jafar, the evil sorceror, uses Aladdin's trusting nature against him to try and steal the magic lamp hidden in the cave, but it doesn't work. Aladdin brings forth the genie and uses the wishes to make him a prince. However, the Genie cannot make Jasmine love him.<br/><br/>Jafar eventually gains control of the lamp and exposes Aladdin as a peasant and it looks like he is going to win and crush everyone. However, his greed destroys him at the last second and Jasmine proclaims her love for Aladdin and chooses him as her husband-to-be.<br/><br/>While that alone would make a great movie, the surrounding characters and nuances are what make it so fantastic. The animation is stunning, made even more so by the fact that it is before current CGI-technology. Second, the supporting characters of Abu, Raja and Iago are hilarious. And, third, the song ""Whole New World"" is simply perfect, one of Disney's crowning greats (both the movie and soundtrack versions are great!) In the end, Aladdin is quite simply the perfect movie, animated or otherwise. It can make adults and kids alike feel joy and happiness and that's what a movie is meant to do. This is a film that I have and will continue to love for as long as I possibly can. Quite simply, this is Disney's crown jewel!!!"

"japamo","8","1","3","26 June 2012"," Is ""Aladdin"" Nothing Without the Genie?
","It's hardly a mystery why the ""Aladdin"" myth attracted Disney's animation crew back in 1992. This timeless story boasts everything: exotic locales, a scrappy hero, flamboyant characters, opulent royalty, giddy romance, despicable and devious villains, and, most tellingly, the endless possibilities of magic as epitomized by the genie. However, as Disney's animators crafted this dynamic spectacle of a movie, I think they must have been concerned that one of ""Aladdin""'s greatest assets -the protean, boundlessly energetic, and fast-talking Genie, as voiced by the inimitable comic pantomiming maelstrom Robin Williams- might ironically turn out to be one of its greatest liabilities. In the Genie, we have a dominating, omnipotent character who can seemingly do anything. So, once Aladdin gets possession of the Genie's lamp, isn't the movie over? Just three wishes, and it's happily ever after.<br/><br/>Besides, doesn't Aladdin succeed solely because of the Genie? You may recall that Aladdin (voice of Scott Weinger) promises to free the unbridled genie with his third wish. However, after the Genie makes him a fabulously wealthy prince on the verge of wooing the Sultan's (Douglas Seale) alluring daughter Princess Jasmine (Linda Larkin) toward matrimony, Aladdin wants to renege on the deal because he feels he cannot continue this ultimate charade without the Genie's continued help. Understandably, this puts the Genie in a funk and leads to a series of plot twists that place the Genie under the control of the ruthlessly ambitious Sultan's vizier (consultant) Jafar (Jonathan Freeman). It seems that Aladdin goes from hero back to hopeless zero.<br/><br/>But hold on thearrrr, as Quick Draw McGraw would say, Disney shows us that Aladdin is not such a hopeless nothing. From the beginning of the film, where we see the penniless orphan and his pilfering simian accomplice Abu (Frank Welker) acrobatically elude the Sultan's security guards led by the burly, irascible Razoul (Jim Cummings), we notice that Aladdin is nimble, clever, street smart, plucky and adaptable. Even after being trapped in the Cave of Wonders by a disguised Jafar (who needs Aladdin to obtain the magic lamp) and finding the lamp, Aladdin tricks the trickster Genie into freeing him without wasting a wish. Furthermore, even the Genie's vast power has its limits. Besides servitude to whoever has the lamp, the Genie informs Aladdin that he has no power over death or love. In other words, he can't be an assassin, or the Messiah, or Cupid. If Aladdin wants to woo Jasmine, he ultimately has to do it on his own. And when Jafar exploits the Genie to become a sultan and sorcerer and uses his power to neutralize his friends, Aladdin again has to find it within himself to defeat Jafar on his own. Instead of false princely status, he uses his courage, sly wit and Jafar's voracious desire for ultimate magic to bring him down.<br/><br/>So you see, ""Aladdin"" belies its ethereal, insubstantial structure and supernatural fantasy elements to remind us that, after all, even if you have true friends to help you along, the true magic to make your life better lies within you."

","We literally wore out 3 Disney VHS editions of this film before it was released on DVD. Now several years later, our youngster watches this film just as much as ever and we enjoy seeing it with him: OVER & OVER & OVER!! SOUNDS GREAT - LOOKS GREAT & IT'S GOT ROBIN WILLIAMS & AN EXCITING PLOT TOO! IN A NUTSHELL: A WHOLE NEW WORLD & IT INCLUDES ROBIN WILLIAMS AS THE GENIE This DVD release of 'Aladdin' by Disney is a treat for audiences regardless of age. It is one of the few films I can think of that both children and their parents may equally enjoy, and this Platinum Edition DVD is the best way I know to bring Aladdin into our homes. WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT: BOY MEETS GIRL - BOY MUST BE WORTHY OF GIRL ON HIS OWN MERITS! Jasmine is 'PRINCESS JASMINE' and she must be married to a prince before her 18th birthday, which is in three days, as the film opens. Needless to say, she is less than excited by the suitors who have presented to claim her. ""Another Stuffed Shirt - Swaggering Peacock"", to use her words. After deciding to runaway - without planning for any expenses or anything for that matter - she runs into Aladdin during a street market fracas caused by her lack of currency, and is saved by Aladdin from the knife point of a greedy merchant. Thinking that Jasmine was just an ordinary girl, Aladdin set his sights on her, but found it was necessary to flee from the palace guards several times with Jasmine in tow. Aladdin discovers to his chagrin, as Jasmine declares her identity to the palace guards, that she is no ordinary girl, which puts her out of Aladdin's reach. BUT THIS IS ONLY WHERE THE STORY BEGINS: ALADDIN: ""THE DIAMOND IN THE ROUGH"" Believe it or not, the film goes along happily for over 40 minutes before Robin Williams makes his entrance as the Genie. By this time we know that Aladdin must elevate his station to attain the hand of 'Princess Jasmine' - but how? A PRINCESS MUST BE MARRIED TO A PRINCE! BUT PRINCE ALI? Acquiring the services of the Genie for three wishes has made it possible for Aladdin to elevate his station rather profoundly by simply wishing for it. So Prince Ali is born, along with a terrific song, lyrics and video action. Unfortunately, wishing does not make one different on the inside, and this Prince Ali charade is doomed from the start. But -- Aladdin will elevate himself and redeem the trust which Princess Jasmine was beginning to place in him, on his own merit. THERE IS STILL MORE--LOTS MORE: ONE CAN'T JUST WISH FOR SELF-IMPROVEMENT-ASK ALADDIN This film has a lovely story and wonderful animation, but it also has Robin Williams who gives a truly over-the-top performance as the Genie. He is the Genie and is so quick and witty and glib that audiences, regardless of age, will really zone in on his delivery. His role clearly demonstrates that one cannot simply change or improve oneself by simply wishing for it. This type of change and improvement comes from within and we go back to the theme 'the diamond in the rough'. No decent hero can be much of a hero without a fiendish and sly villain over whom to prevail. 'Jafar' and his evil sidekick 'Iago' provide the needed balance to present Aladdin with a real obstacle. Jafar readily grabs at the chance to elevate his standing by wishing for it, and first wishes to be the Sultan, then the ""most powerful sorcerer in the world"" and ultimately the ""all-powerful genie"". This leads him down the path that Aladdin did not take and we get to see exactly what Jafar reaps in the end, which demonstrates that the only way to improve oneself is by exerting an honest effort, not just wishing for it. IN THE END: WE GET BACK TO WHERE WE BEGAN. This is a truly wonderful animated family classic to enjoy watching again and again. It combines excellent catchy songs with wonderful video images. Robin Williams as the Genie is incredible which serves to highlight this very worthwhile story and amazing tale."

The stories stopped being interesting, the music became average. To me, it seems like that magical something these animated movies used to have, simply disappeared. But Aladdin puled it off............ the story, although changed a bit, was still entertaining and the music made sense.

My one problem with Aladdin is how insulting it is to the viewer in the way it plays on stereotypes, something Disney has been getting away with too long. I find it rather strange that the only Arabian characters with Arabian accents were the villains, while the good guys all have American accents. For the most part Aladdin is a very enjoyable movie, due in large part to Williams. Most of the songs are very good and fun to listen to. The animation is beautiful as always."

","Not the worst Disney movie, but pretty close. Lacks any real emotional depth, and just replaces it with Robin Williams slapstick. A Whole New World is one of the Disney songs, but a generic even for Disney plot and clear racism counteract that. This movie doesn't have any depth, just some white Indians defeating the evil, dark Indians. Some might commend this movie for being the first one with out an extremely pale Disney princess, but making her skin slightly darker doesn't change the fact that she's an even more out of touch brat. Some people might not like reviewing children's movies, but when a movie is so widely loved like Aladdin, I say it's fair game. Children are gonna like the movie no matter how bad it is, so why not review it for the 13+ demographic?"

","I just recently watched Aladdin for the first time(I'm 15). For some reason, though we owned many Disney movies, Aladdin was never one of them and I was very excited to watch it. I was thoroughly disappointed. The animation was good, but Jasmine looked like an Arabian stripper. What message does this send to the young girls that watch it? Also, the Sultan exclaims many comments about Allah. So, they'll put in comments about Allah but they won't ever put in anything about God? Robin Williams has always freaked me out, so imagining him as the genie kind of ruined the character. They condoned stealing and sneakiness, but maybe it's just the way I view it. Also, I didn't like that they put in very modern stuff for a very early time. I mean, a Disney vacation for an ancient genie? It made the movie kind of cheesy.

"erv-7","5","1","15","8 January 2010"," I think video game was better.
","I become familiar with ""Alladin"" because of Video Game and TV series - I saw the game first, then I saw the TV series, and many years later I finally decided to watch original movie. Honestly, expected much more from this movie, and I still think that overall video game was more interesting (it was my childhood's favorite). Anyway...<br/><br/>Pros: <br/><br/>1) Has 2 or 3 REALLY great songs and musical performances associated with them. ""Prince ALI"" song was spectacular. ""Arabian nights"" was also pretty good, everything else wasn't really interesting.<br/><br/>Cons: <br/><br/>1) The movie heavily uses 3D graphic and CGs. ""Cave of Wonders"" was definitely a 3D animation, same goes for the magic carpet in certain scenes, lava wave, etc. Also it looks like many character were digitally shaded - the shade gradient is way too smooth and just doesn't look right. This looks very bad and out of place. I would prefer hand-drawn animations. For example, modern ""Hellsing"" OVA (the one that is made in 2006) has superior drawing quality, even though it still uses CG from time to time. <br/><br/>2) Very naive, weak plot. Once again, there is a ""power of love that overcomes everything"", couple of banal morality lessons, and a lot of dancing and singing for no reason. Sure, there is a one or two good musical scenes, but other than that overall it looks pretty silly. No real character development, no deep questions, no philosophy, etc. In ""Wonderful Days"", ""Tonami no Totoro"" plot was deeper. <br/><br/>3) Quality of animation wasn't really impressive. Sure, characters have fluid movements, there are some nice backgrounds, but there are not enough details on them. <br/><br/>4) Voices aren't really great and feel a bit out of place. For example, in ""Corpse Bride"" voices were much more fitting.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Probably good movie for young kids, or for the people that value musical scenes in the movies (because some music is really nice).<br/><br/>Not the best pick if you go for animation quality. If you want cool animation, you would probably have to pick something way older. The very first episode of tom and jerry (""Puss gets the boot"") is superior to this movie.<br/><br/>Bad choice if you want something with a deep story."

","LEAVE it to Walt Disney Pictures to teach us something new about an old story. According to the Disney studio, the tale of ""Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp"" did not originate in the collection known as ""The Arabian Nights"" or ""The Thousand and One Nights"" more than 1,000 years ago. Rather, it first appeared in a French storybook of the early 18th century, translated by a scholar who probably learned it from a Syrian colleague.<br/><br/>Just about anything can be grist for the Disney mill, however, from Brothers Grimm classics to contemporary fables. In its new ""Aladdin,"" the studio has done its usual excellent job of making the origin and evolution of its story seem infinitely less relevant than its moment-to-moment impact on the wide screen.<br/><br/>Our hero struts and sings his way through surroundings influenced by centuries-old Persian miniature paintings and Arabian calligraphy - and through it all he seems as modern, accessible, and Disneyesque as if he'd been dreamed up yesterday morning by a Hollywood story consultant.<br/><br/>In this respect as in others, ""Aladdin"" is a worthy successor to such recent Disney hits as ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""Beauty and the Beast,"" which appealed not only to children but also to the grownups who carted them to theaters in astonishing numbers.<br/><br/>The movie won't deepen your understanding of Eastern mythology, Arabic culture, or anything else of consequence, and it's regrettable that negative ethnic stereotypes are reinforced by some aspects of the picture. But since the point of the show is to revel in sheer fantasy, whimsy, and energy, the most sensible response is to sit back and enjoy the evanescent eye candy it provides.
Fewer jobs at City Hall - one way Flynn can begin to arrest the deficit<br/><br/>The title character of ""Aladdin,"" a street thief who wins a princess and vanquishes a vizier with help from a friendly genie, fits the usual Disney pattern. Openly modeled on contemporary media types like Tom Cruise and Michael J. Fox, with a dash of rap-music star M.C. Hammer for good measure, he's simultaneously brash and bashful in ways designed to mirror pop-psychology notions of teenage behavior. Jasmine, the princess of his dreams, is less carefully worked out but equally likable as a personality type.<br/><br/>Typically for a Disney production, though, the movie's best fun arises not from its hero and heroine but from a secondary figure who helps them reach their goals: the hyperactive Genie, modeled directly on the hyperactive Robin Williams, who provides the character's voice. ""Character"" is really the wrong word here, since this Genie is a one-person variety show of imitations, impressions, and Post-Modern pastiches whose voice and appearance can change in the twinkling of a Hollywood edit - mimicking child ren's favorites like Pinocchio, grownup icons like William F. Buckley Jr., and others too numerous to mention or even keep track of. Rarely have Mr. Williams's talents been put to better use, and all this without even showing his face!<br/><br/>Also worth special mention is the music score by composer Alan Menken, lyricist Tom Rice, and the late wordsmith Howard Ashman, who died not long after ""Beauty and the Beast"" was completed. Although there's no single song in ""Aladdin"" that equals the catchiness of ""Under the Sea"" from ""The Little Mermaid"" or the hilarity of ""Gaston"" from ""Beauty and the Beast,"" their work is consistently genial.<br/><br/>When the animators pull out all their stops to match a particularly ebullient song - most notably the ""Friend Like Me"" production number, which recalls ""Be Our Guest"" from the ""Beauty and the Beast"" score - the results are simply dazzling.<br/><br/>All kinds of technical wizardry went into the making of ""Aladdin,"" including computer-generated effects that allow for visual feats (the contortions of an anthropomorphic flying carpet, for example) that would have been impossible a few years ago. Still, most youngsters and parents will care more about the movie's on-screen appearance than its behind-the-scenes calculations, and ""Aladdin"" manages to be spectacular without seeming gratuitous or pretentious.<br/><br/>To my eyes, ""Aladdin"" has less narrative wit and from-the-heart imagination than true Disney classics like ""Pinocchio"" or ""Dumbo"" in years gone by, but such comparisons won't matter to young spectators who take ""Aladdin"" on its own high-stepping terms. Directed by John Musker and Ron Clements, it's the best animated fun of the year, and you don't need a lamp or a genie to enjoy it."
"calspers","8","0","1","1 September 2019"," Absolutely marvelous animation film
","""Aladdin"" (1992) to me is one of Disney Motion Pictures' crowning achievements. First of all, the adapted screenplay is well written, and it has absolutely perfect pacing with interesting character introductions and arcs all around.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film looks absolutely gorgeous, filled with vibrant and warm colour palettes, beautiful portrayals of middle eastern culture milieus, and a stunning level of detail from the city of Agrabah.<br/><br/>The cast is overall great in terms of voice acting (e.g. Jonathan Freeman's performance of Jafar), but the performance by Robin Williams stands out unparalleled as Genie. Williams' role absolutely dominates the experience as Genie, and his signature sense of impeccable humour is vividly sensed through his animated character. As a note, his Easter egg inclusion of Jack Nicholson hitting on a woman is pure improvisational magic.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent animation film from Disney, and deservedly the biggest film of 1992. Within the Disney Motion Picture range of films before Pixar, I think it is only bested by 1994's ""The Lion King""."

","Aladdin is a thoroughly entertaining film, with the theme of being ""trapped"" resonant across all demographics. This is probably the funniest Disney film of the '90s, with a large part of that owing to Robin Williams' ostentatious genie. The incessant references might date the film a little--in fact, I believe Aladdin may be the first children's animation showcasing the trend of gratuitous pop culture references for the sake of a knowing laugh--But I digress, for the movie does manage to find comedy in other places too. Jafar, for example, is probably the perfect Disney villain: sarcastic, maleficent, and creepy as all hell. He inspires most of the action scenes, which are exhilarating and suspenseful mostly because they have a sense of real urgency; Aladdin doesn't just slip out without having a few (or 10) close calls. Many people have complained about Jasmine and Aladdin being bland stock characters, but I don't see that, especially for Jasmine. She was probably the most autonomous Disney princess at the time, and she has grace and charm without being simpering and dependent. All of the characters here are entertaining; even the notoriously grating Gilbert Gottfried as Iago garners quite a few laughs. <br/><br/>The two leads have a palpable chemistry, and are given a classic ballad to develop their relationship (""A Whole New World"" is the best song here), but given Jasmine's obstinacy, could have been given a little bit more time to grow realistically, in my opinion. The short duration of the wooing doesn't impede our ability to see the characters having a happily ever after, though. The ending is saccharine, with the villain getting an ingenious comeuppance and everyone getting their dream's fulfillment, including the Genie, in a surprising show of compassion for a movie that largely focuses on making one's own dreams come true.<br/><br/>The music is also witty and exciting, but isn't as eloquent or stirring as Beauty and the Beast's soundtrack. However, Aladdin's engaging action, characters, and story more than make up for this. Aladdin is a classic tale that'll make you laugh and gasp (it's too sweet of a film to elicit a full on cry), and it definitely deserves a place in the Disney hall of fame (or your movie collection)."

Unknown to Aladdin, he is the only one who can enter and unlock the treasures of a secret cave, including a magical lamp. Aladdin finds the lamp and releases the genie trapped within. The genie offers to grant him three wishes. Meanwhile, Jafar wants the lamp and the Princess has to be married within three days. Many adventures follow...<br/><br/>Reasonably entertaining.

","Aladdin isn't the best movie in the world. There have also been various accusations over the years that it was partially influenced by the terrorist attacks of the Twin Towers and that it's a racist movie. I won't get into some big debate over that because I'm not sure about these accusations myself, but based on the animation and voice acting alone, for a Disney movie, Aladdin certainly isn't bad.<br/><br/>Aladdin is the old story of an orphan and thief living on the streets of Saudia Arabia, dreaming of a life where everything is better for him and his pet money Abu. One day he falls in love with a girl on the street, who is secretly the princess, who escaped her palace to see the real world. After Aladdin is arrested she hears from her ""loyal"" adviser Jafar that Aladdin was beheaded (a lie because Jafar wants to make a dark deal with Aladdin). Horrified, Princess Jasmine avoids Jafar from then on, as does her caring but oblivious, overweight father.<br/><br/>Jafar, disguised as a wizzled up old man, helps Aladdin to escape prison but forces him to go into a mystical cave which closes in on him and Abu, trapping them underground. Luckily for Aladdin, he's saved by a magical genie, and is granted the wish of becoming a wealthy prince, using his new friend to try and get Jasmine's attention - but not if Jafar has his way.<br/><br/>Aladdin isn't the best movie out there, but it sure beats that stupid Ferngully environmental propaganda garbage that came out the same year! Robin Williams as the genie was an excellent voice actor, probably one of his best roles aside from One-Hour Photo (2002). The soundtrack was pretty sappy and cheesy but not the worst, and the animation was excellent."

","Aladdin, while one of Disney's best isn't exactly one of the classics and while definitely an entertaining film, I feel that something is missing. Audio-visually it's top-notch material. Everything looks gorgeous, with beautiful designed & colored environments, great character design and animation, (although inferior to Beauty and the Beast which came one year later), and CG that doesn't look out of place. Voice acting is pretty good and the music breaks, a part that I usually hate about Disney, are surprisingly good, blending some good tunes with some pretty funny scenes.<br/><br/>The classic middle-eastern tale about the wish-granting genie gets a modern facelift and with some great characters thrown into the mix. Jafar is one of Disney's best villains, similar to Scar from The Lion King and the naive Sultan is quite likable. The main couple though could be better. They have some good points of course, like their chemistry, Aladdin's genuinely good character and street-wise wit and Jasmine's strong will and –again- genuine charm. The cons? A somewhat bland romance and their sudden turn from a wise-ass hero and a charming princess to a surfer dude teen and a typical damsel in distress.<br/><br/>The main deal of course is the Genie, which steals the show and for a good reason. R. Williams obnoxiously over-the-top performance fits like a glove to the hyper-lively and wacky character of the Genie who, in my opinion gives what's best about this film. Forget about the romance or Jafar's schemes, Aladdin's finest aspect is its comedy. But is it truly funny? Yes and no. When the Genie isn't around humor is scarce and subtle and when it IS around, while the undoubtedly a funny character, it makes too many modern-day references for the jokes to stand the test of time.<br/><br/>The defining factor for me though is that Aladdin will excite people, (no matter the age), only once in the first viewing. It's one of those films which get less fun to watch as time goes by. The romance is good but forgettable, the villain is great but his power struggle doesn't contain any mystery or plot twists, the action is passable and the comedy while way above average isn't even close to being perfect. All in all a great film for renting, but not something worth buying.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Amongst the Disney's greats not its bests (7/10)"
"Angels_Review","6","0","1","27 December 2013"," One of the better Aladdin movies that came from Disney
","This show has a lot of good things going for it, at least much more then the second movie. The story line follows the book and yet, it has a happier ending then that one. It's not a real spoiler because if you haven't seen this one, you might have never seen this, go out and watch it now. It's a big classic.<br/><br/>The characters are rather filled out, the personalities fleshed out down to little details. It's nice to get back to the classics. Aladdin is the normal Robin Hood character; he almost always looks after people who can't really fend for themselves even if he would go home hungry. Although he's a street rat, he dreams of being part of the world of aristocrats, not starving and able to relax. He is the opposite of Jasmine, who is only trying to get away from it all and be free. Both feel trapped in their own world. I guess in a sense, the Genie is also trapped, so it makes them all more believable. They feel each other's pains and problems.<br/><br/>Jafar is one of the best Disney villains I think. He does all the right moves and yet, sometimes, it seems like he uses Iago a little too much for his ideas.<br/><br/>Some little things are not bothersome in the artwork, when Rasha bights the prince, he has a piece of his boxers even though they are intact when he storms away. Its little things like that that makes it not as good as it could be but when it was drawn on cells, it is easy to excuse them. When they bring in the CG though, it looks rather bad though there aren't many times they use it.<br/><br/>I like some of the voices, Genie's the most though. It's so fun and comical that even at the most drama filled times, he loosens it up. I'm not sure about the music though, it just feels so childish. I mean, it fits the show well but I would have liked a little more adult fashioned songs too."

","Aladdin is Disney's 31st full-length animated feature film released in 1992. Based on the popular Arab folktale, the film follows a young peasant boy named Aladdin (voice by Scott Weinger) and his sidekick Abu (voiced by Frank Welker) who are in search of a life outside of the streets from stealing food and dodging guards every day. Then one day, they meet the beautiful Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin) in the marketplace and after they save her life, they take her to their place and realize that she wants the exact opposite of what they want; a normal life outside of the palace walls. Then, after Aladdin is thrown into prison by the evil Sorcerer Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman), he is unknowingly taken to the Cave of Wonders by Jafar (disguised as an old beggar man) and his wisecracking sidekick Iago to find an ancient magic lamp that unleashes a genie that grants three wishes. After Aladdin and Abu find the lamp and narrowly escape the Cave on the Magic Carpet, they are thrown back into the cave as it crumbles in the ground. In the process however, Abu grabs the magic lamp, gives it to Aladdin and he accidentally rubs the lamp and unleashes the energetic, hilariously funny Genie (voiced by Robin Williams from ""Good Morning, Vietnam"", ""Mrs. Doubtfire"") and chaos ensues!!! This was Disney's fourth film of the Renaissance Era and it's has every element of a classic Disney movie present: great story, unforgettable characters (including one of the best Disney villains of all-time, Jafar), great animation, suspense, great climax, and an awesome score/songs composed by famed Disney composers Alan Menken and Tim Rice (stepping in place of Howard Ashman). The best songs in the movie are ""One Jump Ahead"", ""Prince Ali"", and ""A Whole New World"", played during the magic carpet ride scene. This is yet another one of my favorite Disney movies and my favorite character is the Genie! If you by any chance haven't seen this classic American animated film in the last 20+ years it's been out, all I have to say is: WATCH IT!!! If you need a good Disney film to watch with the family, then I highly recommend this one! Rating: 10/10!!!"

","Just watched this recently, on the new-and-improved DVD which features a restored print, and it looks spectacular. The story is slightly shallower than the best of Disney's films, but this is balanced by the sheer lunacy of Robin Williams' bad, blue Genie. Whoever first thought of putting Robin Williams in a Disney flick should get a Pulitzer, or a Nobel, or something. The comic timing of his riffs combined with the comic timing of the animators transform the Genie from a ""Deus Ex Machina"" into the soul of ""Aladdin."" I have a tiny issue with the fact that the most recent VHS and DVD prints of the movie have bowed to pressure from activist groups and altered a line in the opening song. The original line was, ""...where they cut if your ear if they don't like your face/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" The revised line reads, ""...where the land is immense and the heat is intense/It's barbaric, but hey, it's home."" Protesters claimed the original line perpetuated a negative stereotype of Arab countries and peoples. But...but...but marketplaces and cities in Arabian countries still cut the hands off convicted thieves. And there's even a scene in the film which threatens to relieve the princess of an appendage. They're not being negative; they're being accurate. And, oh yeah, IT'S A CARTOON. But that's just my opinion."

Rice's lyrics are functional and workmanlike - they do not have the panache and zing which Ashman brought to them.<br/><br/>Robin Williams. I love Robin Williams in straight roles, in comedic roles, doing stand up, as a raconteur, but oh how I wish he had not been cast as the genie. It is when the genie arrives on the scene that this film stops being Aladdin and starts being the Robin Williams show. He simply overpowers it. It is a tour de force, certainly, but it is out of place in an ensemble piece, where the characters should be stronger than the individuals voicing them.<br/><br/>For all of that, this is still a pretty good film."

","The story of Aladdin, from a collection of stories dating back more than a millennium, has been filmed dozens of times in dozens of variations. However, none was ever filmed as creatively, humorously and family friendly as Disney Studios did in 1992. The success of the movie owes much to the talents of Robin Williams, whose manic impersonations and characterizations propel this movie along at a frantic pace. Disney also kept the story of Aladdin and Princess Jasmine simple, helping the appeal of the movie. This story is relatively simple, cutting out much of the detail from the original story. Aladdin (voiced by Scott Weinger), is a teenager trying to find enough to eat in Baghdad. Though Aladdin steals food and is a bit of a rogue, he also has a sense of fairness, honor and innocence, a ""diamond in the rough"" that evil Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman) needs to enter the Cave of Wonders to steal the magic lamp. Aladdin enters the cave and finds the lamp, but uses the lamp to escape and become Prince Ali in an attempt to win the heart and hand of Princess Jasmine (voiced by Linda Larkin). As we learn early in the movie, Princess Jasmine wants nothing to do with phonies and princes; she is looking for someone to whom she can give her heart, someone who will understand and love her. Prince Ali is not that person. Jafar wants the power of being the Sultan of Baghdad. His plan is simple, get the lamp, gain absolute power, marry Jasmine, and take over the world; not necessarily in that order. I would be remiss if I failed to mention Jafar's trusty adviser Iago the Parrot, voiced by the always obnoxious and, certainly in the case of this movie, funny Gilbert Gottfried. Perhaps if Jafar had not had a parrot as an adviser, things might have turned out different for him. The animation in this edition of the movie is marvelous. The colors are bright and images are quite clear. This movie is excellent to watch on your big screen television. Another wonderful feature of this movie is the music. The standout song is ""A Whole New World,"" but I also liked ""Prince Ali"" and ""One Jump Ahead."" Alan Menken's score and Tim Rice's music garnered an Oscar for Menken and an Oscar for Menken and Rice. In fact, this movie won 22 significant awards and was nominated for another 15. Aladdin is a good guy trying to survive in a tough world. Princess Jasmine is naïve and innocent. Aladdin's love for Jasmine is pure and teenage and children and teenagers everywhere will identify with Aladdin's angst. The song and dance routines of the Robin Williams' Genie keep the overall tone of this movie light, which is necessary to help balance the evil of Grand Vizier Jafar (voiced by Jonathan Freeman). I recommend this movie for all members of the family except for the very youngest members, who may be frightened by the images of Jafar and the Genie is a couple of the scenes. Most children ages 4 and above should be able to watch this movie with little difficulty. Enjoy!"

Most people and critics alike had applauded the film for being more of a Robin William's movie than caring for the other characters.<br/><br/>The title character (Aladdin) is a street thief with his trusted monkey Abu (voice of Frank Welker) in which the thief must do what he can to survive until he meets a woman who's about to be punish before saving her. What he realizes is that the woman he saved (Jasmine) is a princess in which she must only marry a prince and not some peasant off the streets until Aladdin embarks on a journey with a prisoner of hidden treasures before finding a magic lamp with one insane genie (Robin Williams). Just like any other movie with a genie in a lamp, it's all about the three wishes in which one of them grants Aladdin the wish to be a prince to woo Jasmine.<br/><br/>To me, it's all about Robin Williams and his impersonation of everybody to Groucho Marx, Arsenio Hall, Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone), and anybody you can think of that saves this movie."

Following that was the Academy Award Best Picture nominee ""Beauty and the Beast"", and then this comedy smash.<br/><br/>The entire success of this film is owed to the comic genius of Robin Williams, whose 'performance' is a riot of ad-libbing, satire and slapstick.
