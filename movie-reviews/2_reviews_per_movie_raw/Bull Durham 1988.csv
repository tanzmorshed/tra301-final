"Sargebri","Null","43","54","13 April 2003"," Not Only a Great Sports Film, A Great Film Period
","I remember the first time I saw this film.  I had won tickets from a local radio station and I saw it at a private screening at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  I remember as I was watching it that it was one of the greatest experiences I had in a movie in a long time.  This film is not only a great sports film, but it is one of the great all around films I have ever seen.  This film has it all from romance to comedy to witty dialogue.  Susan Sarandon, Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins all brought Ron Shelton's script to life and the three of them displayed some of the greatest chemistry ever captured on film.  This film is a timeless classic."
"caspian1978","8","33","41","22 April 2005"," A Comedy with much more to offer
","It is nice to see a movie that attracts more than one kind of audience. This is a comedy, then again a love story. This can be placed in the baseball genre as well as a coming of age drama. Most movies claim to be one or the other and sometimes fail to be. Then again, when a good movie hits a homerun it can not only become a money maker and a box office smash, it can also become timeless. Before they became giants of Hollywood, Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins stars in this great movie as some of the most interesting, yet simple characters. Costner plays an aging baseball player who meets with rookie, soon to be great major league pitcher Tim Robbins. Out of the rafters comes Susan Surandon who, in her own may, is a Muse of the religion of baseball. Together, the three introduce three different worlds upon the audience. Each are believable characters even though they are in a way, fantasy like. A great story with a perfect ending, Bull Durham is one of those hard to find movies that is a crowd pleaser with just about every audience out there."
"DanB-4","9","28","38","10 October 2001"," The movie about the love of Baseball
","Crash Davis loves baseball more than it loves him. He believes in the game. He deserves to be in the show, but he isn't and never will be. But still he plays on, dutifully and to a certain extent, joyfully. Better to play crappy A-ball than sell shoes.<br/><br/>That for me is the central theme of this film. It is all summed up when Crash tells Nuke, the wild young star pitcher ""You don't respect yourself. That's your problem. You don't respect the game. That's my problem.""<br/><br/>Take a player that passionate, and a youngster that annoying, add in a sexy yet maternal fan and you have great comedy. Bull Durham works scene after scene, because the film never forgets that baseball is what binds all the characters together.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins is nothing short of brilliant and Nuke Laloosh, the rising star youngster who walks 18 batters and strikes out 18 batters in his first minor league appearance - both league records. But Nuke is caught up in his fat contract, his Porsche, and his endless parade of women. Baseball is a sideline. Eventually, Crash's mentoring begins to pay off until he finally realizes that winning is ""like, you know, better than losing!""<br/><br/>The love triangle between Annie (Susan Sarandon), Crash and Nuke is wonderful and funny, but it mainly provides us with set up for the baseball scenes, like when Sarandon convinces Nuke to wear women's underwear while he pitches. Or my favourite scene, when Annie and Crash take batting practise together, Annie dressed like she is ready for a wedding, but determined to correct Crash's swing. Crash is determined to take Annie home. They flirt and practice batting in one of the best prolonged foreplay scenes ever filmed.<br/><br/>The ending is satisfying but the real depth of this film is harmony that the game brings to the characters. **** out of ****."

","First of I have to say i'm from the UK, i've never played baseball seen a baseball game or have any ideas to the finer rules of baseball but this will not stop you enjoying this film. This film is about a way of life and you can enjoy it in the same way as you can watch a film about a great explorer without ever having left your own country. For Crash, Nuke, Annie and all the other characters in here baseball is a way of life not a sport and it is to be respected and in some cases worshipped. For me the best scene in this movie comes in the pool hall at the end with three generations of baseball player we know that one day nuke, will be in crash's position and that crash will eventually be in the old guys position it's the baseball way of life. Howevever it's a way of life that's changing and this is shown in the almost forlorn at times shot's of the ballpark and main characters, like the lady says you have to respect the ball player who's just trying to finish out the season.<br/><br/>Direction, script and performances (Costner's best performance ever I think even over Field of Dreams and the Untouchables) are superb see this movie you wont regret it. 8/10"
"DeeNine-2","10","20","33","19 May 2002"," A diamond in the rough
","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>I thought I read the book, or at least I dreamed it, but this is NOT adapted from something by Larry McMurtry, although it sure seems like it oughta be. It is one hell of a funny, crafty, too real for life, kind of movie. The brilliant script, full of clever one-liners, was written by Ron Shelton (White Men Can't Jump (1992)), who actually played minor league ball in the Orioles farm system. Shelton also directed and did a bang-up job. This is a funny movie that is really funny.<br/><br/>What I recalled (when I found out this wasn't from Larry McMurtry) was a baseball novel for juniors that I had read when I was a kid about a crafty, veteran minor league catcher who had once made it to the big leagues but got beaned and never got over it, always bailing out from an inside curve ball. (This was in the days before batting helmets.) He fell back to the minors and went from team to team and town to town, hitting a ton until somebody figured out that his knees would buckle if you brushed him back a bit, and then he'd have to move on. Kevin Costner's part reminds me of that guy (without the beaning phobia). <br/><br/>Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a baseball groupie in her sexual prime who likes to read poetry and give the players hitting advice. She is just wonderful as she plays sexy mom to the boys, a new one every summer, just so she can avoid any kind of real relationship or commitment. And so along comes Crash Davis (Kevin Costner, one of the more underrated and less flashy stars of our time), playing an itinerant catcher who has managed to hit nearly 300 minor league home runs. He is tough and savvy and once made it to the Show for 21 days. Tim Robbins plays Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" ""Meat"" LaLoosh, a not too bright, wild-armed phenom who needs more than a little guidance. He gets a lot from both Crash and Annie, who are intent on schooling him in their differing expertise. Nuke is just the hunk Annie needs to keep her from falling in love with Crash, but...well, this is a romantic comedy, so you can be sure that love will find a way.<br/><br/>The baseball shtick and the interior dialogues of Robbins and Costner during the games (""Why's he want the heat? I wanna throw the deuce..."" And, ""Don't think, ... Get that...woman out of your head--Time out!"") are really funny, and the bit where Robbins shakes him off and Costner, as an object lesson for his young pitcher, tells the batter what's coming next allowing the batter to hit it out of the park (or onto the Bull Durham sign to win a free steak dinner--is this genuine Americana or what?) are a crack up. But also great are the scenes with Sarandon as she philosophizes (""I believe in the Church of Baseball"") and wise-cracks her way through the boys of summer, especially the scene where she ties Nuke up in bed and reads him some Walt Whitman. Now THAT really tires the boy out! Another great scene is on the bus when Crash lets the other players know that he once made it to the bigs where ""...you hit white balls for batting practice and the ballparks are like cathedrals."" Beautiful.<br/><br/>Best dead-pan one-liner is when Crash catches Nuke in the locker room trying to adjust the panty hose girdle that Annie has talked him into wearing under his uniform: ""The rose goes in the front, big guy.""<br/><br/>By the way, the great rock and roll soundtrack includes the galvanizing baseball song, ""Brown-Eyed Handsome Man"" by John Fogerty of Creedence Clearwater Revival fame. (Or maybe the title's ""In Center Field"": ""Put me in coach. I'm ready to play, today, in center field."")<br/><br/>It's a shame that Shelton did not win the Oscar for this script, it's really that good. (Ronald Bass won for Rain Man.) The characters are just fascinating and full of life, and not just the three leads. The bit players are funny too, including the hard-talking, middle-brained manager, the mindless pattering coaches, the sweet young groupie girl who makes it with all the players as fast as she can. Even the team clown is good.<br/><br/>The irreverent characterizations, the sweet story, the realistic atmosphere of baseball in small town America (only slightly burlesqued), and some fine acting all rolled together make this one highly diverting little film, actually one of the best baseball films ever made. See this with your best babe. She'll like it as much as you."
"Hey_Sweden","8","5","6","14 June 2013"," Well acted by the trio of stars.
","""Bull Durham"" is one of those engaging sports films that can be enjoyed no matter if one isn't a fan of the sport in question - in this case, baseball. There's all the love in the world for this great American pastime, but there's also some interesting and literate discussions going on all the time in this smart and witty comedy, as well as some memorable characters whom we like and find easy to watch.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays ""Crash"" Davis, a veteran minor league catcher who's hired by the Durham Bulls to act as a mentor to their new pitcher Ebby LaLoosh (Tim Robbins). Ebby is in need of some direction, as he may be truly talented but has ego and discipline problems. At the same time, sexy Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon), the Bulls' loyal groupie, takes an interest in Ebby as she makes a habit of hooking up with one young player every season and helping the man to mature. Naturally, some sparks fly as the two guys both get attracted to Annie.<br/><br/>Writer / director Ron Shelton truly knows the territory, having been a minor league baseball player himself, although he doesn't in truth feature a lot of game action. His dialogue is often very funny and often very profane. A lot of humour comes from Annies' manipulation of the naive Ebby, whom she nicknames ""Nuke"" and has him do things like wear a garter, thinking this will improve his game. And while the film does get serious at times, it never becomes too maudlin. As was said previously, the attraction comes from watching three intriguing characters and three fine performances. With fine support by Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl, Costner, Sarandon, and Robbins make the most of the material. There's also some endearing goofiness from the real-life ""Clown Prince of Baseball"", a man named Max Patkin. And to top it all off, there are some very sexy scenes in this thing, especially towards the end. All in all, this likable story has a little something for everybody, and is well worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","The movie reviews that have been said about this amazing film are quite possibly the least impressive writing that has ever been put down on the internet. If you don't respect baseball you wouldn't like this movie. You may like baseball but unless you respect the sanctity of the games with its quirks and its traditions you won't understand this movie. The plot revolves around what every baseball player dreams of. Sex with an incredible and mysterious women and making it to the highest echelon of players that has ever graced the sanctity of a baseball diamond.<br/><br/>What makes this movie even better is the depth that it goes into. This movie depicts the minor leagues of a yester year and how the game was meant to be played. This marvelous film depicts the struggles that goes on not only with baseball players but with all human beings. The struggle between men and women, teacher and student, and different personalities in a work environment. The parallels between all of life and this movie are great. The baseball is even better. The fact that it doesn't get more respect as a classic is surprising because of America's fascination with baseball and sex.<br/><br/>Costner's speech is the best speech of its kind. The way that he says it could not be delivered by any other performer. Sarandon's character shows how women seek acceptance from men in different ways and even though she is brilliant she still needs to be accepted in a man's world. Robbin's character show the difficulties that an incredible talent has in harnessing that talent into a great career. The way that they address the season and baseball as a business and a love has not and will not be done any other way. The way Costner struggles being a great baseball player and a career Minor Leaguer with an abundance of knowledge and love for the game sets his character apart from any other. The way he finishes out his career by hitting the last dinger that sets the minor league records shows the struggles that exist between a man's love of a child's game and a depiction of what every boy goes through be it high school, college, or a career as a professional baseball player. The monologues that Sarandon's character gives expresses the simplicity of the game as well as how complicated it is along with every other facet of life. This baseball movie is not only baseball but a way of life."

","If you're new to Earth and are wondering which Kevin Costner baseball film to start with, drive past ""Field of Dreams"" and take the exit marked, ""Bull Durham.""<br/><br/>While both great movies, ""Field of Dreams"" requires a dream-like nostalgia for the era and aura of childhood in order to best feel that film inside your bones. ""Bull Durham"" edges it out by summoning outstanding character development across the board, and by supporting Coster's terrific portrayal with elite supporting acting from juggernauts Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins.<br/><br/>This is a classic film, and possibly the best there's been at conjuring the very nuanced American soul of baseball, as well as the unique characters and life-affirming truths our pastime evokes. - (Was this review of use to you?

"anavodnik-57709","8","2","2","21 November 2017"," Very charming movie
","I love how this movie could have gone down the wrong path on so many occasions, yet somehow still managed to pleasantly surprise its viewers by its overwhelming charm and whit. Susan Sarandon wonderfully portrays Annie, a baseball fan who picks a minor league player to sleep with every season, something that sounds, and should be considered trashy and inappropriate. But somehow Susan turns her into this exotic, free-spirited, classy woman who just wants to help the players grow and mold them into big league material because she. Just. Loves. Baseball. <br/><br/>Which brings us to the love triangle. It is common knowledge that in every love triangle someone ends up getting hurt, the woman chooses the man we were all rooting for and the other candidate falls out of the race without anyone batting an eyelid, if not even cheering for his loss. Yet in Bull Durham we see that both Annie and (the man we root for) Crash actually educate the boy who is willing to compete with Crash for Annie's heart. How wonderful is the idea that the person who loses in the race picks up some wisdom from the other two? If all heartbreaks were that productive no one would even mind getting one. And when the boy is not an option anymore we have this rational, disciplined, morally strong man who falls for a woman almost completely opposite to him, but somehow we still see how they fit, and somehow we know he was her first choice, and somehow we feel their chemistry.<br/><br/>I will not comment on the baseball side of the movie because I, admittedly, would have no idea what I'm talking about. I have however read some reviews myself before writing this one, and most of them say the accuracy is impressive."

"jallen52","10","10","19","16 December 2004"," This movie just totally rocks unless you might be a non fan
","Previous reviewer of this movie obviously has no clue about the sport of baseball. The opening monologue by ""Annie Savoy"" is absolutely the best of any movies I've ever seen. The scenes on the playing field are so real I can almost smell the dirt and the grass. Costner and Robbins are both absolutely excellent in their portrayals of frustrated Minor Leaguers trying to get to the ""show"" (i.e. the MAJOR LEAGUES for those of you who do not know the lingo.) and the setting is beautiful; a small southern town where baseball is probably the best thing on Earth because everything else is boredom. Annie Savoy does the best monologue ever known to my ears; her comparsions of baseball to a ""religion"" speak deeply into my heart because I have been a fan since I can remember and I will be until the day I die. The Annie character is also an interesting twist on the necessity of a female figure to calm down too much boiling testosterone.<br/><br/>MLB players like Milton Bradley need an ""Annie Savoy"" - unfortunetely they apparently do not yet; I hope these tortured souls of MLB will someday find an ""Annie"" or at least watch this movie so chairs stop flying into the stands at MLB parks and these guys can get back to the real business of just playing the game.<br/><br/>If you are a serious baseball fan this is a must see; if you're clueless or just don't get the draw of not just the game but of honest ""Americana"" - don't bother; maybe at least try to figure it out."
"RHPSFan","Null","12","24","25 March 1999"," What all baseball movies should be!
","'Bull Durham' is definitely one of those movies you can't get enough of. Not a drama, but more of a sexy, laid back film. Tim Robbins was great in the movie, a little  low on brains, but still very vulnerable. Susan Sarandon was very persuasive in this movie, the kind of a woman all of the guys like. Kevin Costner was so great, his theories were untouchable. A great combination of everything that a movie should have to offer. Gives a new meaning to 'home run', and baseball."
"slightlymad22","7","3","4","12 August 2016"," Kevin Costner Is A Star In The Making
","Continuing my plan to watch every Kevin Costner movie in order, I come to 1988's Bull Durham <br/><br/>Plot In A Paragraph: Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) a baseball fan who takes a new lover each season, finds her life complicated when Crash Davis (KC) an aging catcher is brought to the The Bull Durham's to provide some help for ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) a hot young pitcher who has a great fastball but no control or handle on life. <br/><br/>If there was a list of the best baseball movies of all time, Bull Durham would be up there. Alongside movies such as The Natural, Pride Of The Yankees and of course KC's classic Field Of Dreams, it remains one of the best-loved baseball movies of all time, yet it doesn't really connect with me despite near perfect performances from the three leads. <br/><br/>KC is feeling confident after the success of The Untouchables and it shows in Bull Durham he's a star in the making here, and boy does he know it. Having skyrocketed from near obscurity to fame, Bull Durham gives KC and opportunity to be flashy!! Something he could not do when playing Elliot Ness, and the role of Crash shows a different side to him. It's a role he really seeks his teeth into, and with this performance he emerges as a true star.<br/><br/>I think Surandon should have been nominated for an Oscar for her work here. Her Whitman-quoting, sex-positive Southern belle just oozes confidence and sexuality.<br/><br/>Sarandon and Robbins have been an off-screen couple ever since this movie. Sarandon is older than both her co-stars (at the time of filming, she was 41, Costner was 32, and Robbins was 29), and this is a rare instance in which an over-40 actress is allowed the opportunity to act as a sex symbol. Although there is obvious chemistry between the two, it is surprising that brighter sparks fly between her and Costner. It's a good romantic triangle, though, with plenty of sexual tension. <br/><br/>There are some nice quiet little scenes that for me are some of the best in the movie, as when a player is called into the office and told his contract is not being picked up.<br/><br/>As sports movies go, this one is defiantly unconventional. The genre formula calls for the film to end with a big game, but that doesn't happen here. Instead, Nuke is promoted to the majors, and Crash (his job done) is released. There is no big championship game, no home run or anything. In Bull Durham the baseball is actually the background to the love triangle."
"edwagreen","8","3","4","14 September 2014"," Bull is Durable ***
","You often wonder why certain guys never make it in baseball given the fact that they have potential. We see this in the film.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner is absolutely wonderful as such a player. An experienced catcher, he has what it takes, but only lasted in the major leagues for a brief period. He is resigned to the Durham minor league team where he meets up with fan and announcer Susan Sarandon who acquires a great southern accent for her role.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins is the pitcher that Costner is assigned to work with. His appearances are memorable. Strikeouts and walks are the same high amount. Watch out when he throws, anyone there is vulnerable. That's what happens to the film-the vulnerability of the Sarandon-Costner- Robbins relationship comes into question."

","Some kind of classic, ""Bull Durham's"" an unconventional baseball movie from writer/director Ron Shelton.<br/><br/>Unlike most films in the genre, ""Bull Durham"" lacks a gauzy, sentimental tone, has no time for nostalgia, doesn't overly romanticise the game, is narrated by a woman and focuses on the day-to-day drudgery of life in the minor league circuit. And whilst a disturbingly high number of baseball films indulge in hokey, metaphysical subplots (angels, destiny, vague spiritualism, baseball-as-religion etc), ""Bull Durham"" parodies such things with conversations about quantum physics, new age religions and its cast of silly, superstitious players.<br/><br/>The plot? Susan Sarandon plays Annie Savoy, a teacher and baseball groupie who's stuck in a kind of perpetual adolescence. Trying desperately to prolong the glory days of life on campus, she has a habit of hooking up with young, up-and-coming baseball stars. In this regard she takes Ebby ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) under her wing. Problem is, Nuke is also being groomed by Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), a veteran player who attempts to mould the kid into something special.<br/><br/>Costner and Sarandon create a couple of memorable characters. Legs always agape, and with the vampish hunger of a Bette Davis, she's a Southern firecracker who overwhelms men with her sexuality. Opposite her is Costner's Crash. Armed with wit, Cosnter's trademark khaki trousers with pleats, and an endless knowledge of everything from baseball to garter belts, he's a burnt out middle ager who, like Annie, tries to live vicariously through Crash. The film then ends with Crash and Annie, products of a very 1960s credo of eternal youth, turning their backs on the ""young man's game"". They stop living through surrogates and abandon their hopes of reaching the big leagues.<br/><br/>It's an odd way for a sport's film to end. Whilst most in the genre build up to a climactic showdown, ""Durhum"" sees its heroes fading into anonymity, giving up on eternal youth, appreciating the power of quiet wisdom and sliding into a quiescent, mature relationship. Unsurprisingly, writer/director Ron Shelton played minor league baseball himself during the 1960s.<br/><br/>8/10 â€“ Worth two viewings. See ""Moneyball""."

Music is by Michael Convertino and cinematography by Bobby Byrne.<br/><br/>Annie Savoy (Sarandon), small town groupie of the Durham Bulls minor league baseball team, takes a different player from the team into her bed each year and in the process imparts her considerable knowledge of the game on them. This year is tricky, though, two candidates catch her eye. One is young air-head, but talented, pitcher Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Robbins), the other is the wise older veteran of the leagues Crash Davis (Costner), who has been employed to be the Bulls' catcher and mentor to LaLoosh. Annie and the two men's lives are about to change considerably.<br/><br/>It's a rare old thing is this, a sports movie that manages to be funny, tender, romantic and spirit lifting all in one. Writer/director Ron Shelton draws on his own real life experiences of the minor leagues to tell his story with skill, whilst cloaking it in authentic looking splendour. His tale is boosted by three excellent lead performances from Sarandon (savvy and sexy), Robbins (ebullient naivety) and Costner (charismatic and natural), with the added bite that, refreshingly in a male dominated environment, it's Sarandon's Annie who is the centre of the story (she narrates also). True enough to say that some of the sports dialogue will not be to everyone's liking, erm hello non baseball fans, but in the main it's a wholesome and mature romady that keeps on giving rewards with each subsequent viewing.<br/><br/>Clearly about more than baseball, it's a film that's easy to love and laugh along with. 8.5/10"

","I've avoided this film for years, because I'm no sports fan, but over the years I've read about it, heard it quoted and cited as a film even for people who don't like sports, so last night -- in the mood for a piece of light comedy romance -- I sat down and watched it.<br/><br/>Holy cow, what an experience. There were, I admit, some comic highlights and good lines, but for the most part all that I had throughout were questions: Who ARE these people? What are they TALKING about? What's at stake, here? What an EARTH is Susan Sarandon's character supposed to be? What does she DO? Why is she HERE? What is the damned POINT of all this? Why is Miss Sarandon -- an actress I've loved since I first saw her in ""Atlantic City"" -- so spectacularly bad in this film, popping her eyes and going so over the top it's as if she's engaged in long-distance Tennessee Williams competition? And...what the hell was the point of the character of Tim Robbins' dad? And, finally: when is this going to end? <br/><br/>Sure, I live in the UK, but I spent 13 years in the States, so I have some basic knowledge of baseball, but even I was completely baffled by what was going on. There was nothing here to connect to any aspect of real life, no real human motivation outside of the scriptwriter's manipulation of his characters for whatever his reasons were.<br/><br/>As I said, there were parts that did make me laugh out loud, and I certainly liked Tim Robbins and even, up to a point, Kevin Costner (wildly uneven, though -- check out his couple of lines to Robbins when the latter wakes up from his nightmare on the bus. Was Costner struck over the head with a baseball bat before the cameras rolled?) but on the whole, this seemed like a long, pointless exercise in...well, I can't even say for sure. But, one thing I can say is that I was very, very disappointed, and whatever appeal this film seems to have had completely eluded me."

The only thing I can assume I'm missing is something to do with baseball.<br/><br/>Even films I don't like I can usually find something positive to say about them, but I cannot find a single redeeming feature about this movie.

It goes right along with their real-life backgrounds, especially Sarandon and Robbins. <br/><br/>Soo....instead of an old-fashioned nice sports story, or a clean comedy about baseball, all you get is sleazy dialogue about a female owner of a team whose sole aim is to jump in bed with this promising rookie. And ""promising"" doesn't mean his baseball talent. <br/><br/>The sport takes a back seat to sex in this movie, plain and simple. The dialog is very profane filled with blasphemy and all of that seems to be the real focus of this film, nothing else. It's almost like an ""in"" joke among these elitist Hollywood people who made this. <br/><br/>I am sorry that Costner, who does have some reverence for the game and knows how to play it, lowered himself to play this role. Making fun of baseball, or its owners or players is fine - but this is just below-the-belt humor and not really very funny. This movie is praised way more than it's deserved to be."
"cowboyed","1","8","16","11 February 2019"," Disappointing
","Costner learned to pick better scripts. Replete with profanity and immoral sexual relationships...an most unrealistic view of baseball life. Their truly is nothing special or magical about this movie...but a forum for a low end script with very little creativity. Typically, a script that resorts to foul language has little to offer. Having played high school and college baseball, the content in this movie is not what is lived on the field of dreams. Speaking of which, Costner elevated his game in the Field of Dreams, a far better and more meaningful movie than Bull Durham...which is stupid and a waste of money and time."
"greg_carsten","3","13","30","15 August 2005"," the character of Annie is a self-righteous manipulative whore
","I am not here to dispute the ""baseball as religion"" concept or to criticize the way in which the game was portrayed. I believe Ron Shelton wrote a screenplay based upon his experiences in the minor leagues and feel the balance between baseball as a fun game and as a business/job were overall solid.<br/><br/>Here's my main problem with the film -- the character of Annie is ultimately a self-righteous manipulative whore. While Susan Sarandon is a talented actress, I don't feel her character portrayed passionate fans of baseball in a positive light. I did appreciate that by the end of the film she was going to retire from her life of bedroom spring training, but her character lacked one of two things: either she was too stupid to be the literary scholar she proposed herself to be, or she was too smart to be the baseball tramp she reveled in. I find it hard to believe that her ""screw a ballplayer"" mentality was anything less than self-righteous notches in the bedpost so she could pat herself on the back later. She used the ballplayers for sport and fun (as Kevin Costner's character noted) as men she could control and bully. A comparable male character would be vilified for years as a sexual predator and masochistic abuser, yet we are supposed to laugh when it's done as a woman? Kevin Costner gave a solid performance as the wise, end of career catcher, but the friendships he appeared to have gained in the sport over the years were rarely displayed.<br/><br/>The character Tim Robbins portrayed was basically a dumb, albeit talented, jock. He wasn't smart enough to know he was being used and was essentially a cardboard cutout of a novice player with talent but no brains. Considering the rest of the players got very little screen time, it's hard to comment on them except for the religious ballplayer who married Susan Sarandon's slut-in-training. I can accept it as an unlikely scenario in a comedy, but it's the only male/female relationship I could allow to slide by since the woman wasn't developed as a character very fully.<br/><br/>Overall, I found the game of baseball handled in a good and serious manner befitting the thousands of players currently working in the minor leagues but the portrayal of Annie as a savior and helper of one player per season was despicable via her manipulative use of sex and need for control. Having said that, I'm glad that in Ron Shelton's future films (particularly Tin Cup) he was able to address the complications of the professional athlete's psyche via the use of professional help (Rene Russo's character). Bull Durham ultimately was an exercise in how a self-righteous controlling nymphomaniac baseball fan gets her jollies. How is that entertaining as the cornerstone of a film? Based upon her character, I am unable to recommend this film."

","There's something to be said about Minor League Baseball.While the Major Leagues have their glitz and glamor,the minor leagues are a bit different.It's not so glitzy.It's not so glamorous.Everything having to do with the minor leagues happens on a much smaller scale.For some,like me,the atmosphere of the minors is much more appealing because you don't have a bunch of millionaires out there saying ""look what I can do"".What you do have are guys trying to prove themselves worthy of that next step,the Major League level,which means that they are more likely to be giving their all.Minor league ballparks,depending upon which ones you go to,have a lot to offer as far as fun things to do for the family as far as contests and the like.What Bull Durham does for the average movie watcher is project that very atmosphere that I have just described.When you watch the film,you feel like you are at the ballpark having a blast.The three way interaction between the characters played by Costner,Robbins,and Sarandon is a great display of artistry that no one should miss.There are elements of language and sexuality that some may find offensive as well as slams against Christianity that made me personally uneasy,but otherwise this film is a definite fun time."

","I sometimes get this movie confused with ""Major League""; they came out within a year of each other and quite obviously, they're both baseball films. Now that I've caught up again with this picture, I'll probably be able to keep them apart well enough. ""Major League"" had that great 'Wild Thing' sequence going for it, and it would have helped if this one could have snared a catchy tune of it's own. The closest it came was a brief snippet of Credence Clearwater's 'Center Field' song, but it didn't hang around long enough to make a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Of the three principals, Kevin Costner comes across as having the best character here, but I would have held him in higher regard if he didn't let his libido get in the way when it came to Baseball Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon). With all the sex and profanity in the film, there were times that it felt more like a locker room joke than a story about the national pastime. After Crash Davis (Costner) had his tumble in the hay with Annie toward the end of the story, I had to wonder whether General Mills did the right thing signing off on that box of Wheaties on her kitchen table. I don't think the Breakfast of Champions had that kind of competition in mind.<br/><br/>When the film does broach the 'love of the game', the dialog raises the standard of the picture up a notch, as when Crash describes his twenty one days 'in The Show'. I've heard the term used before, and it does seem to appropriately describe a reverence for making it to the Big Leagues. But then you have a scene in which Crash uses that one word that's a no-no with umpires, and it drags the story back down to the gutter again, at least for this viewer.<br/><br/>As a corollary to my summary line above, uttered by team manager Skip (Trey Wilson) to his hapless team in the early part of the story, Ebby 'Nuke' LaLoosh offers up his own version later on when he eventually makes it to The Show himself - ""Sometimes you win. Sometimes you lose. Sometimes it rains"". For me, this might have been one of those 'sometime it rains' pictures. Considering that Kevin Costner starred in the great Academy Award nominated ""Field of Dreams"" the very year following ""Bull Durham"", this one more closely resembles a strike-out."

I think Magic Johnsons travails which surfaced not too long after the release of this loserfest, officially destroyed the reputation of this movie.

"phantopp","3","9","21","25 February 2009"," Strikes out on laughs
","In Durham, North Carolina, the minor league baseball team, the Durham Bulls, are having a horrible season. However, things may be looking up for the team as they have signed a promising rookie pitcher, ""Ebby Calvin LaLoosh (Tim Robbins).<br/><br/>The team hires a catcher by the name of ""Crash Davis"" (Kevin Costner), who is nearing the end of his professional baseball career in the minors in a career that included three weeks in the major leagues (or ""the show"", as it is known in the minors), to teach the rookie. ""LaLoosh"" also gets some coaching by well-known groupie, ""Annie Savoy"" (Susan Sarandon), who hooks up with a player for the season, which many consider a good thing due to her unusual coaching ways in the sport she legitimately loves.<br/><br/>Although ""Annie"" has picked ""LaLoosh"", whom she gives the nickname ""Nuke"" to, it is getting quite obvious that she is falling for ""Crash"", who is pretty much her intellectual equal.<br/><br/>Now, the two have to battle over the same player, as they try not to act on their attraction for one another.<br/><br/>This is suppose to be a comedy right? Well, where were the laughs? I didn't laugh at all, at any of the jokes. I probably only slightly chuckled at a couple of jokes through the entire movie. The jokes fell completely flat in this movie.<br/><br/>Another thing I noticed in this movie is that it lagged the entire length of the film. The movie is very slow, and pretty boring. Part of the bordom is thanks to the supporting cast.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is completely boring. Not one advance the story, nor do they add to the movie. In fact, the supporting cast subplots do not go anywhere at all. They aren't even developed as much as the three main characters (""Nuke,"" ""Annie"" and ""Crash"").<br/><br/>In fact, the main characters chemistry wasn't that great. Although the performers were good in their roles, there was very little spark between them. I also thought that they had their moments together.<br/><br/>If I'm not mistaken, this is the movie where Sarandon and Robbins became an item. I felt that their on-screen chemistry was a bit weak, especially when she started going after ""Crash."" And I felt no romantic spark between ""Annie"" and ""Crash."" I also found the music was pretty boring. Most of the songs were a little old, to the point that the youngest members of the (adult) audience would not know them. I found that the music didn't really enhance the scenes at all.<br/><br/>I was also unimpressed with the sets used in the movie. ""Annie's"" home was filled with junk, and had way too much of it. I was also disappointed in the baseball scenes.<br/><br/>The scenes on the diamond were just OK. Some had ""Crash"" teach ""Nuke"" some lessons, while some were just game play. I was not impressed with the game play scenes. None of the plays were too exciting, and just didn't do anything to the movie except remind you that this is a movie surrounding a minor league baseball season.<br/><br/>This movie is not for children, especially young ones. There is a lot of sexually-oriented language and some sexual situations. There is some sexual innuendo as well.<br/><br/>I've read that this movie is one of the greatest sports movies of all time. However, it appeared that baseball was not that major in the story itself.<br/><br/>Even the wardrobes were pretty boring. I really could not tell when this movie was suppose to take place. ""Annie's"" outfits looked to be about 30 years older than the rest of the cast's outfits.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is certainly not the classic sports movie that people say it is. I found it boring, and suggest that you see it on regular TV where it is edited for content and time aloud. You won't miss too much."
"Robert_duder","8","5","10","21 August 2005"," A movie about the game
","The tag line for Bull Durham says it all. ""It's all about sex and sport. What else is there?"" Nothing when it comes to this film. That sounds harsh but there really is nothing else to this film!! Films can be made about a sport, or a sport can be made into a film. What I mean is sometimes certain films are made that completely encompasses a sport, it's all about that particular sport and with Bull Durham Costner begins his infamous Baseball trilogy. Bull Durham really does encompass Baseball, both stars Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner show an emotional attachment to the game that is touching and very real. The only other thing that abounds in the film besides baseball is sex...and I wouldn't even call it romance because I didn't feel any romance between the characters just sex based on baseball.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins really gives a stand out performance as Ebby Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh. He's young, self absorbed, hot headed and also gives a great comedy performance because of his character. He truly does a great job and is the only one in the film who comes close to having any sort of chemistry with real life love Susan Sarandon...perhaps that's where the chemistry comes from as they met on this film. He also has a great even better chemistry with Kevin Costner. The two butt heads but support each other and become great friends and it's fun to watch the two of them go head to head. Costner, who has always been one of my favorite actors, does a good job playing Crash Davis. He plays the old timer of the film despite being still young, as far as baseball is concerned he is the mentor of the film. He teaches ""Nuke"" LaLoosh in seemingly harsh lessons but in the end turns him into a big league pitcher. I didn't feel any chemistry whatsoever between Costner and Sarandon but I don't blame him. Sarandon, to me, was so out of place in this film. She has had some wonderful roles in her life but this just wasn't meant for her. I thought she was too old and quite frankly too classy to be playing a ""ball girl."" She was believable as the experienced lover but just not as the tramp she was made to play. I didn't think she made the good female lead.<br/><br/>Ron Shelton who wrote and directed the film did a great job of capturing the spirit of baseball, there is no doubt about that. He created some great characters in Crash Davis and 'Nuke' LaLoosh. Anyone who has a love for baseball is going to in turn love this film but if you're not a fan you might find it a tad drab. Any time Shelton writes or directs he tries to capture the reality of the situation whether it be baseball, basketball (White Men can't Jump), boxing (Play It To The Bone), or police work (Dark Blue and Hollywood Homicide.) He knows about the buddy system and about the topics he creates but Bull Durham is one of his better films. For sports fans a real treat!! 8/10"

Too bad the whole film was not about Max, as a story about his life would make an interesting film. Bull Durham's problem is the script for the rest of the story this film tells is so mediocre. It is not written well enough to hang jokes on.<br/><br/>This film could have been so much better that I think even Costner realized it & went on to do FIELD OF DREAMS in order to try & make the public forget about this effort.

","ALERT: POSSIBLE SPOILER OR TWO <br/><br/>This movie is one of two reasons why I can forgive Kevin Costner for every crap movie he has put out since the release of this film. The other reason is the Untouchables but that's a whole different review. Not that everything he came out with after Bull Durham was crap but I think we can agree that the man has made some floaters since then.<br/><br/>Anyway, to put it bluntly, I think that Bull Durham is probably the best baseball movie I have ever seen thus far. I say thus far because at the time of this writing, I haven't seen Field of Dreams (I know... shoot me. I promise I'll write a review for that one as soon as I see it.) which seems to be a popular choice as well, so until I see that one, this is it for me. Kevin Costner's Crash Davis is a great character, the kind of character that can make a star out of someone overnight if played correctly. Susan Sarandon as Annie was undeniably sexy and Tim Robbins as Nuke LaLoosh was enjoyably dim. The interaction of these three characters with one another provides for some hilarious one liners and moments that anyone can appreciate. This is a baseball movie that isn't only about baseball and I think that's what makes this film so good. Not only is it about baseball but it's also about love. It's about letting go and moving on to something new. It's about accepting your place in the world and making the most of it. The movie plays out very genuinely and while it's a comedy for the most part, it becomes something completely different near the end of the movie, when Crash is cut from the team after fulfilling his duty of mentoring Nuke. That moment of the movie is so heartbreaking that it really lifts the movie to a whole other level. That scene speaks volumes and yet, there's very little dialogue. Costner also delivers a monologue early on in the film regarding his character's beliefs that is probably one of the best monologues ever. The movie has a lot to say and is actually a lot deeper than it looks like on the surface. Every time I watch the movie again, I seem to pick up on something new I never noticed before and I love when a movie doesn't reveal everything so readily. <br/><br/>There's a lot more I can say about this movie but I'll just end it by saying that it is very well-written and directed, the acting is great, it's both hilarious and touching at the same time and most importantly, you don't necessarily need to be a baseball nut to enjoy it. <br/><br/>RATING: ****1/2 out of *****."

","Sports, comedy, and romance make for an unusual combination. 1988 sports rom-com ""Bull Durham"" features an ensemble cast, pleasant blend of genres, and superb writing.<br/><br/>Eccentric Annie (Susan Sarandon) explains in a voice-over narration, she tried most religions until she settled on the Church of Baseball. Each year, Annie selects one player from the Durham Bulls minor league baseball team as her student. During the season, Annie teaches her chosen pupil about baseball, sex, and life.<br/><br/>Rookie phenom Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) joins the Durham Bulls as a talented, albeit unpredictable, pitcher. While he's capable of pitching unrivaled fastballs, LaLoosh lacks control. Seasoned minor league player Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) joins the Bulls roster for the sole purpose of taming Nuke. Shortly after Crash arrives, Annie invites both Nuke and Crash to vie for her company. Crash states that he's a veteran and refuses to ""try out,"" leaving LaLoosh as Annie's over-eager student by default.
Despite the addition of Nuke and Crash to the Bulls lineup, the team begins the season with a strong losing streak. LaLoosh begrudgingly adopts Crash's sage wisdom on the diamond, while accepting Annie's advice in the sheet. By the middle of the season, Nuke matures into a reliable pitcher. Both Annie and Crash teach Nuke the same lesson, but in different ways: to slow down and think less. Meanwhile, Annie and Crash realize that they're a far better pair. Unfortunately, Annie and Nuke remain in a relationship.<br/><br/>Although ""Bull Durham"" derives its name from the Durham Bulls single-A baseball team, the focus is less on sports and more about romance. Baseball merely serves as the backdrop. As a romantic comedy, it's unusual. The passion between Annie and Crash steeps until the third act, defying expectations. Normally, the courtship begins well before the ninth inning.<br/><br/>Still, it's not a flick absent of tropes. Notably, most of these arise on the field and in the locker room. ""Bull Durham"" pits the hotshot rookie (Nuke) against the humble veteran (Crash), while throwing in an impending losing streak. Thankfully, it doesn't dwell on these elements, the lack of a traditional happy ending for Crash further solidifies the mostly cliche-free narrative.<br/><br/>Acting is top-notch. Costner is at the top of his game with a balance of humor and surliness. Sarandon dominates as the esoteric Annie, a character no other actress could have played as believable. As Nuke, Robbins lends nuance to the egocentric yet likable dimwit. From the dialogue and characters, which present a varying degree of both experience and inexperience, it's no surprise that writer-director Ron Shelton spent time playing minor league baseball.<br/><br/>One part rom com with a side of sports and a dash of drama, ""Bull Durham"" is among the finest genre flicks to date. Though not without its clichés, ""Bull Durham"" knocks if out of the park with a major league cast, fantastic narrative, and a few curveballs which ultimately make it a home run."

","""Ebby Calvin LaLoosh"" (Tim Robbins) is a promising young baseball pitcher for the Durham Bulls of the Carolina League who has an awesome fastball but suffers from a severe lack of control. As a result a veteran catcher named ""Crash Davis"" (Kevin Costner) is sent down to the Carolina League to somehow develop him into a first-class, major league pitcher. Along with that the Bull's biggest fan, ""Annie Savoy"" (Susan Sarandon) takes Ebbie into her home to teach him about sex, life and baseball--but not necessarily in that order. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good comedy which benefited from the baseball background to a large extent. I especially liked the performance of Susan Sarandon who was both funny and sexy at the same time. Likewise, both Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins also performed rather well. In short, I thought that this was a pretty good movie and I have rated it accordingly. Above average."

","""Bull Durham"" was released in 1988. It was written and directed by Ron Shelton, who knew his way around an American baseball field, and runs the bases in a swift, witty 108 minutes. It stars Kevin Costner, in what may be the first of his successful sports-themed movies, Susan Sarandon, and a young Tim Robbins, at the outset of his career. It happily combines romantic comedy and baseball: many people still consider this the best movie about the boys of summer. Costner plays a veteran catcher brought in to mentor a talented but wild young pitcher (Robbins). Sarandon plays a teacher and baseball fan that takes one player under her wing (and into her bed) every year, and provides her own baseball wisdom, coaching and life experience!<br/><br/>The director, Ron Shelton does a superb job of bringing this story to life and hopefully satisfying the sports fan and rom-com addict at the same time. Full of some great, witty dialogue and earthy one- liners, this film does have its share of sex and bad language (it is rated 18) so be prepared for that, but it plays with a very natural and fun feeling to it. The most surprising thing to me though is that this isn't necessarily a baseball movie. Sure, the sport in question is baseball, but it could be any other sport, with a young upcomer (Robbins) being coached by experienced veterans (Costner and Sarandon), and the unconventional coaching methods that might be used. Especially by Sarandon's character. <br/><br/>Overall rating: 8 out of 10."
"willcundallreview","7","1","1","18 May 2014"," A fun Romance about Baseball
","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>Bull Durham is a sports film which boasts a great cast, comedy throughout and actually some good bits of baseball. With a variety of characters also seen in this piece, you can't help but feel good when watching this and with Romantic themes also coming thorough, it makes just a little bit better than it already is. Whatever sport movie fans may think of the sport, you should enjoy this and I felt that this was firmly a good movie.<br/><br/>The story is a fun film about a minor league baseball who hire a veteran batsman and a young promising pitcher who may make it big one day, both the characters work together well and the story always lets the two express there polar opinions and feelings. It can be funny at time, not really laugh out loud but it still raises some chuckles and if anything it is very much feel good and smile like entertainment.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner in the main role is good and really shows his wise face as the wise old veteran batsman Crash Davis. Susan Sarandon as the love interest of the film Annie Savoy is good, maybe slightly crazy at times and over the top but she is fun and makes the film much morepassionate. Tim Robbins for me is truly a star turn as Nuke the young pitcher as although Costner leads the film, Robbins is very good in his young testosterone filled role, he is fun and enjoyable. <br/><br/>Ron Shelton writes and directs this well and really does a good job here to create the characters on paper and bring them out well whilst directing, shows he really had the vision and performed it out well. I enjoyed the dialogue which really sets this film up nicely and is the whole reason it is funny, the sport side is fun and the scenes that actually contain Baseball are truly quite thrilling but also keeping the comedic and romantic side within it.<br/><br/>It isn't always so funny and so maybe that could be a criticism but the film is still good, could also be said that the romance side coupled with the serious sport scenes are just too soppy, that is up to you if you see it. Sarandon is also not at her best in this, doesn't affect it's rating but when she is in it, I felt she can annoy at times. <br/><br/>Sport movie fans should like this as it contains enough sport to actually be considered a sport film, it has the romance dabbled in so be aware if you hate a rom com. If you want a fun comedy then this if for you, it isn't out and out laughter as said previously but it raises a quick smile and a laugh but can also warm the heart when it wants to.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 7/10, it is a Firmly Good movie, not near being Very Good but breaks away from just being KIND of Good. With this you should watch it with a little warm heart going into it and it will be hugely enjoyable, If it doesn't make you laugh then look to the romance part as it really can be fun and hugely entertaining."

","Bull Durham is a really good baseball film that doesn't only give you the finer points of baseball, but it supplies the audience with a good amount of well-developed characters. This film is supposed to be a comedy, but I didn't see it as one. Sure, there were some funny moments but I feel this movie should be seen more as a feel-good drama. With a light atmosphere, this film is a great date night film for sure. Even those who don't like baseball would like this film.<br/><br/>Ron Shelton's film is about a 12-year veteran catcher of the minor leagues named Crash Davis who is assigned to mentor hotshot pitcher Ebby ""Nuke."" Along their moments of bondage, they rival each other in getting the attention of Annie who believes in the ""Church of Baseball"" and she has a program where she chooses one player per season to be her lover.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted. Because of his acting abilities and natural athleticism, Kevin Costner does really well in this film. Perhaps one of his finest film roles rivaling Field of Dreams. Tim Robbins, who is a newcomer here, does very well and is quite a dandy to watch. Susan Sarandon has plenty of talent and she makes great use of it here.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is one of the greatest baseball films made. It is not really funny, but more witty. I love the confrontations on the mound between Costner and Robbins since they show such great chemistry. This movie is basically a three-run home run right here. Perhaps one of the finest baseball films to hit this planet thanks to it's big heart and well-developed characters. I rate this film 9/10."

","This is unfairly forgotten sports comedy . It's far better than the more famous and overrated ""Major league"". I'm not exactly a fan of sport comedies , but this one is one of the best I've seen.<br/><br/>The movie really heavily on the trio of stars : Kevin Costner (""Dancing with the wolves"") , Susan Sarandon (""Dead man walking"") and Tim Robbins (""The Shawshank Redemption""). Each of them shines here. Costner is charming and very likable as the smart and bitter old baseball player. Sarandon is incredibly funny as the woman obsessed with baseball and sex . Robbins is very convincing as the incredibly talented , but stuck up young baseball player.<br/><br/>I like that this movie doesn't follow a typical ""from zero to hero"" story that is so often (TOO often) seen in this type of movies. Instead we got here a story about love triangle between two baseball players and baseball fan . The movie is a character comedy and it's fun to see how the characters interact with each other and change during the movie. There is great chemistry between them.<br/><br/>I love the wisecracks from Costner's mouth , Sarandon is HOT and Robbins is adorable when he throws into the bull.<br/><br/>There is some great music here . Soundtrack is full of great songs like: Bill Haley and The Comets ""Rock around the clock"" , Edith Piaf ""Non , je ne regrette rien"" and ""La vie en rose"" , Ike and Tina Turner ""I idolize you"" , The Everly brothers ""When I will be loved"" , Los lobos ""I got loaded"" and Joe Cocker ""Woman loves a man"".<br/><br/>The only thing that I didn't like is the religious approach to the baseball. I'm not a fan of baseball and I couldn't really relate to it, but the baseball fans probably will be happy.<br/><br/>A very pleasant , charming and enjoyable comedy. Good way to spend your time.

","A blend of comedy, drama and romance, Bull Durham follows the intertwining of three lives brought together by the great American pastime. It is based upon the minor league experiences of writer/director Ron Shelton and depicts the players and fans of the Durham Bulls, a minor league baseball team in Durham, North Carolina. The movie stars Kevin Costner as ""Crash"" Davis, a veteran catcher brought in to teach rookie pitcher Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh about the game in preparation for reaching the Major Leagues. Baseball groupie Annie Savoy romances Nuke but finds herself increasingly attracted to Crash. Also featured are Robert Wuhl and Trey Wilson, as well as popular baseball ""clown"" Max Patkin.<br/><br/>Crash Davis is a perennial Minor Leaguer assigned to the Durham Bulls, a hapless team with a long tradition of mediocrity. There he tutors a young, dim-witted pitching prodigy, Nuke LaLoosh in the ways of baseball, life, and love. Each strikes up a romance with Annie, the team's ""mascot"" who takes it upon herself to sleep with a new player every season. Each has his/her own conflict: Crash struggles to end his career with some measure of dignity; Nuke struggles to make it to the ""big show""; and Annie struggles to find something more than a roll in the hay and of course, Crash and Nuke come into conflict over Annie's affections to further complicate matters. <br/><br/>Kevin Costner at his funniest and most charismatic in Bull Durham, a film that's as wise about relationships as it is about minor league baseball.Also,aside from classic performances, witty and insightful script, this is about so much more than baseball and will no doubt prove to be a quiet classic.Obviously,it deserves its status among sports films, but its ongoing appeal reflects that it's something more: an old- fashioned romantic comedy that succeeds in establishing and deepening memorable characters through memorably flavorful dialogue."
"Ben_Cheshire","4","9","25","30 July 2004"," Makes ambitious promises to show baseball as a religion, and like sex, but then resorts to sport movie and love triangle cliches.
","Baseball groupie Susan Sarandon only sleeps with one player a season: Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner both want to be that player. Except Costner refuses to compete - and now his assignment of getting star pitcher Robbins to buckle down and concentrate on Baseball is made much harder...<br/><br/>It starts well, with Sarandon's voiceover making these big promises to liken baseball to sex and religion, with a church choir playing in the background as the camera looks at various shrines in her room. I was so excited seeing this that when the movie turned out to be just another love triangle losing-team-triumphs sports movie, I was very disappointed.<br/><br/>There is still sex and superstition in it, but the film doesn't really fulfill its promise to demonstrate to me how baseball could be a religion to anybody except the players. Here's why:<br/><br/>1) The only two non-player characters we meet are a slut who sleeps with all and any of the players and Susan Sarandon, who only sleeps with one player a season, and is always in the power position, so she's more like a sexual predator. In introducing actual sex, the screenwriters have made it impossible for us to see how baseball could compare. We get the sense that sleeping with the men, and watching them play baseball are two completely different interests for these women.<br/><br/>2) The story is too small-scale to fulfill Sarandon's promises. We never get these global, grande feeling that baseball means more than just hitting balls and boredom. We only experience these few characters.<br/><br/>3) The other reason its not very effective is the screenplay is not well-focused. It meanders all over the place - giving us nondescript scenes of baseball, travelling on the road.<br/><br/>4) Costner's storyline is almost forgotten. Its just badly written. He never goes out of his way to pull Robbins in line because the love triangle interferes.<br/><br/>5) They pretty much assume that just showing us some Baseball will make us moan with ecstacy - but you pretty much need to already bring a love of Baseball to this flick to do that.<br/><br/>2/5"

","Probably helps a lot, watching this film, if you're American and of course, a baseball lover, neither of which I am, so maybe I'm a bit out of line marking down this sometimes entertaining sports/sex-farce. That said, being British and a lover of cricket, I think I'm safe in saying it will be a long time before Hollywood makes a cricket movie, let alone a cricket / sex farce! I wasn't even aware there were such things as ""baseball-groupies"" or ""Annie's"" as I believe they're called but as ball-game slappers go, it has to be said that Susan Sarandon's Annie Savoy and her young sidekick Millie, certainly offer an understandable come-hither attraction to the dumb grunts who make up the baseball team's ranks.<br/><br/>The acting by the A-list cast is very good, Sarandon in particular scoring (no pun intended) as the inexhaustible, Durham Bulls fan with a novel way to bring on young talent in the team, well supported by a a very young looking Tim Robbins as her number one draft pick this particular year and Kevin Costner as the seen-it-all-before old lag who arrives to encourage Robbins' character in more traditional manner but who likewise falls for Annie's charms and ends up competing with his protégé for the squiring rights.<br/><br/>Like I said, a lot of the baseball terminology and action pretty much passed me by, although I did enjoy Costner's universal roll-call of sporting clichés to Robbins for his first major television interview. The sex-scenes are perhaps a bit seamier and steamier than I would have anticipated, but probably acceptable enough given the battle of the sexes going on here. One thing I couldn't get over though was the interjection throughout of 50's imagery for what reason I couldn't gather, for instance, Sarandon in her first scenes is wearing 50's style attire and vintage rock and roll songs crop up regularly throughout the soundtrack.<br/><br/>On the whole I was reasonably engaged by the characters and the humour of their interaction before they all got the endings they each wanted. Not quite a home run for me then, but I wouldn't have taken a walk and avoided the film if it had been offered to me (I think that's a baseball term!)."

","What is Bull Durham about? On the surface, it's about baseball: the love, joy, pain, and madness of baseball. But it's really about life. The baseball team are the Durham Bulls (a variation on the title), a minor league North Carolina team who aren't very good.<br/><br/>The 3 central characters of the film are Crash Davis, Annie Savoy, and Ebbie Calvin 'Nuke' LaLoosh, played respectively by Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins in a triumvirate of truly focused, convincing, memorable performances. All 3 actors imbibe their characters with humanity and unique qualities. They all pair off at different times in the film and have a variety of memorable interactions and discussions. <br/><br/>*ANNIE AND NUKE Annie chooses every season to 'pair up' with one of the players and it comes down to Crash (the catcher) and Nuke (the pitcher). Annie 'chooses' Nuke, but mainly because Crash 'rejects' her. Annie and Nuke share a set of hilarious scenes together. Annie (much older than Nuke) uses him to satisfy her sexual desires and need to stay and feel young and vibrant. Also, she is helping him with his pitching. But there is also a maternal instinct that kicks in. It's obvious that Sarandon (Annie) and Robbins (Nuke) off-screen relationship contributed to their on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>*NUKE AND CRASH Crash is literally traded to the Bulls (engineered by the team manager) so that he can mentor Nuke's pitching, thus preparing him for the major leagues. Crash is a veteran with a lot of experience and advice that Nuke can use, but Nuke doesn't always listen, so Crash has to constantly teach him lessons and reminds him who's boss. Crash and Nuke have a big brother-little brother relationship with Crash doling out advice, but also there is 'sibling' rivalry because of Annie. Crash sees the greatness in Nuke's pitching and is living his dream through Nuke. If Nuke makes it to the majors, he'll know that he made it too. Their last scene together is the most touching moment in the film. Costner and Robbins convey a real, funny, male bonding relationship that is a special part of the film.<br/><br/>*CRASH AND ANNIE And, now, to the creme de la creme! The piesta de resistance! The pairing to end all pairings! Crash and Annie! It's always hard to see what is really going on when you first see a film, but when I saw this film 20 years ago, I really kind of knew how it was going to end (with Crash and Annie), but didn't really appreciate at the time how it got there. After watching the film again over the years, I really see the true magic of the Crash/Annie relationship. It's got to be the most fun I've ever had waiting for 2 characters to get together in a film. It's obvious from the beginning, even when she's playing her baseball groupie games, that Annie wants Crash from the start. You can see it in the way she looks at him when she first sees him. It's love at first sight. Of course we find out how she feels later in the film, but it's obvious she wanted him from the start. You can feel the sexual tension and desire in all of Crash and Annie's scenes together, even when they are playing word games and seemingly don't want each other. When they finally do get together, it is one of the rawest, hottest, sexiest series of scenes ever put to the screen, so be warned! Costner and Sarandon (as Crash and Annie) can lay claim to having provided the viewer with the sexiest scenes recorded in film history. The look that they give each other when both finally realize that they have each other is almost as hot as the series of scenes succeeding this. The way that Crash looks at Annie is the way a woman wants a man to look at her when he wants her and the way Annie looks at Crash is the way a man wants a woman to look at him when she wants him (even though the average guy supposedly doesn't really care). But, for Annie, Crash isn't the average guy, not just some seasonal fling who she can forget about later. Crash for her is THE ONE, a man who shares all her interests (reading, philosophy, old music and of course, baseball). And for Crash, Annie is the person he's been waiting for all his life who saves him at just the right time when he's approaching middle age and realizing that he's at a crossroads in his life. She gives him something to live for and continue on. Their final scenes together are truly special. The irony is that, if they had gotten together from the beginning, I don't think they would have ended up together because they needed to learn about and really size up each other to make sure that they were meant to be.<br/><br/>Of course, the brilliance of the film is not only these 3 characters, but also the way that it chooses not to glamorize or glorify baseball, but rather let baseball play second fiddle to the real story of the film: life itself. There's a lot of great dialogue and funny scenes with other characters as well. The scene with all the baseball players and coach on the mound talking about 'wedding gifts' is classic! Wonder if this happens in the majors! But a lot of the baseball moments still feel and seem realistic (Crash mentally 'talking' to himself while trying to get a hit off a pesky pitcher, Nuke literally talking to himself while trying not to think so much while pitching, Crash using his veteran savvy as a catcher to throw off batters to get them to strike out). <br/><br/>So what is Bull Durham? Well, in order, it's...<br/><br/>1)...a love story 2)...about relationships 3)...about mid-life crises 4)...about life itself 5)...about baseball"

","***************** SPOILERS !!!!!!!!! *********************<br/><br/>Bull Durham is the best baseball movie ever, best sports movie and also an incredibly underrated movie about sexuality and life in general. But it's also, the funniest movie I've ever seen. The shower scene, the fight outside the bar, Nuke rejecting Annie, Crash breaking the mirror, Crashing calling out the umpire, there are so many funny moments that simply have not been matched as of today. <br/><br/>If you have never watched this movie, it doesn't matter if you know much about baseball because you quickly get the basics knowledge of the game. I highly advise everyone to watch it, because you don't know what you're missing. So much insight on human behavior, maturity and transition in life.<br/><br/>The dialogue, the lines are superb, Crash's speech, Crash' advices, his perspicacity on life and baseball, his reasoning, his theories and discipline, his name-calling make him the best character in sports cinema. His ""if you think you're playing well because you're getting laid or you're not getting laid or because you're wearing women's underwear, then you are !"" is the truest sentence on Earth. <br/><br/>I don't understand how Costner who plays perfectly, every line sounds great, every emotion correctly expressed, didn't win an Academy Award. And it's the proof that with a small budget, a great movie is totally feasible. The montage is very good, camera work excellent and for a picture made in 1988 it still looks good in 2016. It's eternal. To think Stallone gets a nomination for playing a character full of laziness and clichès is embarrassing. <br/><br/>There hasn't been any other duo as believable, romantic and sexual than Crash and Annie. After all, look at the erotic scenes, nothing extreme or shocking, but they are very exciting.<br/><br/>This movie should go down as one of the greatest movies ever made."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","3","6","5 July 2008"," A film for those who observe the religion of baseball
","The best way to describe ""Bull Durham"" is a pitch that starts as a fastball and then breaks out of the zone--how far out just depends on how long your bat is. The analogy might seem a bit much, but this sports comedy stars with a very catchy, natural humor about it, but it loses some velocity later on when it starts playing off as a romance drama. Whether the romance subplot works for you is obviously a matter of opinion, but it definitely threw me off.<br/><br/>I really liked this film to start. Kevin Costner doesn't come off as a typical hotshot ballplayer- -that's not his role at all. He's quite good as a seasoned minor league veteran with an interesting perspective on the game. Susan Sarandon is also a really unique character in a sex-crazed older woman with a devout passion for baseball. Their characters make you think about the game differently and for a fan of the game, you have to like or at least find interesting what they have to say. Ron Shelton, well-accomplished writer/director of sports films from the late 80's-early 90s does a good job making this film much less formulaic. Gladly, there is not way too much focus on the game being shown on screen--there's just enough to make it a true baseball movie, but the movie revolves around the way baseball affects people, particularly those who love it but never saw any good come of it.<br/><br/>In the film, Costner is Crash Davis, a minor league vet who is brought in to play catcher for the Durham Bulls to mentor their pitching prospect, ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) who has a ""million dollar arm and a five cent head."" The relationship between the two is humorous and eventually becomes serious after awhile as the film takes its turn for the dramatic.<br/><br/>While I didn't particularly care for the film's portrayal of its female characters, Sarandon did make the film a bit more interesting than just a generic love interest because she's so fixed on baseball and strange things like romantic era poetry.<br/><br/>This is not really a true comedy, and perhaps the slight dislike I have with the film is because of that expectation, but it's mostly the ineffective romance stuff. It's kind of overdone with all the saxophone music and other 80s stuff that happens toward the end. <br/><br/>The best part of the film though is that unique dialogue about baseball. Costner has some killer lines and a fan of the game really starts to think about it differently which is a very cool aspect of this movie. By the end with the romance and all, I just wasn't totally sold on ""Bull Durham to consider it a really good film. Instead it was decent, but something I'd still recommend, mostly to a sports fan."

","Two favorite warm weather diversions (summer movies and professional baseball) are ill-served by writer director Ron Shelton's debut feature: a thinly disguised third-person daydream of fistfights and fastballs in the Carolina League. Kevin Costner portrays a veteran 'player to be named later', doing what he can to mature a hot shot but dim-witted rookie pitcher (Tim Robbins), while competing against him off the field for the heart (and body) of local groupie/baseball guru Susan Sarandon. Shelton draws on his own experience in the minor leagues for background, providing a few good laughs about interview etiquette and pitching mound conferences, but the film is more about Sarandon's libido than the ballgame itself, with all the expected male fantasy frills: locker room humor and easy sex, to be specific. It proved to be a popular crowd pleaser (such is the devalued state of the Romantic Comedy these days), but it's a pity Shelton couldn't have taken a few cold showers while writing his script."

Sure I laughed at this joke the first few times, but about after the 20th time, it just got old.  What else wore me down?  How about Susan Sarandon's ""as a matter of fact"" attitude.  Tramps are fun and all, but can you sell a premise on one?

","Bull Durham was a really good movie when it came out. But I watched it recently and portions of it are not aging well. There is tension over whether the movie is going to be thoughtful, or whether it's going to be a marketable ""product."" The ""valentine to baseball"" moments are writ large (unsubtle!) and Shelton could have left them out because they're just gilding the lily; the movie is already a valentine to baseball. Annie Savoy's outfits are obnoxious in a way the movie is not. Shelton also takes a lot of this from Slapshot. And I think it was Christopher Null who griped that Crash's big famous speech to Annie about his beliefs being overwritten. (It is.) The Bulls team is largely made up of dopes whom thoughtful people would now regard as ""meatheads,"" but how can you give it low marks for all of that, when there's such smartness elsewhere?<br/><br/>The movie's charm lies in in wry moments that are written subtly enough to please any smarty. It deserves credit for suggesting that small towners might be aware of William Blake, Kirkegard, Thoreau, alternative sexuality, etc. Even if it's a complete fiction, it's a nice place to occupy for a few hours. And really what makes parts of the film extraordinary is its oblique answer to philosophy, media coverage (intentionally being boring as the highest art of public relations), and movie plot lines. When's the last time you were asked to (allowed to?) identify with the second best character in a Hollywood movie? How often does a sports movie have the nerve to work in a love of books? There is a thread of laconic sensitivity here encompassing futile achievements and humility, that could not be manufactured by a hundred baseball-loving Hollywood execs. ""Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, And waste its sweetness on the desert air."" Thomas Gray, or was it William Blake? You can look it up!<br/><br/>Also... I loathe sports.

WOW. what a novel idea. give me a break. sure there are a few good lines, but none that I can repeat to my friends the day after I watch it. I just can not understand why sports fans have fallen in love with this movie. the story was bland, unoriginal, and pretty much boring.

"superscal23","Null","5","15","18 April 2003"," The most overrated movie EVER!!!!!
","When is Hollywood going to realize that the average age of lower level minor league baseball players is about 20 or 21.  Tim Robbins was pushing 30 at the time Bull Durham was made.  He is supposed to be a big shot rookie just starting out in pro ball.  In the real world, unless a player goes to college (which Nuke LaLoosh obviously didn't), they begin their pro baseball career at age 18 or 19!!!!.  If Bull Durham had any base in reality, that is how old Nuke LaLoosh would be.  Are we supposed to believe that Annie Savoy goes after a different teenager every summer.  If she does, we have a word in our culture for people like that which I won't use here.  I don't have a problem with Costner's character, because he is supposed to be older.  The rest of the Bulls don't really have too many lines, but they are all in their mid 30's, and some of them have receding hairlines.  It's a real shame that ""Summer Catch"" had to be the movie that actually cast appropriately aged actors in a minor league baseball movie.  It's also a real shame that Bull Durham is regarded as the best baseball movie ever made.  That is such an insult to ""The Natural"".  I wish that people felt about that movie the way they seem to about Bull Durham.  What kind of name is Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh?  It's just stupid.  Sarandon's character has no basis in reality. I've already said what I need to about the baseball players themselves.  The only thing that saves this movie is that Costner is perfect on the field as Crash Davis.  All the off the field scenes are worthless.  However, the baseball scenes with Costner, Trey Wilson (lollygaggers!), and Robert Wuhl, are worth watching."
"malvernp","Null","2","4","14 October 2006"," Overpraised Groupie Baseball Film
","There has been so much positive comment on this film, that it may be time to take a fresh look at it-----and truth be told, ""Bull Durham"" has a hard time standing up to close scrutiny.<br/><br/>One of its principal story lines involves the premise that the Susan Sarandon character (Annie) spends a season every year initiating a selected rookie on the minor league Durham Bulls to the joys of sexual awakening. She is a forty-something baseball groupie who holds some ill-defined academic job nearby, but seems to have all the time in the world to carry on her quest. Her target this season is the Tim Robbins character (Nuke)----who is obviously younger, talented, immature, undisciplined, and overly afflicted by raging hormones.<br/><br/>Annie makes a ritual of these initiations----giving them both physical and cultural aspects. She also seems totally one dimensional in her lack of any romantic feelings for the initiatee, and it is difficult to understand exactly how she expects her annual exercise to make a better person of either the ballplayer or herself. Nuke's journey with Annie may be analogized to the one taken by a new law clerk with a judge----only Nuke's clerkship seems to exist only as a between the sheets experience.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner (Crash) plays the world-weary veteran catcher who is supposed to tame the raw talent that Nuke apparently possesses, while at the same time deal with Annie's intrusion into this process and Crash's own growing feelings for Annie. If he were alive at the time and able to project the right persona, the ideal casting for Crash would have been George Sanders-----because nobody played such burnout roles better than he did.<br/><br/>The film is interesting in giving us a slice of life in a minor league team and town, but none of it rings particularly true and much of it feels contrived.<br/><br/>While involving a totally different story (the world of pop music v. minor league baseball), a much better ""groupie"" film is Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous""(2000). It is a far more authentic viewing experience.<br/><br/>Ms. Sarandon never looked lovelier than she does in this film. Perhaps it came from the glow of playing with (filmwise and otherwise) Tim Robbins for the first time. As we all know, this movie marked the beginning of their beautiful relationship. As for Robbins and his attempt to portray a gangly ballplayer, a much better effort came from Gary Cooper in ""Pride of the Yankees"" (1942). But of course that was made at a time when a baseball story had to stand on its own two feet-----and any screenplay weaknesses couldn't be covered up by lots of sexual situations---and I do mean lots!"

","Just watched ""Bull Durham"" again for maybe the sixth or seventh time, and I have more respect for it now than ever. The Special Edition DVD is the perfect way to preserve Ron Shelton's funny, sexy, passionate, action-filled baseball masterpiece.<br/><br/>Movies aimed at grown-ups are a rarity, which may be why ""Bull Durham"" still feels like such an amazing movie. Not a moment of it is aimed toward the lowest common denominator. There is sex in this movie, and talk of sex, but it's not silly or gutter-minded, and never gross. You can feel the physical and emotional passion of the characters; baseball simply provides the philosophical backdrop behind the romance -- the reason the characters are together.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner and Susan Sarandon make my favorite romantic screen couple; they burn up the screen. Costner in particular is excellent, showing a knack for verbal comedy and physical heroism that he put on a shelf until ""Tin Cup."" And Tim Robbins turns in a memorable performance as Nuke Laloosh.<br/><br/>I see no reason in going into the plot details, as everyone who has seen the film knows what ""Bull Durham"" is about, and those who haven't seen it are in for a wonderful treat. Few movies approach perfection, but this one, set in a world of lovable losers where the game is just as much a job as selling appliances at Sears, joins that select handful."

And this is the most obvious case because:<br/><br/>-- It adds the extra dimension of sex as performance (to ""educate"" the baseball performance which produces the actor performance) which dimension is underscore by the capture of Tim Robbins in much the same manner as Nuke was captured.<br/><br/>-- It features that speech by Annie  about what she believes in (the Church of Baseball... a religion full of magic, cosmic truth, and the fundamental ontological riddles of our time...), followed after some time by what Crash believes including: ""... that the novels of Susan Sontag are self-indulgent, overrated crap""<br/><br/>-- Crash calls the majors ""the show""<br/><br/>-- The only real teaching Crash gives Nuke is about the TeeVee cliches<br/><br/>-- We have three kinds of actors. Costner who wants the world to come to him, so only offers what he thinks is appealing; Robbins who throws himself into the psychological space of the viewer (at 90 miles and hour), and Sarandon who cheats by attracting us into her actorly Bermuda triangle.

Anyone who is or was a big baseball fan should consider this film a must-see.<br/><br/>One of the unacknowledged features of the film is the tragedy of Crash Davis' character.

","One of the most popular baseball movies Bull Durham is an exciting film that will be appreciated by non-baseball fans as well. As sports movies go, this one is unconventional, dealing more with the minutia that provides the foundation of life in the minor leagues than with the actual games. Bull Durham is about showing what it's like for athletes who play for the love of the game and not the expectation of multi-million-dollar contracts. It's about the men who toil far from the spotlight and whose daily concern is not whether they will be promoted to The Show but whether their stats will allow them to bat another day. The qualities that distinguish Bull Durham from so many other baseball movies are its low-key humor (in contrast to the overt jokiness of Major League and The Naked Gun), the smartness of the dialogue. As I said in the opening sentence- Bull Durham isn't only for people who understand baseball- it's a universal experience."

","I find it hard to believe that it's been 30 years since BULL DURHAM came out in theaters. That seems to happen a lot the older you get. Memories of a movie first being released seem fresh even when some of those memories are kind of clouded. Deep rooted is the memory of liking or hating a movie. I remember liking this film but cloudy on a number of memories. Things came into focus as I watched the new Criterion Collection copy of the film.<br/><br/>The story revolves around three main characters and the minor league Durham Bulls baseball club. Annie Savory (Susan Sarandon) is a bit of an oddball character. Having searched for the meaning of life through various religions and metaphysical experiences she's come to determine that life should be lived through baseball. Her way of helping her ""religion"" is to find a single player each year that she helps along through both instruction and sex. <br/><br/>Next up is Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh (Tim Robbins) a hot new pitching prospect the team has hired. Ebby has an incredibly fast arm but unfortunately can't seem to control his pitches. The potential is there but when your pitches tend to hit the team mascot or fly into the watching crowd there is a problem. He's young, brash and thinks he's a star before he's actually ready to be one. <br/><br/>And then there is ""Crash"" Davis (Kevin Costner). Crash has seen it all. A catcher who once had the opportunity to be called to ""the show"" (the major leagues) Crash is older and wiser now. He still has that potential to be called up once again but the odds are slim. Here he's been called in by the team to help get Ebby on track to help the team.<br/><br/>The two men become the focus of Annie as she tries to decide which one she will share both her knowledge and her bed with. When she tells them this in her home Crash says he's leaving. When she seems startled he tells her he doesn't try out any longer before giving her a now famous speech about what he believes in. Stunned Annie lets him leaves and begins work on Ebby.<br/><br/>As the season begins both Crash and Annie do what they can to help Ebby along. Stubborn and unwilling to listen at times he soon discovers he has much to learn and might not be the big thing he once thought he was. As the season movies forward he improves on the field. And while he's also sleeping with Annie her thoughts keep bringing her back to Crash and wondering what if. At the same time there is a growing attraction towards Annie from Crash that goes unrequited with her having her sights on Ebby. Will that change if he does too?<br/><br/>The movie easily moves back and forth between romance, slight drama and some hilariously funny moments. Director/writer Ron Shelton actually played in the minor leagues and he knows his stuff. He knows that there is plenty of raunchy dialogue that goes on between players behind the scenes and most likely worse than he allows here. He understand the power of superstition and knows how that can get into a players head. And he knows that feeling of longing to make it to something better as on display here.<br/><br/>Shelton's love of the game is obvious here in what is easily a tribute to those who play the game for hundreds rather than millions of dollars. The smaller fields and smaller paychecks are meant for those who long to reach ""the show"" but who also play because they must, their love of the game stronger than anything. Crash embodies this sort of player and his love and respect of the game are the biggest things that he passes along to Ebby. <br/><br/>The sexual tension between the three characters is always underlying and surfaces only on rare occasion. Annie's calling out Crash's name while in bed with Ebby, Crash's longing for Annie and Ebby's sense of jealousy over Crash. All of it will last only one season though as Annie has a long standing love of the game and the Durham Bulls, knowing that another season will dawn and a new prospect will be there looking for her help and attention. <br/><br/>Shelton does an amazing job of combining all of these elements to make not just an entertaining film but a thought provoking one at the same time. Who would think that a discussion on the true meaning of love would come from a movie about baseball? Or that it could be used metaphorically to discuss life in general? And at the same time he does this he's created a completely liberated female character in a male dominated world who lives for herself. That's an achievement few have accomplished.<br/><br/>Criterion has done their usual great job of presenting the movie in the cleanest looking version you'll find. In addition to that they've included some interesting extras as well. Those extras include two audio commentary tracks featuring Shelton, Costner and Robbins, a new interview with Shelton by Michael Sragow, a program from 2001 with interviews of the cast and crew including Shelton, Costner, Robbins and Sarandon, an appreciation of the film from 2008 featuring former players, sports fans and broadcasters, and NBC NIGHTLY NEWS piece from 1993 about the final season at Durham Athletic Park where the film was shot, an interview with Max Patkin who was known as the Clown Prince of Baseball from a 1991 episode of TODAY, the original trailer for the film and excerpts from a 1989 piece by longtime New Yorker baseball writer Roger Angell. <br/><br/>If you've never seen the movie be ready for some salty language, some hilarious moments, a few touching scenes and some of the best acting to come from the stars of the film. Honorable mention in this category should go to actor Robert Wuhl as coach's assistant Larry whose moments on screen offer many of the laughs to be found as well as providing some of the best baseball chatter ever filmed. Fans should add this copy to their collection and for those who've never seen the film now is your chance."

","Who doesn't love a great sports movie? Sometimes sports can provide a nice avenue for a perfect character arc. The ups, downs, and overall weirdness that sports can supply is well encapsulated with Bull Durham.<br/><br/>The things I look for in a sports movie are; if the film is accessible to non-sports fans; provides an accurate look at sports from people who do play sports; and if it's able to cover multiple genres, whether that be comedy, drama, romance, or whichever. Bull Durham accomplishes all of those things surprisingly well. Kevin Costner, in one of his 3 baseball movies, gives one of his most memorable performances as Crash Davis, a close-to-retirement minor league baseball player who never got his true shot at fulfilling his dreams in the big-leagues.<br/><br/>That's the strongest asset the film boasts, is the bittersweet story of someone who gave it his all and even then, it may not be enough to be successful. Due to me being a ballplayer myself, this especially hit home, because I had those dreams when I was younger. To watch someone struggle for over a decade in the minors and still never get his shot is tough to watch. Luckily, Bull Durham isn't a straight drama, it's got a bit of comedy and a whole lot of romance. <br/><br/>Costner plays the catcher (Davis) to a young project-pitcher, 'Nuke' Laloosh, played by Tim Robbins. Davis is forced to train Nuke to use his strong arm to reach the minors and to do more with his life than just lay with the next beautiful woman in the stands. That relationship is the core of the film, as is Susan Sarandon's dynamic and potential romance with them both. Sarandon's character feels a little bit like it was a female character written in a different era and rarely holds up. Think about it, she spends all of her time watching baseball in an attempt to find the next player she can sleep with. Granted, she does offer some useful advice every once in a while, but it isn't anything earth-shattering. I hardly think a character like this would be written in today's Hollywood.<br/><br/>Baseball is known as the most ""romantic"" sport, and Bull Durham personifies that belief. It's as romantic as it is thrilling and hilarious. That's the thing I'll take away from watching Bull Durham, is how well it balanced the baseball and romance aspects of the film. Complement that with a bittersweet story, memorable performances, and a funny script and you have one of the great sports movies of the last 30 years.<br/><br/>+Well-written<br/><br/>+Romance & baseball<br/><br/>+Back and forth with Catcher-Pitcher dynamic<br/><br/>-Sarandon's character motives don't hold up<br/><br/>7.9/10"

","For a baseball movie, this was a bit of a curveball, but I liked ""Bull Durham"" for a number of reasons. One of them being its treatment of baseball as a daily grind; that these are just shlubs in the stadium workplace. Another is the writing; this is some great dialogue and a few of those lines just seem to come out of nowhere. It works pretty well as a romantic comedy, but even better as a clash of wills between two competing players - which takes a somber note as Kevin Costner dishes out wisdom only to find himself spit out the bottom of a middling career in baseball. that aspect drew me in more than I 'd expected. <br/><br/>And I must surely not forget to mention the film's most winning feature: the utterly magnetic Susan Sarandon.

","Bull Durham only received Oscar recognition in one category that of Original Screenplay. But that screenplay is the basis of the film that broke the mold for baseball films.<br/><br/>When you think of baseball films you think of heroic type films like the biographical stories of Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Grover Cleveland Alexander and Monty Stratton. Or some funny, but still reverential films like Kill The Umpire or It Happens Every Spring. None of these films will ever have a character like Susan Sarandon, a well known baseball Annie which is what the players have dubbed their groupies. You could never have a character like her with the infamous Code in place. <br/><br/>Sarandon is frank, she loves sex, she loves baseball and she sees herself doing her bit for the national past time. Her concentration this year is on Tim Robins who is a promising Sandy Koufax like pitcher before Sandy got control of his pitching and gave us five of the best seasons ever seen before announcing his premature retirement.<br/><br/>Also giving Robins his concentration is veteran catcher Kevin Costner hired specifically for that purpose by the Raleigh-Durham Bulls. Between Sarandon and Costner they turn Robins into someone fulfilling his promise. But baseball is a most unsentimental game as Costner knows and Sarandon's avocation is also one with some heartbreak.<br/><br/>Best scene in the film is Costner describing what it's like in the Major Leagues, 'the big show'. As he says ""the 20 best days in my life"". Like actors, athletes on team sports want to play in whatever major leagues there are. If not they're like Costner, hanging on because of the love of the game.<br/><br/>Costner has the philosophy of Stan Musial who was quoted as saying he knew it was time to quit because the pain outweighed the fun of getting paid to play a sport. I suspect that Musial would have felt the same had he been a journeyman player like Costner rather than the Hall Of Famer he is.<br/><br/>No way that Christian athlete William O'Leary would have been a character in a film made under the Code auspices. Younger groupie Jenny Robertson makes a point of showing him what he's missing.<br/><br/>Ron Shelton who was a minor league ballplayer drew from some rich memories of those times to give us Bull Durham. It's both a serious and also irreverently funny look at those who participate in our national past time and the women who service them."

","Annie Savoy is a spiritual woman. Her religion is baseball. Every year she shares her spirituality, and her body, with one member of the hometown minor-league Durham Bulls. But this year Annie has a dilemma. She can't decide who this year's lover should be, wise old veteran catcher Crash Davis or hotshot rookie pitcher, and total rube, Nuke LaLoosh. Complicating matters is that Crash has been sent down to lowly single-A Durham for the sole purpose of grooming Nuke, the organization's golden child. But Crash quickly uncomplicates things by saying he's a veteran who's not going to try out to be Annie's fling of the year. With a memorable speech about what he believes in Crash leaves Annie with Nuke. He also leaves her very much pining for him.<br/><br/>So Annie embarks on her relationship with Nuke. She tries to give him a little bit of wisdom and spirituality. His interest in her does not seem to extend outside of bedroom activities. All the while Annie keeps a watchful eye on Crash. It's fairly obvious that Annie and Crash would make for a much better match than Annie and the hopelessly immature Nuke. But Crash keeps his distance. And meanwhile there's a baseball season to be played. And unlike so many sports movies this one gets the sports part right. It's a great depiction of minor-league life. Smart, quirky, often funny, always honest. It's very easy to buy into these Durham Bulls. These guys actually seem like a real team, with all the ups and downs of a season and all the complicated relationships a real team has. The movie focuses on Crash and Nuke but we get to know enough about the other players, and the coaches, to care about them too. This is the rare sports movie where the sports totally rings true. It feels real. But that doesn't mean it can't be funny too. Ever wonder what gets discussed during those interminable conferences on the pitching mound? This movie has a funny answer. There's nothing in the movie that will make you bust a gut laughing but there's plenty of subtle, smart humor to bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely helped by some pitch-perfect casting. Kevin Costner is superb as the worn-down, but wonderfully wise, veteran Crash. Tim Robbins is a hoot as cocky, flighty, silly Nuke. And Susan Sarandon is the perfect high priestess in the Church of Baseball. Her Annie Savoy is mature and worldly and fascinating enough to entice a man like Crash. And sexy enough to rope in young buck Nuke. Seeing Annie open herself up to the possibility of a real relationship, not her typical fleeting fling, is some of the best stuff the movie has to offer and Sarandon nails that change in the character wonderfully. Of course that change won't come easy. She may want to be with Crash but she's actually with Nuke and baseball keeps getting in the way. The relationship between Crash and Nuke will prove to be as important as any of Annie's entanglements. The old vet has to prepare the young star for life in the big leagues. But when the job is done, when Crash has done all he can to shape Nuke into the player and man he can be, then what? What use is there for Crash then? A sobering thought. Crash has led a terrific, albeit obscure, baseball life. What will that get him in the end? Annie has loved many a player in her own unique way and then sent them along up the baseball chain. Is it time to stop that particular cycle of life? And Nuke? Well, he's gonna announce his presence, bring the heat. And they all lived happily ever after? Who knows? The joy of Bull Durham is in embracing the possibility. This is a movie which gives us such great characters. And puts those characters to very entertaining use, making us smile and laugh but also making us care. A home run."

Less than a week ago I took exception to a film that didn't know whether it wanted to be a farce, a drama, a slice of life a la Warners in the 30s or a modern take on Romeo and Juliet. As a result it was rubbish. Utilising some of the same elements Bull Durham is a fine, feel-good movie delivering both laughs, romance, and sex. In terms of baseball on celluloid we've had a reasonable amount of Major League, a lesser amount of Little League but I personally am unaware of any movie that focused on the Minor Leagues until now though I am happy to be corrected. Apart from the three leads, Susan Sarandon, Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner, the supporting cast is largely unfamiliar but all deliver fine performances. There's a fairly distant echo of the Billy Wilders about it in the idea of late-blooming seriousness coming out of light-hearted comedy but it really stands alone as a fine example of entertainment."

The story itself isn't much we haven't seen before, but the characters are anything but formulaic.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins is new to the Durham Bulls. He pitches fast balls with a great deal of ""heat"" but he's wild and easily distracted. Kevin Costner is the newly arrived catcher, recently sent down from the major leagues, who has a thing or two to tell Robbins. They are also in competition for the heart and body of Susan Sarandon, a kind of local baseball groupie who schtupps the best player of the season and is always true to him in her fashion. She has a degree from Alliance Junior College, has New Age tendencies, and quotes from Blake, Whitman, and a number of other wordsmiths. There are a number of sexy scenes. The romantic and the athletic competition exist in equipoise.<br/><br/>As you can see, it's not exactly what you'd expect in a movie about baseball or any other sport. It has a certain charm, but very low in key, rather like some unexpected and interesting rock formation you stumbled across on the Appalachian trail. You're compelled to stop and admire the thing for a while.<br/><br/>It was written and directed by Ron Shelton, who has convinced me he knows baseball, or at least has invented a colorful argot for it. It must have been successful because it spawned a number of cruder imitations, funnier but with considerably less of its fey quality. In the rip offs, the characters are no longer quirky. They're bizarre. I have in mind especially ""Minor League."" The template may have originated with ""Semi-Tough,"" back in 1977.

Soon after the film opens, she brings Nuke LaLoosh and Crash Davis, played by Tim Robbins and Kevin Costner respectively, and lets them know that they are both in contention to be her lover. She ends up with Nuke, but the rest of the movie revolves around Crash and her finding their love connection. The movie's superb acting makes it very likable. Robbins, Sarandon, and Costner all do an amazing job portraying their characters.

Costner's Crash Davis is a very realistic portrayal of an older player who is just trying to hang on, smart enough to guide other players, but not smart enough to know that his time has passed, and that he needs to move on. Like many players, he is unwilling to stop playing the game he loves. While it is hard to believe that a player as dumb as Tim Robbins, ""Nuke"" Laloosh is shown to be would ever exist, the movie is realistic in having the organization bring in an older experienced player to help coach him, and show him the ropes. Such things do occur all the time. The love story, between Sarandon and Costner is also very believable, and really helps to move the movie along, as Crash finally grows up and becomes a man, with all the commitments that come with that. Reality, wins out in this film, and it does so with a great deal of heart. The direction is fluid, and keeps the story and the action moving along, without getting bogged down. All in all a fine film."

","First of all, Boog, anyone who follows baseball at all, knows that Durham is actually the Atlanta Braves AA club, not an A ball level team. Secondly, it is not about persevering, or surviving, it is quite simply about a man who loves the game for what it is, knows he isn't good enough to be a major leaguer, and wants everyone around him to respect and love the game like he does. The film has moments of great hilarity, as anyone who has gone to summer camp, played ball, or just has a bunch of friends well knows, it is not a film to be taken seriously. The casting is excellent, the script well written, but the acting is a little over the top (especially Robbins). Besides, Susan Sarandon was too old, and looked too old to play the part of Annie."

This is the most realistic portrayal of baseball life that I have ever seen, including the humor, sex, frustration, and warts of being a professional ballplayer. Every actor and actress is perfect in their roles. While Annie's character isn't very believable, it's absolutely necessary to the story in a metaphorical sense, and played brilliantly by Sarandon. Tim Robbins, although I never pictured him as a baseball player before, ended up being the perfect casting choice. His facial expressions throughout the movie and acting skills were hilarious! And although I rate Dances With Wolves a hair higher (they're both 10's), I still consider this as Costner's best performance. When I think of Costner, I think of Bull Durham. Rarely is a movie and an actor so perfectly matched.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with hysterical anecdotes and ""speeches"". Things that you will find yourself saying one day to your baseball fan buddies, and everyone will smile and know you watched Bull Durham. The conversation on the mound among the players and the coach cracks me up just thinking about it.

The acting in this movie and the on screen chemistry between the characters is what makes this movie work. Yes, it's technically a sports movie, but it doesn't really center around baseball too much. It focuses on the characters and their relationships with one another. It really has something in it for everyone. It has really good comedy that works, some romance, sports of course, and some serious moments. There are many lines from this film that I would consider to be some of the best lines in cinema.

What baseball fan who's seen this movie could ever forget Costner's monologue on his beliefs?  Go. See."

","The Durham Bulls are a minor league baseball team who draft in a rookie pitcher who has an arm that holds promise for the majors, sadly his powerful arm lacks finesse.  The team bring in veteran catcher Crash Davis to coach him, while rookie `Nuke' LaLoosh is also taken on by Annie Savoy, who makes it a habit to seduce one player a season.  However Crash also has an eye for Annie.<br/><br/>It has been a few years since I lasted watched this film and, partly due to the age I was when it came out, I have always had the idea in my head that it is a `great film'.  This idea is not totally unfounded as the film is pretty enjoyable although falling far from being brilliant.  What makes it stand out for me is the amusing mix of romance and baseball  both parts being done pretty well.  Working best is the sports movie which is affectionate and nostalgic towards America's minor leagues and the men who play all their lives in them.  The romantic side doesn't work quite as well and only is given free reign in the final 15 minutes.  Annie's babbling of Whitman and astro-physics is a little of a turn off for me and I found it harder to care about the romance as a result.<br/><br/>The relationship between the two men is stronger though and makes for an more enjoyable dynamic around the baseball diamond.  Although the romantic side is a little weaker, it is hard to imagine the film with one or other of the strands missing and the two give the film an unique spin.<br/><br/>The cast is good all round.  Costner (for he was once great) has an easy charm as Crash which belies the fact that several lines of his dialogue are awfully cheesy.  Robbins looks so very different viewed with an eye for his present incarnation, but he is pretty good.  However it is harder to buy his dumb-kid routine when we know him to be a much smarter man  and his supposed `unequal' relationship with Sarandon seems more likely now that he's with her in real life.  Sarandon is OK but I didn't like her character. She is sexy but I never understood totally what a woman with such intelligence would be sleeping with baseball players for  even if she is a big fan.  Some of her lines are poor too, and she sounds like she's just been given big words to say.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable movie but certainly not a great film as either a romance or a sports movie.  Costner is on good form and the baseball banter is good fun even for those who think it's just a fancy version of rounders."

The common denominator is that both films have heart. Lots of heart. <br/><br/>Writer-director, Roin Shelton does a great job of telling the story of our minor league hero, wonderfully played by Kevin Costner. Costner as always is fun to watch.

","Bull Durham is one of those movies. From the moment it hit the big screen, baseball fans who are romantic at all fell in love with it! The concept of the minor league ballplayer (Kevin Costner) falling for the baseball addicted groupie (Susan Sarandon) is just too good to be true.<br/><br/>Most men who are true baseball fans I suspect fantasize that they might some day find a woman as interesting as Annie Savoy! The fact that her interest in the National Passtime is mere icing on the cake.<br/><br/>Bull Durham has been called, with good reason, the best sports movie of all time. I know, I just bought a new copy of the DVD with that sticker on the cover! Who ever made the claim hit the nail right on the head.<br/><br/>Costner is a hoot as the antagonistic Durham to Tim Robbin's ""Nuke LaLoosh... the airheaded pitcher with a million dollar arm. Crash Davis (Costner) has had a fleeting taste of ""the show"", as the Major Leagues are referred to; and he knows that his protégé has the talent, but might lack the intellect to make it. Davis knows his best days are behind him and he is simply trying to set the record for home runs by a minor leaguer (a bogus record it turns out as the writer did not research that particular point of trivia too well)... and does what he must to do that.<br/><br/>Savoy understands that she has stumbled into a season like no other; having a relationship with ""Nuke"" while wanting ""Crash""... and watching her beloved Durham Bulls change from a bumbling squad of kids to a team of professional ball players.<br/><br/>Just my two cents. If you've never seen Bull Durham, do yourself the favor; although I do caution to keep the kiddees out of the room unless you like them seeing some really mature, sexual situations!"

"heat95pd","Null","1","4","29 October 2003"," Summer Catch is much better
","It's hard for baseball movies to have good storylines for some reason.  I rented this movie with great expectations after watching and loving Summer Catch.  Unfortunately, even with a cast like Kevin Costner, Susan Sarandon, and Tim Robbins, this movie failed miserably.  Granted they're two different types of comedies; this is more of a dry-humor film, and Summer Catch appeals to young adults more with its cheesy, teen movie funniness. However, you need to take it for what it is, and I loved Summer Catch and I love Jessica Biel.  Freddie Prinze Jr's Ryan Dunne character is a much better pitcher than Tim Robbins' Ebby Calvin ""Nuke"" LaLoosh in my mind. If I had to pick between the two of them, I'd pick Freddie, no doubt about that one.<br/><br/>The film centers around the hard-throwing yet iratic arm of LaLoosh (Robbins) and in order to make it to the show, he needs lessons in baseball and in life from no other than a twelve-year minor league veteran catcher, Crash Davis (Costner).  Davis dislikes LaLoosh based on his attitude toward the game and the relationship he has with the team's supporter, Annie Savoy (Sarandon).  <br/><br/>Basically, the whole movie revolves around the battles between Costner and Robbins and the seductions of Sarandon.  If Kevin Costner wasn't in this film, it would've been far worse. Atleast Summer Catch had great performances in Freddie Prinze Jr., Jessica Biel, Matthew Lillard, Fred Ward, Brittany Murphy, and Marc Blucas.<br/><br/>Bull Durham didn't have that much entertainment in it.  The funniest parts of the film were when Robbins calls out Costner to fight in the back of a bar and Robbins tries to throw a baseball at Costner's chest.  Robbins fails miserably, and when he runs up to Coster to try and punch him, Costner knocks him down with one blow to the face. It was funny.  The other funny part or parts i guess, were Robbins' wacky pitching motions on the mound. He would wind up and turn his whole body to the plate, kind of like Hideo Nomo but with this funny look on his face.  I laughed at that also.  That's how disappointed I am with this movie, I'm looking for parts that were funny or appealing to me.<br/><br/>Summer Catch has it all over this film."

The film also involves Susan Sarandon as a baseball groupie whose reputation of sleeping with one player every season leads her to pursue Robbins and Costner as her next conquests in that ""field.""

"Better_Sith_Than_Sorry","6","0","1","16 May 2020"," Rom-Com Masquerading as a Sports Film
","Beware the reviewers labeling Bull Durham ""the best sports movie ever"" or even ""the best baseball movie."" Real sports fans know this really isn't a sports movie. It's a romantic comedy that happens to use minor league baseball as the setting. Even Roger Ebert, in his review of the film, wrote that Bull Durham ""is a completely unrealistic romantic fantasy."" Does that sound like ""the best sports movie ever"" to you? Yeah, it's not. The people saying this must not be sports fans, I can draw no other conclusion.<br/><br/>Plot in a Nutshell: An aging catcher (Kevin Costner) and a young pitcher (Tim Robbins) vie for the affections of a local harlot/groupie (Susan Sarandon).<br/><br/>That's the basic story of this film. It focuses on a love triangle between these three characters and uses the Durham Bulls baseball club as the backdrop. Oh sure, there are some baseball scenes thrown in, and some baseball terminology that might confuse anyone who's not a fan. But make no mistake: this is a rom-com all the way, and as such, can't be seriously considered in the top echelon of 'sports films.'<br/><br/>And on top of that, it's not nearly as good as some would have you believe. As Ebert noted, it's unrealistic for one. What makes anyone accept that the two ballplayers would even WANT to hook up with the Sarandon character? She is already in her 40s and freely admits her extremely loose morals as it pertains to sexual partners. She's basically a walking STD at this point in her life! No thanks, pal. It also seems odd that the Bulls trust Costner's character to mentor their million-dollar investment, then suddenly have no use for him by the film's end. Don't they have anyone else that could use some mentoring? Why did they trust him in the first place if they think so little of him now? Yeah that doesn't work.<br/><br/>Having said that, it's not a bad film. It has its moments and I would say it's worth one watch. But I wouldn't go beyond that. There is a much-talked-about speech (""I believe in wet kisses"" etc.) given by Costner's character in the film, apparently intended to be romantic, as it gets the attention of Annie Savoy (Sarandon). But watching this film now, I was more than a little surprised to hear that part of this famous discourse included the lines ""I believe in the c_ck. I believe in the p_ssy."" Um, what? Yeah I'm not making this up, that's part of the dialogue. And far from being profound, it sounded laughable, not laudable. Socrates-like wisdom, this was not.<br/><br/>There are SO many 'sports films' better than this. To name a few...Rocky and Rocky II, The Natural, A League of Their Own, Eight Men Out, the original The Longest Yard, the original Brian's Song, Hoosiers, Raging Bull, Slap Shot, Hoop Dreams...there's a lot. A LOT. To name Bull Durham better than those, as Sports Illustrated did back in 2003, is beyond puzzling. It's a sometimes-amusing look at minor league baseball life, and that's really about it.<br/><br/>6/10. Would I watch again (Y/N)? Having watched it for the second time now, no. There's no title fight, there's no championship game. It's just an unconvincing romantic comedy set during a minor league baseball season. And that's just not good enough to warrant any more viewings."

"powermandan","8","0","1","31 October 2017"," A Sweet Sports Flick!
","I personally don't like sports. They're too superficial to get wrapped up in. And baseball is one of the most boring sports to watch. Other boring sports include tennis, curling, and NASCAR. But baseball is bigger, the most boring of the popular sports. Regardless of if you like baseball or not, Bull Durham doesn't care if you're a fan or not. It wants you to be entertained and just have an all-around good time.<br/><br/>Bull Durham is a three-character driven film about life, love, and baseball. Susan Sarandon gives her first great performance as Annie Savoy. I forget her official position with the team, but she is picks one member of the Durham Bulls to seduce to make a better player. She's a groupie and her reasons behind the sex seem too silly--she uses sex as means of making players on the team better. Is she a sex addict? Is she a libertine? Is she trying to fill a void? I think her sexual ambition was too silly to be taken seriously--the only reason I can not giving this a perfect score.<br/><br/>Kevin Costner plays Crash. He's spent twelve years in the minors and can't never catch a break. He gets drafted to the Bulls and hopes he can make it to the MLB from there. But he may not be as good as he thinks he is.<br/><br/>Caught between Annie and Crash is Tim Robbins, who plays Nuke. Nuke is a talented and immature pitcher who stands a chance of making it big. The main reason Crash got drafted was to train Nuke into honing his craft. Nuke has the speed and agility, but poor aim. And he happens to be the player Annie chooses to be with for the season.<br/><br/>The love triangle is pretty cool as both men are attracted to Annie. Annie wants both of them, but it is unclear who could benefit from her more. As the movie unfolds, this becomes more clear. The scenes where Annie gets with Crash and Nuke are fun. The friendship and training with Crash and Nuke is hilarious. The trio together have perfect chemistry.<br/><br/>Despite the movie being centred on three people, we do get a good look at the other members of the team and their rituals. Some use prayer beads, some use sex, it all depends which one works. Whichever works, stick with it.<br/><br/>A major strength with Bull Durham is that is places the viewer into the escapades of the players. They go to the bars, have some beers, argue with officials, etc. When the lights go down, the viewer becomes a die-hard fan like the ones in the bleachers. The viewer also feels the pressures of the players. But first and foremost, the movie is hilarious. The love story isn't sappy and there isn't a psychological bridge that gets drawn with the players. Comedy is used to fill up and push the movie.<br/><br/>There is too much not to like.<br/><br/>3.5/4"

This is Kevin Costner's best performance, and Crash is his best-fitting role. Also enter Annie Savoy, expertly played by Susan Sarandon, the Durham Bulls' unofficial tutor.

Nuke is the pivot point of this love triangle, as well as the target of both Annie's and Crash's didactic objectives. As Crash and Annie take turns giving lessons to Nuke, their appreciation for each other's experience, wisdom, and baseball knowledge grows (as does the sexual tension between them), until Annie lets her personal needs interfere with Nuke's training, as she mistakenly believes Crash has done the same. Genuinely funnier than Major League, more authentic than The Natural, and more coherent than Field of Dreams, Bull Durham is the truest baseball movie, perhaps because it takes place in the minor leagues, where thousands of hopefuls struggle and play for peanuts, for a chance at a dream, and for the love of the game. Like the game itself, the career of a baseball player includes a lot of waiting. Most never get the call. Many who do, like Crash, who spent 21 days in ""the show"" (the majors), don't last. And fewer still become stars. And, as Crash explains to Nuke, it's a game of inches, a matter of a few dying quails that makes the difference between playing in Yankee Stadium and selling Kenmore appliances at Sears. Nuke gets called up, because he has talent (and a couple of fine trainers), and Crash, who has brains, loses his position on the Bulls' roster. Bull Durham celebrates the exciting possibilities of Spring, as it laments the knowing stillness of Winter. Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed Bull Durham, conveys well the isolation of baseball players at game time, as they talk to themselves on the mound and at the plate, as well as the isolation of lonely women trying to find fulfillment through sex, marriage, philosophy, and America's pastime. The climax of the movie is a climax (or several), as two lonely souls come together in a shared realization that although they are beyond their primes, they can still choose to dance the night away."
"Michael_Elliott","Null","0","2","6 November 2011"," The Three Stars Steal the Film
","Bull Durham (1988) <br/><br/>*** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>A washed up minor league catcher (Kevin Costner) shows up in Durham where he's been asked to take a major league arm (Tim Robbins) and try to teach him some common sense. Along the way the two men try for the affections of a local groupie (Susan Sarandon) who tries to offer them more than just sex. There's a terrific sequence early in the movie where the Sarandon character takes home the two men and informs them of the ""rules"" she has laid down. Each season she takes ""care"" of one player and these rules just don't sit right with the veteran player and this leads to one of the funniest speeches from any film of the 80s. BULL DURHAM falls a bit short of being a great film but it's still a very special one that manages to mix in plenty of laughs, some mild romance and of course baseball. I know a lot of people bash this film for not being about baseball or that the sport gets left behind the romance but I've never agreed with this. I think the screenplay by director Ron Shelton does a terrific job at building up the minor league lifestyle and I think the film captures the perfect look and feel of the small town, small stadiums and the small life. I really love how the film manages to put the characters in a situation where the end results can be the same no matter if they're trying for the major leagues or if they're just trying to make it one more game in the minors. The movie is full of wonderful, dirty moments including the type of foul-mouthed profanity that the screenwriter is probably best known for. The screenplay allows all three characters to be so different that it really does seem as if each one is the main character. Costner turns in another wonderful performance here as the catcher who has pretty much done a lot of small things and resents the fact that this rookie could do so much more but he usually just throws it away. The relationship between Costner and Robbins makes for a very fun time and you can't help but enjoy the older/young brother banter. Both actors are terrific in their parts and really bring them to life. Saradon, a wonderful actress, really gets to go all out here with the charm and even if you object to her groupie status you still can't help but enjoy the character. The film mixes a lot of things but at its heart the thing is just a good comedy. I don't think the romance is as strong as it could have been but this is just a minor issue. Fans of baseball or the stars should get a kick out of the film."

","This film is about the happenings of two baseball players' year in a minor league team.<br/><br/>""Bull Durham"" is only fairly engaging, which is a surprise as it is a sports movie. The reason is that it is not really about baseball. In is in fact about two baseball players and a woman with a thing for baseball players. Hence, the poignant scenes of victory are not prominently seen in ""Bull Durham"". Fortunately, the three main characters are equally interesting. Susan Sarandon is particularly memorable as a temptress, her desperate exclamation after her failure to seduce Tim Robbins is intense and also comical at the same time."
"jboothmillard","7","0","1","6 July 2010"," Bull Durham
","Kevin Costner was in quite a few films focusing on baseball, including Field of Dreams and For the Love of the Game, and this is the one that features in 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die. Basically Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon) is latched onto the ""Church of Baseball"", and it is tradition for her to select an up and coming player from the Durham, North Carolina baseball team, the Bulls. The Bulls have introduced Ebby Calvin LaLoosh, later nicknamed 'Nuke' (The Shawshank Redemption's Tim Robbins) as the pitcher to the team, and Annie has chosen him to share her bed throughout the season. But the wild pitcher can't control his right arm swing quite right, so veteran major-league catcher Crash Davis (Costner) comes to teach him some control. With Nuke having more control of his powerful, he is described as having a million dollar arm, the Bulls are on a winning streak, and Crash convinces Nuke if he sleeps with Annie it will spoil the streak. With Nuke not being with Annie, she instead hooks up Crash, who was her original choice for star player to be with, but jealousy soon becomes an issue and a love triangle is forming. In the end, Nuke has risen to stardom that he is assigned to a higher place, Annie decides that she should probably just enjoy baseball as a game and not a way to hook with star players, and ageing minor Crash may only be able to get a job as manager for a team which he accepts, but he and Annie still stay together. Also starring Trey Wilson as Joe Riggins, Batman's Robert Wuhl as Larry Hockett, William O'Leary as Jimmy, David Neidorf as Bobby and Danny Gans as Deke. Costner is good as the old pro who coaches the rising star pitcher, Sarandon does well as the player loving groupie, but for me, Robbins stole the show with his powerful swings and lovable slightly dim-witted nature, it also shows baseball as a good game, it is certainly a sport comedy drama to see. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Original Screenplay, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""When a Woman Loves a Man"". Kevin Costner was number 93, and Susan Sarandon number 25 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and the film was number 97 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!"

","I never thought that a movie about minor league baseball could be so entertaining. Bull Durham is funny, sexy and very blunt in its depiction of two popular national pastimes. The movie chronicles the season from the eyes of two players, ""Nuke"" Laloosh and Crash Davis. Nuke is a young hotshot pitcher and Crash is a veteran ball player hired to refine and tame Nuke. Susan Sarandon plays Annie, a sort of baseball groupie that spends each season with one minor league player. The unconditional love triangle set up in Bull Durham makes a for a very unique and often quite humorous sequence of events. Sarandon is perfect in her role as is Tim Robbins, playing the hot-headed Laloosh. My favorite performance is that of Kevin Costner. He creates a seasoned, rough and darkly humorous Crash Davis whose relationship with baseball is frustrating and unfair. A great storyline and even greater acting make Bull Durham almost impossible not to like. I am not much of a baseball fan and i love this movie. It takes a whole new approach to telling the story of an athlete's and it is in no way (in its depiction of characters and sport) like most other baseball movies. It is tragic and comical all at the same time. Bull Durham will make you appreciate baseball more, but it will not make you want to become a ball player."
"MHay10","9","0","1","11 December 2006"," Great Movie.
","Bull Durham is a terrific movie that uniquely shows a relationship between baseball, love, and second chances. Crash Davis (Kevin Costner) has had a chance to play in the major league, but finds himself back in the minors training Nuke (Tim Robbins), a young pitcher with a wild arm. Costner does a wonderful job in his role as a smart, witty, charismatic ball player who struggles with Nuke because he has talent and potential to play in the majors but refuses to listen to Crash. Susan Surandon plays Annie, a charming woman who picks one player from the team each season to ""be devoted to"". The chemistry among the three main characters is what makes this movie so great, from the love-hate relationship between Crash and Nuke, to the sexual tension felt throughout the entire film between Crash and Annie. Bull Durham could be described as a baseball movie, but I think it could be better described as a film about lessons learned through second chances and love and how those affect the game of baseball."
"gavin6942","7","0","6","23 September 2006"," Possibly the best Kevin Costner Baseball Film
","First of all, I still don't know why this film is called ""Bull Durham"". The team they play for is called the Durham Bulls, but if there's some meaning to bull durham, I'm not familiar with it. So that really confused me.<br/><br/>Second, this may be Kevin Costner's best baseball movie. I really enjoyed ""Field of Dreams"" a lot, but this one seemed to have more spirit to it. I guess it depends what you want... Tim Robbins co-starring or Ray Liotta.<br/><br/>Otherwise, a great film. Kevin Costner is Crash Davis, a catcher who has spent way too many years in the minor leagues. He is training Nuke (Tim Robbins), a pitcher with a lot of potential. And then there's Susan Sarandon, who creates a love triangle when she enters their relationship, claiming sex with her can create a better ball player.<br/><br/>Tim Robbins has consistently made great movies, even disposable stuff like ""Nothing to Lose"". And Kevin Costner is an epic actor (which can get on some people's nerves at times). So their interaction is both wonderful and grand, even though there's nothing new about baseball movies or older people teaching the new guy.<br/><br/>Susan Sarandon was the worst part of the film. She could have been removed entirely. Why Nuke is attracted to her is unknown ,because she's like Skeletor. And then why is Crash Davis attracted to her, when she's slept with most of the guys on the team? Old, ugly and promiscuous... I don't get it. And as the film goes on, her part gets bigger and bigger. And since she does the voice-overs, I almost wonder if this is her story disguised as a baseball film.<br/><br/>There were many scenes that are quite memorable... and I really liked the bull that gives you a free steak.<br/><br/>But in the end, after all the fun is over, the sadness sinks in. We realize Kevin Costner will never go anywhere. Maybe he'll fall in love and have kids. Maybe he'll be in the minor leagues forever. But he can never get back to the majors... he is the tragic and fallen hero seeking redemption through Nuke. I won't wax philosophic about that more than I already have, but his character is very deep when really considered.<br/><br/>Don't let the boring box cover or Susan Sarandon scare you off. This one is a home run."

","Felt compelled to comment after reading the other review--this is the funniest sports movie ever, and probably in the top 10 of all comedies. Yes, Costner was a tad unconvincing as a ballplayer, but held his own...what makes this movie so great are the unique characters (Crash Davis, Annie Savoy, Nuke, etc...), the side stories and the exploitation of many baseball clichÃ©s. Granted, if you are not a baseball fan,you'll get less out of this movie...but still one of my all-time favorites. Even those that don't like baseball can appreciate how the characters address relationships, work, traveling, etc.... Definitely a notch above ""Major League,"" although both movies are must rents during baseball season benchmarks (opening day, All-Star break, and the World Series)."
"Wulfstan10","8","0","1","24 March 2005"," A Great, Entertaining Film
","I mention spoilers to be safe, but my references to possible spoilers are very general and vague, so don't really give much away.<br/><br/>I'm not even remotely a baseball fan, yet I really like and appreciate this film. I can still appreciate this theme in the movie and how this film develops it. It does a great job at conveying the love people have for the sport, and at presenting a fun, sensitive, convincing comedy/drama about things which baseball players and fans supposedly dream about or hold dear.<br/><br/>One of the other real strengths of this film is that, unlike a lot of sports movies, it is really about the characters and their development rather than about their team, a ""big game,"" etc. This makes the film more meaningful, gives it much more depth, and provides a broader appeal to non-sports fans like me. The real core of this film is not how players come together to bring the team through, etc., but how the characters address their personal issues. The characters are strong and mostly convincing, the result of a strong screenplay and good acting, and they undergo meaningful development addressing their specific issues. This development is also not formulaic or predictable, with the result for each being at least somewhat mixed, and all the more convincing and poignant as a result.<br/><br/>I shall add that, apparently like many, I have mixed opinions about Kevin Costner and find many of his later films and roles to be mediocre or worse, and giving the impression of an inflated ego. However, he does very well here and he fits this film and his character perfectly. This is definitely one of his best films and best performances, probably only inferior to his truly great role as Ness in the Untouchables. The latter was the first time I had seen him and I loved him in that movie. Unfortunately, with a few exceptions he pretty much went down hill after that. This film is definitely one of the exceptions, so one should not avoid it just because one may have been turned off by Costner in other films.<br/><br/>There are also some quite humorous parts of the film, which help keep a lighthearted tone. Like most of the film, these are handled quite well, and can be quite witty and intelligent.<br/><br/>This is, all round, a very solid, and entertaining comedy/drama which is not by-the-numbers and which achieves its aims quite well."

","This is one of the few sports movies that's actually more about people than sports -- there's no big game, no win or die situations. One doesn't even have to care about baseball all that much to enjoy the film . And the dialog operates at a level substantially higher than the typical sports film -- it's both poignant and hilarious (Costner's speech about what he believes is worth the viewing alone). Of special note is the character development -- each of the lead characters is at a real crossroads, and things don't work out ideally for each. Crash doesn't get to the Show; he gets released instead. And Nuke barely knows that he's succeeded, or why. Like I said, maybe not an Oscar-worthy pick, but definitely thoroughly entertaining and one of my all-time favorites."

","I'm shocked at the poor reviews people are giving this film. It's one of the smartest films of the 1980s. Ron Shelton is one heck of a writer, and it's probably the best film he's directed, too. Like Tootsie, this film is a throwback to 1930s literate screenplays -- Pauline Kael said this film reminded her of Preston Sturges. Perhaps people who don't like it want some sentimental rot like Field of Dreams, or more action like some other sports movie. But this is a romantic-comedy, and it's both romantic and very funny.

For a brief, but wonderful time, Orion Pictures signified great movies.  This was one of them.<br/><br/>Bull Durham is a wonderfully romantic look at the world of minor league baseball and relationships.  Director Ron Shelton presented a loving tribute to his days as a ballplayer and the men who played with him.  He also presented one of the most interesting love triangles and some of the most romantic and sexyist love scenes ever put on celluloid.<br/><br/>Everyone is great in this.  Costner is the aging ballplayer just trying to hang on until it's time to hang up his cleats.  Susan Sarandon is the existential groupie who molds young players, but falls hard for the veteran. Tim Robbins is the rookie who learns about the game and life from both. Add great supporting performances from Trey Wilson and Robert Wuhl, as well as the rest of the team.<br/><br/>The film has endured well because the emotion and relationships that are the center of it hold true.  It's not just a baseball movie.  It's a coming of age story, a romance, and the end of a chapter in life.  It is warm, funny, loving, and oh so entertaining.<br/><br/>It's interesting to watch the dvd and listen to the commentary track from Kevin Costner and Tim Robbins. It is quite entertaining, but, when the film reaches Costner and Sarandon's love scenes, Robbins gets very quiet, and Costner becomes very uncomfortable trying to cover the silence.  Robbins' comment that they haven't shown this film to their kids brings a bit of a chuckle.  How do you explain Dad with another woman at the beginning and Mom with another man at the end?

","I've read most of the comments that have come before mine. And everyone is entitled to their opinion. So here is mine...<br/><br/>This is a fantastic movie. I fell in love with Kevin Costner's Crash Davis because he was passionate about the game and the integrity that should be afforded America's greatest pastime(although not always it's players). I've been around a lot of baseball players - and these characters are a dead on portrayal of a very dynamic group of men - how they act and how they think. They swear, they fight, some of them love the game, some of them only think of themselves, and players should ALWAYS respect a streak. Parts of it may be romanticized - but it's the movies! It's supposed to be. The heart of this movie is pure. It's wonderfully done.<br/><br/>Ok - Nuke is unrealistically old for the part. But I have enjoyed this movie since I first saw it on video in 1989 - and I don't care. I appreciate that they cast an actor that could capture the spirit of who Nuke, as a character, was intended to be. And Tim Robbins did that VERY well. [The first time I saw Tim speak as himself (which was only recently)- I was shocked at how intelligent he was!] Most young actors could not accurately invest that kind of retrospect to the ""fear and ignorance"" that 20-somethings hide behind to take on the world.<br/><br/>Finally, I have to say, this is the best quotable movie in the world! My husband and I know most of the lines between us. This was the first movie we ever bought - before we even owned a VCR. There are so many wonderful lines and speeches: ""I believe in the soul..."" ""I know women like you..."" ""Cute? Baby ducks are cute!"" ""Candlesticks make a nice gift..."" And I'm sure I'm leaving out some of the best ones.<br/><br/>I can understand why people who do not like baseball or have not had great exposure to the game would not fully enjoy this movie. And I feel sorry for them. But then there are movies they probably enjoy much more than I do because of their different experiences - and for that I feel sorry for me! But I do know that this is a great movie.<br/><br/>If you ""love"" baseball and do not love this movie - you may be able to score a game, or root for the home team, but you do not understand the heart of the game."

The scenes at the minor league ballparks were shot in a very appealing way. Small grandstands and outfield walls covered in advertisements are common sites in the film. The movie's casting is excellent. Costner, Robbins and Sarandon work great together. Any scene with Coster and Robbins together is exciting to watch because their friendship takes interesting turns as it develops. You can't tell if they're getting along or upset at each other.

","BULL DURHAM is many things: romantic comedy, buddy picture, sports movie, and character driven comedy. It's also about realizing one's potential, accepting one's limits, and growing as a human being. And it's about the religiousity of baseball and all of its rituals and pieces of insiders' knowledge. But the two main things this movie has going for it are the writing and acting. The dialogue sparkles, and allows for both a tone of witty existential bemusement, appropriate to a story that deals so much with both play and transience, and for the main characters to come across as having greater depth than might be initially realized. The acting, by main cast members Susan Sarandon, Kevin Costner, and Tim Robbins, is great and shows authentic talent, particularly by the sometimes (in other movies) wooden Costner - here, in one of his very best performances, he stands out and gives a truly moving performance. The remaining supporting cast is also fine. This is among the very best sports movies ever made. It's so good, in fact, that I've always thought that a sequel might have been worthwhile."

The plight of the not-quite-good-enough player is shown in startling clarity. It's a situation common to most sports, I would imagine. The desperation of the players to get a hit and keep their place in the team is clear and you can't help but feel for the guy who gets let go. In fact, all the characters are desperate in their own way. Crash is desperately trying to hang on to the only life he knows; Annie is desperately trying to find meaning and purpose; Nuke is just plain desperate!

Which makes their love scenes more believable. My favorite part of this movie is when the three main characters meet for the first time. Back at Annie's house after a few drinks at a local bar. It is there where Crash tells Annie what he believes in. Such as the small of a womans back, the hanging curve ball, opening your Christmas presents Christmas morning rather than Christmas Eve, etc. And to hear her say ""Oh My"" at the end of that speech makes me sigh. I really don't understand baseball, but you don't really have to to enjoy this movie. From my personal opinion this is one of the funniest movies I have ever see. I will recomend this movie for any one who likes Kevin Costner. Watch it and think of me at the end of that speech!"

","Why is this the best baseball movie ever made?  Because to those of us who have played the game, it paints the ultimate portrait of the stoic struggle between love and failure, and the addiction it creates.  Baseball is one of the few endeavors in life where a seventy percent failure rate is considered successful, and yet few reach that plateau. This is where this movie becomes special.  Almost as important as the physical skills needed to play the game is the mental toughness needed to persevere in the game.  The world is filled with people who do with their life something they love, cherish, and respect, so this angle is nothing new.  This movie takes that angle and adds to the equation rejection on a multitude of levels. Up until ""Nuke"" LaLoosh gets his September call up from Class A ball (virtually unheard of), this is the most realistic portrait of, when stripped of the greedy and indifferent stereotypes brandishing it, the greatest game ever invented."
