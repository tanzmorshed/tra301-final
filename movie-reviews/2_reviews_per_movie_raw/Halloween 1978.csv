"baumer","10","382","452","28 July 1999"," The personification of fear
","I have just recently been through a stage where I wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. I have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like The Haunting and Urban Legend and such. I feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. And it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. I already own all the Friday's so I rented The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the original Nightmare On Elm Street, Jaws, The Exorcist, Angel Heart, The Exorcist and Halloween. Now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that I want to tell you about Halloween. Because what Halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. I was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as I knew it was, I wanted to look behind me to see if Michael Myers was there. No movie that I have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. No movie.<br/><br/>John Carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. He showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. Because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. What was that shadow? What was that noise upstairs? He knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that I think you can use. I even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. But they don't. No one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. And it is just not the same. You can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. It's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. And Halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.<br/><br/>In 1963 a young Micael Myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. As Loomis ( his doctor) says to Sheriff Brackett, "" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. "" That sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. And all he wants here is to kill Laurie. No one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( Halloween II continues the story quite well )<br/><br/>What Carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. There is one scene that has to be described. And that is the scene where Annie is on her way to pick up Paul. She goes to the car and tries to open it. Only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. She gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. The audience picks up on this but she doesn't. She is too busy thinking about Paul. When she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. She is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then Myers strikes, from the back seat. This is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. We know what is happening and Annie doesn't. But it's astute observations that Carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond. <br/><br/>Halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by Donald Pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. It should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. After all, Carpenter followed in Hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.<br/><br/>Halloween personifies everything that scares us. If you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then Halloween is a film that should be seen. It won't let you down. I enjoy being scared, I don't know why, but I do. But nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( Wes Craven's final Nightmare ). If you enjoy beings scared, then Halloween is one that you should see. And if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like Urban Legend. Urban Legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. Halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. Now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?<br/><br/>And just to follow up after seeing Zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. This is a classic by definition. Zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one."
"Steve-280","Null","143","176","30 December 1998"," Sure scared me back in 78
","I was 20 back in 1978, and saw this on opening weekend.  I knew nothing of it, and after growing up on the old Hammer films, followed by a period of almost nothing, this was quite a nice surprise. It really worked! Had me checking the back seat in cars, gave me a sinking feeling when I lost my keys, etc.  The low death toll and relative lack of blood, as compared to subsequent slasher films, has me really admiring how effectively it created the atmosphere & suspense that kept me on edge, and made me jump at the right places. I certainly don't jump any more at it, but I do have fun remembering what it was like watching it when the now-cliches were fresh & new.  I laugh at the 'horror' flicks of the 30s & 40s, but when they were new, I bet they were something. And I bet in another 20 years, today's toddlers will find Scream/IKWYDLS, et al, to be tame and passe too, at least compared to what they'll (& I'll) be watching then!<br/><br/>I'm surprised at the number of people half my age who wish they could've been around to see this film when it was brand new!<br/><br/>Looking back, Halloween probably scared me more when it was new, than other horror movies have,when they were new.  Horror films are indebted to Halloween for breaking some new ground, and I can't wait for the next horror film that will do something on a similar scale."

","Halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever!  John Carpenter and Debra Hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller.  Michael Myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as Jason Vorhees (Friday the 13th), The Miner (My Bloody Valentine), and Charlie Puckett (The Night Brings Charlie). Okay, so I got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre.  No longer did a monster have to come from King Tut's tomb or from Dr. Frankenstein's lab. He could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia.  And on The Night He Came Home...Haddonfield, Illinois and the viewers would never be the same.  There are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies.  First is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood.  Many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters.  This is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.)  Along with the setting, the movie takes place on Halloween!!  The scariest night of the year!  While most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, Michael Myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers.  Besides the setting, there is some great acting. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date.  However, it is Donald Pleasance, as Dr. Sam Loomis, who really steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of Michael Myers and feels compelled to send him to Hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend.  However, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film.  Once you hear it, you will never forget it.  I also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture.  Nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of.  In Halloween, John Carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at Michael Myers.  He always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, I think that is what makes him so terrifying.  There are many scenes where Michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness.  If you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. Unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find Michael, he's not looking for candy on this Halloween night..he's looking for blood.  Finally, Michael Myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness.  His relentless pursuit of Laurie Strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop.  He is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life.  So,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old DVD and watch in fright.  Trick or Treat!"

","My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece.<br/><br/>Halloween night 1963, little Michael Meyers murders his older sister. All-hallows-eve 1978, Michael escapes from Smith's Grove sanitarium. Halloween night, Michael has come home to murder again.<br/><br/>The story is perfectly simple, Michael stalks and kills babysitters. No bells or whistles, just the basics. It's Carpenter's almost over-powering atmosphere of dread that generates the tension. Like any great horror film, events are telegraphed long in advance, yet they still seem to occur at random, never allowing the audience to the chance to second guess the film.<br/><br/>The dark lighting, the long steady-cam shots, and (most importantly) that damn eerie music create the most claustrophobic and uncomfortable scenes I have yet to see in film. There is a body count, but compared to the slew of slashers after this it's fairly small. That and most of the murders are nearly bloodless. The fear is not in death, but in not knowing.<br/><br/>The acting is roundelay good. PJ Soles provides much of the films limited humor (and one of the best deaths), Nancy Loomis turns in a decent performance and then there is the young (at the time) Jamie Leigh-Curtis. Her performance at first seems shy and un-assured, yet you quickly realize that it is perfect for the character, who is herself shy and un-assured and not at all prepared for what she is to face. And of course there is the perfectly cast Donald Pleasence as the determined (perhaps a little unstable) Dr. Sam Loomis. Rest in peace Mr. Pleasence.<br/><br/>If the film has a detrimental flaw, it would be the passage of time. Since the release of this film so many years ago nearly countless clones, copies, rip-offs, and imitators have come along and stolen (usually badly) the films best bits until nearly everything about it has become familiar. Combined with the changes for audience expectations and appetites, one finds much of the films raw power diluted. To truly appreciate it in this day and age, it must be viewed as it once was, as something unique.<br/><br/>Never the less, I have no reservation with highly recommending this film to anyone looking for a good, scary time. Highest Reguards.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Hotstar","9","193","250","27 February 2005"," The Greatest of the Slasher Flicks
","John Carpenter's Halloween is quite frankly a horror masterpiece. It tells the immortal story of escaped mental patient Michael Myers, who returns to his hometown on Halloween night to stalk and kill a group of babysitters.<br/><br/>This was the first and without doubt the best in the Halloween franchise. Carpenter shows great restraint in pacing the story very slowly and building likable characters; unusual for a horror picture.<br/><br/>Even more unusual is the non-existence of blood and gore, and yet it remains the scariest Halloween to date. <br/><br/>Halloween marked the film debut of Jamie Lee Curtis and a defining point in the late great Donald Pleasence's career. A true classic."
"TheMgnt","Null","228","298","4 August 1998"," It *is* a classic
","To begin, this is a twenty year old film.  Few films remain as suspenseful today as they did when it came out.  (see: Night of the Living Dead -- had people running from the theatres when released but is very tame today).  Clearly a movie fan brought up on the standards of today's movies will fail to find enjoyment of such 'classic' films.  But when watching Halloween today perhaps it helps to consider a few things: Halloween was a low budget film (read: bad acting, poor special effects) made for only $300,000.  It was not a product of Hollywood but a bunch of 20 year olds.  This was the first film to feature the Boogeyman that Wouldn't Die which has been ripped off time and time again in the Friday the 13th, Elm Street, Scream, etc.  You're used to it now, but Halloween did it first.  Even Scream ripped off the look of the villian in Halloween.  The theme of teenagers being stalked by a madman has been ripped of numerous times as well (again, Halloween did it first) but what seperates Halloween from the imitators is that it plays on traditional fears: The Thing that Wouldn't Die; the Boogeyman coming to get you; being followed and stalked; the boyfriend returning to the room under a bedsheet -- and it's not really him; someone hiding in the car... all things that have made our skin crawl in real life at one time or another. Watching Halloween tonight again for the first time in years I found myself again on the edge of my seat.  Classic?  Hell, yes.  Maybe not to a generation who feels Scream was a 'good' horror movie but a classic none the less."

","That mask. Wow, is that mask scary. The same can be said about the music. Even 40 years later it completely holds up in every way-it's iconic, it sounds great, it's scary and it's instantly recognizable. Amazingly, John Carpenter wrote and performed the music despite claiming that he cannot write a single note. <br/><br/>Before we see any part of the movie, we hear the music. Instantly, we feel unsettled. Then, watching through first-person stalker cam perspective and through the eyes of a Halloween mask, we observe a young boy peep on his sister then murder her. <br/><br/>Fast forward 15 years and this young boy, Michael Myers, has grown into a man while living in a mental hospital, never once speaking a word. As if summoned by some evil power, he breaks out and travels to his home town of Haddonfield on Halloween. <br/><br/>After breaking out and encountering people in the outside world, Michael still never says a word. It's another inspired filmmaking choice. Hearing his voice would humanize him in some way, instead all we hear is his heavy breathing. <br/><br/>Why Michael returned to his hometown is unclear, as is everything about Michael. That's brilliance of this movie-we never find out why Michael killed his sister, we never find out why he escaped the hospital and we never find out why he continues to kill. <br/><br/>We don't need to learn his reasons. No motive is scarier. <br/><br/>Also scary, he's human. He's not some monster with superpowers (if you ignore the sequels, like you should), he's just a severely disturbed person. Think about that. That means this story is something that could actually happen in any American small town. His victims were seemingly random, so they could be anyone. No one is safe. <br/><br/>Although, as I just mentioned, his killings are random, he does seem to take issue with people having sex. This started the now famous horror trope that characters who have sex are as good as dead. <br/><br/>This movie also popularizes the horror staple of victims who consistently make dumb decisions. Stop dropping the knife! Stop assuming he's dead! It's maddening. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie that stood out to me is its surprising lack of violence. There's virtually no blood or gore. Michael mostly strangles his victims. He uses his knife too, of course, but the killings aren't terribly graphic. It's refreshing change of pace from the excessive violence in modern slashers.<br/><br/>While Michael may seem invincible since he survives two stabbings and multiple gun shot wounds, he is not flawless. Upon my latest re-watch, I noticed how much he struggles with walking. Michael Myers is a hall of fame level killer, but he's a below average walker.<br/><br/>This likely a deliberate choice by director John Carpenter. Not only does Michael's slow walk build suspense, it also lends itself perfectly to the first-person camera shots. The patient, measured movements give him an eerie feel. He's lurking. <br/><br/>We see his lurking figure in many forms, each equally brilliant in its execution. Sometimes we see his outline as a shadow. Sometimes we see him ease into the corner of the frame behind a victim. Other times we see a distant shot of a house of character, then Michael partially steps in frame near the camera. Carpenter expertly mixes foreground and background in his shots to make Michael just far enough away that the characters don't see him but the audience does.<br/><br/>The movie builds and builds and builds. It's definitely scary from the opening scene, but it grows continuously scarier as we see the extent of Michael's killing spree. All the while, jump scares are sparsely used and are never fake. What I mean by that is when the music jars viewers, it's because Michael appears. The music never blares for fake scares, like when a cat runs across screen or a friend knocks on a door, which is annoying trend in recent horror films. <br/><br/>The only scary part of this film is Michael. Fortunately, he's plenty scary to carry the load. <br/><br/>'Halloween' is considered an ageless horror masterpiece. After re-watching it recently, I can clearly see why that is the case."

","Halloween(1978)stars a very young Jamie Lee Curtis, the late Donald Pleasance, and, among others, P.J. Soles(the cap-brat from Carrie). The story centers around the demented/catatonic-schizophrenic Michael Myers and the brutal, cold-blooded murder of his oldest sister in 1963(done by him). Now it is fifteen years later and Michael has escaped the sanitarium and is headed for Haddonfield, Illinois, home of Laurie Strode(Curtis), his sister who was adopted shortly after the 1963 murder. Laurie has no idea about her past and wanders around with her friends, seemingly free of worry, and unaware that her every step is under careful watch from hiding eyes.<br/><br/>In the long run I am at a loss for words. Everything is here. And it's even terrifying...and a slasher movie, what a combination. Slasher movies, to me, usually aren't scary. But Halloween is. Seriously, if you haven't seen it yet you are really missing out. It's a rare achievement in film history and is one of the best horror movies ever made. It's a perfect 10/10 all the way!!!"

","So much has been said about John Carpenter's 'Halloween' that adding anything to it will be like adding a few drops of water to the ocean. People have their own opinions when they review 'Halloween', but I am going to share my own experiences that I had with 'Halloween'.<br/><br/>As the opening credits begin, we are introduced to a sinister looking pumpkin (Jack-O-Lantern) that looks spooky yet funny and harmless with its eyes, nose and jagged mouth lit by the candle inside. Looking at it for a few seconds, the viewers then begin reading the cast and crew names....Donald Pleasance in John Carpenter's 'Halloween', Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie.....P.J. Soles as Lynda...Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett....then Featuring: Kyle Richards, Brian Andrews...and by the time you reach 'Irwin Yablans' and 'Debra Hill' part.....You are just shocked to see that the 'sinister looking pumpkin' you almost forgot is now so close to you that you have no chance to escape its evil eye! That's what Michael Myers is for me! That's the beauty of Halloween.....The evil sneaks close to you and the worst thing is YOU ARE NOT PREPARED TO FACE IT!!!!<br/><br/>Michael Myers is faceless, but being faceless makes him more menacing and scary. The 'fear of unknown' is more bone-chilling than the 'fear of known'. Michael Myers is unpredictable. We know he is evil.....and he only wants to do evil for sure......but how would he do it? We never know this. He uses his silence as a cloak to hide his deadly yet unknown agendas. <br/><br/>Moving ahead in our lives, we always think it will be like that forever. Same old routine, going to college, working part time, chit-chatting with friends, teasing and gossiping. Life seems so easy, safe and enjoyable....Isn't it? But then a violent faceless 'shape' (Guess who 'The Shape' is!), whom we never thought of, shows up suddenly out of nowhere. His path of life, his point of view, his aim and his everything is entirely different from the common definitions and stuffs of life! You never noticed him (just like the sinister looking pumpkin) and remained busy in your daily chores, and eventually when he came very close....you realize that it's too late to escape death!<br/><br/>Halloween needs to be preserved for eternity. It's an amazing combination of horror, mystery, nostalgia and music and fortunately each of its aspects work so well that together they give us this towering masterpiece. John Carpenter taught me to believe in boogeyman. He taught me that they do exist. He taught me to keep an eye on the dangers that may be hiding in vicinity and finally he taught me to keep the lights on while watching 'Halloween'. <br/><br/>I really thank John Carpenter for making it way better than it was expected to be and for making something that has been scaring us for the last 37 years and I bet it will continue to do so till 'Horror' genre is alive."
"film-critic","10","87","120","12 October 2005"," ...but you cannot kill the boogeyman!!!
","I must admit, this is one of my favorite horror films of all time. The unique way that John Carpenter has directed this picture, opening the door to so many mock-genres, it will chill you to the bone whether it is your first time watching it or your fiftieth. The sound, the menacing horror of Michael Meyers and the infamous scream of Jamie Lee Curtis gives this film instant cult status and a great start for the independent era. I love the music, I love the characters, the familiar yet spooky setting, the simplistic nature of the villain, and the random chaos of it all. There is no really rhyme or reason to the killing in this first film, giving us a taste of Michael's true nature. Is he insane, or in some way just a very brilliant beast? That question may never be truly answered, but Carpenter gives us his 100% and more devotion to this amazing masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Carpenter is the master of horror. While lately his films have not been the caliber that they once were (see Ghosts of Mars), Halloween began his powerhouse of a career. This is his ultimate film. While he did release other greats, I will always remember this one as the film that caused me to turn on all the lights, beware when babysitting, and check behind closed doors, because you never knew where the evil would appear next. Carpenter has this amazing ability to bring you into the world in which he weaves. With the power of his camera, he places these images of Meyers in places you least expected while giving you the perception as if the murderer is right next to you. I loved every scene in which we panned back and there was Michael, watching from the distance, without anyone the wiser. That was scary, yet utterly brilliant. I loved the scenes in which Carpenter pulled your fright from nearly thin air. There you would be, minding your own business, when suddenly that horrid mask would appear out of nowhere. Like the characters, you too thought it was just a trick of the eye, but that is where Carpenter gets you, it isn't. Michael isn't a ghost, he is a human being (or at least we think), yet he has a stronger mental ability than most of the main characters. This leads into some really dark themes and unexplored symbolism, but even without that, this is a spooky film.<br/><br/>Then, if you just didn't have enough of Michael just vaporizing in the windows of your house, Carpenter adds that chilling theme music. I still have that tapping of the piano keys in my mind, constantly wondering if Meyers is looking at me through the window. Carpenter has found the perfect combination of visual frights and chilling sounds to foreshadow what may happen to our unsuspecting victims next. It is lethal, and it is done with refreshing originality and more unique thrills than anything released by today's Horror Hollywood could muster. Carpenter's Halloween is a breath of fresh air in the midst of what could be a rough horror year, with actual scares being replaced by Paris Hilton, you know that the quality isn't quite the same.<br/><br/>Finally, I would like to say that even the simplistic nature of the opening murder in this film is terrifying and chilling. The use of the ""clown"" mask sent shivers up my spine. The way that it was filmed with that elongated one shot using the child's mask as if it were our own eyes is still one of the best horror openings ever! It completely sets the tone for the remainder of that film. You have the babysitter theme, you have the childish behavior which carries with Michael throughout the film, and you have the art talent of Carpenter all rolled into one. I could literally speak for hours upon hours about this film, but instead I would rather go watch it again. It is worth the repeat visit many times! <br/><br/>Overall, I think this is one of the most outstanding films in cinematic history. Skip all those foreign films that think that they are going to chance the face of movies leave it to a budget tight Carpenter and the slasher film genre. This singular movie redefined a whole generation of horror films, and still continues to be an influence on modern-day horror treats. The lethal combination of a genuinely spooky murderer, the powerful cinematography of the events (which normally doesn't amount to much in horror films), and the beauty of Jamie Lee Curtis is exactly what makes Halloween that film above the rest. Sure, Freddy is cool and you feel sympathetic for Jason, but Michael is real, he is troubled, and he is on the loose lusting for the blood of babysitters. What can be better? <br/><br/>Grade: ***** out of *****"

","Halloween is one of those movies that gets you skin deep! It is in my opinion, the scariest movie of all time. Michael Myers is the best boogeyman ever! He was just so terrifying! What makes Halloween so special is that there was no special effects where you can tell how computer animated it is, this was on a low budget and had a one note score, yet managed to scare the Hell out of people. 25 years and this movie still has the same effect as it did in '78.<br/><br/>It's about a boy Michael Myers, he kills his sister at the age of 6 and so many years later escapes the mental institution. Dr. Sam Loomis is after him and will do anything to get him back, since he describes Michael as ""...pure evil. The blackest eyes, the Devil's eyes"". Michael is on a mission though, to kill his other sister, Laurie, played by a new Jamie Lee Curtis. She has to babysit on Halloween, while her friends are out partying and of course, we know the rules, they get it! But Laurie may stand a chance since she's the virgin. ;D <br/><br/>Halloween pays many homages to Psycho, we have another character named Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curis, the daughter of Janet Leigh. Halloween is an absolute terrific movie that breaks boundaries and makes you lock the doors, bolt your windows, and turn off the lights! ""They're gonna get you! They're gonna get you!"". Halloween, the ultimate horror film! <br/><br/>10/10"
"NpMoviez","10","18","22","19 October 2019"," A true and deserving horror classic. Thanks John Carpenter.
","Whenever we talk about the classic slasher films, we must mention at least two names - A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), Halloween (1978). That's what this movie is - a pure classic. You know what Friday the 13th films are? Something that started with a RIPOFF of Halloween. That's how important this film is! Who knows? Had it not been successful, we might have never got a Friday the 13th films at all!<br/><br/>Good : This usually is in my negatives in a slasher film, but here, it is in the positives - the characters. The characters we get introduced to in this film are very interesting. It doesn't feel like as if they're there to get killed, except for a final lady character. Laurie, our main girl played by Jamie Lee Kurtis, stands out to be one of my favorite final girls in the so-called classic slashers. Her friends are not just blant and useless characters either. They are not as interesting as Laurie, but they do entertain us either by getting killed or by interacting with other characters. I won't say all the characters are memorable, that's (perhaps) never the case in these type of films, but at least they don't feel forced and boring. Michael Myers. The tiny introduction to the character, for me, was sufficient to get behind him. We actually get to see what happened to him, or what made him the killer that he was. In short, Michael Myers was a good antagonist for me. However, all these are the secondary factors, which make this film good. The main aspects that need to be acknowledged for making this film so good, even after 40 years, would be John Carpenter. His imagination gave us Michael Myers. His screenplay served as the basis of this film. His music in this film gave chills. His direction made it a classic. I don't think the screenplay was a unique piece of writing. It could've been used to make a dumb Friday the 13th film too. It's the direction of Carpenter that made the movie so good. Throughout the film, we can feel the creepy presence of Michael Myers and we do not have a single moment to relax. That's something which makes a film like this work. Not just kills. Or loud sound effects. This movie apparently understood it very well. The suspense and the thrills are built very effectively and all of the thrills are worth the respective conclusions. The third act is a rollercoaster ride, to be honest. What I am going to say now can be put in ""mixed"" aspects, but I am not going to do so. If you show this movie to someone who has watched the modern day slasher films, he or she will definitely say ""what's the big deal, the movie is clichéd"". I would definitely agree to that - had it been a movie made in this date. It was made back when such films weren't so popular and if you think that this movie is obvious, you must know that movies like these are the ones which apparently gave us the clichéd template of slashers. It is a trend setter, in that respect. A movie being a trend setter is one of its biggest accomplishments. One more positive about this film. Compared to Nightmare and Friday films, the ending works in this movie. I would definitely say that the ending is quite similar to that of the first Friday and first Nightmare movie. There's a lot of mystery behind Michael Myers and they barely acknowledge him as ""inhuman"" - not confirming as if he was a supernatural entity or just an emotionless killer - and, he looks like a human. Even though we know enough about Myers to get behind him, even though Myers gets over with us, we still don't know many things about him. So, the ending makes us more curious about the character and hypes up for the sequel, even though it wasn't meant to be given sequels. It absolutely wasn't shoehorned to make room for the sequels like in the other two franchises I mentioned. Yet another positive. The character of Dr. Loomis is an integral part of what makes the story engaging. If you compare the first Nightmare film with it, we like the first Nightmare film because we get to know a great deal about Freddy and the psychological horror aspect of the movie was engaging. So, it didn't really need a ""stopping agent"" like Loomis. But comparing with Friday films, it lacks a character like Loomis to hold the movie tightly, which becomes a weak compilation of slicing scenes (roughly speaking). Dr. Loomis may not seem like a character which was integral to the movie. But, had he not been there, the movie might not have worked so well. I often get confused about which movie - among this one and first Nightmare film - I like the most. But, I always tend to put this one above just because of the ending that doesn't bug me.<br/><br/>Conclusion : It's one of those movies which deserve to be called ""classic"". Even though the tropes may seem familiar, it was perhaps the first one to use such tropes so effectively. Thus, viewing in the retrospect will make you enjoy this movie even more. .

","Oh the memories!  I was 9 years old when I first saw this movie on HBO with my younger cousin and older brother....it was about 1980.  It was so creepy. When the movie went off me and my cousin were too scaried to go to bed so we stayed up until the infamous ""Night Tracks"" went off on TBS (REMEMBER NIGHT TRACKS??).  The 'Halloween' Movie Theme stayed with me for years. Everytime I hear the theme I think back to when I was a kid.  I would often dread when my parents would go out on the weekends and let my older brother babysit me.  I just knew that Micheal Myers would know that my parents were not home and kill me. In my opinion, a movie should stay with you long after the movie is over. That's what 'Halloween' did for me.  Each Halloween night, I remember back to 1978, when 'Halloween' came out.  I think of the young scared child that I was and how good the first 'Halloween'movie really was!"

","I must have watched this movie a hundred times or more, apart from being possibly the greatest horror movie of all time, it's a damn good movie in its own right. Fantastic story, really well acted, plus it has one of the best musical scores I have ever heard. How many films can boast a soundtrack that can evoke such feelings as Halloween? not many. 37 years later and it's as watchable today as it was back then.<br/><br/>Talk about getting the acting balance spot on, Jamie Lee Curtis made the perfect victim, brilliantly set against Michael Myers, the perfect bad guy, and Donald Pleasance was utterly flawless as Doctor Loomis. I hadn't realised just how good Donald Pleasence was in this film, the speech he made was almost iconic.<br/><br/>It plays on so many of our fears, the young Michael in a clown mask, still as shocking today as it was back then. The thought of the bogeyman following you home, waiting on a street corner for you etc, the list is endless.<br/><br/>I cannot believe having just watched it the lack of blood and gore, goes to show it simply didn't need it, it's the suspense and fear that creates the horror.<br/><br/>There have been so many rip offs and 'homages' to Halloween, but there will only ever be one King of the Horror films, and that's Halloween! Thank you John Carpenter. 10/10"

","This was a movie that I had heard about all my life growing up, but had never seen it until a few years ago. It's reputation truly proceeded it. I knew of Michael Myers, had seen the mask, saw commercials for all of the crummy sequels that followed. But I was growing up during the decade where Jason and Freddy had a deadly grip on the horror game, and never thought much of the Halloween franchise. Boy, how I was being cheated with cheap knock offs.<br/><br/>Halloween is a genuinely terrifying movie. Now, by today's standards, it isn't as graphic and visceral, but this film delivers on all the other levels most horror movies fail to achieve today. The atmosphere that John Carpenter creates is so creepy, and the fact that it is set in a quaint, mid-west town is a testament to his ability. The lighting effects are down right horrifying, with ""The Shape"" seemingly appearing and disappearing into the shadows at will. The simple yet brutally effective music score only adds to the suspense.<br/><br/>The performances by all the players are well done, with specific nods to Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Ms. Curtis is such a good Laurie Strode because she is so likable and vulnerable. It is all the more frightening when she is being stalked by Michael Myers because the director and viewer have invested so much into her, we want her to survive and get away.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Loomis like a man on a mission, and it works well. He adds a sense of urgency to the predicament the town finds itself in because he knows what evil stalks their streets.<br/><br/>Overall, not only is Halloween a great horror movie, but also a great film. It works on many levels and draws the audience in and never lets up. This should be standard viewing for anyone wanting to experience a truly scary movie. And for an even more frightful time, try watching it alone with the lights off. Don't be surprised if you think you see ""The Shape"" lurking around in the shadows!"

","Halloween is one of the best examples of independent film. It's very well made and has more psychological elements to it than you might realize at first glance. It is a simple movie told very well. The music is perfect and is one of the most haunting scores... If you haven't seen this movie yet, you must check it out. The cast is all terrific. I wish they had never made sequel after sequel. The first one was by far the best and should have ended like it did without having a sequel. It was fun to see Jamie Lee Curtis in the movie. She hasn't seemed to age (she's just as gorgeous today, without the hairdo and seventies clothes). The scenes through the mask are one of the scariest things ever!"
"PyreworksShow","10","24","32","1 August 2007"," Another movie I never miss during the Halloween season
","The first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with it. The atmosphere was what caught my attention first and foremost. I expected a gore fest, but instead got to watch a highly intelligent killer mess with my head to a chilling soundtrack (it's actually my ringer at the moment :P). The fact that I couldn't predict when he'd kill and when he'd disappear was a major plus in my book. Predictable horror movies bore me. Now, I know the storyline had some discrepancies, but, if you're like me, you don't even notice them until long after the movie's over and you're laying in bed mauling over the fact that you just witnessed a masterpiece in motion. Finally, as I mentioned, the soundtrack is timeless. It's one of my all time favorite theatrical scores, so I was very happy to hear that Rob Zombie is leaving it untouched in his remake. Speaking of the remake, I read a very comprehensive article on it and, now that I know that Mr. Zombie reveres John Carpenter, I have high hopes for his take on this classic. This movie is great for any time you have a craving for a spine tingling, but it's the perfect addition, opener, finale, you name it for an All Hallow's Eve movie marathon. :)"
"CinemaClown","Null","13","16","31 October 2015"," The Most Influential Of All Slasher Films!
","Possibly the most influential of all slasher films, John Carpenter's Halloween is the reason why this particular subgenre of horror even exists in the first place. Although it wasn't the first of its kind, it certainly was the game-changer for almost every other slasher flick that followed this low-budget indie horror only ended up imitating the formula that this classic originated.<br/><br/>Set in Haddonfield, Illinois, the story of Halloween begins on the titular night in 1963 where we witness the 6-years old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death with a kitchen knife. The plot then jumps 15 years in the span of which Myers remained silent in a mental hospital he was confined to, only to escape from the facility and returns to his hometown to kill some more.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by John Carpenter, whose innate ability to churn out quality pictures from mere scraps of filmmaking elements has earned him a place amongst world cinema's most influential filmmakers, Halloween is one of the finest works of his career that presents the director in complete control of his craft, and the way he sets the pace & eerie tone from the beginning is a delight to watch.<br/><br/>Carpenter creates an uncanny mood during the title sequence only which has nothing but a jack-o-lantern on the black screen, accompanied by the now iconic score, and follows it up with an expertly shot prologue which instantly brings the audience into the story. The script is equally impressive for the character of Michael Myers is handled with extreme care, and the writers leave no stone unturned to show him as an unstoppable force of evil.<br/><br/>The technical aspects are skilfully executed, and every dollar of its low budget is efficiently used in service of the story. Setting the plot in a suburban location turns the very openness of the area into a playground of mayhem. Cinematography is inventive for the camera stalks our characters at all times, benefits from some ingenious placements, and is further uplifted by clever lighting while Editing makes sure that the suspenseful ambiance is kept alive from start to finish.<br/><br/>But the biggest contributor, in my opinion, is John Carpenter's minimal, synthesised score for it elevates the tension to a whole different level and greatly amplifies the desired effect of its disquieting camera-work & editing. Whenever its main theme surfaces on the screen, there's an uneasiness felt in those moments & whispers of an ominous presence dominate those sequences. It's one of Carpenter's most notable musical pieces & is a major reason behind this film's success.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Halloween features a budget-friendly cast in Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, P.J. Soles, Nancy Loomis & Nick Castle. The film marks Curtis' acting debut and she does a neat job as Laurie; a high-school student who's continuously stalked by Myers throughout the movie. Pleasence is in as Myers' psychiatrist and the only person who knows what this homicidal maniac is capable of. And Soles & Loomis do a fine job as Laurie's friends who are also pursued by Myers.<br/><br/>But it's the character of Michael Myers and how he's portrayed in this film that establishes him as one of the greatest antagonists in cinema history. Using nothing but a cheap mask that conveys no emotions, keeping him mute throughout the story & giving him an almost mythic strength that renders him invincible, Carpenter presents Myers as a devil incarnate who kills without empathy, and intelligently uses his presence in the film to build a sinister aura, not to mention the very aspects of this character has gone on to inspire many more villains.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Halloween remains one of the genre-defining films of the 1970s whose narrative structure has been adopted as a blueprint for slasher films ever since and its vast influence on cinema & pop culture cannot be downplayed. There were a couple of moments that bothered me but for the most part, this is a thrilling, entertaining & satisfying ride from Carpenter that is every bit worthy of its legendary status. A lesson in horror filmmaking that downplays the elements of gore & graphic violence to show the lasting effect a consistently maintained tense ambiance can have on the viewers, Halloween is the very definition of a slasher film."
"gab-14712","9","5","5","11 February 2019"," The Horror Film That Started It All!
","1978's Halloween is the definitive horror film. Without this classic, there wouldn't be the 80's slasher flicks we come to know and love today (or do we?). There would be no Nightmare on Elm Street. Genre films are important in today's cinematic world, but would they be if John Carpenter decided not to direct this little tiny horror film? This film went on to spawn endless amounts of sequels and reboots and they practically all failed quality-wise when compared to this film (although the 2018 sequel that ignored the previous movies was very good).<br/><br/>Honestly, it amazes me how John Carpenter was able to create one of the scariest movies ever made. The movie was made on such a low budget, $300,000 to be exact. The movie ended up grossing 47 million dollars domestically and an additional 23 million worldwide thus making the movie the most successful independent movie of all time. The film was well-received when it first appeared onscreen. In fact, esteemed critic Roger Ebert placed the movie in this top ten films of 1978 and he is often a vocal critic of slasher films.<br/><br/>The movie itself is very scary and it works just as well as a psychological thriller as a slasher movie. There is very little gore and hardly any blood, which absolutely surprised me. The majority of the violence takes place offscreen. It is a testament to the uncanny craftmanship of director/screenwriter/composer Carpenter, lead actress Jamie Lee Curtis, screenwriter Debra Hill, and among others to create a franchise that made Michael Myers a forever legend.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier that Halloween was a movie that popularized the genre, thus creating similar slasher films in the 1980's and beyond. Besides that, this movie made many horror movie tropes we see today popular. For example, this movie had the final girl trope, it made a daring movie killing off any characters with a hint of promiscuity or substance abuse, and also Carpenter had scenes showing murders from the killer's point of view. The whole opening sequence involving 6-year old Michael Myers killing his sexually active sister was shown through the little peephole eyes of Michael's costume. Perhaps the most important is the portrayal of women. Critics are vocal how later slasher films are misogynistic and they blame Halloween. Even so, women are given a more stronger stand in this movie and in later movies. Prior to this film, women were helpless people that were saved by the strong male character. Here, Jamie Lee Curtis was able to fend for herself mostly without the help of any male character.<br/><br/>It's a cold night in Haddonfield, Illinois in the year 1963. Michael Myers, a 6-year-old boy, murdered his sister in cold blood. He was taken away to the Warren County Sanitarium and placed under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance). Dr. Loomis was able to see the pure evilness of Michael Myer's soul when no one else could. 15 years later, Michael escapes and Dr. Loomis witnesses the escape. Loomis heads to Haddonfield to warn the town because he knows that is where the villain is heading. Teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), and her friends may be the next victims of Michael Myers. Can they do anything to save themselves?<br/><br/>The performances are excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis was an unknown at the time, although she happened to be the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. Hitchcock was one of Carpenter's idols when it came to the making of this movie. Anyhow, Curtis was a revelation and ultimately gave a convincing portrayal of a quiet, small-town girl turning into a badass warrior in a way. Donald Pleasance added veteran poise to the movie as the male hero, and he had some fantastic scenes and memorable lines of dialogue. His quote, ""I met him, 15 years ago; I was told there was nothing left; no reason, no conscience, no understanding in even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this... six-year-old child with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and... the blackest eyes - the Devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up, because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil,"" may be the best quote of the movie as he describes what we are dealing with.<br/><br/>Overall, Halloween is one of the best films of 1978 and it is the horror movie that set the ground for future horror/slasher films. The tropes we see in today's horror films were introduced in this film. The movie does not rely upon gore or blood as it more wants to play tricks with your brain. It's scary, visceral, and suspenseful. The acting, the direction, and music are what made this movie so good. The ever-famous score by Carpenter gave much suspense to the movie just like John Williams did with 1975's Jaws. Before Freddy Kreuger or Jason, we got Michael Myers. If you like horror films, this should be at the top of your list. If you do not like being scared, give this movie a pass.<br/><br/>My Grade: A-"
"ctrout","10","49","74","8 May 2005"," The Best of the Teenage Horror Films
","Halloween is the story of a boy who was misunderstood as a child. He takes out his problems on his older sister, whom he murders at the beginning of the film. This is just the start of things to come from Michael Myers.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasance plays the doctor who's been studying Myers for years. He knows that something is different about him, something mysteriously evil. This evil will not be contained, and it cannot be stopped.<br/><br/>After an escape from an institution, Myers tracks down his younger sister. If he kills her, there may be an end to the troubles of this misunderstood boy. But he seems to have problems in finishing his sister off as other people get in the way. He manages to take them out while still looking for that one girl he needs.<br/><br/>There have been a lot of those horror movies involving teenagers getting hacked to pieces by a masked or gruesome killer. But this one started it all, sort of. If you think about it, most of those horror movies we all remember are the ones that have Freddy Kruger or Jason chasing around half naked girls. Well, if it wasn't for Halloween, those characters wouldn't have haunted our dreams when we were children.<br/><br/>Halloween's director, John Carpenter, got a lot out of the horror movies of the '50s and combined everything he knew into one film that scared the hell out of a lot of people back in the late '70s. This films solidified him as a director to watch and also jump started the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who plays the girl being stalked by the masked killer.<br/><br/>This film may seem cliché today, but back then there wasn't much out there like this. It's been copied from and ripped off of, but Halloween will always remain the quintessential teenage horror movie. It still gives you chills listening to Carpenter's thrilling music while we see another victim get chased by that shadowy Michael Myers."

","Halloween is a hands down classic horror film. John Carpenter made a film that was often imaited but never duplicated. The camera angles are one of the many things that make the film scary.

Jamie Lee Curtis had a star making role in this movie and if you've never seen the film you should."
"PhillipMichaelH","10","11","14","28 May 2011"," A groundbreaking horror film.
","Released in 1978, John Carpenter's Halloween was shot in 21 days and on a low budget but somehow, the filmmakers were able to pull off an effective movie. What makes this movie work so well is that it's very simple but proves that simplicity can work if it's done the right way. This was a very ambitious film despite the budget it was made on. It's visual style is filled with class and very detailed. The direction and cinematography is some of the most haunting I've ever seen in movies. It never feels like a low budget movie in my mind, director John Carpenter truly cared about the camera and how it was going to tell the story and he also used the anamorphic wide screen, that and Dean Cundey's lighting give the film a very timeless feel. Most low budget movies that were released in the late 60s and 70s are grainy and have a more documentary like feel but Halloween is truly more cinematic.<br/><br/>It is now considered a classic and also the film that launched the slasher films of the 80s. It's become so iconic that it's hard to imagine it being scary anymore. It was the highest grossing independent film in its day. I look back at this movie now and even myself wonder why is it so good. What was it about this movie that made it become the classic that it is now? I can understand why some may not like this movie, I recommend looking at it from a visual standpoint and maybe you will like it but if not then you may be disappointed.<br/><br/>The film launched 7 sequels (all of which I consider to be good films) and a remake from Rob Zombie in 2007 and a sequel in 2009. Maybe I am taking it too far by saying this is my favorite movie but it truly is. It never looses it's power and it reminds me of why I love movies to begin with. It's a great film because it works for what it is, a horror movie. Halloween 2, released in 1981 is equally as good I think. The rest of the series was very well done also. Avoid the remakes though."

","I have only managed to see this classic for the first time a few weeks ago. Being made almost 30 years ago I thought the scary moments would be rather tame. Boy was I wrong. There are some great moments that sent shivers down my spine. Even the acting was great, Jamie Lee Curtis was fantastic and Donald Pleasance was superb.<br/><br/>On the downside it can be rather slow to start but once it gets going there is no stopping it. It makes all the copycats, e.g. Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream look very tame. I can't really say it is Carpenter's best because I have not seen many of his, the only one I can remember of his is Starman (I think he made it). Halloween is the crowning achievement of the horror genre."

"Halloween1247","10","24","35","1 November 2015"," Best Horror Film Of All Time
","Halloween directed by John Carpenter, the movie that started the decade trend of slasher films.<br/><br/>Halloween tells the story of Michael Myers( Nick Castle ), who stabbed his 15-year old sister on Halloween night when he was 6-years old. After being locked up in a mental institution for 15 years, he escapes and begins to stalk a group of high school babysitters. The only character who knows of Michael's capabilities is his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis. <br/><br/>Loomis (Donald Pleasance) believes that Michael is not a human, but an incarnation of evil that will perform acts of murder of eternity. Loomis knows Michael better than anyone else. No one else understands Michael's true capabilities and thinks that Loomis is just being paranoid. Even though Loomis searches for Michael, he is unsuccessful in stopping Michael for most of the film and has little effect on story until the end. Loomis only exist to provide exposition and insight into Michael's actions. <br/><br/>Michael Myers is less of a man and more of a force of nature in physical form. Michael is shown to know how to drive or disable the power to a house, even though he has been sitting in a chair staring at a wall for 15 years. Michael moves in a mechanical fashion, every move Michael makes is done deliberately and efficiently. An injury only temporarily stops Michael, and he is shown to appear and disappear without reason. The original does not give a motive for his killings, giving Michael a kind of mystique. The mask he wears in a white Captain Kirk mask, a neutral face. Michael's victims are forced to die seeing a blank face that is indifferent about killing them. <br/><br/>The main character Laurie Strode (Jaime Lee Curtis) is different from her friends as she is shown to be caring and selfless. Laurie chooses to babysit on Halloween with her friend Annie who drops off the child she herself should have be watching, so that she can go out and have a good time with her boyfriend. Laurie was different though, she watched the child was supposed to and one she did not have to. Laurie even provides some Halloween activities for the kids she babysits. Laurie is a good friend and a good babysitter, so because of these traits in her character, Michael is unable to kill her. <br/><br/>Halloween isn't an isolated horror film. It does not take place in a far-off hotel or the middle of the woods, but in a far more relatable setting of a pair of neighborhood houses. Cries for help are ignored by neighbors who do not want to get involved. Halloween makes good use of the dark nighttime setting. Michael appears to dissolve and appear in the shadows. <br/><br/>The soundtrack by John Carpenter is a haunting, atmospheric soundtrack. It makes the ordinarily seem ominous and unsettling. The sound is what really makes the movie scary and sets the tone. <br/><br/>The film uses certain techniques to hide Michael. Most of time Michael is just a shape in the background, just watching. The opening is a seamless sequence of Michael's P.O.V as he enters the house and kills his sister. This opening leaves the impression that anyone is capable of murder, especially a young child.<br/><br/>The movie ends with Loomis preventing the death of Laurie Strode by shooting Michael out of a 2nd story window. When Loomis goes to check the body, it is revealed that Michael has disappeared. The closing statement is that evil never dies and that it is out there and can be anywhere. <br/><br/>Highly Recommended<br/><br/>10/10"

","This film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. The claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! Actors are fantastic, RIP Donald Pleasance you were fantastic as Dr Loomis, he made the film even better. Without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. Jamie Lee Curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! Her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. She gives a tremendous performance. I loved this film since it scared me like hell back when I seen it in the very early 80's and I still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! The fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. We all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. Death at any turn. Halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. Horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. It's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. As well as Psycho's superb storyline, both of which I adore, I believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. To me Halloween and Psycho are the best films I have ever seen and I will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. Halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time."

","One of the best horror movies ever made. The acting is nothing short of amazing. Jamie Lee Curtis gives one of her best performances ever. This film revolutionized the horror genre with its portrayal of the terrifying Michael Myers. As other films from the horror genre strive for perfection, the one movie that all of them look up to is this, the original badass Halloween. None of the sequels have topped the original, but Halloween H20 and Halloween: Resurrection have been the closest by far. The cinematography, music, and atmosphere are creepy and intense, and the whole movie is an insane thrill ride. Donald Pleasance fits right into the role of Doctor Loomis so perfectly that it is even more of a tragedy that he died before he could reprise his role in H20. I recommend this movie to fans of the genre, no matter what age. This terrifying film transcends all genders and ages (appropriate ages, of course). This is one of the scariest and most disturbing tales ever told, and the directing from John Carpenter proves why he has become such a horror movie icon. I absolutely love this movie, and if you haven't already been a witness to the wonder of the Halloween experience, I really recommend you go seek this movie out immediately--I promise you that it will blow all of your preconceptions about horror films out the window."
"Nightman85","10","16","23","23 December 2005"," THE staple of modern horror!
","Classic, highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Carpenter and star Curtis.<br/><br/>Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloween.<br/><br/>Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece! Carpenter's frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt! The direction often consists of such simple elements, shadows, dark streets, creaking doors, that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy. Carpenter well-times his suspense and his jolting shocks to make them the most effectively startling, that in itself is a feat few horror filmmakers ever manage! Plus, he is wise enough to give us some truly likable young characters and a very scary villain to keep the tension all the more strong. Highest kudos also go to Carpenter's simple, yet frighteningly unnerving music score. In a sense, Halloween is a fine example of a perfect horror film!<br/><br/>The cast is excellent. Young Jamie Lee Curtis does a very nice turn as lovable babysitter Laurie Strode, she's so good that she would go on to be in a number of other horror films before breaking into bigger films. The great Donald Pleasants does a perfect performance as a Myer's doctor, who's desperate to capture him again. Supporting cast Loomis, Soles, Castle, and others are good too.<br/><br/>So like its own villain, Halloween is an unstoppable force that never fails to thrill and chill.

","31 Days Of Horror: Day 31<br/><br/>Here it is, kids. The third corner of the slasher triangle that's essential viewing for any horror fan. John Carpenter made a no budget, streamlined little horror flick back in 1978, one that would start an eight film legacy of mania and legendary prolofic culture in the horror genre. The eternally relentless boogeyman Michael Myers has become an iconic movie monster, and my personal favourite of the slasher stable. From the moment that Carpenter's nerve jangling, haunting synth score kicks in, framing a half lit jack o lantern as the main credits start, we're lulled into a hypnotic, ambient atmosphere of sometimes unbearable tension and razor sharp sound design. The film opens as young Michael Myers snaps, grabs a kitchen knife and murders his teenage sister upstairs. Flash to fifteen years later, mute adult Mikey escapes from the sanitarium he's spent the last decade and a half in, much to the frantic dismay of his bug eyed psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Pleasence took the role and ran with it, and is at times even crazier than Michael himself, and just as iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis plays sheltered Laurie Strode, living in Michael's sleepy hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois and a prime target of the boogeyman. Carpenter wisely saves the chases and violence for the latter third of the film, and choosing to make Michael an almost unseen presence, lurking in shadowy corners of the unassuming suburbia he makes his playground out of, a vaguely threatening gust of unease in the fringes of the character's awareness. When the chases and kills do come later on, we're so wound up from the tenuous waiting, watching and wondering that the shock hits us harder at its sheer arrival. It's that mounting tension and reverence paid to the sickening anticipation of the horror as opposed to the horror itself that makes the film so special, influential and timeless. It's like a bad dream where something is inevitably, slowly waiting to get you. A horror classic, (hell a classic in itself), the king of slasher flicks and one of the most atmospheric movies ever crafted."

","I only first watched Halloween on October 31, 2004, and it sure frightened me that Halloween night! John Carpenter directs a low budget shocker detailing the horrific night Michael Myers 'came home'. What a memorable night indeed!<br/><br/>Cue frightening horror moments, equally harrowing background music, and credible performances from all concerned, and you've got yourself one of the best horror movies of all time! Halloween doesn't actually contain many stomach-churning or gory scenes, instead any murderous happenings are done with both quickly and straight to the point, and there's always that last bit for the viewer to fill in, which makes the film even more captivating. Great ominous dark settings too.<br/><br/>Halloween is not a movie that simply deals with murder: we can actually feel some compassion for the main characters, and you sometimes can't help but scream at the TV screen, where a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse is in full swing, and nothing can be done to stop it.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasance suited the role of Dr. Sam Loomis extremely well, despite turning down the role to start with, while Jamie Lee Curtis proved herself a versatile actress with her portrayal of vulnerable and simply ordinary Laurie Strode.<br/><br/>Halloween sure has a nail-biting ending, and is simply a terrific horror movie, remaining far superior when compared to the countless sequels that followed it."
"KirstenJackson","9","8","10","5 September 2005"," One Of My Favorite Horror Films Out There
","Halloween is definitely one of my favorite horror movies. It has just what every good horror movie needs -- a haunting murderer, suspenseful moments and interesting murder scenes. The film is about Michael Myers, a killer who murdered his sister on Halloween night when he was only 6. He was put into an institution where he has been studied by Dr. Sam Loomis. But now Michael Myers has escaped unexpectedly and returns to his home town, where everyone remembers what happened Halloween night all those years ago. When he returns, he is stalking Laurie Strode, no matter where she goes and this terrifies her, seeing she has no idea why. Suddenly Laurie's baby-sitter friends Annie and Lynda are murdered and Laurie fears she'll be next. Halloween is filled with jump scenes and suspense. The famous opening scene of this film made my heart pump as it went on and my eyes were glued to the screen, just wondering what would happen next. This film was also one of Jamie Lee Curtis's firsts and she does a great job as her character. Halloween certainly is a frightening horror film, a must-see for any horror fan."
"Polaris_DiB","7","6","7","30 April 2007"," A classic
","""Halloween"" is, of course, a very famous horror film, and is well-liked today even though 1) modern audiences are being fed more extreme fare and 2) it contains some of those absurd types of reasoning that have become well-recognized and endlessly parodied. Part of the reason why is the sense that it's a classic... it's been around a while, has had many sequels to keep its name around, and was indeed shocking at the time. Another reason is that it was one of the films to usher in those now-recognized clichés, having come after Texas Chainsaw Massacre but before Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, and the Hellraiser series. It also still has a subsisting sense of creepiness merely for the fact that the Michael Myers never talks, and he never reveals himself... lending the movie a surreal sense that is constantly pounded upon by Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis: ""Behind those eyes is nothing but pure evil."" <br/><br/>""Halloween"" also came after ""Jaws"", which helped because it was one of the beginning of an era where studios were hoping to make blockbusters out of the teen demographic. John Carpenter's approach to voyeurism in this film, though Hitchcock-inspired, was serendipitous for keeping it to the demographic, and ""Halloween"" stands as a classic narrative about the deaths of the sexualized and the survival of the virginal. Michael's initial slaughter of his sister is completely unexplained (except by those comfortable with the ""Eh, he was insane, what can you say?"" explanation) except by the extremely sexual nature of the opening take. While such a theme and approach had been used before, we can thank Carpenter for ultimately suturing it onto popular conscious.<br/><br/>Finally, the ""Halloween"" theme song is something of a famous work in and of itself. Carpenter wrote the score himself, as he did many of the synthetic sound effects, but while the latter seem dated, the former still has a resounding feeling of suspense. So effective is it that it marked every Halloween sequel as part of the franchise right from the commercials onward, and it's being upheld by Rob Zombie in his remake despite the fact that Zombie is a musician himself.<br/><br/>Also, an interesting fun fact: in this movie, Carpenter homages ""The Thing"", which he later remade. From this movie Rob Zombie used clips of the children nagging Tommy about the Boogeyman for the White Zombie song ""Boogeyman"", and later Rob Zombie remade ""Halloween"".<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

","This movie really put a new perspective back then on horror movies. It's a very dark movie which John Carpenter did an awesome job on the atmosphere and created a spooky town. We don't see much of the killer which added to the heightened need of suspense. The mask is very original and it has frightened people still to this day. The theme music added a nice touch to the movie and it fit it very well. As for the acting, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence did wonderful in their roles. I am not going to give away the plot because it should be a surprise if you have not yet seen this movie.

"RaidonHyobanshi-1","10","19","29","15 August 2007"," The Greatest Horror Film Of All Time
","John Carpenter's Halloween<br/><br/>Is it the greatest horror film of all time? no .. maybe not to everyone, but to me it is and always will be. The film is sheer genius and will always hold a very special place in my heart. <br/><br/>It's unfortunate I didn't get to see this film until twenty years after it's release, but even twenty years later after so many slasher copy cats had come and gone the film still gave the same impact as it must have done then. My father suggested before I go see Halloween H20 that I whip out and rent Halloween's 1 and 2 to get the full story, and after watching Halloween it was quite clear that it defined and set the Slasher Genre.<br/><br/>The film's plot is simple, In 1963 Michael Audrey Myers killed his sister Judith in cold blood with a large butcher knife. Incarcerated for fifteen years where he was treated by Dr. Sam Loomis, he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield where he begins stalking three young girls: Laurie Strode an innocent bookworm, Annie Brackett a tough talking sarcastic and Lynda Van Der Klok a beautiful and sexually vigorous young girl. Dr. Loomis tracks Michael here where he enlists the help of the town Sheriff Leigh Brackett whom remains skeptical of his story about the psychotic killer. Michael watches the girls mercilessly and begins killing them off one by one, until only sweet innocent Laurie is left who is the prime target on Michael's list.<br/><br/>The casting of this film was brilliant and all the actors and actresses gave top notch performances, Jamie Lee Curtis was stunning in her first film role as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance gave a thrilling performance with his small role as Loomis. Nick Castle who portrays Michael did an outstanding job as the soulless and evil killer, and his walk and body movements were perfect.<br/><br/>One of the great highlights of this film is it's chilling score done by John Carpenter himself who created one of the most recognizable horror themes known today. The Blue Lighting was creepy and effective and one of the great moments in this film is when young Laurie is cowering against a wall after seeing her dead friends, and in the shadows behind her Michael's face materializes before he strikes. Michael's mask was one of the thing's that sent chills down my spine the most, the white emotionless face worked perfectly.<br/><br/>What makes this film so great is that it is not a gory film unlike the cheesy Friday The 13th films, in fact there is little blood in this film at all and works instead on suspense and tension. <br/><br/>It became so clear that Halloween spawned movies like Friday The 13th and characters like Jason Voorhees, whom he is a mere rip off of Michael Myers.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I suggest you see this film at least once in your life as it is a landmark in film making and is without a doubt if not the greatest then one of the greatest horror films of all time."
"ThiefOfStars","8","9","12","27 October 2015"," Death has come to your little town, Sheriff
","Hitchcock's influence on this movie is undeniable, even down to the casting of Janet Leigh's daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis in the lead role; an homage to 'Psycho.'<br/><br/>Halloween unfairly gets lumped together with the many uninspired slasher rip-offs that the movie generated after it's release, but in truth there is very little blood or gore and relies heavily on suspense and atmosphere to create tension and fear.<br/><br/>Take the introduction to the main villain for example: Director John Carpenter creates a long P.O.V. shot of an unseen creeper who sneaks into a teenage girl's home after she has sex with her boyfriend on Halloween night and brutally stabs her to death. The creeper then flees the scene only to run into the girl's parents returning home. In a shocking twist, the creeper is revealed to be the girl's six year old brother, Michael Myers.<br/><br/>He spends the next fifteen years in an asylum, under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (another nod to Hitchcock), played by Donald Pleasance. The night before Halloween, Michael escapes and it's down to Loomis to stop him before history repeats itself.<br/><br/>Michael's chosen victim and the movie's main heroine is Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis). She, along with her friends, sarcastic smart-mouth Annie and bubble-headed cheerleader Lynda are stalked by Michael as they babysit on Halloween night. Unlike her more outgoing friends, Laurie is quiet, bookish and charming. Halloween is credited with creating the 'virginal' heroine trope that became prevalent in horror thereafter.<br/><br/>Halloween is often criticised for not being very complex and being 'slow paced' but for me, the way Michael spends most of the night circling and observing his victims like a ghostly predator is one of the movie's biggest strengths, not a weakness. <br/><br/>The cinematography in Halloween is utterly gorgeous; I could write a review on the blue and orange tones and hues of the night times scenes alone.<br/><br/>Like Psycho and Jaws that came before it, Halloween uses it's score (written by John Carpenter) to maximum effect, creating a perfect sense of foreboding and dread."
"HorrorOverEverything","10","9","12","24 September 2015"," The Best Slasher Of All Time
","There really isn't much left to be said about John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". However I am re-watching the whole Halloween franchise since Halloween is only a little over a month a way (stretching I know but I will take any excuse to re-watch these films) and I felt like it couldn't hurt to post another positive review gushing about this excellent movie.<br/><br/>I'm fairly young so unfortunately I didn't get to experience this in the cinemas when it was first released, but I did get the chance to grow up with this film and it haunted me every Halloween since I was 12. The first time I watched it I was legitimately scared that a mask wearing psycho was stalking me in the shadows. Watching it today doesn't have the same effect, but it is a lot easier to appreciate the film when I'm not being scared to death. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" does everything right, every scene of the film is just perfect and every time I watch I feel like I find a new scene that really gets to me and creeps me out a bit. Although the kills are very tame by todays standards they are still very well done and pretty terrifying. Sure the acting is a little over the top and some of the character's reactions while they are being murdered are pretty unrealistic and cheesy, but that is all forgivable just because this is such a classic.<br/><br/>Like I said before, there isn't really a lot I can say that everyone hasn't already said, but if you are reading this and you actually have never seen this movie then I cannot stress to you enough that you need to watch this immediately."

I can see how it would have been scary to those living a sheltered late 70s life though.

"AKissintheDreamHouse","1","106","200","13 December 2009"," I'm Sorry...
","I'm sorry, but this may have been scary in 1978 when it came out, but in modern times it just doesn't hold up. The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. Shows you what an awful reviewer Roger Ebert is that he gave it four stars."

Just because something is the first of it's kind doesn't make it good. There's no mystery in this film, no creepy or scary bits, nothing interesting in it at all! Michael Myers doesn't even have a reason for killing people! I also don't get why he is such a superhuman and just disappears and dies and comes back to life all the time. He just a person! The actors... what can I say. Awful! Cheesy and not convincing. Especially those kids. I would have expected more from a so called 'classic'. The one thing I liked in this film is the theme tune. And even that gets annoying! Usually I would recommend a slasher film just to get scared and to watch on Halloween not to be interested or get into the story. Halloween doesn't a interesting plot and is not scary. There is no way this film should be a classic. Most overrated film of all time. 2/10"
"adudewhoiscool","10","10","14","23 October 2006"," This is one of the best horror movies made
","""Halloween"" is not only a slasher movie classic, but a horror movie classic as well. Much like his other movies such as 1980's ""The Fog,"" John Carpenter does not rely much on gore, but more on suspense and creepiness. The movie is almost 30 years old, and it still holds up today. If you are looking for a horror movie classic, forget about renting it because it is good enough to buy.<br/><br/>On Halloween of 1963, 6-year-old Michael Myers murders his sister, Judith Myers. After the murder, he is locked into a mental institute where Doctor Sam Loomis supervises him. 15 years later, Michael has escaped from the mental institution. He returns to his hometown to stalk a teenager by the name of Laurie Strode and her two friends. Luckily, the only person able to stop Michael is Doctor Sam Loomis.<br/><br/>Since ""Halloween"" is a horror movie, it needs to do its job in being scary and it did just that. ""Halloween"" is most famous for that chilling soundtrack composed by John Carpenter. It is hard to make a good scary movie without an excellent soundtrack because it is the music that helps build the suspense. As mentioned above, the movie relies mostly on the suggestive violence then the actual violence. That can be scarier then just showing someone's limbs cut off and blood splattered everywhere.<br/><br/>The real accomplishment of this movie is not of its suggestive violence but from the influence this film has made. Without the first ""Halloween,"" there would be no Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorhees because there would be no ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" or ""Friday the 13th."" This movie started the slasher film craze of the 1980's and 1990's. The ""survival of the virgins"" theme is also commonly used in those slasher movies and without this movie, that theme would be nonexistent.<br/><br/>The acting is wonderful. Jamie Lee Curtis, in her movie debut, shows why she is the ""scream queen"" by playing Laurie Strode. The best character is Doctor Sam Loomis played by Donald Pleasence. Tony Moran was scary playing the non-speaking Michael Myers himself. Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett, and P.J. Soles as Lynda van der Klok, get minor roles as Laurie's friends. Kyle Richards as Lindsey Wallace and Brian Andrews as Tommy Doyle did a good job as the kids that Laurie is baby sitting. There is also Charles Cyphers, who was also in ""The Fog,"" who played Sheriff Leigh Brackett.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with this film, but if there had to be one, it would the fact that if ""Halloween"" had come out today, it would seem very cliché. If you are a first time viewer, view this as if it was 1978 instead of 2006. There is one minor script error, but most probably would not catch it. In conclusion, if you are looking for the perfect scary movie, skip the rental just purchase it. ""Halloween"" is extremely recommended!"

","Halloween is a rare movie. First, it is rare because of the effectiveness of the shots. Nowhere else will you find such amazing and terrifying shots in a movie.

If you watch this film thinking it will be bad, or cheesy, you will only notice the flaws (yes, there are quite a few flaws). I watched this movie thinking that it was going to be great. It did not disappoint me. John Carpenter did an amazing job with this film, a superbness that he will never again match. In The Thing, he focused on the gore. In Halloween he focused on the scares. And it certainly did scare. There's a couple great chase scenes, a couple great deaths, and then, of course, there's the ""pinned"" scene. (Whoever's seen the movie should know what I'm talking about) Anayway, in a final note, This is the greatest slasher film ever. Hands down."
"BaronBl00d","9","7","9","19 December 2005"," A Modern Classic - Really
","Whilst always hesitant to label anything under 25 years old a classic, Halloween is now over 25 years of age, has withstood the test of time, spawned so many numerous sequels directly and indirectly, and made John Carpenter, Donald Pleasance, Debra Hill, and Jamie Lee Curtis rich and famous - not to mention brought Michael Myers into the collective consciousness of our culture. Series like Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street owe their existence to Carpenter and this low-budget horror film centered around the most fitting of all holidays for murder - Halloween. We all the the story. We all know the great direction and musical score Carpenter contributed. We all know that Jamie Lee Curtis started out here on her way to becoming a competent actress(as well as lovely one). What some of us sometimes forget(especially those that label this film as trash and have never seen it) is how bloodless it really is. Carpenter gets far more out of what he doesn't show than what he does show. His knack for creating suspenseful, jump-out-of-your seat scenes is legendary in this film and his subsequent ones. Carpenter pieced this one together just right at just the right time. He picked good actors. Curtis is good as the heroine Laurie Strode. Credibility is brought by English stalwart Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis - a role turned down first by Peter Cushing and then by Christopher Lee. I am sure both would have been great(I particularly would have love to have seen Cushing in that role), but fortunately for all involved Pleasance was cast and makes the most out of the role. He is in many ways the backbone of the movie - a center of reality to be brought back to again and again. Anyway, I could...and should...gush on and on about the importance of this film to all horror after 1978. It is undoubtedly the most influential horror film of the last 30 years in terms of its long-lasting staying power, and its has been used as the model for many, many, many horror films since that year. Carpenter has since gone on to direct many fine features; some of them are even better films than Halloween. But if his legacy is to be remembered for one film, I can think of no finer film than Halloween to be remembered for. Halloween and John Carpenter are forever linked."

The success of this film ushered in the slasher films of the 1970's and 1980's. If it wasn't for the success of ""Halloween"" there would of never been a ""Friday the 13th"" Film or ""Nightmare on Elm St"".<br/><br/>This film is flat out frighting. What scared me here is the fact most of us at one time felt someone was watching us. This movie plays on that fear. However hardly anybody in the film realizes they are being watched by an escaped mental patient. <br/><br/>The widescreen frame adds scares because John Carpenter will show the killer (the shape aka Michael Myers) in the frame but then he is gone and you don't know where he is. <br/><br/>Now anybody under 30 will find this film slow because there isn't a kill every 5 minutes. What we have is a slow build up of terror and the past 15 minutes of this film will have you screaming for mercy! <br/><br/>Again today's teens have a limited attention span and will find this film a bore.

","Yeah, okay, I watched it on Halloween...<br/><br/>John Carpenter's classic slasher thriller has been imitated to death by innumerable poor retreads, and has had an unfortunate influence on the horror genre as a whole. Countless rubbish was churned out in its wake in the 1980s, reducing horror to something teenage gore hounds went to see, films with little plot, inventive and increasingly gory deaths and a formulaic laziness. John Carpenter, however, cannot be blamed for that. He delivers here a splendid little horror thriller, with a memorable music score, great use of lighting, and clever editing. It's also pretty well acted, too, though the dialogue is occasionally flat.<br/><br/>The town of Haddonfield is surprisingly quiet and unpopulated, all the better for escaped lunatic Michael Myers to return to fifteen years after he killed his sister at the age of six! Escaping from an asylum with Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) on his trail (hi, Psycho fans!) he sets about recreating his infamous act...with the aid of a William Shatner mask!<br/><br/>This is a clever, atmospheric and extremely well made low-budgeter. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent as the bright but somewhat lonely high-schooler. The plot is simple but Carpenter keeps us on our toes through excellent use of subjective camera, spookily framed shots (the houses here are all full of dark corners and patches of inky black - great work from Cinematographer Dean Cundey), and an astonishing climax which suggests the spirit of Michael Myers is everywhere in the town after he is shot. (forget the sequels, which of course, kept him alive). <br/><br/>This is a seminal movie in the genre, and has surprisingly little blood. If only a lousy bunch of talentless hacks hadn't taken Carpenter's little gem and ruined the horror genre for about a dozen years with annoying rip-offs..."

The story to this films is very simple but manages to be so effective that it's scary and there hasn't been a horrorocie like it since.<br/><br/>The story tells of Michael Myers who killed his sister when he was a young boy and has escaped from a mental asylum to cause havoc on Halloween night he is the embodiment of evil the boogyman. It's such a great premise for a movie and Michael is such an interesting character even though we know nothing about him the looks of Michael is very simple but effective and very scary even though all he wearing is a simple mask however it's the fact that mask looks emotion less is scary because you sort put you're fears into the mask it's like you're own personal Rosarch test.<br/><br/>The way John Carpenter builds tension in this is just pure genius he builds it and builds it and then keeps building teasing you untill he finally let's it happen and it's 100% satisfaction in its delivery John Carpenter is an absolute genius and this is his masterpiece some people may say the thing and that's a great movie but Halloween is just a perfect horror movie in my opinion.<br/><br/>Jamie Leigh Curtis one of the greatest horror actresses in the world and she is great in this movie Laurie Strode is one of the best characters in horror and is the ultimate scream queen such a legend and I could imagine anyone else playing this role she is just perfection in this movie and I love how Laurie is the exact opposite of Michael because Michael is pure evil and Laurie is this ultimate good presence in this movie really smart on Carpenters part for that little detail and just makes this movie the perfection that it is.<br/><br/>However my favourite character in this whole franchise is definitely Sam Loomis played by the late Donald Pleasence a legendary actor who will always be missed .<br/><br/>Verdict 9.5/10 greatest horror movie ever made and a great horror icon in Michael Myers"

","John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) <br/><br/>A film made on a small budget, a cast of unknowns, a director no one ever heard of before (and was to become a popular name in the horror field). It only took 21 days to film, it became a cult hit and received praise from many notable critics and is considered the ultimate 'slasher movie' and it probably is.<br/><br/>A kid killed his sister, he went to a mental institution... Later he escaped and came back with a mask to terrorise innocent babysitter Jamie Lee Curtis, graphically kill a few unlucky teenagers and became an icon in the world of horror and popular culture.<br/><br/>Halloween is effectively frightening, sequential and an important part of the horror genre.<br/><br/>My rating of the film, a mere 7/10 maybe considered as a low rating by some, but when I assess the whole motion picture, I am not compelled or magnetised enough or even thrilled or excited enough to award an 8 a 9 or a 10 (which is an extremely high rating for a slasher flick). Others disagree; maybe some appreciate the film in other ways I fail to see. I will agree that it is a solid, redefining horror film but will not go that far as to call it a masterpiece or a film of power or rare importance. On the calibre of horror films I award this film 9/10, because it is a good, worthwhile horror film with all the ingredients and props for a Saturday night fright.<br/><br/>7.0/10"
"AZFiresky","10","5","6","31 December 2006"," Timeless and a model for Hollywood
","I watched this movie in the theater when it was released back in 1978. Today, 28 years later it still remains a classic with an edge.<br/><br/>The story is primitive, but is all the more effective for it: A six year old boy named Michael Myers murders his sister. He spends the next 15 years locked away. In that time, his doctor, Sam Loomis, comes to the conclusion that this seemingly catatonic child is evil in it's purest. To Dr. Lommis, he's ""waiting"" but doesn't know what for. Sure enough, a now 21 year old Myers escapes only to return to the town he once called home.<br/><br/>Film critic Roger Ebert once wrote that Director John Carpenter played his audience like a piano with this film. That is probably the best description by a film critic yet. The music score in unforgettable and there has never been a movie made that has relied so beautifully on the art of suspense rather than the simple cliché of straight bloodletting, as we saw with so many knock offs after Halloween's release.<br/><br/>For a movie that was filmed on a shoe string budget to be this effective should be a lesson to Hollywood (and film schools) that some of the best ideas are completed with heart and realistic dedication, not just with dollars, slick sets, and big name actors.<br/><br/>My only regret concerning this film was that it it inspired sequel after clunker sequel, which took away some luster to the average film-goer. This was the kind of film that should have been left alone as a classic to itself: The story of Halloween, a Boogeyman and viewers with questions at the end which they should have had to answer for themselves."
"zkonedog","10","8","11","11 March 2017"," The Standard
","IN 1978, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" set the standard by which all horror flicks both emulated and came to be judged by.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Halloween"" tells the story of psychotic killer Michael Myers, who (15 years after murdering his sister in cold blood) escapes a mental institution and returns to his old stomping grounds to wreak havoc once again, this time on a group of young teenagers on Halloween night.<br/><br/>Basically, everything you are accustomed to seeing in a horror film has its roots here, including:<br/><br/>-The blood-curdling score, which has never quite been duplicated. -The terrifying, weapon-wielding antagonist who knows nothing but murder. -The standard prey, that being young, sex-crazed teenagers who are so caught up in themselves that they become oblivious to their surroundings. -The ""jump scenes"" (often accompanied by loud music crescendos) that make your heart skip a beat, whether true or fake-outs.<br/><br/>What's really impressive about this movie, though, is the fact that it was THE standard of horror films for such a long period of time. Until ""Saw"" changed the game with its graphic violence and outwardly moral musings in 2004, ""Halloween"" was the king of scary movies. ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" may have had their followings, and ""Scream"" did a great job of poking fun at the genre, but it was this flick that still remained on top of the heap (it helps to have your own built-in holiday, too!).<br/><br/>Thus, if you are a fan of fright fests whatsoever and haven't yet seen this film all the way through (hard to believe, I know), it is a must-see. Or, if you don't have trick-or-treating responsibilities on October 31st, then settle in for another go-round of the seminal horror event."
"C22Man","8","8","11","25 March 2016"," How to do a Horror Film
","John Carpenter's Halloween stands up in modern day as one of the most creative and unsettling horror films of all time. It first showcased Carpenter as a director that can make a cheap film look a million bucks and one who can craft an incredibly creepy atmosphere simply by what he decides to show, methods he would continue to use to such great effect in his later films. Despite so many films trying to copy its style and the 'slasher' sub-genre becoming popular in its wake, the film continues to comfortably standout from the crowd. It isn't gory or visually grotesque because the majority of the horror is left to what you can only imagine and that is where the scares come from. For such a simple story the film is enhanced by technical expertise, believable acting and a director who knows exactly what he is doing.<br/><br/>The idea of a crazed killer returning to his home town and killing off innocent people is pretty much the entire premise. It is a credit to the film that it uses this concept so successfully. Michael Myers randomly stalks teenager Laurie Strode and picks off her friends as they babysit, while we get very little insight into Myers' character (apart from a chillingly shot flashback to when he was a child) and this is actually one of the things that makes him so scary. He's a blank-faced killer and we have no idea what motivates him or if he will ever stop. He seems to be able to withstand great pain and the way in which his psychiatrist talks about him only adds to his threat.<br/><br/>For me what really makes the film so chilling is how it takes place in such a normal, quiet town to such believable people. A fair amount of the film takes place in broad daylight and the characters get quite a few glimpses of the killer, which shows you just how unnerving it is that darkness and shadows aren't always needed. The film understands what is truly scary, seeing glimpses of Myers slowly disappearing behind a bush or being in a garden one moment and gone the next are so much more disturbing than any amount of blood or gore. It's the sense of unease because both the audience and the characters don't know his motivations. The increasing sense of danger throughout the film as it builds is done masterfully.<br/><br/>The two main performances from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are both superb. A lot hinges on them given their key roles in the story and both deliver. Curtis is perfect as the soft- spoken, high school girl Laurie because she brings such believability to the role. She convinces you immediately that she's just normal teenager and that makes her struggle all the more terrifying. Pleasence is always a gripping screen presence and as Dr. Loomis he is excellent. Loomis is the only person that has any understanding of Myers, as Pleasence sells the sense of panic in his delivery and expressions alone. Both Nancy Kyes and P.J Soles as Laurie friends help add to the credibility given their grounded performances.<br/><br/>As noted Carpenter's directing is absolutely fantastic here. He masters the art of simplicity, keeping the movements appropriately basic and making everything that happens in the first half play on the mind of the viewer. He knows what to show and when, because you rarely see much blood in the film despite its premise. The dialogue is done very well. The way in which these girls talk to each other and interact with the children is so naturalistic, adding more and more to the genuine tone that the film carries. The score by Carpenter himself deserves a special mention. The main theme has rightfully become iconic and it fits the film perfectly, the spidery piano notes and icy synth adding to the eerie atmosphere.<br/><br/>For me Halloween is certainly one of the best horror films of its time. Not just for its ability to strike a sense of fear into people, but for how smartly it is crafted and how it understands where the scares come from. I think that is something most horror films (especially those in the slasher or stalker area) seem to forget. The idea that someone might be behind you but you don't know it or that you're powerless against something that won't stop is so much scarier that someone being tortured or carved open. Carpenter really set himself as a master of the genre (which we would later see again in a different way in The Thing) thanks to his great directing, while the acting and writing are both top notch which add to the terror unfolding. It shows that less can be more."
"scott-sw","10","8","11","29 December 2007"," Favorite horror movie of all time
","There are two movie experiences I will always cherish. The first was seeing ""Star Wars"" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. A close second is sneaking into Halloween at the Tripple Plex with my good friend, Trevor, in late October 1978. Halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. Everyone knows the story. Young Michael Myers decides to kill his sister on Halloween 1963. He escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to Haddofield to wreck havoc once again. He spots Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. Her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as Michael sets his plot to get her. Ironically, the young boy she tends on Halloween is afraid of the ""Boogeman,"" and can see him outside. During the murder spree, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) works hard to find Michael before he unleashes his fury. He has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to Sheriff Bracket (Charles Cyphers). As the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. Alfred Hitchcock once said, ""You can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. That is a cheap thrill. However, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense."" Director John Carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in Halloween. The audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. We gasp. Will he kill her? When will he kill her? Then, Michael disappears. Carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. This movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. One of the best scenes is Michael lifting Bob off the ground. He rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. All you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees Bob's feet drop lifelessly. Carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. This also peaks our audience. What will he do? What's going on inside his mind? Finally, Carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. Moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with Debra Hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. The teens are not ""party mad,"" but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. Finally, there is some decent acting in this ""B,"" low-budget thriller. Nick Castle who plays ""the Shape"" (Michael) adds something to the mindless killer. It is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. Moreover, the personality does everything the same way. He kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. He splits the victims apart. He also relies on brute strength. And that mask used (a bleached William Shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. While Pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. It made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. The crown jewel, though, is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut. She plays the Laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. The end is one that left me speechless. This was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. Movies like Star Wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. Halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. So if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, Halloween would be the movie I would choose."
"FilmFanatic09","9","8","11","6 December 2006"," Halloween
","The opening credits of ""Halloween"" scare us. No action commences until they have finished and yet, even before the first real image of the film comes on the screen, we are filled with a sense of dread. We know the movie we are about to see is going to frighten the hell out of us. This is in thanks to the fantastically eerie score written by John Carpenter himself, coupled with the camera's inching forward towards a flickering jack-o-lantern. He sits there with that disquieting grin during the film's title sequence, as though taunting us, daring us to watch this movie. From there, we are treated (although I suspect that's really not the right word) to a prologue done entirely in a continuous point-of-view shot of the killer. We are given no choice but to go with him, and from his vantage, witness what is easily the most heinous act in the film. <br/><br/>After this, we are given virtually our only momentary reprieve in the unrelenting suspense this film is able to sustain. Even when nothing ominous is in sight, we can't shake the feeling that it is waiting just outside our peripheral vision, ready to attack at the most opportune moment. This sense doesn't lie, as the film features numerous ""jump scenes"" which are all too effective. Surprisingly for this type of film, ""Halloween"" is devoid of any actual gore or scenes of carnage. Carpenter uses this to his advantage. He knows that blood would let us off too easily. It would allow us to be disgusted, thus focusing our attention on something besides the persistent terror. Some horror movies go for visceral thrills and some manage to engage our inner psyches. ""Halloween"" does both. The film was made by a group of young filmmakers with such ""Let's put on a show!"" type attitudes that none of its elements show any sign of pretension. I think that's why it works. We believe it. <br/><br/>I realize I've yet to discuss either the plot or characters of ""Halloween."" They are both so basic and straightforward, they almost seem inconsequential when discussing the film's impact as a whole. Of course, the performances are very good. Jamie Lee Curtis is pitch perfect as girl-next-door Laurie Strode, the heroine you love to root for. And Donald Pleasence, as Dr. Sam Loomis, gives the whole thing a further air of credibility. And there is another character too. Michael Meyers is obviously now an icon in the horror genre, but it's really quite amazing when you think of how little you see him in this first installment of the franchise. He has such little screen time and yet his presence is felt constantly. The filmmakers deserve high praise for this, among their many other achievements. In seeking to make a simple thriller, they made a genre-defining classic. I think it's best when viewed on these same terms. Unlike some, I've decided never to try and ascertain what exactly Michael Meyers represents. I prefer to stand firm in my rather simple conviction: I never want him stalking me."

Im not watching this film 30 years ago, I'm watching it today. When I sit down to watch a movie I want to be told a story, I do not want a lesson in film history.

","Halloween was directed by john carpenter and produced by Debra hill. the film was licensed under Anchor Bay Entertainment. carpenter was a film student and eventually made his first film Assault on precinct 13 which did well in england. by that time a struggling company Anchor Bay Entertainment had no movies to distribute. so they came up with the idea of Halloween. they asked John if he would do it. john said yes only under one condition,i get my name over the main title.production began in spring 1977. it was a 100 day shoot. they filmed this classic in south Pasadena. the outcome would change horror history for ever.<br/><br/>plot: a young boy named Michael myers kills his sister Judith myers when he was 6 years old. then he was put in an institution for 14 years. on hallows eve 1978 Michael escapes. he stalks who we later find out in the second film his sister Laurie strode he kills her friends in creative ways. the only remaining people are Laurie, Dr.loomis, tommy Boyle,and a little girl..<br/><br/>what makes this film so special is that it has hardly any blood once so ever. this film is based more on suspense and scare rather than death and blood. many people think ''Friday the 13th'' was the first slasher but there wrong. Halloween wasn't either. it started with psycho and then black Christmas and finally Halloween. ''Friday the 13th'' is a rip off of Halloween. Jason voorhees who comes from Friday the 13th is more popular but less suspenseful. in a horror film you don't need blood guts and bones to scare the audience. all it takes is that perfect scare.<br/><br/>the original Michael myers mask was actually a captain Kurt mask from star trek. the pale look on Michael myers is what makes him so scary. there's no emotion. just nothing really. his jump suite adds a nice touch to his suit. but his legacy lives with his infamous butcher knife.<br/><br/>so the next time you go to a store or rent a movie get Halloween. it is truly a masterpiece/classic and i love it for that. if u don't like Halloween somethings wrong with you. so get a bag of popcorn and enjoy Halloween."

","Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films. Often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not THE scariest.<br/><br/>I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. But I would have to say this one blows all the others away. It is genuinely frightening, and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. It is one of the eeriest images in movie history.<br/><br/>Later slashers, such as the Friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. I do like the F13 series better than the Halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies. Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.<br/><br/>What's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. It is just pure terror. It's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come."
"DylanCanonge","10","6","8","16 December 2019"," Ultimate horror masterpiece!
","Halloween (1978) is one of very few horror movies that contains no gore, very little blood and not much violence, proving you don't need all of that to make a horror movie scary. As cliche as it sounds, they don't make them like that anymore. Subtle horror at its finest, slow burn scares, smart character writing, extremely tense sequences that still hold up to this day. Directed by John Carpenter and introducing Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role, this atmospheric horror/thriller redefined the genre. Carpenter's score for this film is iconic, it's spine-chilling theme about a sociopath murdering just because is executed with resonant simplicity. Carpenter's masterpiece still reigns supreme in horror !"

Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing.<br/><br/>The story is just amazing and John Carpenter & Debra Hill wrote a very good story and they really did a very good job bringing it on screen and this film shows that it's about building up suspense and characters and story , not about the violence and gore, which was something that the other films lacked.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode and she is amazing in that role. Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis and this was his breakout role and he was amazing in that part until the last one that he was in. Nick Castle plays Michael Myers and he is great. P.J. Soles as Lynda is really cool in her role and she was spectacular.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is just amazing. The music is just amazing and I love that Halloween theme song, because they have done different versions of the film and it was really cool. The kills in this movie are not as bloody and that's what I like about this film. My favorite kill that has been re-enacted a lot of times is Lynda's death and I saw the remake and it stays true to it's source material.<br/><br/>Overall, I love HALLOWEEN - the 1978 version, but there are some problems with this film and the 2007 remake fixed those problems. 8/10."

","This movie is mainly known as the movie that launched the slasher movie genre as well as the movie that made John Carpenter (as well as ""Precent 13"") on of the best directors of his generation. The thing that makes this a great movie is the fact that it scares you with actually fear, not gratuitous violence (not there is anything wrong with that) or cheap jump scares (there is a lot wrong with that). Jamie Lee Curtis is a great ""final girl"" because you actually are afraid for her and you really want her to live but are not sure if she will. Donald Pleasance is a great rival for the Shape. And now we get to Micheal Myer. He is, hands down, the best slasher ever. You have no idea what he is thinking witch makes him extremely dangerous and he isn't so much in love with his work as he is amazed by it which is shown in a scene where, after he kills a guy, he looks at it with a fascination.

","""Halloween"" may be interesting as a historical piece, and it may even be entertaining if you scare extremely, extremely easily. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this film has nothing special to offer. The story never even tries to be thought-provoking or inspiring. The plot is paper-thin, as a murderer comes to town and kills 3 random teens for no reason. The film is very overt that there is absolutely no reason; the killer is nothing but a vehicle for overwrought ""suspense.""<br/><br/>There truly is a lack of suspense here. Most of the movie features the average main characters going about their boring lives and occasionally noticing Michael Myers appearing on a street corner, then disappearing. This could be an evocative and tantalizing effect, but each of Michael's ""surprise"" appearances are extremely predictable and usually accompanied by a melodramatic, campy musical cue.<br/><br/>The murder scenes are quaint, with no thrill or shock; at best they give a glimpse into '70s filmmaking style.<br/><br/>The worst aspect, though, was in most of the character interactions. Audiences want an exciting thriller from Halloween, but a ridiculous amount of the movie consists of bland, mildly annoying teenagers chatting mindlessly. I suppose this material is an attempt at realism, but when it contributes nothing to plot, meaning or character arcs, it's just an insulting waste of the audience's time.<br/><br/>As for good points, the film is competently executed (with no glaring faults but also no outstanding cinematography), and the character of Dr. Loomis had the potential to be interesting or entertaining. Unfortunately these aspects are nowhere near enough to complete the movie.<br/><br/>If you want to check out a real museum piece, take a look at Halloween. If you want a film that will excite and thrill you, or a film that will make you think, you'll be wise to look elsewhere."

"claptonisgod53","10","7","10","12 September 2008"," Influenced by Giallos, Influenced Slashers
","While many people would say that the slasher genre started with Halloween, I would have to disagree. Halloween didn't start the slasher genre by any means. Halloween mearly set the ground rules for slasher movies to be made in the following decade. Halloween itself was influenced by many films to come before it. To start off with, the whole slasher template was started with the 1960 classic, Psycho. This would soon be followed by many Italian crime films known as ""Gialli"" films. These Gialli films were the exact definition of a good slasher film. Twitch of the Death Nerve (aka Bay of Blood) directed by Mario Bava influenced the slasher genre to a great extent, which would influence Carpenter to make Halloween.<br/><br/>Halloween is recognized in pop culture very easily. Everyone has heard of Halloween, rather it be due to the very creepy theme music, the Michael Myers mask, the remake, or the countless sequels. After pop culture has turned the image of the film, it is hard to remember what it was originally; The original Halloween had very little gore, if any at all. The movie relied suspense and atmosphere, rather than severe brutality like many other films to follow. John Carpenter used pure talent when it comes to film making, rather than relying on cheap special effects or loud noises.<br/><br/>Another great attribute about Halloween is the strong female characters. In movie after movie we have pathetic female characters with a fairly smart killer. This is the exact opposite here. The female characters in Halloween are well developed and acted out (by Jamie Lee Curtis in particular). Halloween has great performances all around the coating of it. With a strong cast of Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasense, and Nick Castle, you can't go wrong with the chemistry, the performances, or even the overall look. Halloween is a horror movie where the audience roots for the characters. This aspect would become very well for slasher films to follow, where the audience usually roots and relates with the characters (this is the absolute truth when it came to the 2007 remake directed by Rob Zombie)<br/><br/>All horror fans have seen Halloween, and while it didn't quite START the slasher genre, it still layed down a great set of rules. Halloween is also recognized as one of the most suspenseful, frightening films of all time up there with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) and the Exorcist (1973). No one is truly a horror fan until they have experienced Halloween."

","One of my all-time favorite fright flicks!! I was 13 when HALLOWEEN was released in 1978 and the local film critics here in my area, the late Gene Siskel & Roger Ebert, praised it highly. The movie poster itself was scary! Of course, being the 13-yr old that I was, I pestered my older sister just enough for her to give in and take me to see it. To this day, I'm glad she did - my love for horror films had started!<br/><br/>The story is simplistic in itself - on Halloween 1963, 6-yr old Michael Myers murders his older sister with a large butcher knife. For 15 years, Michael is kept institutionalized until one night - October 30, 1978 to be exact - he escapes and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois to relive his crime again and again. Hot on his trail is Dr. Loomis, who tries to 'stop the evil'.<br/><br/>Until THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, HALLOWEEN was praised as one of the most successful independent films produced. One does not notice that the film was shot on a shoestring budget, nor does one care. While there is much talent in front of the camera (Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis), it is the behind-the-camera talent that really stands out. Dean Cundey's photography is incredible and really sets the scary mood Carpenter creates. Using blue light to simulate moonlight in the night scenes was just a stroke of genius! Ray Stella's use of the Panaglide is great - the stalk/chase scenes when seen in their original widescreen format are tense!! Yes, many ripoffs and sequels came and went in HALLOWEEN's wake, but the original is the best!! I wholeheartedly suggest that viewers watch this film in its widescreen format and not in alternate pan-and-scan versions!"

","I have nothing new to say... Halloween (1978) is one of the best horror movies of all time. The plot is so simple, yet so effective and eerie. Everything's here - Serial killer,victims,tension... The mask is very original and it has frightened people still to this day. Still fresh and innovative,soundtrack is absolutely fabulous. A must-see if you haven't,definitely genius. My personal favorite horror film. From the lengthy first tracking shot to the final story twist, this is Carpenter's masterpiece. I could watch Halloween (1978) every day, it's aged so well. I'm at a loss for words, it's just a pity they don't make them like this anymore.It's a perfect 10/10 all the way!"
"Horror_Metal","10","8","12","4 October 2013"," A brilliant and highly effective masterpiece of suspenseful horror!
","Michael Myers (Nick Castle) murdered his older sister on Halloween night when he was six years old and has been locked away in a mental institution ever since. Michael's psychologist, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), has recently given up on him, as he seems to lack a conscience or any human emotion whatsoever. A few days before Halloween, the now twenty one year old Michael escapes from the asylum and goes back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois where he steals a creepy looking white mask to wear over his face and hide his identity, along with a new outfit and some knives. Dr. Loomis follows him there in an effort to stop him, as he is the only one who knows what his former patient is capable of. The purely evil psychopath targets three teenage girls that consist of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis), and Lynda van der Klok (P.J. Soles). On Halloween night, Michael Myers begins stalking and killing anyone who gets in his path while Laurie and the other girls are babysitting young children. Can Dr. Loomis stop him before he succeeds with his deadly mission? <br/><br/>What can I say about this amazing movie that hasn't already been said a thousand times? Director John Carpenter is a truly a genius and this film alone is a testament to that. The Michael Myers character has to be the scariest villain in movie history, right down to every terrifying trait. He's just an unstoppable monster who has no remorse or grief about what he does. he is just pure evil in human form. I love how they kept him in the shadows for most of the movie and you never knew where he was, which upped the scares and suspense factor immensely. I applaud Nick Castle for his great portrayal as the mysterious masked murderer, who is the living embodiment of fear! Scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, who went on to star in several slasher movies in the early 80's, played a great lead girl. She seemed genuinely terrified throughout the film, making the happenings all the more believable. Donald Pleasence's excellent character of Dr. Loomis is one of my favorite horror protagonists of all time and luckily we got to see more of him in most of the sequels that followed. Speaking of the sequels, none of them were able to capture the eerie and ominous presence that Michael Myers had in this movie, which was perfectly done. I could go on and on about what makes this movie so chillingly effective, but the best way to appreciate its greatness is to simply watch it and see how a brilliant horror film should be made. Flawless filmmaking!"
"PrincessLisa07","9","8","12","1 October 2007"," Chilling and atmospheric horror film...one of the last 'good' slashers
","Halloween is a genuinely scary, influential, stylistic and tasteful, extremely well-crafted slasher/horror classic from young film director John Carpenter (who had previously directed two cult cinema classics, the sci-fi film Dark Star (1974) and the riveting crime genre film Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) - a modern-day film often compared to Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo (1959)). Throughout the manipulative, morbid film, the suspenseful stalkings and killings are seen from the subjective vantage point of the killer's or 'peeping tom's' eyes, a few times while looking through a mask. (The mask was a costume store William Shatner-like faceplate, turned inside out and painted white, and inspired by the B-grade campy witchcraft film The Devil's Rain (1975) - featuring John Travolta's debut performance.) Other scenes are viewed through the subjective POV eyes of the characters in danger, or accompanied by the heavy breathing of killer Michael Myers, referred to as the 'bogeyman' or ""The Shape"" in the credits. Almost every scene is filmed with a constantly-moving camera (the Steadicam variety) to make the audience feel disordered, totally insecure, unsettled and paranoid, believing that every ominous corner, shadow, noise, or space is potentially life-threatening or dangerous and that everyone will be a helpless victim of random violence. Often, nothing is revealed when something is expected, but sometimes the unexpected is shockingly viewed.<br/><br/>Most of Halloween is at all explicit, and surprisingly, contains little gore or graphic violence. It, instead, relies on pacing and suspense to keep our viewers on the edge. And it works. I'd like people to stop watching those pathetic slashers of today, made only for shock value, and see a genuinely scary horror film that has the skill to scare you witless."
"ironhorse_iv","8","9","14","31 October 2013"," Watching Halloween on Halloween- this movie is a sweet trick and treat flick for that day.
","Glad, this movie was call 'Halloween' then the original script title 'The Babysitter Murders'. 1978's Halloween is a pretty good low budget independent slasher horror film directed/scored by John Carpenter. It might be a little dated, but it's still pretty scary. Pretty realistic that something like this could happen. The film was very popular, and was the first installment in what became the Halloween franchise of sequels and reboots. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends. Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasanton) follows him to prevent him from killing. Like, I say before, Halloween is really low-budget. It was so low budget, it didn't bother even showing us the hospital, or much locations. When the film aired on television, Carpenter filmed 20 minutes of additional material scenes for the film mostly of the hospital where Myers was staying. Those scenes does that help plug a lot of plot-holes between the first movie and the second movie 1983's Halloween 2 like why he was stalking Laurie. Halloween would end up being one of the most profitable independent films to ever come out, and in my opinion, pretty much help the independent film movement getting established. Another thing, Halloween did inspired a long line of 1980's slasher films to follow it. While, it's not the first movie to use the POV camera angle of the perspective of the killer nor the first slasher film as 1974's Black Christmas, 1960's Peeping Tom and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) came before it. It did had some scary sadistic voyeurism moments. The opening shot was pretty intense, and well done in my opinion, but it did get carry away later in the film. Halloween did create the many several horror clichés found in low-budget horror films of the 1980s and 1990s. The movie help create the idea of the 'final girl' trope concept that specifically refers the final girl alive who is face to confront the killer. According to term, the final girl shares common characteristics: she is typically sexually unavailable or virginal, or mostly avoids the vices of the victims (sex, illegal drug use, hedonistic lifestyle, etc.). There is a bit of misogyny and misandry sexual psychology terms in these types of films. If a woman shows any interested in sex. She will happen to die. If a man happens to be interested in women, he must be a serial killer, pervert or deranged. Men are always represented as deadly creatures in these films, hints why there is few final guys in horror films. Men can survive any threat, tossed at them, while women tend to be more violable. Only by becoming masculinized by the end of the film, the final girl is able to survive. By picking up a weapon, it shows that she has become a man as the weapon represent the male penis. In this film, I wouldn't call Laurie a saint. She wants to get with Ben Tramer, and also she did smoke weed, earlier in the film. She did had some girly damsel in distress confrontation moments and had some help against the killer with Dr. Samuel Loomis. So, I wouldn't say, she fit the final girl concept too well. This was Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, but I wouldn't call her a 'Scream Queen' because I felt that didn't express the fear that great in my opinion. While she can come off as a bit bland, she's still a good person who isn't a complete moron or tool, and that goes a long way with me. There seem to a bit of a strong connection to Halloween and Psycho. Both have characters in the film, name Samuel Loomis, the two killers happen to murder with knifes, and lastly, Jamie Lee Curtis happens to be the daughter of Janet Leigh, the main star of the Alfred Hitchcock film. Surprising, the film contains little graphic violence and gore. Still, there is a bit too much nudity that is a bit laughable as the writers had to find a way to get the supporting female characters to take their clothes off. The whole ghost scene was just awful and cheesy. Also, what type of babysitter allow her friends to have sex at her employer's house with children around? I also found it, disturbing that Lynda (P. J. Soles) wanted to rip the child's clothes off. The critics were kinda right, it felt a bit like hardcore porn. The children actors were OK, but they were never in any real danger. I thought it was a miss chance as Laurie could had find her bravery by trying to protect the children like any mother figure. The Shape was the best thing in the film. While, the original mask Don Post Emmett Kelly looks scary. The mask, they pick was creepy. I had to say, the pale white- William Shatner mask really does look scary when the actor playing the 'shape' tilt his head a couple of times as he was observing a corpse. The scene where The Shape seems to appear out of the darkness behind Laurie was amazing done. The score by Carpenter is pretty good, but it used way too much in the film, that it wear down its welcome, and became a bit annoying. The suspense was pretty long as most of the film has nearly nothing going on. The whole stalking thing in the beginning is intense, but a bit boring. Even the opening title credits went a bit too long. The ending cliff hanger was pretty perfect. It's like the saying, you can't kill evil; you can only survive it. Evil is ever presented and that's how every horror movie should end. That's why this film works."
"crbr01","10","9","14","8 September 2007"," Halloween...My Favorite
","Halloween became the biggest Slasher/Horror film of all time. Not only did it become one of the best, the most known Horror Film. A little kid by the name of Michael Audry Myers kills his sister on October 31, 1963, a kid that was explained to ""'Purely and Simply...Evil!"" Later he escaped his Sanitarium and suddenly is on the loose. A chase between Myers and Dr. Loomis. Later he stalks a girl named Laurie Strode all over the place (which in the sequel Halloween II, they are family: related to each other). Starts stalking his friends and kills them. Later he gets to Laurie and Michael is trying to kill Laurie. Dr. Loomis saw kids running from this house. Gets in there, sees Michael, and shoots him six times. It has such a surprise ending, that I'm not saying what it is, besides I said too much. But I'll tell you this, if you haven't seen this movie, see it. See it before you EVEN think about seeing the remake. See it before you see the sequel. See it before you see Freddy Vs. Jason. Just see it and see how John Carpenter made a fantastic Horror film."
"acidburn-10","10","9","14","7 March 2007"," Horror Classic
","What can be said about Halloween that hasn't been said a million times before well lots actually, this has to be one of the all time favorite horror movies, I first saw this when I was eight and it scared the hell out of me, and it's still scary now even by today's standards, it's just a pity they don't make them like this anymore.<br/><br/>The plot. Well, the plot doesn't really matter. HALLOWEEN is one of the few films where lack of plot isn't a hindrance; in-fact it's the complete opposite- it's one of its strengths. Carpenter's film is a lean mean shock machine that soars precisely because he jettisoned needless exposition. What's left is the very bare bones of a story. A six year old boy stabs his sister to death and, fifteen years later, on the anniversary of her murder- Halloween, he escapes and returns to his home town to carry on an apparently motiveless killing spree. That's it.<br/><br/>Directed by John Carpenter who've made brill cult movies ""The Thing"" and ""Assault On Precinct 13"", has done a stupendous job with this movie and this definitely his best yet.<br/><br/>It's the characters who make this movie work, and are completely believable from Jamie Lee Curtis's portrayal as the geeky virginal final girl Laurie Strode, bubbly airhead Lynda (PJ Soles), and the sarcastic but amiable Annie (Nancy Loomis), who all become the focus of Michael Myers murderous intentions. Donald Pleasance's portrayal of the brilliantly unhinged Dr Loomis, Myer's doctorThe only other adult inhabitants of Haddonfield of any note are Lynda's boyfriend Bob (John Michael Graham) and Annie's Father- Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), who both seem curiously disposable. However, on a night that has been relegated to providing entertainment for children, paradoxically it is the two kids that Laurie Strode ends up baby-sitting- Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) and Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards), that are the first residents of the sleepy town to recognise the true nature of the night- and the terrifying reality of the Boogey Man.<br/><br/>It is a pity that none of the other sequels were as great as this one, even though Halloween 2 get's slagged off a lot, it's still enjoyable but doesn't have the likable characters this one has.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why this was a massive hit and spawned 7 sequels and this movie remains cherished It's incredible that it can still seem so vibrant and engaging- it's ability to grab the viewer and scare them shitless is resolutely undiminished. None of the films that followed in its wake are as effective , and with boogey men (and women) of their own) are as good- but then again, how could they possibly top near perfect film making? Having said that, many of those films are highly enjoyable (be they cheesy or classy) and are, indeed, things to cherish themselves (well, at least if you're anyone like me!); but Carpenter's film remains a cut above."
"charlesradams458","1","36","72","14 January 2014"," Classic ?
","This movie is only a classic in the way that a DeLorean is a classic, that is that they are both old and have a strong cult following in spite of their many many flaws. I've never found Jamie Lee Curtis to be a particularly skilled actor, but in this , she is so terrible its almost laughable, but really with her father being Tony Curtis and all of the resources and acting classes that should have provided her its really more sad than anything. Classic ? really its more the prototype for the cliché bad horror movie.Not scary, banal, not worth watching again or in the first place if you haven't seen it, unless you simply must just to say that you have."
"James-russ98","8","4","5","1 October 2018"," Aged badly and that's the beauty of it
","Just watched this film for the first time in preparation for the new and upcoming Halloween. I can honestly say my eyes were glued to the screen throughout the movie and I can't explain why. The film was a perfect mix of intensity, curiosity and just straight out chilling. When that music plays you'll know what I mean. As the title states, the movie hasn't aged too great but I think that what makes it so brilliant, how in 2018 this film out does the majority made in recent years.<br/><br/>Next stop: Halloween II"
"Cole_Early","10","4","5","18 June 2007"," The Beginning of Slasher-Horror
","""Halloween"", as most or all of us know, is set upon an allegedly small, quiet, and peaceful town, disturbed by the ominous force of a returning killer, Michael Myers. Fifteen years ago, Michael murdered his older sister, then was sent into a mental institution in 1963. He escaped that institution in 1978, and returned to that small, quiet town, known as ""Haddonfield"", Illinios. The night of his return is the night that his only other sibling, Laurie Strode sees the terror that has lived in her family for fifteen years.<br/><br/>It is, in fact, ""the night he came home"".<br/><br/>I saw this film when I was about... twelve or so. I had seen the ""Friday the 13th"" movies, but Halloween was the movie that provoked my everlasting love of horror films. ""Halloween"" is by far, even after three years and hundreds of other horror films, (no exaggerations), my absolute favorite stalker/slasher movie.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's best work is already among us, as has been already for over twenty-five years."
"lagriff05","10","4","5","17 June 2007"," This is what fear is---this movie has no equal
","What is there to really say? This is a classic by all means and it hasn't truly found an equal in the slasher genre since. While Friday the 13th had a 'party' vibe to it, and Nightmare on Elm Street was over the top and filled with crazy gore and violence effects. This one was different...quieter, subtle, more mature and scary then either of the aforementioned films.<br/><br/>It had very little gore or nudity, and yet it was more of a horror movie then Friday the 13th and all of that film's clones ever was. It was scary because of the realism, the fact that this stalker was roaming a quiet suburban neighborhood and entering dark houses and killing people. It was scary because HE HAD NO MOTIVE. That's why this film trumps all of it's mediocre sequels, because Michael Myers didn't even have a name yet, and he was just some creepy stalker going around murdering teenagers in the dead of night on Halloween. You'll be looking over your shoulder for a while after the credits roll for this one.<br/><br/>Acting is good, especially by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. Even the supporting cast and the children did good jobs, odd for a slasher film like this. But this isn't a normal slasher film, again, this is something else. The slow, menacing directing that plunged you into darkness and fear at every twist and turn, splicing your heart with true horror, and that dark, grainy picture quality...this is just amazing. Most horror movies today barely muster a scream or a shudder. You hear me, Boogeyman? The Messengers? Ring Two? This is a horror movie. This is what fear means. And this is far scarier then anything you can think of in the last 10 years. Bah to modern horror, this is where it's at if you're just starting out in the genre.<br/><br/>There is really not much you can detract for this film except for the shoddy picture quality, especially at the beginning of the movie. Very dark and grainy, you can't see anything except for Donald Pleasance's face and his assistant. But it gets better later on, when we're out of such a dark and dank setting. This was 1978 though. So Halloween is excused in this department.<br/><br/>Halloween is a timeless horror classic, and defies any stereotypes of the genre being 'brainless', 'just about gore', or 'pointless.' This is essential, and everyone needs to see it once in their lifetime. Highly, highly recommended."
"killbill_28","10","4","5","5 March 2007"," Excellent Film!
","In 1978 John Carpenter and Debra Hill joined forces again to create on the best horror films to date. With a tight budget and deadlines they create a basic story that could happen to you in your neck of the woods. A silent unstoppable babysitter killer on the lose. The story is about Micheal Myers an unstoppable killer that escapes from his metal hospital up state. Being in there since he was 6 for murdering his older sister while she was having sex with her boyfriend on one cold Halloween night. Now 21 Micheal heads to back to the town to cause more trouble. He hunts down and stalks young high school students. He's chasing one particularly his baby sister Laurie Strode.<br/><br/>After finishing school Laurie and her friends plan to have a Halloween party after they finish babysitting kids and trick or treating. Micheal Myers (or the shape) as they call him in this one watches their every move, even stealing a car to drive past the pack walking home from school. But Micheal's doctor Sam Loomis is on his tail trying to bring Micheal down before he gets to Laurie.<br/><br/>He slowly walks around the town with his white faceless mask and his knife and starts killing Laurie's friend one by one. And the showdown between Laurie and Micheal is well filmed and very scary. Even though the movie has very little blood and gore, its very scary and with John Carpanter's music score makes it even scarier! Don't watch this movie alone if you haven't seen it before because it will scare you with Micheal's acts of hiding in the dark. 10 out of 10"
"labemaster1","10","4","5","11 February 2007"," Perfect slasher film
","What a great film this is. Even though it resaulted in the slasher era. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis are at their best in this movie. So are Nancy Kyes and P.J.Soles. And there is no doubt that Michael Myers might just be the best serial killer ever. He's better than Freddy Kreuger and Jason Voorhees combined. And unlike today's slasher films, Halloween tries to scare you instead of just making you vomit in disgust. The death scenes are good too. My favorite death is Bob's death. He is impaled on a wooden door. Annie and Lynda's deaths are pretty good too. I recommend Halloween to anyone who really likes horror movies. And the good sequels are Halloween 2, Halloween 4: the Return of Michael Myers, and Halloween H20: 20 years later. The decent sequels are Halloween 3: Season of the Witch and Halloween: the Curse of Michael Myers. And the terrible sequels are Halloween 5 and Halloween: Resurrection. I just wanted to let you know which ones to watch."
"TitusYorick","9","4","5","3 February 2006"," No need for blood.
","This is probably one of the greatest horror films I have ever seen, especially because it's Old School horror. John Carpenter helps prove a very important point with this movie - you don't need buckets of blood pouring out of people's bodies to make a movie scary. You only saw one or two places where there was blood and even then it was just enough for you to understand the person was dead, which made the movie very suspenseful. This movie was what also helped create all the many different parodies of ""The Silent Killer in the Mask"" series, like Friday the 13th's 2-10, the Scream trilogy, and countless other examples that weren't even half as good as Halloween."
"CarsonTrent","10","4","5","29 November 2005"," You'll be seeing Michael forever lurking in the dark corner of your room!
","The most terrifying ""face"" of evil is no face at all, and in this case the few explanations about Michael Myers's motives only add to the tension. <br/><br/>Of course the movie does not appear as scary as today's visual effects-filled teen slasher movies, which only aim to give you a quick scare but fail to leave any real mark in your psyche. The obsessive music composed by Carpenter himself will stay buried in your mind long after you have left the theater.<br/><br/>The movie is structured exactly like a real nightmare, where you only have to put the right ingredients and then your psyche will do the rest making sure you wake up in a cold sweat...You have to consider the fact that Carpenter leaves everything pretty much to your imagination, as he just gives you a hint(the masked Myers, the terrified Loomis and the frightened Laurie) and then pretty much obsessively plays the tune that will leave a scar in your mind forever.<br/><br/><ul><li>""Evil, pure evil!""</li></ul>"
"carmenjonze-1","9","4","5","19 November 2005"," The suburbs ARE the horror
","We who grew up ""different"" in the suburbs always knew there was something, some ineffable thing, that was dead wrong with our environment. Halloween, like Blue Velvet (1986) vindicates that feeling. While ""the city"" is typically cast in pop culture as the setting for rampant immorality, murder and general debauchery, ""The Suburbs"" are the REAL creepy, borderline psychotic, and all too often death-dealing American institution.<br/><br/>The news media is littered with daily stories of ax murderers, serial rapists, gun freak vigilantes, and other barely-human opportunists who are either products of, or thrive in, the suburban environment.<br/><br/>Halloween brings exactly that creepiness to the fore. And made a mint doing it, because as everyone in America knows: the suburbs breed DEATH. Don't believe me? Just put ""Dr. Ossian Sweet Detroit"" in a search engine, see what I mean. The very thing you're running away from is right in your face. In fact, it's you, because you also thrive in it, and allow it to persist.<br/><br/>Halloween never tells us what made 6 year old Michael snap, we're left to guess whether nature or nurture (or both). My guess: nurture. That is what makes Halloween so disturbing. Halloween, while routinely compared to Psycho and other Hitchcock thrillers can also be viewed as a throwback to The Bad Seed (1956), which no doubt served to reassure middle class white suburban parents that sociopath child murderers are the product of nature, and all the middlebrow breeding in the world can't alter that.<br/><br/>Halloween is also one of those movies like Birth of A Nation or Gone With the Wind, in which it's impossible to approach the movie with any kind of objectivity. Sorry, this is what happens when you grow up in LA suburbs and remember the constant news reports of celebrity sickos at the time Halloween (and its imitators and followups) was released and made it big: the Hillside Strangler, Patty Hearst, Manson family, and Night Stalker Samhain aficionado, Richard Ramirez...incompetent Christian rightwing hysterics about ""backward masking"" and hidden messages in rock and roll songs by Abba (no joke), (sub)urban legends about razor-laced apples and poisoned mini-Snickers...did art imitate life in late 70s Los Angeles, or not? Nature or nurture or not? Yeah yeah, the sexually active teens get hacked to death, but not even dorked-out asexual babysitters are safe.<br/><br/>They never were. Michael doesn't like them much, either. Or you and your posh lawns, family cars and fancy brand name cookware.<br/><br/>That sad fact is what makes Halloween so effective, still, in 2005."
"Zephyr75","10","4","5","22 February 2004"," Still the best horror movie made to date...
","I've been watching horror movies since I was 8 years old. I'm 28 now and still to this date the best horror movie ever made is and will probably always be John Carpenter's: Halloween. Don't get me wrong there are plenty other movies in the horror genre that were and are scary and acceptable. Just from the shear nature of the film and its realism, that is primarily what makes this my favorite and best movie ever made. I can only hope as an aspiring film maker myself that I could make something as challenging and heartfelt as John did with Halloween. It's funny cause my friends and I get into such debates on what in fact is the best horror movie out there right now. Lot of them say The Excorcist, or Friday The 13th, or even Nightmare on Elm Street. Yeah... of course I have a great deal of respect for those films as well. And yes lot of them are actually in my top ten list of all time favorite horror movies made. But nothing can surpass the all time champ... Halloween. Hail to John Carpenter."
"kintopf432","10","4","5","6 November 2003"," Beautiful
","One of the simplest and most beautiful horror films ever made, `Halloween' still manages to impress, especially now that its worst imitators are thankfully starting to be forgotten.  The young John Carpenter understood that truly stylish filmmaking need not grow out of self-indulgence (unlike, say, Brian DePalma), and the gracefulness of the picture's style comes largely from his directorial restraint.  Well, he didn't really have much of a choice; he had no money, and so the pure-and-simple road was the only one available for him.  Thank goodness for that.  The film remains as gorgeous and watchable as ever, with the inspired lighting, tense set pieces, and incessant minimalist score being only a few of the notable technical elements.  It also features two marvelously authentic performances, one by the young Jamie Lee Curtis (still perhaps the best one of her career), and the other by non-actor Nick Castle, whose eloquent body language makes the Shape more frightening than that blank mask alone ever could.  So many years down the road, it may not be the scariest horror movie you've ever seen, but you'll be hard pressed to find one more elegant.  10 out of 10."
"filmlover_1","10","4","5","18 February 2002"," Underrated as a great film.
","Halloween by John Carpenter, is a masterpiece, not only as a horror film, but a film period. It is told greatly and very thrilling. What really makes this film move is the music score by Carpenter himself. It sucks you in at the start, and takes you in to this dark world."
"Jane FlamE","Null","4","5","16 September 2001"," The Night HE Came Home!
","I'll start by saying this, I am very gald that HE came home because as a result, movies of this genre were never thesame. First off the bat let me dismiss the rest of the series that followed this, especially HALLOWEEN 3 SEASON OF THE WITCH & HALLOWEEN:H20. These examples were in a word, pathetic, but I am not here to speak about those films, I'm here to sing the praises of the original classic! This film combined with Friday the 13th confirmed the era, it upped the ante and made horror directors have to work on their contributions. In my opinion the beginning of the film begins in typical stalker fashion, but when the murderer is revealed to be a knife wielding child in a clown suit, the audience becomes uncomfortable, it's a urban myth on film. Attend to your children or they will become deviant murderers. <br/><br/>The sheer idea that evil can be born into a child and linger and fester to become an evil force is unnerving and is probably more frightening to the audience than the actual murders that are committed on screen. Carpenter captures the mood in every scene, when the Jamie Lee Curtis character feels afraid and enclosed on an open street in broad daylight, the audience feels that with her and the classic ending of the villain-ain't-quite-dead-yet, which has been used in multiple films over the years, still unnerves me when I watch it. When I fist saw this movie, I knew in my heart that at the end of the movie, the villain would die, so when Jamie looked out of the window and saw an empty space where Michael Myers should have been lying, I shouted ""NO!"" with her,because that meant that he was still out there.<br/><br/>Halloween is a classic for both Horror and John Carpenter, an achievemnet he has rarely attained to since."

","I either forgot, or never appreciated how darn good this is. <br/><br/>The engineering of the thing is splendid. It was the first of a genre, so there was nothing to build on.

It even features the three iconic films that set the precedent for this: The Thing, Forbidden Planet and Psycho.<br/><br/>— It is basically wrapped around the fear of being watched. Sure there are violent murders, but the tension is built from what is seen and unseen, the notion that Myers watches and extensive POV shots. Especially the one at the beginning. This is what I call narrative folding where the watchers of the film and a character are merged.<br/><br/>— Carpenter wrote and directed it. That you know. But you may not appreciate that he wrote the music. It is fantastic. He has said that he heard the movie before he imagined it in visuals. It shows.

","Halloween is one of the those classic horror movies that everyone must see at least once. With little gore and violence, I feel that Halloween is very much a part of the 'it's not what you see, but what you don't see' club. The subtle quizzical look that Michael Myers gives to his victims is more frightening than any amount of blood can do. This movie will make your hair stand on end and send chills down your spine! The character development is excellent; you do not want these characters to die, unlike many horrors that are made today. It is one of the few scary films that the audience is not rooting for the killer! Jaime Lee Curtis plays an unassuming babysitter and her performance is very believable, making it hard not to sympathise with her as she struggles to get away from Michael Myers. I cannot recommend this movie enough. If not for the great casting, music and originality, watch this movie simply to appreciate the simplicity and eeriness of what Halloween has to offer. A must see for both horror movie fanatics and casual viewers!"
"Bonehead-XL","9","5","7","5 November 2013"," You Should Fear the Reaper
","As originally envisioned by Moustpha Akkad, ""Halloween"" wasn't much more then an exploitation film. Even the original title, ""The Babysitter Murders,"" sounds like the kind of undistinguished schlock that would have played on 42nd Street for weeks and then be forgotten. Enter John Carpenter. His stylish direction, directly influenced by Hitchcock, Argento, and Hawks elevated ""Halloween."" It really is as good as everyone says it is.<br/><br/>Carpenter uses the tracking shot emphatically throughout ""Halloween."" It's a rare shot that isn't moving. The constant movement accomplishes several things. It establishes a sense of speed through the first half of the film, as the characters go through their everyday lives, living from one moment to the next. We are placed within someone else's world. The movement also implies a third party, a voyeuristic eye. Of course, there is a voyeur and it's not just Michael Myers. The audience themselves are spying on the cast. During the best of these early scenes, the viewer truly feels like we're snooping on the daily routine of ordinary small-town folks. Lastly, the camera constantly roaming makes the motionless moments more noticeable. The camera stands still to make a statement, a bold exclamation point on the preceding. Little Michael having his clown mask torn off. The Shape raising up from the floor behind Laurie. The final montage, noting the places where violence has taken place. ""Halloween"" is visually engineered to make an impact.<br/><br/>I'm going to talk about the early half of the film a lot, mostly because it's frequently overlooked. You could call those day lit scenes a couple of things. ""Boring,"" to modern, ADD-afflicted youth. Yeah, it's kind of those things. However, these scenes establish our setting, Haddonfield, the typical Midwestern small town. They establish the autumn setting, leaves fluttering in front of the camera. They show the characters in their normal lives, contrasting with the horror the night brings.<br/><br/>What exactly is Michael Myers? He's not human. Watching the film this time, the word that kept coming to mind was 'wraith.' For those unaware, a wraith is a Scottish ghost that is exceptionally angry and takes it out on anyone that comes its way. Michael Myers is an entity, an embodiment of some inhuman force. This is why he comes into existence, fully formed. This is why Dr. Loomis insist the character is unknowable. His motivates are obscure and inscrutable. Actually observe Myers' behavior. He shifts through the darkness undetected. His mask appears in frame before quickly vanishing again. Over Laurie's shadows, in the doorway, he slowly fades out of the black of the night, a ghost phasing into perception. While the girls smoke pot in Annie's car, Myers drives behind them. And what's playing on the radio? ""(Don't Fear) The Reaper."" But you should fear the Reaper. Because you can't stop him. Michael Myers is a malevolent manifestation of death itself, inexplicable and indestructible. The indestructibility is about the only thing the subsequent sequels and remakes got right Carpenter and Debra Hill were working in archetypes. Laurie is the virginal, shy every-girl, a babysitter and obedient little daughter, who hasn't moved past schoolgirl crushes towards actual relationships. Is PJ Soles' Lynda the more interesting, likable character? Maybe. That might have to do with the boundless enthusiasm Soles brings to the part, an innate likability that should have made her a major star. It's not as if there's much to Lynda, a cheerleader stereotypically interested in fashion, school dances, beer, and her boyfriend. But what about Annie, by-far the least defined of the girly trio? She is hopelessly devoted to a boy who doesn't seem that invested, abandons the child she was supposed to protect, spills butter on her clothes, and gets stuck in a window. ""Halloween"" mostly avoids the broad clichés of later slasher films but Annie totally deserved to die. What a stupid girl.<br/><br/>Anyway, why Laurie? Why does she survive the Shape's inescapable power? Carpenter likes to say it's because she paid attention to her surroundings. Maybe. But then why does her off-screen teacher bring up destiny and fate? Laurie is forced on the path of survival, her encounter with pure evil destined to make her a fuller human being, to bring forth her indomitable will to survive. There's no way JC could have predicted the influence his little movie would have. Yet, of course Laurie is the original final girl. Her elevation to iconic status is buried in the bone marrow of the film. Even if she does need Dr. Loomis, who spends most of the movie just kind of hanging around, to save her.<br/><br/>The film is painted with shadows, crisscrossing faces and bodies. The blue tone not only suggests night and darkness but also a morbid, deathly pallor. No wonder Myers reigns supreme. He has recolored the entire night to suit him. Argento's influence on Carpenter is most obvious here, as John uses color to create a tone and atmosphere. The last act is a fun house thrill ride, designed to continuously ramp up the tension. Laurie falling down the stairs, running across the streets, knocking on a locked door, trapped in a closet, it's all escalation of the previous set piece. Bold-faced audience manipulation that works every time. Despite the famous theme music, most of ""Halloween's"" score is pulsating synth or pounding piano keys. Myers' leitmotif, a quivering, rising note, implies his presence even when he's barely glimpsed. The score is another tool in Carpenter's box to raise tension and get the audience's blood pressure up.<br/><br/>Am I reading too much into it? Or is ""Halloween"" deep? The film is a classic for a reason, a retelling of an urban legend that transcends those roots. The retelling becomes the new standard for the myth, the old routines reinvented continuously throughout the years. Wow, ""Halloween,"" good movie after all."

","It doesn't matter what time of year it is, any time you watch ""Halloween"" it becomes October 31st for an hour and a half. It's always a pleasure to re-visit Haddonfield and spend a little more time with Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, and all her friends.<br/><br/>Does ""Halloween"" really need any introduction? It might not be the first slasher film in horror history, but it's certainly the one that jump- started the genre and is still being imitated today. After the image of Michael Myers' famous white William Shatner mask hit screens, things were never the same. Suddenly, every psychotic in these types of films was covering their face using gimmicky guises. We've seen every sort of mask cover the maniac's identity, including hockey, gas, jester, cherub, and firefighter.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" captures the time period and small-town feel of its setting so perfectly. Anyone who lived through the late 1970s and trick-or- treated as a child in a suburb can attest to this. If you happened to grow up in Illinois like I did, the movie hits home even more. Honestly, Director Carpenter couldn't have done a better job establishing a believable atmosphere for this suspenseful and thrilling masterpiece."
"bensonmum2","9","5","7","30 September 2007"," ""I met him, fifteen years ago.""
","The plot of Halloween is so simple and so well known that I hardly see much point in revisiting it here. What person with even a passing interest in horror does not know who Michael Myers is and his story? He is one of the true iconic characters is recent horror history. And who with even the slightest interest in either John Carpenter or Jamie Lee Curtis isn't aware of what Halloween meant to their careers? And finally, while it may not have been the first movie of its kind or even the first to churn out a sequel, there's little debate about Halloween's influence on horror for more than a decade. For an independently made movie with a shoe-string budget, Halloween is quite the remarkable movie.<br/><br/>Halloween works because John Carpenter was smart enough to realize something that most of the imitators fail to realize. That is, for a horror movie to be effective, it's not about the kill scenes - it's about the moments leading up to the murder. It's about creating atmosphere and tension rather than a geek show filled with blood and gore. Carpenter shows us Michael lurking in the shadows just waiting to strike, but he doesn't go into detail on what happens when Michael kills. It's a simple concept and I'm continually amazed that more filmmakers don't get it. Thank goodness Carpenter got it!"
"TJ1380","8","5","7","29 August 2007"," A simple yet effective horror movie.
","Most people consider ""Halloween"" to be the first true slasher film, and from watching it it's easy to see why. All the conventions are there: the unstoppable faceless killer, promiscuous teens who are killed after having sex, steadi-cam shots from the killer's point of view, and the virginal heroine. Despite these conventions, I just don't think it's fair to call ""Halloween"" a slasher film; slasher films are cheesy exploitation films that seem to only exist to spill as much blood as possible, while ""Halloween"" is actually a creepy and effective horror movie.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is about an escaped mental patient named Michael who was committed after he murdered his sister as a child. He returns to his home town one Halloween and immediately begins stalking a local teenage babysitter named Laurie. No reason is given for Michael's obsession with Laurie or why he's been mute since he stabbed his sister to death as a child. All that matters is that he wants to kill Laurie and possibly anyone else who gets in his way. It's an incredibly simple plot, but somehow the fact that we know so little about Michael and his homicidal tendencies makes for a better and much scarier movie. It also helps that the entire movie is all about Michael stalking Laurie. There are other victims who get in Michael's way, but unlike most slasher movies the murders seem less random and more like a means to an end, which of course is to further terrorize Laurie.<br/><br/>The plot may be frightening enough, but what really makes this film work is the outstanding cinematography. Much of the film is made up of long tracking shots of the characters and steadi-cam shots usually from Michael's point of view that really give the viewer the impression that there is somebody watching these people. Even when nothing bad is happening, I would still get the impression that something was going to happen very soon. It creates a very intense atmosphere that, when added to Michael's heavy breathing that we hear whenever he comes close to killing somebody (getting excited, perhaps) and the simple yet creepy musical score make for a genuinely scary movie.<br/><br/>I would probably recommend this movie to anybody who really likes good old-fashioned horror and knows that a horror movie doesn't need to spill buckets of blood to be entertaining. A remake directed by Rob Zombie is coming out soon, but I would be very surprised if it manages to top the original. This one is truly a horror classic."

","Halloween is a stunning, stylish slasher film with an excellent cast. It is set in the Midwest of America, on Halloween night, where mental patient Michael Myers is stalking various different teens in an attempt to kill them all. What is so surprising about Halloween's success is that it cost little under $500,000 to make. It clearly did not need an inconceivably large budget to prove success, and the fact that its gone onto influence cinema to this day is amazing.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curits hits full stride in one of her earliest cinema performances. She plays Lorie Strode, Halloween's heroin who fights of one horrors most psychotic villains. Pleasence is brilliant as the cynical detective also trying to put an end to Michael's devilish ways. John Carpenter, master of suspense, has created a tense, unsettling atmosphere and one of the greatest horror films of all time. See it, otherwise your missing out. Makes a great party movie too!"

","No, it's not the first slasher movie, far from it. But it granted legitimacy to the genre. The setup and the quality of the acting and the timing of events is startling. We are brought into the insanity that is Michael Myers. The initial event that brought him to the asylum is graphic and horrifying. This movie begins later and Myers is on the loose. Jamie Lee Curtis is the teenager that becomes central to the plot. She is a good choice because she is no pushover. As Myers attacks and attacks and attacks, she uses he resilience to withstand his assault. It's a little remindful of Sigourney Weaver in Aliens (the second movie) when there is so much to lose, you are going to go down fighting. Of course, this film launched a bevy of sequels and copycat teenage slasher films, but this one is so nicely crafted that it rises above the rest."

Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time.

"Gotensive","10","6","9","20 May 2008"," Carpenter's Best
","I consider this movie to be Carpenter's best movie. I'll admit that I've only seen three of his movies (Halloween, The Thing, and Assault On Precinct 13), but out of those three, Halloween is by far the best. Here on IMDb The Thing has a higher rating, but don't let that fool you as this is Carpenter's true masterpiece. The setting/atmosphere, the score, the scary yet quiet Michael Myers who's breathing you can hear through his mask, the fantastic performance from Pleasence, everything in this movie works perfectly. Critics of this film argue that the acting brings down this movie, as well as the lack of gore. Well, I personally disagree on both counts. I'll admit, the acting in this movie (besides Donald Pleaseance of-course) is pretty pedestrian, but it's a low-budget Horror Movie with mostly no-name actors ( at least at the time), what was everyone expecting? Award Winning performances? The acting was fine, in fact it was pretty damn solid. Certainly far superior to the acting in any Friday The 13th movie. As to the lack of gore, well that's what makes Halloween great, IMO. It doesn't need gore for it's scares, as the atmosphere/setting and Carpenter's amazing score is very creepy all alone. The lighting in this movie is also fantastic, specifically the scene where Laurie Strode is standing in front of a dark bedroom doorway, and slowly and steadily Michael Myers appears behind Laurie in a dim lighting. That right there is fantastic film making. Anyway, I recommend this to anyone who wants to consider themselves a Horror Fan, as this is a must see. It may not be as influential as Night Of The Living Dead (1968) or Psycho (1960), but it's just as great as both of them, IMO."
"grezza_2004","9","6","9","24 September 2007"," Horror films should be scary
","Definition of the term horror: ""intense and profound fear"".<br/><br/>Surely then, a HORROR film should contain intense and profound fear. So why is it then that most horror films are not very scary, and just contain grotesquely disturbing and violent images. Well, its probably because most people who watch modern horror films are mostly underage and get off on graphic violence. It's a shame really, because these films do so well, why would anybody go out of their way to make a genuinely scary horror movie? James Wan's Saw is an exception, but like all other actual good horror films, it has been exploited by making pointless sequels.<br/><br/>Thankfully, we'll always have the legendary John Carpenter. Halloween is by far the scariest film I have seen. Instead of going out of his way to put graphic violence on camera, he instead creates unbelievable suspense by making us wait, setting the film at night, the heavy breathing sound, and adding a supernatural element. Notice there is no blood and gore in that list. Michael Myers has no lines in the whole film. He also has no back story. He is seemingly normal, that is perhaps the scariest thing about him. So many villains have been made so much less scary by giving them a back story - even Hannibal Lector was ruined by his own creator! Ignore the fact there has been a recent remake of Halloween, because it hasn't aged one little bit. It isn't gory at all, but remains terrifying in a way that no other film can. This is a milestone in film horror, and a true classic. Because what Carpenter lacked in budget, and some of the actors lacked in talent, was more than accounted for by superb technique, something that many budding directors should take a look at."

","The original Halloween is definitely a true slasher flick, as well as a horror classic. Even though this is an independent feature and at the time had a relatively unknown cast, it became one of the surprise hits of the late '70's. Halloween more than most modern horror movies relied more on scares and suspense than extreme gore to help make it a success. <br/><br/>Here scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis has her real first big screen role. At the time her mother the late Janet Leigh was also known as a screen queen as the doomed motel tenant in Psycho another landmark horror movie. Like mother like daughter!<br/><br/>When Halloween was first released Donald Pleasance was probably the only star of the film that was already a household name. Most moviegoers best knew him as one of the all time James Bond villains, Blofeld from You Only Live Twice. This time around Pleasance plays one of his few good guy roles in that of the obsessed, but determined Dr. Loomis. However, Dr. Loomis's adversary would not be a super spy who has at least two lives, but a supernatural serial killer who the doctor will eventually discover has anywhere between 2 and 2 million lives. <br/><br/>The well known serial killer is known as Michael Myers, who was also the doctor's patient for 15 years. Even though Michael was a major headache for Loomis, he mostly likely helped launch the careers of Jason and Freddy. Michael is first introduced to us a 6 year old, who on Halloween night in 1963, brutally butchers his half naked sister to death. Then the evil child will spend the rest of his life in an insane asylum. However, Michaeal would not have it that way. <br/><br/>Fast forward 15 years later, Dr. Loomis and one of the hospital nurses are under orders of the law to bring Michael Myers to court to stand trial for his sister's murder. The doctor and nurse shockingly discover that Michael has made an elaborate escape plan, and decides to come home to Haddonfield, Illionis. <br/><br/>Now that Michael Myers has returned to his hometown, we are first introduced t Jamie Lee Curtis's character, Laurie Strode who is a rather shy high school student. Once Michael first lays his eyes on her, he begins to stalk her and her two girlfriends Annie and Lynda. All three notice the masked figure, but have no idea who he really his. As Laurie and Annie are both off to their baby sitting duties, Dr. Loomis finally arrives in Haddonfield. When he finally make his presence back in Michael's hometown, he requests the town's sheriff who is also Annie's father to aid him in tracking down his patient before he commits a major murder spree. <br/><br/>Dr. Loomis decides to hang out in Michael's childhood home, believing he will actually decide to return. Sheffir Brackett somewhat skeptical about the doc's theories, agrees to patrol the streets of Haddonfield in an attempt to find the escaped patient before it's too late. However, both men have no idea that Michael is stalking the two girls who babysitting two different kids. Michael makes Annie his first victim of the night, then murders Lynda and her boyfriend in the same house where Annie was babysitting. <br/><br/>This is where the major scares really start to pick up. Laurie who is babysitting across the street, believes that her friends are playing a Halloween prank. So she decides to walk across the street to where her friends are hanging out. Unfortunately, Laurie discovers that's it's no Halloween prank and three of her friends have been murdered. Laurie herself miraculously escapes from the house and heads back over to the house she was originally babysitting in to hide from her attacker. <br/><br/>As Michael is about to claim Laurie as his next victim, Dr. Loomis sees two screaming children running out of a the house that Michael is now in. The doctor decides to go into the house and finds his patient at last trying to murder Laurie. The doctor saves Laurie by shooting ol Mike approx. 6 times before falling out of the window to the ground. As Loomis looks out the window he like everybody else discovers that you can't kill the bogeyman.<br/><br/>Now we know there will be numerous sequels, as well as similar style slasher films."

","Each of the three pivotal teen slasher movies had one rising star. A Nightmare on Elm Street had Johnny Depp, Friday the 13th had Kevin Bacon, and Halloween had Jamie Lee Curtis. While the former two were just side characters, undeveloped and there for slaying, Curtis was given the lead role of Laurie Strode (her first movie role, too). And, amazingly enough, she performs quite well. The rest of the movie doesn't perform as well, though.<br/><br/>Michael Myers (Tony Moran) killed his sister when he was six years old, and then locked up in a mental institution for fifteen years. He escapes and returns to his hometown, where babysitting highschool/thirty-year-old Laurie (Curtis) is. Myers proceeds to wreck havoc on the town for no reason at allwell, he doesn't really wreck havoc, all he does is indiscreetly murder a few people while Jamie Lee Curtis screams.<br/><br/>I've heard this referred to as being `the scariest movie ever,' blah blah blah. There was almost no horror to it; the way director John Carpenter sets it up is so blasé and dull. He didn't create any tension leading up to anything: all he did was have a couple murders, a bland sex scene, and young kids. Usually those three things can be put together for an entertaining ride, but here they don't add up to anything.<br/><br/>Technically, however, Halloween was good, considering its small budget. Its cinematography was almost too good for the movie itself. Many shots seemed like on take, and the angles were impressive. I've always liked when first person shots were done, and many times we saw things from Michael Myers's point of view, which was more impressive, too.<br/><br/>On the other hand, not only was it not scary, but it wasn't believable. I know that movies weren't as violent back then, but there was absolutely no blood throughout the entire movie. I'm not much of a gore hound, but I actually wanted some to add some authenticity. When someone is stabbed, blood comes out, whether the knife is taken out or not. Also, I find it kind of sad when I know more about and care about the cold-blooded killer than the heroine. The character of Laurie is not only the world's worst babysitter but isn't a pleasant character. I almost hope that Carpenter remakes this movie.<br/><br/>One thing I abhor about movies like this is that they almost know that there's going to be multiple sequels, so they don't explain everything, especially about Michael. I won't be seeing the sequels, that's for sure, so I would have liked to know what actually happened. Then again, that's some clever plot to make me see them. Although I may grow to like it more, which I probably will, Halloween is not the horror classic everyone makes it out to believe.<br/><br/>My rating: 4/10<br/><br/>Rated R for scary situations?"
"destiniem","10","2","2","16 April 2020"," One of the best horror films of all time!
","So simplistic, yet terrifying! As a huge horror film, I love a horror film that does not rely on gore, over-the-top nudity, and cheap jump scares. Halloween (1978) is by far one of my favorite horror films. With a simple plot, it reminds us that we can sometime get too comfortable, and even when we feel our most safe, evil can disrupt peace."
"ccthemovieman-1","7","11","20","13 December 2007"," A Bit Tame By Today's Standards, But That's Good
","I didn't watch these '70s and '80s horror movies like ""Halloween"" until the mid 1990s when I watched every VHS I could get hold of, so a film like this looked pretty tame to what I was already used to seeing by the '90s. However, what this film offers (see below) has some real value, and has a major lesson to learn to the people who make movies..<br/><br/>Comparing horror series that were both popular in the 1980s, I did not find it anywhere near as entertaining as the ""Nightmare On Elm Street"" horror series. Maybe I was too old by the time I finally saw this, but I appreciated the humor ""Freddie Krueger"" provided as the main character in those Elm Street stories. A little humor, sometimes, is nice relief in a suspenseful horror flick.<br/><br/>That's not to say Halloween wasn't worth a look, especially with young Jamie Lee Curtis making her film debut. And, like many films with sequels, I found this first Halloween as the best of all of them.<br/><br/>Also on the positive side, it's nice to see a modern-day (post '60s) horror flick without all the blood and gore. The writers here were smart enough to play on our fears, not having gross body parts flung in our face. In other words, suspense is the name of the game here, something filmmakers did effectively for years in the classic era of movies. It seems a lot of that has been replaced with shock today. Young filmmakers who are into horror could learn a lot studying this movie."

","This one of the scariest movies made before 1981. It has a great story line. It also has great acting. Halloween II (1981) a little better. Halloween the cures of Michael Myers is also better. Halloween H20 is also better. Halloween II (2009) is also better. But still this a great movie. This is about a warlock that kills people on Halloween. It will make you think twice about going out to night. This is a true classic horror fantasy. This is the movie you need to see.

","I remember seeing this movie when it first came out in '79. My friends and I went to the theater, expecting to see 'THE SCARIEST MOVIE EVER MADE'. Now, mind you, I had been sneaking into movies like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Suspiria"" and ""The Exorcist"" (et al) since I was a little kid, but ""Halloween"" was the first time I went to see an 'R' rated horror film legitimately. My friends, however, were not exactly died in the wool horror fans like myself and were duly frightened by the proceedings. I, on the other hand, was kept awake only by the sporadic yelps and squeals from all of the other neophytes in the audience. I was, like--""what?"" I did not see then, nor do I see now, why this movie made such a big impression on everybody. Its just not that scary folks. Unless by scary you mean highly derivative, unimaginative and dull."
"thehighbutwise","10","6","10","12 October 2015"," He is the incarnation of evil itself.
","This movie is about a boy who stabs his sister when he's 6 years old. 15 years later he escapes from a mental institution to go to his hometown Haddonfield to kill. That person is Michael Myers. This movie is quite slow in the beginning as it establishes the characters but as the night falls then the killing starts. During this movie when it's day you can see Michael just standing and staring at the characters. This makes it creepier because it gives you that feeling that anyone could be watching you in real life without you knowing it. And the scenes when the camera is beside Michael when he's spying on some teenager without them knowing is also creepy because it gives you that feeling that a psychopath could be in your house and you wouldn't know it before it was too late. The ending is great because Dr. Sam Loomis shoots Michael six times in the heart and he falls of the balcony and he disappears. This gives you that feeling that he's out there somewhere and that no matter how hard you try, evil never dies. As the other reviews I've seen here that talks about it not having many kills and that it's not bloody enough. It's because it's not a Slasher! It's a Hitchcock inspired thriller! The sequels gave it the reputation of a slasher. And Michael can't die because he's the incarnation of evil itself and evil never dies."

Halloween is one of the only truly popular horror movies that is mostly believable: crazy guy goes around killing unsuspecting victims, most of them drunk and horny. Michael Myers has no special powers really. No other horror movie has ever been copied or been more influential before or after it. And seriously, Jaws,Aliens,King Kong, all good but none are even horror movies. Aliens has never scared anyone.Now, there are a couple of movies rated above Halloween here that have arguments as the best horror movie ever, like Psycho or the Exorcist.

"Milo-Jeeder","7","5","8","28 March 2015"," A solid horror film that, for some reason, doesn't appeal to me entirely
","I have mixed feelings about this film. I like it and I've seen it around five or six times, but there's something about ""Halloween"" that I find dissatisfying. <br/><br/>Incorrectly regarded as the first slasher ever made, ""Halloween"" started a trend of low budget films about mysterious killers wearing a mask and murdering young people with no specific reasons. The truth is that ""Halloween"" changed horror movies for good and served as an influence for many horror films that came after. While ""Black Christmas"" came four years before this, and it is one of my favorite slashers, I think it is less known, because we never get to see the killer, while ""Halloween"" gives us a very frightening looking villain, capable of causing horror to the most experienced horror fans. Michael Myer's design is actually very modest: a white mask with black eyes, a blue overall and a big kitchen knife that make him very sinister, without having to appeal to something more brutal and explicit, like some of the slasher killers that came after him. Michael is a very well designed horror villain and he is probably one of my favorites too (keeping in mind that this isn't the only ""Halloween"" film). So what is it about ""Halloween"" that doesn't quite do it for me?<br/><br/>My main problem with ""Halloween"" is that I find it a little bit slow (there, I said it!) and I'm sure this is the main reason why other people dislike it as well, which automatically causes avid ""Halloween"" fans to accuse the detractors of only being capable of appreciating horror films with a lot of cheap-scares. I actually don't have a problem with slow films, but I feel like most of this film features the main character going on about her business, chatting with her silly friends about high school crushes and stuff, and we occasionally see Michael Myers appearing here and there. I do realize that this is intended to create a frightening atmosphere and it actually works well, but after a while, I find it a little bit tedious.<br/><br/>Those who want gory murders will have to skip this film. While I think gore is not always a requirement, I would normally expect the murders to have some kind of shock value and be disturbing, even if we don't get to see a single drop of blood (it can happen). Most of the murders are rather predictable and what we see on the screen isn't too disturbing or shocking, at least not by nowadays' standards. Fortunately, the music during the murders is so powerful and fear-provoking that it makes up for the lack of brutality. For the life of me, I can't understand how ""Halloween"" got an R-rating in so many countries. Not only there's barely any blood in it, but also, the nudity is very naïf and harmless. <br/><br/>Towards the last twenty minutes, ""Halloween"" displays a lot of suspense, mainly with Laurie Strode (the lead) being chased by the sinister Michael Myers. This part of the film is not only full of tension due to the fact that a merciless killer is out to get an innocent high school girl for no apparent reason, but also because two small kids are in danger and it's the lead girl's implied responsibility to protect them. The confrontation between Michael and Laurie is chilling, as the killer is apparently impossible to kill and Laurie, in all her nervousness, goes out of her way to make the worst possible choices when it comes to escaping the lunatic. While I find the night scenario and the dark in general to be fitting for a horror film about a mysterious killer, I find the excessive dark to also make it very difficult to fully appreciate what's going on at times. <br/><br/>The acting in ""Halloween"" is very solid, which is unlikely to find in slasher films, or at least the ones that came out during and after the eighties. The main three actresses are Jamie Lee Curtis (unknown back then), P. J. Soles and Nancy Loomis, while English actor Donald Pleasence plays Detective Sam Loomis. I have no complaints here, like I said, I found the acting to be rather convincing and spot-on. As for the characters, the lead is a mousy girl, named Laurie Strode, who mostly keeps to herself and behaves like a nice girl. Laurie's friend however, are nothing like her; Annie and Lynda (her two besties) are outgoing, popular and fun and yes, they have sex, they drink alcohol and smoke. Now guess which ones get killed and which ones get to live for several more sequels? Laurie is a good lead and someone the audience would normally care about. She's a very mature girl, responsible, hard working, great with kids and even though she doesn't follow her friends' life choices, she doesn't judge them either, which makes her a perfectly likable lead, which is important in a horror movie, because we are supposed to like her and root for her. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" holds up pretty well as a solid horror film that manages to avoid the campiness or the unintentionally funny moments, which is crucial if we are hoping to see a genuinely scary horror film. There are some well created moments filled with suspense and the emblematic music (composed by Carpenter himself) intensifies the feeling of uneasiness during the climax of the film. All in all, a good horror movie that is simply not one of my favorites."

","Sometimes it's hard to review such well-known films, classic films. It feels everything has already been said before. But old films and classics certainly do age, some of them well, some of them not so well. Watching them in different time periods certainly gives you a fresh perspective, but always keeping in mind the time and context in which the film was made. Having said that, I rewatched this horror gem a couple of months ago and the more you watch it, the more enjoyable it gets. This is the original, the ones that follow are just mediocre. This one is quality, the real deal. Here is the beginning of the battle between Michael Myers and Laurie, and is always so delightful to watch it gestate from the beginning until the end. So many cool scenes, and I don't know if this gets mention often or not, but I truly appreciate this movie's photography work. So many incredible shots that are a testament to this movie's classic status.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is great, this role came natural to her and she shows that on screen. I'm sure she inspired many that have attempted to portray her essence to a certain extent but have failed miserably, for she's one of a kind, as her performance is. You know how it is, it's so hard to fine convincing (let alone good) acting in these kinds of films, but you have one here.

","Starring:<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode Donald Pleasance as Dr. Samuel Loomis Nick Castle as The Shape Nancy Loomis as Annie P.J. Soles as Lynda<br/><br/>Plot: Fifteen years ago Michael Myers murdered his sister Judith. He's now escaped and stalking a young group of teenagers in his old hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. His doctor, Sam Loomis, knows exactly what he is and has also returned to stop him.<br/><br/>What could I say that hasn't been said really? Halloween is one of the greatest horror films ever made. Carpenter took a small budget, a simple plot and a cast of mostly unknown people(with the exception of veteran Donald Pleasance) and crafted a masterpiece. With this review it's not a simple task of explaining what's good and bad, but informing you why exactly this movie is so great.<br/><br/>Let's start with the script. While it's a basic story(guy returns home to kill people) it works because of the subtleties within. Dr. Loomis is a very well-written character, and gets some good lines explaining why, in his view, Michael Myers is not simply a man, but pure evil. Those lines are delivered excellently by Donald Pleasance.<br/><br/>He gives you the very briefest of introductions of Michael, just showing him as some kid who killed his sister, without ever saying why. Then he escapes and you know right then that someone is going to get hurt. The teens he stalks are normal and look like everyday people. People that you could know, in a town that you could live in. Only on this night, evil has arrived. It's simple, sure, but it's the simplicity that makes it so damn scary. Would this have been as frightening if say, there was some giant monster with four arms killing people? Not really. This is a story that could ACTUALLY happen.<br/><br/>Carpenter's direction I feel is very top-notch. My favorite shot in the film is when Laurie is in the house, and you see a flash of white in the darkness..while you question what you could have seen, Michael slowly appears and attacks. Other great moments such as the Shape being visible, then disappearing, the killer POV shots and the entire opening sequence all add up to a very good visual style. The cast turn in good performances, including Jamie Lee Curtis who pretty much made her career off of this one movie.<br/><br/>What else is there? This movie doesn't rely on blood at all, which is superb. Coming from someone who enjoys his gore, I can say this doesn't need it at all. It relies on suspense and scares, which still can get you today, even if you know they're coming. It has a sense of dread just filling the entire thing and you know SOMETHING is going to kill these innocent kids. The score, which Carpenter himself provided, is haunting and is very memorable. The opening theme is easily recognized for a reason. It's very chilling.<br/><br/>You can probably already tell what rating I'm giving Carpenter's Halloween. I'm just explaining why. This movie deserves all the acclaim it gets, and it still holds up today. I couldn't imagine why you wouldn't have seen it(really, I can't think of a single reason). Go watch it again and relive the greatness. It's the night HE came home, after all.<br/><br/>Rating: *****"
"Quinoa1984","10","9","18","10 February 2000"," One of the best horror and independent films ever made
","John Carpenter has created a masterpiece with Halloween.  Not only a terrific horror film, but a terrific independent picture as well (the film only cost $320,000).  The pictures revolutionized horror movies and all movies by scaring you to the bone with a character who heard voices in his head and couldn't be stopped.

"Horror-yo","3","15","34","29 October 2011"," The most over-hyped, over-rated piece of crap in horror. Really.
","* Yes it started slashers - not nearly the finest field in the horror genre - but it was dubbed the godfather of slashers nonetheless. * Yes, it's John Carpenter. ------------------------------------------- But that's - about - it folks. Wanna read the reality about it ? Here goes:<br/><br/>The premise itself could not be simpler - a kid kills his sister and goes to a mental hospital, manages to escape of course a decade later... somehow (nothing about that). He manages to find and wear his trademark mask, comes to possess incredible physical strength, and haunts one girl in particular for absolutely no given reason. Behold: Michael Myers...<br/><br/>The villain: one of the most inexplicably notorious in all of horror today, has as much depth as a post-it. There's no credibility in some 10yo killing his sister like that. And he's just out to kill...randomly. The only attribute to his account as a great killer in horror films is his heavy breathing. They didn't exploit the severe, extreme span of his unique psychological case one bit. Just the standard knife, the breathing...and a generic white mask. They turned a dreadful nightmare of a psychological case into a Tom n Jerry episode. Great.<br/><br/>The protagonist and other preys: Jamie Lee Curtis is fine. Nothing to say here. But the rest are completely interchangeable, colorless characters that are 'developed' for over an HOUR with no murder taking place - you would think to space out, deepen and strengthen our relationship as viewers with them - but it's all just teen-girl gossip ! Nobody gives a damn about any of them. They're all skin-deep cattle.<br/><br/>Who goes to a horror film, a genre viewed and developed by a majority of guys, whether it's 1978 or 2011, to watch scene after scene of potential slaughter trivialized by girl-to-girl teenage gossip ? And what, the final scene with Myers out to kill the main chick is supposed to redeem the whole of this crap ? He dies like 5 times in 15 minutes !<br/><br/>The main theme, composed by director Carpenter himself, is thrown at you about 6 times during the film. <br/><br/>The scenes that had potential to scare were completely ruined by bad timing, too-slow a pace, inadequate music, cheesiest of sound effects, terrible acting, too long of scenes...(think nun in car early in the film, or later chick strangled in car in garage) - the latter example simply turning on the ridiculous, simply. There's nothing remotely subtle about the entire 1h40min of it. Nothing interesting. Nothing subjective. It's like a horror fabricated from a computer. Neutral, cold, boring. <br/><br/>And all in all, though I'm very willing and patient and tolerant and I wanted to enjoy it, it's awfully boring. Just...plain boring. There's no way to possibly, actually get into it in all seriousness. Fairly, this movie is just BAD. Yes."
"derwunderbaremandarin","2","14","32","2 June 2010"," How many clichés can you take...?
","I remember my first attempt to watch this movie, it was about 5 years ago and ended after about 10 minutes. I remember the impression the opening scene made on me. I thought: ""What a cheap, cheesy and bad movie this must be, no thanks."" After a while I decided to give it another shot, also based on the 8.0 rating on this website. I rented it again, and I deeply regret it.<br/><br/>I love horror movies, I love to get scared, and I do not need blood, gore, splatter and the liking. I need an intelligent plot, a good, creepy atmosphere and a capable director who can tell the story well. ""Halloween"" has nothing of that.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" has a really poor plot (a madman escapes from prison and kills people), a low-budget set that looks low-budget, an incredibly cheesy screenplay (the doctor about the madman: ""I have worked with him for 15 years and he is pure evil"" or something like that), a lousy, lousy soundtrack that should win an award for the worst movie score (composed by Carpenter himself btw.) and so on and on.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is a typical teenage low-budget horror cliché, full of bad dialogue and bad story telling. Since the sceneries are so dumb and hence so predictable, the movie is not scary at all. Actually, it is boring. I had a hard time not to close my eyes or do something else.<br/><br/>For my taste, this movie shows how not to make a horror movie. It is not scary, not intelligent and (on top of it) takes itself dead serious. Again, I have to say no thanks.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has become a ""no no"" to me. As a teenager I was kind of fascinated by ""The Thing"", but having seen it again as an adult, I'd have to say that it probably was because it was so disgusting. ""Assault on Prencict 13"" was one of the worst movies I have seen so far, and ""Halloween"" was not so much better than that. I will never watch a Carpenter movie again.<br/><br/>Anyway, 2 stars for not being as bad as ""Assault"" and for having Lee Curtis and Pleasance in the cast - the latter though with dialogues that make your mind boggle."
"imbluzclooby","5","8","16","1 November 2007"," Inexplicably Overrated!
","I remember hearing about Halloween when I was in the fifth grade. A couple of friends told me how cool it was and I relished over having the privilege of sharing their opportunity to see R rated Horror. But the movie to me was nothing special. The hype immensely outweighed its value and I was quite frankly, disappointed. Sure there are some chilling movements and usage of slow motion and antics with camera angles. But the final result was pretty stupid.<br/><br/>The killer falls from the window after having been shot by a 6 round pistol and is then missing. Donald Pleasance gives a look of shock and anguish and glosses his eyes over the screen. The premonition is ""There will be a sequel"", and then some and then some. Gag me.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is nothing but a drab chick that panics and falls repeatedly when being chased. P.J. Soles is an equally annoying chick with a dimwitted boyfriend. You can only enjoy the deliberately slow and banal moments of their demise. Donald Pleasance is the only real actor here and it's the expression in his eyes and intensity of his voice that carries this slow and plodding plot line.<br/><br/>The killer to me was very disappointing. Watching a slow, plodding mental case in a dumb mask wasn't scary enough.<br/><br/>I am one of the select few who thought this movie was overrated and I can think of numerous, maybe hundreds of horror films better and scarier than Halloween. I can even think of films not under the horror genre scarier and more suspenseful than Halloween.<br/><br/>Case closed."

"helge_iversen","3","11","25","6 September 2002"," Disappointed
","Even though I have been a horror fan for two decades I still hadn't seen Halloween until now. No special reason, it just didn't happen before. I was excited and expected a lot from this pioneer movie that taught later movie makers so much. I was utterly disappointed.<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead. The movie starts off really well and is quite promising for a period of time, though weaknesses are displayed from the very beginning. Let's take the opening scene when we are introduced to the child murderer. Little details go wrong like why do you pick up a knife and automatically raise it above your head when you know that your victim is upstairs. In this real-time scene when you (quite originally at that time) see the world through the eyes of the murderer, things simply moves too fast. The young couple goes fully clothed upstairs to have sex. The killer then moves into the house and pick up the knife he lift like a zombie and moves toward the stairs just in time to see the boy come down the stairs while buttoning his shirt. If you withdraw the time of undressing and redressing - the young couple MIGHT have had sex for 10 seconds...logics fail already. Then the murderer proceeds upstairs to kill his sister with this big knife that he stabs her with. The sounds she makes are undescribable. It sounds more like she's having sex than being killed...this happens again later in the movie. OK - that was only the opening scene...it goes on and on. A major glip is how the autumn leaves always falls down right in front of the camera when there is basically no movement or even leaves anywhere else in the town...or how the knife logically must have turned into a sword to be able to hold a grown man stabbed, hanging from the wall...<br/><br/>Apart from these glitches there are other things to consider. The constant appearances of the murderer through a window, down the street, inside a house, outside a house - and always simultaneously with an overdramatic musical boom sound - was interesting at first but grew old really fast. It becomes like ""yeah - we know he's scary by now, let's get down to business!"" Boring. And then in the final scene when the murderer FINALLY encounters Jamie Lee Curtis - she stabs him twice - both times leaving him there with the knife. How stupid can a person get? Not that stupid. One good thing about the movie was the absence of explanation. The psychiatrist played the best part, and his describing of the murderer are quite thrilling. Also the fact that the killer disappears in the end when he really should be dead and the lack of explanation for this is quite intriguing. WAS he some sort of devil in the flesh? I don't know, and I can assure you that I won't see any of the seven (?) sequels to find out. This movie grew old after twenty minutes. A 4/10, rescued by the importance of the movie in displaying certain exciting movements which later movie makers used without using them up the way Carpenter did with this one. The movie is now a historical curiosity. Nothing more."
"jono_day01","1","23","61","24 June 2008"," Small things entertain small minds
","I can't believe that this film could be viewed as terrifying, what's the matter with you all, it is at the most ever so slightly tense on occasions. I can't help thinking that anyone who thinks this film is scary was either a young sheltered teenager in the 70's when the film first came out or was of primary school age with this being the first horror they had ever watched. Not that John Carpenters Halloween really deserves to be described as a horror, more like watching paint dry. The plot is not remotely intriguing or creative, there is virtually no story to this film other than Michael Myers going around killing people. Most of the scenes in the film just seem if they were chucked in to fill the massive gaps in the film when Michael is not killing anyone rather than tying the story together nicely.<br/><br/>The film doesn't feel as if it gets going until about half an hour before the end, before then Michael is just watching Laurie Strode from distances and then disappearing now and then, and this is meant to be a tense build up? Give me a break. In all honesty it doesn't really feel as if it ever gets going properly and as for the killing at the beginning when he kills his sister, it looks so fake and I can't believe that she is in pain at all. Her scream is so unconvincing and it doesn't even look as if he is stabbing her at all but completely missing and to think, the mask is covering most of our view making it much easier for Carpenter to play with illusion of depth with the knife but he still fails. The following scene is laughable when his parents come back and see Michael out side the front of the house, it's as if the three of them just freeze for a photo to be taken with Michael's mum and dad just watching him looking gormless as the camera zooms out.<br/><br/>The music is so ineffective and repetitive, the theme sounds more like music for an action thriller and not a horror, plus throughout the film the music is very basic with little atmosphere. For a slasher this film has a very small body count, something like 3 or 4 murders and when most of the corpses are revealed as we approach the alleged climax of the film it looks like something from a comical haunted house theme park attraction. I'm talking about the parts when we see a young lady dead on a bed with her arms spread out and a grave stone behind her and when a body falls down and hangs from the ceiling conveniently as Laurie is close to it. I can almost imagine someone hiding in the room and pressing a button to release the corpse from the ceiling and when a door mysteriously opens to reveal another dead body of a lady again like theme park style, it looks is if it was pulled open by a piece of fishing wire from below deliberately so that Laurie would see the body and be scared. I remember thinking that the only good technical aspect of the film was the lighting in some places but otherwise it's one of the most boring films I've ever seen and it's such a joke that it's considered to be one of the scariest films of all time. I'm sure there is more that I could complain about but I've not seen the film many times and I'm not planning on boring my self to death with it again just so that I can criticise it more thoroughly, it's just not worth it."

","In my opinion, there is no better film in the horror genre than John Carpenter's ""Halloween"". The plot is so simple, yet so effective and eerie. (Man in mask, stalks teenage girls). Everything is effective in this film. The acting is very well done (especially for a horror film). The setting is perfect and Carpenter's score heightens the tension and suspense. Perhaps Carpenter's score is the crowning jewel in this film and is synonymous with the film. Although there is virtually no blood throughout the film, the audience can't help but think the murders are incredibly brutal and violent. Perhaps it's because Carpenter had no budget for this film, and therefore and had room for special effects or perhaps it was done by design, but directors of this genre should take a lesson from ""Halloween"" Less is MORE! Halloween is a perfect horror film and one that should be in any horror buffs collection!"
"brewer23","3","11","27","7 November 2010"," A totally overrated so called ""classic""
","I understand this movie is dated now and might been scary back in 1978. However older movies like this are meant to rely on a good plot. This movie basically just starts with the murder of his sister one of the better scenes then no explanation there after of the next 15 years, just a vague terrible scene of him escaping then bam his for some reason he's crazy and wants to kill people. The acting is bad and showcases a massive lack of emotion when people are meant to be scared. I was expecting a much better movie then this considering the hype and critic reviews. The fact it has been filmed well, had a good score was the only reason i could withstand watching it to the end. If you want to watch a classic horror that might actually scare you or get you thinking try nightmare on elm."

","After watching this film for the first time, the one that created the slasher genre and was supposedly one of the best horror classics, I got a sudden urge to drop dead of boredom.
No explanation as to why Michael killed his sister (if you ignore the sequels), bland characters like these teens that I don´t feel any affection for and the nerve that some reviewers have by claiming that people who call this movie boring are stupid teens is just a joke, the fact is in 2018 this movie is not scary or effective in any way, the fact that they take so long to set up the deaths with scenes of Myers of just walking around looking at people behind bushes, following a kid in a car for no apparent reason and then people saying that these teens dying to a mysterious man in a mask is terryfing, maybe in some movies but not in this one, the deaths are laughable especially the one who gets choked in the car. To sum it up, maybe I´m not old enough to find this movie scary; I wasn´t a kid when I first saw this movie or maybe people just have their nostalgia filters turned up to the max while rewatching this movie more than 3 decades later."

","""Halloween"" from 1978 is a cult horror by John Carpenter, movie considered to be the first slasher horror and one of the most influential movies of all time. With all due respect, this does not automatically make it a good movie. This is Jamie Lee Curtis' debut movie, the movie that made her famous and one of the stupidest and the most boring movies I have ever seen. It practically doesn't have a story, characterization is also nonexistent, and complete lack of motivation makes Michael Myers one of the most unconvincing movie villains. The movie has no depth, no tension, and it is not scary either.<br/><br/>One reason to watch this film could be the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis is extremely hot. She changed a little over the decades, but her specific sex appeal and sensibility fits her better in her forties and fifties than in her youth. As she is buttoned up to the neck all the time, this reason falls apart. On top of that, she is a lousy screamer.<br/><br/>The only good thing in this movie is Carpenter's simple but eerie high-pitched melody, that became one of the most famous themes in the history of horror, or even movie melodies overall.<br/><br/>5/10"

"paul2001sw-1","4","6","13","3 November 2006"," The film that launched a thousand sequels
","John Carpenter is widely acknowledged as the 1970s master of low budget shockers; 'Halloween', a tale of teenagers attacked by an escaped killer, was arguably his most influential film. I quite like some of his other films from this era, but, watching this one, I was mostly amazed at how bad it was. The acting is poor, and there's none of the atmospheric Gothic atmosphere of the equally influential 'Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. Most crucially, the murderer is a man who wears a mask, betrays no expression, and kills for no discernible reason, not even his own pleasure: a less interesting, or plausible, bad-guy, is hard to imagine. Eventually there are some tense (though surprisingly un-graphic) scenes towards the end, but even their impact is reduced by repetition, and by the poorly worked-out zombie-theme that is added onto the end of the film. To me, it's odd that this movie was so widely copied; but as few consider its sequels to be improvements, I doubt that I'll be watching them."
"Jacques98","3","7","16","25 February 2009"," An unbiased review.
","There is a major difference between having respect for a film and being truly captivated by a film. Respect is simply realizing the importance a film had to cinema, or a certain genre, and admiring it for what it was in its time. Captivation is when you watch a film and are truly amazed by what you have just witnessed: in result, you think about it for days; you buy wallpaper with the main character printed on it; you give it a perfect score; it becomes a part of your life. With that said, let me briefly talk about the two main groups that make up the Halloween fan-base.<br/><br/>Group (1) watched the film when they were 4-years-old or when it first came out, went in their pants, and then childishly force the biased idea that it's THE scariest movie of all time into the heads of everyone who is even a mild horror fan. Because of nostalgia, they ignore the fact that Halloween is just a generic killer-in-the-house movie, even in its time, and place it high above anything and everything that has come out in the horror genre afterward. It doesn't matter how original or intelligent a modern horror movie is, in their mind, by God, it can't touch Halloween. Funny, though, if you ask them ""Why?"", they can never answer you. Group (2) watched the film in their teen years, thought in the back of their heads that Halloween was nothing special, but gave it perfect scores out of pure respect and duty. Group (3) is rare, but it's the few who saw it recently and genuinely thought it was a superior film, without being biased by positive scores. Group (4), which I include myself in, is completely middle-ground. They realize the most of the film is nothing special, but there are enough cool elements to keep them from saying its pure crap.<br/><br/>The reason I bring up the fans is because it's a subject that no one really wants to talk about, but a subject that is very important when analyzing the film. With millions of ""Perfect!"" opinions beating down on you, honestly realizing the mediocrity of Halloween isn't an easy thing to write in a review.<br/><br/>The main reason Halloween isn't as great as it's hyped to be is the core story. A juggernaut killer kills. Point blank: it's generic, unoriginal, and just downright boring, even in its time. As citation, the year before Halloween came out, Stephen King expressed in an introduction that he was sick of ""generic killers"" and that he could ""write this in"" his ""sleep"". (Note: This was not in response to Halloween or any other movie, but his personal feelings.) When I look at Halloween as a story and as a story alone, I cannot give it any credit whatsoever. It's pathetic. It's painfully unoriginal. Much more complex and original horror stories were told in the '70s. For one, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ('74). Another, Alien ('79). Another, The Shining novel ('77). Another, Carrie ('76). Halloween, in comparison to its peers, is just primitive in the way of plot, and that's the main reason I cannot give it a higher score. Some inaccurately credit it for starting the slasher sub-genre, but because it didn't, I can't even give it story credit for that.<br/><br/>However, the reason I don't dismiss the movie as a total waste of time is because of the atmosphere and directing. John Carpenter doesn't quite reach the perfection here with these two elements that he later reached with The Thing, but it's still impossible to ignore how superior they are in Halloween. The opening sequence with Michael as a child is absolutely brilliant. It pays homage to Black Christmas ('74) by doing a first-person view of the killer, then takes it even further with a third-person view afterward. The Halloween night atmosphere isn't quite done to absolute nostalgic perfection, but it's done better than any other movie I've seen. The camera angles, the reveals of the killer, the shadowed faces—all clichés to us now, but this was the movie where most of them originated. And it did all of this without cheese. This aria is where Halloween deserves its credit.<br/><br/>With that said, Halloween really isn't scary at all unless you grew up with it. Even in its time, it was a generic killer-in-the-house film, and, as I've read some reviews state, it wasn't scary even on its release night. As for gore, I'm not even sure I saw a single drop of blood in the entire film, and that got a little cheesy. The acting is also borderline cheesy at points, but nothing too distracting. What is distracting, however, is the lack of action for most of the screen time does get very boring. It is obvious Carpenter is trying to make up care for the characters by showing up drawn-out bits of their lives, but that doesn't work because they're all just cardboard, personality-less people. Halloween does get boring.<br/><br/>I never write reviews based on my respect of a film, but rather on my view of a film. Halloween deserves the credit it receives. I won't deny that. What I will deny is that this is the scariest movie of all time, or even one of them. What I will deny is that this is the be-all-end-all horror movie, because there are far more intelligent and original horror movies out there. What I will deny is that Halloween is the ascension to heaven that the brainwashed fanboys make it out to be.<br/><br/>3/10"

","Halloween (1978) was good. I that much out of it as I had hoped,the reputation of the film being really out there and had a good story. I thought it was a fun Halloween slasher movie and I do think that you should watch this movie before something like Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street and definitely watch it before Scream. With all the backstory behind it like how the budget was $300,000 and the actor bought their own clothes, I was expecting something above-average, and I guess that's what I got it was a tad bit disappointing though so let's get into that.<br/><br/>First the good things. The character Dynamics I really enjoyed. I like how Jamie Lee Curtis's friends do drugs and she doesn't smoke like how they do. I like Donald Pleasence as the doctor who took care of Michael Myers for 15 years. I like the concept of Michael Myers, he's kind of like Darth Vader except not as super-powered. I like the cinematography and the music used in this film. I also enjoyed how the filmmakers knew when to use the music and what not to like in the Dark Knight. The opening credits are cool with the pumpkins slowly revealing itself using them. I think the cheapness of the phone actually kind of helps it in terms of anesthetic makes it look more gritty the scary than it would with a big-budget 100 million dollar movie. Interior of a movie you watched during Halloween really fun and it's really good you can watch it with friends or if your mom and dad is really cool they watch that kind of stuff with you.<br/><br/>Now for some of the problems I had with it. That last line was a good segue into this one. As a Halloween movie I enjoyed it, but as an actual film it didn't really have an effect on me or surprise me and anyway. Some of the acting from the kids and Jamie Lee Curtis' friends is really bad. Michael Myers wasn't as scary as I had hoped. And I guess people just built this movie up too much and the point where it got disappointing when I watched it.<br/><br/>The reason I gave it a 7/10 was because of prison been some of the tropes of horror movies maybe you should all of them and it was really entertaining. Good definitely outweighs the bad. No Masterpiece Though."

"Natheer","8","3","5","31 October 2011"," A Good Film
","This is my first time to see the movie after 3 decades since its release, I always thought that Halloween would be no different film than the other slasher films like the Friday 13th series, which i saw during the 80s, so I had never been interested to see Halloween. Last night this impression was proofed to be wrong, the first thing I liked about this film unlike the other films, that the film takes its time to prepare the viewer for the story, good film making is always about putting the viewer in the right mood and atmosphere, John Carpenter managed to let us feel the peaceful neighborhood atmosphere, watching Laurie walking to the school through the neighborhood and again with her girlfriends back from the school and showing the beautiful surroundings and seeing the gentle wind blowing through the window in her room with its calm colors, all of that prepare the audience well to the coming shock, the shock is achieved from the contrast between the peaceful neighborhood settings and the evil that is represented by Michael Myers, Myers character is not represented here as a supernatural monster like the other slasher films, he is a deeply troubled person since childhood, and just like PSYCHO the source of horror is generated because we come face to face with the dark side of the human mind and behavior and not because of gore and violence. The transition between the daylight and the night was done beautifully in a Hitchcockian style, Laurie and her friend Annie drove in the evening to reach the houses where they will babysit the kids. This transition sets the mood for the shock coming with advent of night. This style of filmmaking is rare commodity these days where everything on screen happens very fast and doesn't give the viewer the proper time to indulge himself in the story. I rate this film 4 out of 5."

","Arguably the first Senseless Knife-Kill flick; arguably the first ""serial murder"" movie mislabeled as ""horror""; arguably the only movie to ever use a Captain Kirk mask to scare people. Intentionally rather than accidentally.<br/><br/>HALLOWEEN is historical; like Friday THE 13TH and a handful of seminal horror movies that spawned an unstoppable tide of sequels, it has entered into world consciousness. Unlike Friday THE 13TH and many of those other seminal horror ""classics,"" HALLOWEEN is actually a reasonably good movie.<br/><br/>After all, John Carpenter writes and directs. And HALLOWEEN features two actual actors in its leading roles: Donald Pleasance, who intimidated everyone with his experience and British accent, and Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature film debut, disguising her striking man-features with a luscious mop of brown locks and displaying a conviction and commitment to her pear-shaped bellbottoms that outshone all her idiotic teen co-stars.<br/><br/>HALLOWEEN has nothing to do with the American-celebrated night of October 31st, Hallows Eve; it's just a nice night to kill teenagers having sex.<br/><br/>15 years ago, young Michael Myers in a clown mask knifed his sister and was sent to a mental institution, where he was treated by psychiatrist, Dr. Loomis (Pleasence). An adult now, Myers escapes, with Loomis hot on his trail, tracking him to the tree-lined suburb of Haddonfield, Illinois, his old home.<br/><br/>In the script, Myers was known only as The Shape, as Steadicams portrayed his Point-Of-View, Carpenter not allowing us many clear views of the psychopath whom Loomis describes as ""pure evil"" - which is a simple way of getting out of any real character motivation. It's the movie version of ""Because I said so."" So Myers can kill anyone at any time for any reason - because he's Pure Evil, see? The stoic flesh-colored mask he wears is actually a spraypainted Captain Kirk mask - ahh, now that's Pure Evil.<br/><br/>Myers stalks Lori (Curtis) for no reason (maybe cos he's ""Pure Evil""), until Halloween night when he starts killing teens in his hometown for no reason. Even Lori's ultimate Running and Screaming relationship with Myers only comes about because he kills her bad actor teen friends across the road and she investigates in her pear bellbottoms.<br/><br/>In the late 70s, in theaters across the nation, HALLOWEEN's iconic, chilling music guaranteed girlfriends would be grabbing their dates in the dark, instead of the other way round, and I'm sure the jump-scares gave teen boys valid reason to spill sodas over their date's bra-less blouses. And offer to wash them back at his place...<br/><br/>Kids, have you learned nothing from this movie? Teen sex could get you killed.

","I'll be the first to admit that I don't like slasher films. They are all so similar and unoriginal, and also spawn hoards of ridiculous sequels that will spatter the audience with meaningless gore.<br/><br/>However....<br/><br/>Halloween is the original modern slasher film, and it is unbelievably scary. What makes it scary is inevitability. The shots are designed to make the audience feel Myers' presence even though we can't see him. We are also intimately acquainted with Myers after the opening sequence of the film, a long tracking shot of Myers' first murder from his perspective. Just the sound of his breathing alone is enough for the audience to understand his relentlessness and insanity. We know he will always be there, just out of frame. One of the creepiest things about this film is how much of it takes place from his visual perspective. He is a voyeur, and it puts us in a very uncomfortable place when we share his vision.<br/><br/>Personally, I think one of the scariest moments in the film is when Jamie's character sees him on the sidewalk DURING THE DAY. He's there and then gone, and she thinks she imagined it. The fact that he's not hindered by the openness of operating in sunlight is another testament to his relentless nature. There are other moments similar to this one throughout the film which are used to ratchet up the tension. The murders themselves are proceeded by well placed small details that clue the audience in, but the characters never notice, leaving us held in suspense.<br/><br/>This is a well crafted film made with almost no money, proof that a person with intelligence can make a good movie without a huge budget. There are a large number of films that try to imitate the style and success of Carpenter's Halloween, but they don't come close."

"army91","7","3","5","2 September 2007"," An honorable achievement in atmospheric horror in spite of its flaws
","Looking back at Halloween after a series of intermittently passable and utterly distasteful sequels, one may lose an objective sense of the methods by which it was created, and really how good it is.<br/><br/>Being introduced to a boy so consumed by an indescribably untainted and dangerous evil that he is able to remorselessly kill at an age meant to comprise innocence raises many questions. Firstly, how did this evil ever begin to flourish? Where did it come from and how? What gives it the strength to disallow the contaminated being to speak, but instead gives it the power to destroy his family? In future years and subsequent theatricalizations of ""The Shape"", the audience and the filmmakers alike sought to answer these questions. But now, twenty-nine years after the iconic killer was conceived, people still realize that some evils are not meant to be explored. They are supposed to remain mysterious.<br/><br/>That is what allows for the films greatness. From the commencement of the simple yet piercing and shrill noises that compose the music of this film, the mystery becomes enshrouded in shock and becomes completely enigmatic as a young woman is ruthlessly murdered by her six year old brother. The only dialogue encompassing the event is a few insignificant sentences irrelevant to the utter horror about to commence.<br/><br/>Over the years, the doctor doing his duty becomes compassionate and obsessed to save the people from what he believes only his own mind can conceive. There is an evil that has escaped and it aims to destroy the lives of young teenagers and over an hour and a half period he stalks them, becoming more and more evident until the unknown deaths become known and The Shape has reached his target. But as we become aware that this evil is immortal, even the good doctor, Loomis, is shocked and quizically looks out into the night. His omniscience is then consumed by the thought that the evil will never stop.<br/><br/>Halloween was based upon a simple atmospheric premise. There was no need for a high body count or excessive gore. While an adept horror director can use such elements to his advantage, Carpenter did the converse in not so much a brilliant way, but in an adequate way.<br/><br/>It would not be so bold for me to say that this movie is overrated, because it most certainly is. It takes a basic observation of what scares people to craft a thriller out of simplicity. The sharp and abrupt music in a dark setting that was simply made scary due to a lack of film quality. The atmosphere of this movie can much be attributed to a lack of quality that inadvertently made positive contributions.<br/><br/>The heroine does not need to be excessively developed and we get all the imagery we need to realize that she is a simple embodiment of innocence that will face torment and disaster in the face of relentless terror. While her friends may not be as likable and visibly innocent, they effectively add to the idea that benevolence and youth are of no significance to cold and thoughtless destruction.<br/><br/>This film can't take all the glory from the genre and it isn't unmatchable. Some sequels posed worthy executions and characters to follow in the footsteps. As the franchise progresses, we realize that the simplicity of the antagonist, conceived out of simple atmosphere and hated through empathy for his innocent victims, has allowed for so many additional entries that while being able to succeed on their own, have not mastered the same art that Carpenter created in 1978.<br/><br/>7/10"

Other than the death scenes, the film pretty much bores me.  But for those who haven't seen it before, it'll be a much more fun ride.  John Carpenter did a fine job at directing, especially on a low budget and scaring audiences with the absence of gratuitous gore.  The score, composed by Carpenter, still gives me chills.  Along with ""The Exorcist"" theme, there has never been a scarier theme song to a horror movie.  It's still creepy when you sit in a dark room and watch the opening credits with the theme playing over the image of a flaming Jack-O-Lantern.  However, as I watch the film more and more, I notice more and more flaws.  For example, the plot is pretty thin and the characters are uninteresting, except for Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis.  The dialogue is bland, and (with the exception of Pleasance, Jamie Lee Curtis and Charles Cyphers) the acting is bad.  But as a horror movie, it works out well.  The cinematography is great, and there are some signature shots that lend inspiration to many aspiring horror directors. The opening tracking shot with Michael Myers (as a boy) murdering his sister is a classic.

She sounded like she is pretending and mourning in joy instead of in pain and fear, the scene looked so fake that its hard to take it movie seriously from this point on.<br/><br/>The rest is basically a boring fest, people walking from places to places and Michael killing 3 more people in same poorly filmed scenes, the acting in the kill scenes are actually funny rather then scary."

","...I thought the movie was hilarious! I only watch horror movies occasionally. The Ring was disturbing and Alien, Jurassic Park, The Conjuring were good IMHO. New Evil Dead was stupid as heck. So that gives you some idea about my preferences.<br/><br/>I got a chance to watch Halloween on Halloween 2013 (it's 35th anniversary) in Cinerama and I figured why not. It IS a classic after all, why pass up the chance to watch it on big screen?<br/><br/>Maybe I'm just too used to newer movies (I do like old films - 12 Angry Men, Godfather movies, GBU, Once Upon..,even Cleopatra), but I thought this movie did not work for me as a horror at all. There is no development of Michael Myers as to why he's that evil and why he is after our protagonist. The story might continue in Halloween II but I'm never gonna watch it. Even if I take the evilness for granted, I find it hard to believe that he can appear/disappear from anywhere at his will, learn to drive like an expert after 15 years in captivity, become unconscious and conscious like a robot AND nothing can kill him when even a 6 years old can kill an adult with a couple of awkward slashes. Then we have our heroine who never bothers to check whether he's dead or alive and keeps leaving the butcher knife (and herself) close to him. <br/><br/>I confess that the heavy breathing was probably effective in 1978 but to me it just sounded funny. The score, though nice, never really connected - there would be ominous music so many times in the movie for no reason. And when he does appear, it's not all that scary. Again, maybe it was back when it came out. One part that was disturbing was babysitters allowing others to have sex in their employer's house and two characters talking about ripping a child's clothes off. Ugh!<br/><br/>Now to the fun part - late 70's low budget fun! Clueless inspector who doesn't smell weed out of a hitherto airtight car? Agrees to stay on duty for a doctor he doesn't believe? Girls getting naked or half-naked for no reason? Nobody calls the police in the entire movie (except 1 try), even after suspecting murder(s)? And the BEST part - a sex scene that lasts 10 seconds and the girl goes - FANTASTIC!! I expected to come out of the theater scared, and I came out smiling. SMILING! I guess I better stop."
"daggersineyes","2","6","14","1 September 2013"," Not great
","Hmmmm this was very disappointing. I watched this movie back to back with the original Black Christmas hoping to be thoroughly entertained by two classics of the genre. I was only half right. I have to say the lesser known and criminally under-rated BC walks all over Halloween which sadly didn't live up to the hype. Black Christmas has a far more interesting screenplay with some very lively and interesting characters, some deliberately humorous moments, a great non-intrusive but suspense- heightening score and an intriguing premise of telling you nothing at all about the villain. You don't even see him. HW was originally intended as a sequel (prequel?) to BC and I suspect Carpenter was trying to flesh out the villain's character and explain his behaviour. What he failed to understand is that it was the very fact that there was no explanation for the killer in BC and no way to identify with him that made the killer so intriguing & scary. This lame back-story of Michael Myers doesn't add a thing to the suspense, in fact it diminishes it even more because the back-story is silly and thin. A complex & interesting back story might have worked but replacing the eery mystery of BC's killer with a half-a**ed background was a mistake.<br/><br/>Both movies have pretty bad acting but that's a product of the times. JLC was marginally better than her ridiculous co-stars but no better than anyone in BC. Mind you, she didn't have much to work with given the script for HW is one of the lamest horror scripts I've encountered.<br/><br/>There were some very neat camera shots here and Carpenter plays with texture and lighting well in his direction but it wasn't enough to make this movie a genuine classic (regardless of how many people think it is - emporer's new clothes n all that!!) He kept some of the clever plot techniques and camera work from BC, thank goodness, including the POV shots from the killer (but we lost those half way through along with the intrigue) and the nasty phone calls (altho this wasn't used anywhere near enough or as successfully as it was in BC). But there was no humour or interesting characters in Halloween. Just a bunch of boring teenagers doing boring things and some wholly uninteresting children.<br/><br/>Also the ending made no sense whatsoever. You can't have things both ways. If you're going to write a lame back-story that explains that the killer is a just some psycho bloke who killed his sister - ie HUMAN - then you can't have him surviving so many fatal attacks. It's just plain ridiculous. If they'd kept the killer a mystery as BC did then they could get away with that ending. As it stands though it just felt trite and contrived - with sequels in mind rather than a good creative conclusion.<br/><br/>Anyway, I gave it 2 points for the great camera shots/bits they kept from BC and recommend it ONLY to people who are interested in the history of horror movies - it's a relic but don't expect it to be as good as people are deluding themselves into thinking it is. Watch Black Christmas (the original with a young Margot Kidder as a wise-cracking drunk!!) instead. It's far more entertaining AND it's the very beginning of slasher flicks as a genre."

","HALLOWEEN <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br/><br/>Sound format: Mono<br/><br/>Fifteen years after he was institutionalized as a child for murdering his sister, psychotic Michael Myers escapes from custody and returns to his home town on Halloween, where he stalks and kills a group of teenage babysitters.<br/><br/>Dismissed by many critics on its original release as a routine quickie with few redeeming features, this low-budget shocker - director John Carpenter's follow-up to another cult favorite, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976) - established its reputation via word-of-mouth at a time when movies could sustain a prolonged release schedule, and it finally emerged as one of the most successful independent productions of the 1970's. Aided immeasurably by Dean Cundey's expansive scope photography - his autumnal color schemes and deep, deep shadows suggest a feature-length extension of the similarly-styled Halloween sequence in MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS (1944) - and an unforgettable music score (composed by the director himself), Carpenter's film is stronger on mood than narrative, and builds slowly - too slowly, for some - toward a climactic set-piece in which the killer pursues his final victim.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence toplines an impressive cast (in a role turned down by Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing, amongst others!) as an obsessive doctor who arrives in small-town America to convince local authorities that 'boogeyman' Michael Myers is nothing less than Evil Incarnate, while second-billed Jamie Lee Curtis - a little too old to be playing a frightened high-schooler - acts up a storm as the vulnerable heroine targeted for destruction by an unstoppable killer; her climactic face-off with 'The Shape' is a technical tour de force. An exercise in relentless terror for some viewers, an overrated bore for others, HALLOWEEN has nevertheless withstood the test of time, and its influence on the modern horror genre is undeniable. Followed by HALLOWEEN II (1981) and a host of increasingly lackluster sequels, until the franchise was dusted off and revitalized for a whole new generation in Steve Miner's impressive entry, HALLOWEEN H20: 20 YEARS LATER (1998)."

"Cineanalyst","9","2","3","31 October 2018"," The Beat of the Stalker's Gaze
","Even for one who isn't a fan of the slasher sub-genre, I appreciate something as well made as this progenitor, ""Halloween."" Director, co-writer and scorer John Carpenter and team pay homage to some of the right horror films to precede it, too, including playing ""The Thing from Another World"" (1951), which Carpenter would remake a few years later, and ""Forbidden Planet"" (1956) on the TVs--two other monster movies of seemingly unstoppable evil creatures. Moreover, there's the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in the central role (even though the doctor standing in for the detective part receives top billing), the daughter of Janet Leigh, the star of ""Psycho"" (1960), which is often cited as the first slasher film. Like Bernard Herrmann's score for ""Psycho,"" Carpenter's one here has become one of the most iconic in horror film--or even general cinematic--history, and it's largely responsible for much of the picture's tension--beginning as the screen is black, even before the picture appears on screen.<br/><br/>The role of the camera in conjunction with the monstrous Michael Myers is remarkable, too. Usually in film studies classes when the ""male gaze"" is discussed, including in Laura Mulvey's seminal essay ""Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema,"" it's illustrated by the films of Alfred Hitchcock, although probably most often with ""Rear Window"" (1954) and ""Vertigo"" (1958), but ""Psycho"" would work about as well with the peeping-Tom antics of Norman Bates and, perhaps, ""Halloween"" would be even better. Cinema is a voyeuristic art form, primarily concerned with the spectator's gaze upon its visuals, which consequently rely for their effect on the spectator's identification with the surrogate gaze of the camera, which in turn may be identified with the gaze of a certain character--in this case, mostly with the knife-wielding serial killer, Myers. Indeed, he's merely acting out what we voyeuristically came to the film to see: him terrifying and killing people. In the opening scene, the camera and the eyes of Myers are one in the form of an extended point-of-view shot. From there, he continues to stalk his prey--sharing with us the pleasure of watching them. Meanwhile, his face is mostly covered by a mask, which like the spectator, prevents the gaze of other characters upon him and, likewise, us.<br/><br/>Mulvey and her followers get into a lot of Freudian psychobabble, but there's undeniably a psycho-sexual element to the gaze of Myers. There's the by-now cliché plot of his killing promiscuous, mostly female teens--all of which seems to stem back to his simultaneous incestuous desire for and repulsion of his sister. I'm sure any Freudian would also say that the knife is a phallic object, penetrating the victims. Then, there's the virginal heroine, with the story spending quite a bit of time on establishing this fact, who, nonetheless, seems to be paying for the sins of her mother's character in ""Psycho."" More interesting than that, though, methinks, is the playing around with the thrill of voyeurism, via the gaze of Myers, while also experiencing the unease of being gazed upon, which is mostly associated with the Laurie character played by Curtis. One effect to come from these switches from identification with Michael to that of Laurie is the jump scare. If little else, subsequent slasher filmmakers grasped the effectiveness of this trick and, perhaps, too much so. But, it's effective here because it occupies that space between the pleasure and horror of the gaze, all of which is underscored by the terrific beat."

","I will never forget this my mom was in the hospital for minor surgery and my dad had to take me and 2 of my friends to the movie, he's was going to buy our tickets and leave , being we were only 12 at the time the ticket guy said he would have to go in and boy was he mad! But as soon as the previews started he bolted and we strapped in for the ride of our young lives. I was a HUGE movie buff at such a young age, especially scary movies which they were called back in the day now know as Horror or slasher movies because of this one film. There was no digital computers, no huge budget, just a masterpiece of a movie unleashed on millions of people that now consider themselves Horror movie junkies that were now unbenounced to us getting ready to watch the GODFATHER of all slasher movies, I affectionately call the GOAT (greatest of all time). Teenagers nowadays say it isn't that scary because there was no internet or computers at the time, we were lucky in a way back then, we were seeing something not seen before just virgins of Horror, but let me tell you after that movie impacted my life, well I mean in the movie junkie way I am now. I've seen every horror movie over the last 40 years good or bad (not really into the sci-fi horror) more into the slasher movie that could actually happen in ""real"" life. And this my friends is the best and the music score of Halloween is down right awesome and will never be repeated though every since 1978 everyone and everybody has tried (Friday 13th, Nightmare on ES,) good in their on way will never match the impact the way HALLOWEEN did for the Slasher-Horror genre in a small town named Haddonfield, Ill. with Michael Meyers did for this wide eyed 12 year old in a small theater so many years ago. I write this review eagerly anticipating OCT 18th for the new release of HALLOWEEN 2018, and I will take my own wide eyed little son and I assure I'm not leaving the theater til it's over!"
"azathothpwiggins","10","2","3","13 September 2018"," Trick Or Treat, Or else...
","Director, John Carpenter's horror masterpiece, HALLOWEEN is a relentlessly terrifying, almost mystical experience. I still jump whenever Michael appears! The story is basic: As a young boy, Michael Myers murders his older sister, and spends fifteen years in a mental institution. Upon escaping, he heads for his hometown of Haddonfield Illinois, w/ the obsessed Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) on his trail. Meanwhile, teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) prepares for a boring Halloween night of babysitting. Unbeknownst to her or her friends (Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles), Michael has zeroed in on them for reasons he alone knows. An evening of deadly terror unfolds. This is low-budget, independent film-making at its best! Carpenter creates a claustrophobic, suburban nightmare world, where Michael roams the quiet streets like an invisible automaton. In this movie, he is simply evil, w/ no need of explanation. He's a shadow, a ghost, a murdering spirit. Laurie is his polar opposite, seemingly drawing Michael to herself by some unknown magnetism. Carpenter uses fate / destiny to bring about the inevitable meeting of these two forces. Absolutely packed w/ classic sequences, this movie re-invented the ""stalking maniac"", making him a near-immortal juggernaut on a singular mission of doom. Among the best films of its genre... P.S.- Special mention must be made of Carpenter's theme music, which is so simple, yet so perfectly haunting and unnerving!..."

","John Carpenter's 1978 slasher horror film is a cult classic which is equally enjoyable today as it was in the 70's. Its Halloween night and teenagers on a quiet suburban neighbourhood are stalked and brutally murdered by Michael Myers, a former problem child who lived in the area until he stabbed his older sister to death. After 15 years incarcerated in an institute he escapes and heads home to a town which has nearly forgotten him and moved on. Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance), the doctor who was assigned to him throughout his incarceration, is the sole torch bearer to warn the town about the evil about to strike them. When nobody believes him and there's only a hesitant sheriff ready to lend a hand, is it too late for the teens that Michael has targeted?<br/><br/>Written and Directed by John Carpenter this low-budget film surpasses a mass of other horror films subtly creating tension and fear using some classic techniques rather than a wash of fake blood and gore. Even 40 years later, some multimillion dollar films can't get close to this film and could certainly learn a lesson or ten from it. <br/><br/>The plot is pretty much 'no thrills' and simple, which is something that modern films could learn a lot from. Start with a good idea, expand it, work with it, and stick to it. There's no need for the multiple confusing twists and turns that some modern films use for their own downfall. Acting is great, in fairness the main focal points are Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance, but they both come off as convincing. Other actors carry themselves off well too, but they are the supporting cast for a reason, which they do a fine job of, supporting the continuality of the film and acting as the 'other' gut to the Curtis and Pleasance character arcs.<br/><br/>Mise-en-scene is top notch throughout, and it's this, with the accompanying haunting score, which really amps up the fear factor. Parallels have to be made to other greats of film history for what Carpenter has done her. Take Hitchcock for example, some of the lighting and framing of shots which appear in Halloween are reminiscent of scene's in Hitchcock classics like Psycho, where the ordinary and mundane can look frightful with the right lighting from the right angle. <br/><br/>The audience is invited to follow some innocent teens, in part lead by Jamie Lee-Curtis in her acting premier, as they experience terror they weren't ready for. Although they act as a vehicle for the film, the audience gets a voyeuristic experience from clever camera shots framed to be the killer's point of view too. Positioning the audience as occasional killer, occasional victim, gives us a level of additional knowledge which intelligently makes us feel cleverer than the victims, while we are only a moment away from experiencing the same scare and shock as the victim when Carpenter turns our expectations around. There are times where you could literally shout at the screen to warn the victims before the knife lands its ripping blow, only to be toyed with, with it either not happened as we expected, or for doubt to creep in and it actually does happen. <br/><br/>This is a true masterpiece of cinema and really helped to reinvent and define a genre. It's spawned hundreds of copy-cat films, some decent (and some not-so) sequels and it's even been rebooted in the last ten years - still, this original version of Halloween from 1978 I as good today as it was when it was released. <br/><br/>I could write about this film all day long, I have before for a dissertation, so keeping my review on this short is painful and challenging. Hopefully I've captured a few key points to put across how highly I rate this film. I never award a film 10 out of 10 because I'm a tight Yorkshire man and feel that 10 would be perfection. There are some goofs in this which didn't need to be, I forgive them and feel it adds character and humanity to the film rather than detract from the ride. I'd absolutely give this 9 out of 10 - which is the highest I rate films on IMDB. You will not be disappointed."

"RforFilm","6","2","3","16 November 2017"," Despite having some great moments (cast, music, and a scary monster), Halloween as a movie is overrated.
","We're going back to 1978 to one of the original slashers, Halloween. This is a movie that has not only continued to be a constant watch around the autumn season, but has inspired several imitators hoping to capture that same success. I can't blame them as Halloween was made on a very low budget (it might have been lower then John Carpenter's first film Assault on Precinct 13), yet generated a major profit. You have to give it credit that while it was not the first slasher movie ever, it was the first to be centered around Halloween. <br/><br/>What's interesting is despite the spooky surrounding of the holiday, Halloween was the first to set a horror story on that day. I think that similar to why we don't see Christmas settings in horror stories, Halloween too has a sense on innocence that even represents a right of passage with most children with trick or treating, watching scary movies, and of course, carving pumpkins. Having a dark character like Michael Myers suddenly come into the fold takes away the intentional fun scare to make way for the true scares. So is Halloween the classic that everyone says it is? Welllet's look at the story.<br/><br/>After a very suspenseful opening that shows a young Michael Myers murdering his older sister, he is sent to a mental hospital where his doctor Samuel Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) looks to keep him there as he says ""I saw nothing but evil in his eyes"". One evening before Halloween, Loomis sees that several inmates have escaped, including Michael Myers, who has stolen a car to make his way home to Haddonfield, Illinois. <br/><br/>In that same town on the same block, teenager Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) is getting ready for a typical night of babysitting her neighbors child Tommy while her friends are going to do the same. But unlike her friends like Lynda, Annie and Bob who want to make it a night of romance, Laurie is single, and thus more focused on being Tommy's friends and making it a nice Halloween. But once the sun sets and the jack o lanterns light up, Myers has made up a costume from a boiler suit and a mask and is heading back to his old neighborhood where Laurie is.<br/><br/>People are constantly phrasing Halloween as the essential John Carpenter film and one of the greatest horror movies of all time. I'm sorry, but I find Halloween overrated. Is it bad? No, not at all. In fact there are some great elements. Speaking of which, let's get into the atmosphere. The beginning, which is all shown through Michael's perspective, is a masterpiece in horror staging and setting the mood to let you know that this kid isn't turning back. He will come out deranged. The rest of the time, you only see him with that mask, giving him the same idea that was occurring with Street Thunder in Assault on Precinct 13; that he's a force rather then a person. <br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is perfect as Laurie, with a combined sense of tension along with a bookish look that makes her the best choice for this kind of teenager. Donald Pleasance is often regarded with playing the authority figure, but few point out that he has that same sense of unpredictability and crazy that would have rubbed off given his job of watching Michael Myers. It's too bad that aside from the three leads, I found non of the other characters, even the child actors, that convincing. Laurie's friends especially only seem to exist to give the movie a longer running time.<br/><br/>It probably has to do with the script, which aside from some good lines and setup, is not that good. If you listen to the way the teens talk, they seem too dumb for the sake of the plot. Even the adult characters just seem like stock cops and stock teachers that may have given this movie more depth. Without it, your stuck knowing whose very likely to get axed off while we wait patiently for Michael to eventually get to Laurie. <br/><br/>Even the way this movie is shot is mixed. Many of the night shots seem clumsy and rushed which I can understand some of the reasoning (there are great moments with the way Michael Myers enters through the dark), but creates an lazy look when compared to how dark was shot in later John Carpenter films. I'd say that out of the things he did for the movie, John Carpenter's score may be the best as it is chilling and of course, has a memorable synth sound that would be his trademark. <br/><br/>I'll give this six Michael Myers masks out of ten. The setup and situation seems ready to go, but I really wanted better characters out of the teens and a bit more unpredictability with the plot. Wouldn't it have been more interesting if one of the kids had gotten killed? At least there are a lot of elements that can make it entertaining in some areas. This is one horror movie I don't come back to that often, but I understand why a lot do. Take a look and see if this is one Halloween worth celebrating."

You know it isn't that great of a movie when I prefer the remake, Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers and Halloween Resurrection! In fact the only Halloween film (not counting Season of the Witch) I consider worst is Rob Zombie's Halloween II (2009). The deaths in this movie are too tame and it's kinda boring. I did get a few laughs but it doesn't make up the fact that this movie isn't that great. Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael himself, the plot and the music is the only reason it gets a 5. A story can have no story and still be a good movie or at least in my opinion. The sad thing is that Scooby Doo on Zombie Island is a better horror film then Halloween (1978) will ever be! It's not the worst horror film I've seen but I can grantee that this movie is not a movie I have to rewatch anymore and I've seen it three times. This really doesn't deserve the hype it gets. It's just a uninteresting film. To me a horror film can be good yet not scary yet this is neither good nor scary."

Micheal Myers is no doubt one of the pentacle peaks of slasher characters. His emotionless mask as he murders baby sisters is just so Menacing. Likewise to Jason, he doesn't speak. Just kills. Laurie is such a great female lead for this film as well. She carries the film just as well as micheal does. The actors do a great job, especially Jamie lee Curtis. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie if you haven't already."

","The powerful effect of the original Halloween is even more potent today than ever after a bunch of entertaining but misguided sequels and goofy rip offs. Although it seems very basic it's been impossible to replicate with the same effect. The timeless horror tale of innocent young women that are stalked by an escaped mental patient on the title holiday is atmospheric and gorgeously filmed setting the standard for the slasher film. Jamie Lee Curtis is layered and likable as Laurie and Michael is a looming, dread inducing presence. John Carpenter's ultimate masterpiece is truly a perfect film and one of my all time favorites."

"Fella_shibby","10","1","1","3 November 2019"," Everything has already been said about this classic n ther seems to be lil left to say but as a fan of horror films, lemme contribute by praising how good this film is.
","I first saw this in the mid 80s on a vhs. It did scared me then. The mask, the music, the knife, the empty suburban area, the absence of parents, found all these things truly terrifying.
Saw it again in the mid 2000 on a dvd which i own.
Revisited it few days back (Oct 2019).<br/><br/>On Halloween night a six year old kid stabs his older sister to death. Was it cos she did fornication or the kid possessed or the kid simply a psychopath?
New generation fellas watching this film in today's time may find it difficult to digest that how can a six year old stab a grown up. Pure evil may be.
After spending fifteen years inside a sanitarium, without talking to anybody for fifteen years, the now grown up insane fella escapes by stealing a car. Even his psychiatrist (Donald Pleasance) thinks maybe the doctors must have taught him to drive. Pure evil maybe.
Our psycho returns to his hometown to buy a mask, a knife n to desecrate his sister's grave. He visits his now abandoned home. He carries his sister's tombstone so that he can place it next to a victim's body.
He starts killing promiscuous girls n boys n goes on a rampage with his unique mask n knife, until he comes face to face with a sexually repressed girl (Jamie Lee Curtis) who unleashes her energy.<br/><br/>This film is without a doubt a very influential film within the horror genre and shud be seen by lovers of horror films.
The music by Carpenter is a character itself in this classic horror film.
The greenery in the suburbs is so soothing man."
"truemythmedia","9","1","1","31 October 2019"," It's Pretty Great
","For years now, I've frequently used ""Halloween"" as a prime example of an overrated movie; in fact, I'm sure if you scoured TMM's reviews you'd find at least a half-dozen references to my lukewarm reaction to seeing this film. I was so unimpressed with this film the first time that I saw it that it had been years since I'd seen it (probably since High School), but during those years, my knowledge of horror films exploded. Now a seasoned vet of the genre, I've watched dozens of psychological horror flicks (""Rosemary's Baby""), giallo films (""Deep Red""), splatter movies stuffed with gallons of gore (""The Evil Dead""), cheap slasher movies (""Seed of Chucky""), and of course, the classics (""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining""). My taste in horror had branched out, and I've found that I really can enjoy almost anything the genre has to offer; if it's great, I get scared- if it's terrible, I get to laugh. After watching a few other John Carpenter films at the beginning of the month (""In the Mouth of Madness"", ""The Fog""), I found that I appreciated his style a bit more than I had when I first watched ""Halloween"", and I figured maybe this year was the year I needed to give Carpenter's best-reviewed flick another chance. (Plus, with the new 4K release I figured I could see how that looked.)<br/><br/>I'm happy I did revisit this film. I still don't think that ""Halloween"" is an incredibly horrifying movie, but I also don't think it's as overrated as I used to think it was. ""Halloween"" is a simple but effective thriller with a villain that is pretty frightening, but really, the film is more of a fun experience during the actual viewing than it is a film that lingers in the viewer's mind afterwards. I, personally, prefer my horror to keep me awake at night and second-guess what might be standing in the corner (like those incredibly disturbing final shots of ""The Witch""). ""Halloween"" is the equivalent of paying to go through a haunted house: you get your moneys worth, but more than being truly terrified, you'll be laughing in spite of yourself."
"TheEoghShow","6","1","1","30 October 2019"," Dr. Loomis ruins it for me.
","I like this movie enough, but Dr. Loomis is... not among my favourite movie characters. I could already do without a character who's only purpose is to repeat the exact same exposition every 10 to 15 minutes (seriously, why?), but what's even worse is that these scenes actually bring down the rest of the movie for me. All of the best scenes are the ones that treat Michael Myers as a mysterious stalker who's motives and intent are unclear, but thanks to Dr. Loomis, I already know exactly who he is and exactly what he's up to. In my opinion, all of the context we needed was in the opening scene, and once it was over they should have left it at that."

","On my annual re-watch of John Carpenter's Halloween, I changed the settings to black & white and it was absolutely stunning. The monochrome fills you with dread. I'd recommend everybody to watch this classic in black and white on their next rewatch. ðŸŽƒ ðŸ”ª"
"ChristianLeFeuvre","8","1","1","28 October 2019"," It's a classic
","Halloween was released in 1978 and was made on an extremely low budget, about $300,000 (which even back then was extremely low).
It has since become almost a cultural phenomenon.
Directed magnificently by John Carpenter, Halloween is about Michael Myers, who in the opening scene set in 1963, murders his sister. The film then jumps to the present and we get to meet Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) a young college student who is very unlike her two friends, she doesn't like smoking and she isn't having sex. As I said, this is unlike her two friends who are having lots of sex and end up being the main victims of the movie. This actually began the horror movie trope of the people having sex being the ones who got killed of first, and the young 'clean living' virginal character outsmarting the villain and surviving to the end.
It's also here in the present time (1978) that a now-grown Michael Myers, escapes a mental institution and his doctor, Sam Loomis (played by Donald Pleasence) sets out hunting him down before he can kill too many people.
This is a stunningly directed movie. Subtle hints of menace, backgrounds out of focus, the brilliant use of the shadows. It could have been so much cheesier and have less of an impact had it been in different hands. On paper, it is an incredibly simple premise, but Carpenter elevated it into the classic it has become.
The iconic music, which was composed and performed by Carpenter himself, and the mask Michael wears are now almost as recognisable as the 'Jaws' theme or Darth Vader's mask.
Ok, this isn't by any means a 'perfect' movie, the acting isn't great....at all, and the best actor and the best performance in the whole movie comes from Pleasence. His speech about how he saw 'pure evil' in Myers' eyes is the best part of the film. Jamie Lee Curtis is, mostly, fine throughout, maybe a little whiny and over the top, in fact, Curtis was apparently horrified by her performance until Carpenter told her she did a good job.
Apart from that, the thing that stands out for me about the film is its core theme, I don't mean a 'slasher' movie, I mean it examines 'evil', how 'evil' can affect somebody and allow that 'evil' to take over their life. This for me is the fascinating aspect of the character of Myers and what drives him to do what he does.
This is a terrific movie and it is a fun watch on Halloween night. It is visually great, the score is amazing and it has become a timeless classic for those reasons.
I guess that today's generation will probably find it quite dated, and not as gory as they have become accustomed to, but for me, it is for this reason it is such a 'must-see' movie.
This is the movie that started the genre of a long list of imitators.
I like this film a lot."

","Halloween is exactly what you hope to see! I watched it today for the first time and I was surprised that it was actually very good!<br/><br/>Expecting screaming, over the top and poor acting and stupid script, Halloween turned out to be a bit of that, but only to the extent that you get what you want. The acting by some of the teenagers are very stocky and almost like ""Now it's my line..."", ""...and now it's my line"" etc. and a lot of the stuff gets no explanation, but now more than 40 years after Halloween premiered this works to its favor.<br/><br/>The music is excellent and has a theme that is recognizable. Jamie Lee Curtis does a fantastic role as the Main Character and since she's only 19 years old in this her first ever movie she is very good! The Villain Michael Myers is a creepy stalker and never talks which builds the mystery of his character. The suspense is of course really well done and I like how they work with the psychological aspects more than jump scares or the actual slashing - Well done!<br/><br/>Halloween is a perfect example of how less is more and is today a cozy horror movie with a classic feel that delivers exactly what you want. Now when Halloween is coming up it's the best time of the year to watch it."

"Becks_Hush","8","1","1","30 January 2019"," Halloween (1978): A Perennial Classic
","The perennial classic. The film that kicked sluggers back into gear and gave the genre a boost. The idea recarved years on by Mr Zombie and the one everyone knows even if they are not a horror fan.<br/><br/>Any reviews that exist for Halloween are by the dozen. Everyone tends to have an opinion and are not shy in expressing it.<br/><br/>There are copious reviews that cover it and certainly on every individual horror site that exists - in a way that makes it hard to write a review that hasn't been done before and probably to greater effect but it doesn't hurt to try!<br/><br/>Halloween is, on its own merits, a great effective chiller with strong performances across the board and a fun final twist that still is adapted and used today.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Michael Myers, a disturbed child, on a stormy, gloomy night kills his sister in a frenzy of blood and is promptly put away. Years on he escapes and makes his way to Haddonfield where Laurie and her friends are anticipating Halloween. Only this year the screams will be their own...<br/><br/>Jamie Curtis Lee, what can be said... this was her moment without doubt; one of the defining points of her career. And yes she plays it to beautiful, undercut effect.<br/><br/>As the shy, residing and intelligent soul from High School she's never too obvious, never too reclusive and because of this Curtis creates one of the best female antagonists in horror. Someone who becomes stronger and more self assured as the film builds and equally someone we genuinely will to survive. Curtis does not disappoint.<br/><br/>By the same stroke Dr Loomis played finely by Donald Pleasance is one of my favourite characters in this film. There's no overbearing nature to Loomis yet he's sharp eyed, quick witted and very personable.<br/><br/>His genuine concern feels honest which means you worry that something COULD happen to him and that's why Pleasance does a blinding job with the role.<br/><br/>In spite of the 18 certificate the gore, blood is not that prominent. More closer styled to Psycho in this regard than the more overt splatter fests we've seen.<br/><br/>Anything you do see happens by the shadow of night so we fill the blanks with our own fervent imagination<br/><br/>Actually I like the lack of any visible blood, a lot of films rely too heavily on the gore and scale back on story whereas Halloween combines both elements succinctly and that's something to be cherished.<br/><br/>Having spoken of many aspects; acting, story... I'd be remiss to ignore one of the most beloved aspects: the score! Always enjoyed, often emulated, never bettered.<br/><br/>It's partway creepy, that kind tickle of the ivory in the background, a treat to the ears. Even now the subtle beauty of the score can still make goosebumps shudder against our skin, that's how simple and powerful it is.<br/><br/>There's a real reason this film has stood the test of time: the characters are likeable, the story is simple and paced gorgeously and of course the now iconic...<br/><br/>Michael Myers. That soulless mask with no visible expression but one and the slow, confident walk toward his victims with no fear of what's to come, how easy it is to see why he earned a space beside Jason, Freddy in the horror annuls.<br/><br/>To anyone new to the genre, Halloween is one I'd highly recommend not least because it's a subtle film that uses suspense, tension to maximum effect. If you want Hitchcockian style thrills rather than the usual blood, guts and glory this fulfills that need perfectly.<br/><br/>It's effective, chilling; storytelling with soul accompanied by a truly unsettling score, Carpenter proving why he is and always will be a visionary in this field.<br/><br/>For a true slice of a real slasher, watch this. A gem."

","John Carpenter's legendary classic still hasn't lost any of its charm or suspense over the last four decades. The movie's elements come together very nicely, from a crisp screenplay to likable actors and characters to several tense moments, but this movie's real power lies in its music and atmosphere. Carpenter nails the carnival-like excitement of Halloween night extremely well, gradually but effectively reaching its pulse-pounding climax like a well-oiled suspense machine. Jamie Lee Curtis makes for an unusual and extremely likable lead here, and she shares notable chemistry with everyone on screen."

"cinemawithcj","10","1","1","1 December 2018"," Halloween - Cinema with CJ Review
","Halloween (1978) is another classic I've recently retread, and while you can probably guess the ending of this review, let's talk about getting there.<br/><br/>John Carpenter directed, co-wrote, and scored a legitimately fantastic movie. It's one of those cases where the term ""genre-defining"" is actually applicable. Following the footsteps of films like Psycho and Peeping Tom a generation behind it, Halloween is the birth of the modern slasher movie. You can try and say it's other flicks like Black Christmas, but Halloween stands ahead of them all. Hell, it's the one most of you know the name of. It's bolstered by the birth of the scream queen herself, Jamie Lee Curtis (and yes, obligatory mention of her being the daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh), who in turn has since enjoyed a long career that sometimes brings her back to the franchise that first introduced her, but let's not talk about those...(except for Terminator 2-starring-Laurie Strode, Halloween 2018)<br/><br/>Halloween is full of great indie horror filmmaking, all the way down to filming at summer in California and having to paint bags of leaves brown for shots. Whether it's the simple but effective main theme over an ominous Jack-O-Lantern, the brilliant POV opening, the slow-burn storytelling, the omnipresent creepiness of Mike Myers, the Hitchcockian suspense and it's other influences, or just the dozens of other elements, Halloween is a perfectly constructed movie that has maintained its effectiveness over 40 years, and will continue to for many more."
"A-G-Deac","10","1","1","2 November 2018"," Historically significant and more...
","The horror genre is full of significant low-budged movies, and maybe John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" represents the most important one of all.<br/><br/>The film, famous for popularizing the Slasher subgenre after defining it, might seem outdated to some viewers, but that's an unfair judgement considering the impact it had on cinema. Very few Slasher movies came close to the quality of Carpenter's classic, and that's more than admirable considering the film's original budget of only 300,000 dollars.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" was definitely inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", but don't let yourself be fooled by this statement. ""Halloween"" is highly original (or was, back in 1978) and has enough to offer. The camera work is brilliant; the way it presents us the little town of Haddonfield as a peaceful place haunted by the unfortunate events of the past is more than enoguh to set the mood for the storm that's about to come. The cast is capable and delivers the terror in a realistic, believable way (something rarely met in the Slasher movies which spawned years later). We meet the beautiful Jamie Lee Curtis (the daughter of ""Psycho"" star Janet Leigh) , a then-unknown actress, in a role which marked one of the most important moments in horror.<br/><br/>Some dialogues might seem silly for modern standards, but they do not affect the final product (and they might seem pretty good compared to dialogues met in other films such as the original ""The Evil Dead"" and ""Friday The 13th"").<br/><br/>The music, composed by Carpenter himself, contains one of the most iconic movie themes of all time. I don't think anyone who has already watched the movie could imagine it with a different kind of soundtrack. Carpenter's compositions are brilliant through their simplicity, proving that the secret to a great movie is knowing when -not- to use music and rely on silence.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie is probably the main element that puts it in a different category than it's followers. The fear of evil and the awareness of it's presence in the everyday life is terrifying enough to make ""Halloween"" one of the greatest horror films of all time, and maybe more."

"moviemattb","10","1","1","14 October 2018"," A Classic 70s Slasher Flick
","Before there was Jason Voorhees, Freddy Krueger, Ghostface, and among others; there was Michael Myers, an unstoppable evil, who stalks and lurks its victims. And wears a William Shatner. LOL! In all seriousness, ""Halloween,"" tells the story about Michael Myers on what happened 15 years earlier into the movie. He kills his own sister, and gets himself to be in hospital. Flash forward to 1978, Michael Myers escapes and goes into Haddonfield, Illinois by killing some victims around Halloween night. I first saw this movie on AMC, which is probably during its Fear Fest (if I remember correctly), and thought it was pretty darn good. I was so drawn in of the psychological aspects of Michael Myers as what Dr. Sam Loomis describes him, where there was a scene that Loomis explains the Sheriff about Michael Myers, when he first met him as a six years old with a blank, cold emotionless face, and the blackest eyes, the devil's eyes. That is all you need to know. His character perfectly sums up how evil Michael Myers is, and definetly what makes him into an icon. Donald Pleasence does an amazing job for the role that he was born to play, and he is Sam Loomis. Its funny to know that Carpenter uses that name from a classic Hitchcock movie ""Psycho,"" and the character of Sam Loomis was played by John Gavin. Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of Janet Leigh, makes her debut as an actress, and really does a real good job as Laurie Strode, the girl next door. We start off from her not being strong into a strong character. The rest of the cast like P.J. Soles, Nancy Kyes, and others all did well for what they were given. John Carpenter is a gifted filmmaker, and was more than good as he is terrific for writing the script alongside with Debra Hill; then he was terrific for directing and creating an iconic musical score. The cinematography by Dean Cundey is marvelous, and really do love the looks of the film's visual. The atmosphere itself is very moody, and does give you the feel of Halloween. The premise is superb, and never I find it boring. The movie doesn't have that much gore like what you see in other horror movies, but it works well without it. I don't know what is left to say about ""Halloween,"" except that its a classic 70s slasher flick, and it could be my favorite Carpenter movie. I believe it is. I love ""Halloween,"" and I give it a 10 out of 10. Be careful or the boogeyman is going to get you."

It tells an intriguing story that leaves you wanting more. This movie is old (1978) and despite that it stills manages to scare the audience and in creative ways, it perfectly uses the shadows to hide the horror from the film, making you doubt if you're even safe in your own house at night. The acting is also very pleasuring, using a cast formed by teens and kids. The main protagonist expresses herself perfectly in every situation and the kids manage to act naturally and without exaggerating like most kids do in movies.

Jamie Lee Curtis is also great as a likable, brave ""scream queen"", determined to protect the two children she babysits. (I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU QUIT NOW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MASTERPIECE.

"a_chinn","9","1","1","14 July 2018"," The REAL originator of the modern day slasher film
","There are a number of films that have been credited as the progenitor of the modern day slasher film. ""Psycho,"" Italian Giallo films, and 70s's exploitation films like ""The Town that Dreaded Sundown,"" ""Black Christmas,"" or ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" are all often cited as early examples of slasher films, but it's really John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" that set the formula of the unstoppable killer dispensing with hapless oversexed teens. Those other films all had elements of the slasher film formula, but ""Halloween"" is the one that cemented the slasher film genre tropes (including but not limited to the final girl, don't have sex, and the masked emotionless killer). Set in the fictional everytown American city of Haddonfield, Illinois, the story takes place on Halloween night 15 years after the horrific murders by a young boy named Michael Myers. Myers (simply referred to in the credits as ""The Shape"") escapes from the mental institution where he's been housed since childhood to come back home with unprovoked murder on his mind. Jamie Lee Curtis (the real-life daughter of Psycho's Janet Leigh in her film debut) and her group of gal pals (including P.J. Soles) are babysitting and fooling around with their boyfriends on Hallows eve when Myers begins his rack up a body count. The story is lean and efficient, but it's Carpenter's masterful building of suspense that makes this films such a classic. Instead of relying on cheap scares and gratuitous violence (there's actually very little blood or graphic violence), Carpenter takes the time to develop his characters and to take the time to build suspense (Carpenter once derided jump scares, saying anyone can do that. Just run a hundred frames black and then insert one white frame with a loud noise and the audience will jump.) This focus on character and suspense elevates ""Halloween"" compared to most of it's ilk. Also worth noting is Nick Castle's performance as The Shape, giving an eerie performance that's better than you'd expect. On a side note, Castle went on to co-write ""Escape from New York"" with Carpenter and to also direct the very underrated comedy ""Major Payne."" Most slasher film simply cast a stuntman in these types of roles, but Castle brings something special to Myers (wearing what is actually a Captain James T. Kirk rubber mask sprayed white, with the eyebrows and sideburns removed). Many may discount Castle's performance and contribution to the film, but as fans of the Friday the 13th films know, Kane Hodder is by far the best of all the actors to play Jason Voorhees. Besides the excellent suspense and the frightening emotionless killer, Carpenter's score is the final crucial element that makes this film so memorable and such a horror classic. Carpenter's synthesizer heavy score is eerie, jarring, and terrifying all at once. Two of these three elements will be part of the 2018 Halloween sequel/reboot (Nick Castle returning as The Shape and Carpenter returning to score the film) and I'm hopeful the suspense will equal Carpenter's masterful touch. Subsequent sequels where Carpenter was not involved (part 4 onward) relied more on routine slasher violence and didn't bother to build much suspense, which was the downfall of the franchise, along with an overly complicated and ridiculous backstory for Myters (although I will say I was a fan of Rob Zombie's reboot films). Donald Pleasence as Myers' twitchy and terrified psychiatrist is also a standout in the film. Carpenter's also inserts all sorts of fun film nerd inside jokes throughout the picture, particularly if you're a fan of Howard Hawks films. Overall, ""Halloween"" is arguably THE most influential film on modern day horror cinema and although it's pacing can be slow and almost meandering at times, once it revs up, it's a suspenseful thrill ride that holds up to this day. FUN FACT! Donald Pleasence told John Carpenter the main reason he took the part of Dr. Loomis was because his daughter, who was a musician, loved Carpenter's score for his previous film, ""Assault on Precinct 13."""

","I first saw this classic when I was thirteen years old at my Grandma and Papa's house. It didn't scare me, because I know that all of the storylines are make believe. Today however, I get worried that there's someone like Michael Myers who isn't in a normal mindset and might go on a killing spree. This picture is amazing, it has scares and a simple story that even a ten year old could follow. Everyone should own this film on DVD or Blu-Ray. This is one film that you shouldn't miss. This is just as good as Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 horror film, Psycho, and having Jamie Lee Curtis in the film was an excellent choice by John Carpenter himself, who at first wanted someone else for the roll of Laurie Strode. I also think that the mask that Michael Myers wears is terrifying and that Irwin Yablans was indeed completely wrong about it not be scary, as he shared on the <br/><br/>Halloween (1978) documentary, which is now available to watch on YouTube. The film has a great supporting cast and a great teamwork ethic by bringing in Debra Hill to colloberate with him on the film. I think that Moustapha Akkad should've been more supportive about the film. $300,000.00 today is extremely expensive. I don't see why even back then you couldn't have made a simple horror film like this one. It's a fantastic film, the style and the look of the film, even when the opening titles play on the screen in the beginning, sets the tone for an amazing horror film. Sadly after Halloween II in 1981 it all went down hill and everything was just to make money. I am hoping that horror fans will help end this franchise this Halloween with the new Halloween film coming out (October of 2018) <br/><br/>For and from overall rating I give Halloween (1978) <br/><br/>A BOMBING 10 STARS<br/><br/>WHAT AN AMAZING FILM!"

","So I'm going to be marathoning the Halloween movies leading up to David Gordon Green's new incarnation coming out later this year. John Carpenter's original classic Halloween, still erupts with fright and terror even after all these years. Directed with mastery and suspenseful as hell, Halloween's story of supernatural character Michael Myers's reign of bloodshed is undoubtedly legendary. (Verdict: A)"
"grantmayberry","10","1","1","31 August 2017"," Still one of the best slashers
","Is it any wonder why Halloween is considered a classic? This film will soon be thirty years old, and it remains, for me at least, the gold standard for slasher movies.<br/><br/>While most slashers made since this one focus heavily on gore and cheap scares, director John Carpenter creates an atmosphere of tension and dread. In fact, you don't actually see a lot of blood and guts, since the surprisingly small number of deaths are blanketed in shadow. And the iconic music, first heard during the opening credits, will always bring a sense of building fear in your mind.<br/><br/>The acting for this movie is superb. Jamie Lee Curtis' performance as Laurie Strode combined vulnerability with resourcefulness to make a likable heroine, and helped define the ""final girl"" archetype for future generations. And Donald Pleasence brings a great deal of sophistication to the film as Dr. Sam Loomis, who acts as the killer's unintentional hype man as he warns others of his great evil.<br/><br/>Of course, what makes this film is the character of Michael Myers, listed in the credits as ""The Shape."" Future films in the series turned him into a lumbering Jason-clone, but he is far from that in his original appearance. Myers is no mindless monster, but a clever hunter who stalks and kills without mercy or blunder. And his mask, an altered Captain Kirk face, leaves a haunting image.<br/><br/>Few films of the genre have come close to the standards that this film set, and likely few ever will. Hopefully future filmmakers will take inspiration from the techniques of this film rather than relying on gore for cheap shock value. Until then, we'll always have the original Halloween to enjoy."

","Among horror movies released during the 1970s, Halloween became the most profitable and the most popular of that time. Directed by John Carpenter, who made his debut with Dark Star, Halloween takes place around the sacred Holiday and tells the story of Mike Myers, a serial killer who first kills his sister then escapes from prison and goes after a rampage before getting to his next target, Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis in her first major role. Donald Pleasance plays the cop who helps Laurie escape from the Shape, yet at the end he survives, leaving the possibility of a sequel, which didn't outgross the original yet it's the best of the Halloween sequels. I first saw this movie on VHS from blockbuster and enjoyed the music, terror, and suspense of this movie. I then bought the movie on two tape VHS from Anchor Bay for its 25th anniversary with the movie in its scope ratio plus extra features. I then saw the other Halloween movies and the first one is always the best, with H2 and h20 being close. Rob Zombie's version was OK but not great and his sequel failed to live up to the magic of H2."

Much more complex than average slashers writing. In Halloween, the serial killer is not just a deranged person who kills. He is a true embodiment of pure evil, an entity that simply refuses to die. Moreover, Carpenter underlines the almost disturbing calm of the suburbs. Even if there is a matter of life and death, the neighbors will remain indifferent.They will simply close the grille.

"Krug Stillo","9","1","1","1 July 2003"," The Slasher Movie that Taught the Rules
","SPOILERS AHEAD...<br/><br/>Inspired by Hitchcock's classic Psycho (1960), Dario Argento's giallo shockers, Bob Clarke's 1974 hit, Black Christmas and a morbid fascination with the supernatural, John Carpenter created what is ultimately one of the most successful independently made horror films of all time. Despite its lack of backing the film looks glorious with its dreamy camera movement within the panavision frame. Definitely one of the greatest Slasher movies of all time, which still influences filmmakers 25 years later.<br/><br/>At the tender age of 8, Michael Myers brutally stabs his sister for over indulging in a heavy petting session with her boyfriend. He is commented only to escape 20 years later to stalk the promiscuous teens of his old town until he is supposedly defeated by the hard studying virgin of the baby sitter group, Lourie Strode (a young Jamie Lee Curtis).<br/><br/>The story seems simple and straight forward but Carpenter, already famous for his classics Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Dark Star (1974), mixes elements of the supernatural, tales of an urban bogeyman and places it all in the harmless location of the suburbs. There are also may references to Psycho, granddaddy of the Salsher genre  frequent point of view shots, casting Janet Lee's daughter as the lead and Donald's Pleasence's character is named after John Gavin's storekeeperetc.  <br/><br/>Debra Hill and John Carpenter worked as partners for further projects, including The Fog (1980), Escape From New York (1981) and Escape From LA. Unfortunately they were only involved with the first sequel that continues immediately where the original ends. Seeing the lucrative opportunity to imitate and profit with low budgets, many leapt on the Slasher bandwagon. Perfunctorily, Halloween was followed by many sequels, the third not having anything to do with the other entries."
"richard-wheeler","10","1","1","28 June 2003"," Trick or Treat!!!
","This sure was a trick or treat movie, nobody gave Michael Myers a treat, he gave them all a trick , and they all died! And here is a great review for all you reviewers out there!<br/><br/>On the 31st of October 1963, Judith Myers' (Sandy Johnson) boyfriend (David Kyle) left and little Michael (Will Sandon)entered the house from around the back, put on the clown mask which he found in the bathroom, entered Judith's room and he murdered her with a knife from the kitchen's drawer from under the counter. And when he went outside, his parent's arrived and when they whipped off Michael's mask, they stared! <br/><br/>At Smith's Grove on the 30th of October 1978, Michael appeared on top of Mr.Loomis's (Donald Pleasence) car while he was out and he grabbed the nurse who was inside the car by the hair, she shot out and Michael got in. Michael had escaped from the clinic he was kept in since he was 6. It was creepy to hear that he hadn't spoken a word in 15 years! And on the 31st of October 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) had to lock the house up because her dad was planning on selling it and then, Michael appeared inside the house. And everywhere Laurie went , she saw the stolen police car and it followed her everywhere. And after school that day, Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews) was being teased by kids that the ""Boogey Man"" was going to get him. And when they were done, one of the kids bumped into him. That's right,kid! Don't speak about the Boogey man or he'll come!!<br/><br/>Soon, Loomis warned the police of Haddonfield on the phone that Michael was coming. And not very far away from him lay a body. It gets SPOOKIER! And when Laurie and her friend Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) were walking down a sidewalk, Laurie caught sight of Michael from behind a nearby bush. And when she got home and she was about to close the windows, she saw Michael again. And this time, he was standing at the washing line. And when she turned around and she looked again, Michael vanished. Hmm. Michael sure was fast. And when Loomis visited the Graveyard Keeper (Arthur Malet), the Graveyard Keeper showed Loomis that Judith Myers' grave stone went missing. Loomis knew that he was getting warmer.<br/><br/>Later, Annie and Laurie arrived at a scene at a Hardware Store, Mr. Brackett (Annie's dad) said that a rope, a mask, some tools and a few knives were stolen. And Mr.Brackett thought it must've been kids. Nope! it wasn't. And soon, Loomis and a cop searched for Michael in his house and when they entered Judith's bedroom, Loomis told the cop about Myers. And what Loomis said must've given very viewer the eeriest sensation! And suddenly! A stone crashed in through the window. But the cop knew no kid would come near the house because, every kid on the block thought the house was haunted.<br/><br/>Later that night, Michael visited Annie's house and her dog Lester went absolutely crazy! And when Laurie was looking after a boy named Bob Simms (John Michael Grahm) opened the blind and he saw Michael standing outside Annie's house. And not so soon, Michael starngled Lester and appeared outside the washing room while Annie was washing her clothes. And when Annie got into her car, she noticed water vapour on her car's windscreen and Michael shot up from the backseat and he strangled her. And soon, Toomy saw Michael carrying Annie's body into her home. And he went frantic and his friend, Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) too!<br/><br/>And when Lynda VanDerclork (P.J Soles) and her boyfriend Paul stayed at Annie's house because they thought she had gone for the evening. And when they were having sex in Annie's bedroom, Michael's shadow moved by. And when Paul went to go get a beer, he opened the door to the kitchen, Michael shot out, Michael strangled Paul and silently stabbed him. And then, he went upstairs dressed up as a ghost and he attacked Lynda with an extension cord. <br/><br/>Later, Laurie believed what Tommy said and she went into Annie's house while the kids were asleep. And when Laurie entered Annie's bedroom, she saw Annie lying on her bed with her deceased sister's grave stone towering over Annie. And she discovered Paul hanging upside down in the closet and Lyda lying dead in it! And Michael creepily appeared and he cut Laurie down her arm and she fell off the inside balcony. Ooh! It was quite a fall. And now, Laurie believed that the Boogey man existed. And everyone who Laurie tried to get help from dismissed all this drama as a prank. And finally, Laurie safely got into her house.<br/><br/>At the end of this movie,I shat myself!When Laurie was in her house, she discovered her phone was dead and the curtain from behind her was flapping. Laurie got her knitting needle ready and when Michael popped up, Laurie stabbed him with it! And she then told the kids to hide upstairs and she went and hid in the closet and Michael broke into the closet. And finally, Loomis came to the rescue when Michael tried to strangle Laurie and Loomis shot Michael until he went over the balcony. And when Loomis saw Micgael's body on the ground, he looked away, and then he turned around, Michael Myers had vanished!<br/><br/>No one moved his body, he got up and ran and nobody knew where he ran to!!!!!!!!!!!! But it seemed that he returned to his old residence. And Laurie in the end couldn't believe that monster was her brother! And didn't blame to cry with fear, I would do the same thing. That was HORRIFIC!"

"Mattswife97","10","1","1","15 June 2003"," The movie that started it all basically
","OMG, what a classic horror movie Halloween was, which basically started it all.  This movie is about the boogeyman aka Michael Meyers who butchers his sister when he was a little kid. Years later on the day before Halloween Dr. Loomis and a nurse goes to the mental hospital to pick Meyers up to take him to a different city for court.  When they get there they realize that a whole bunch of crazies are roaming around on the grounds unsupervised. While Dr. Loomis is out of the car on the phone talking to the hospital, Meyers gets on top of the car and attacks the nurse till she gets out and surrenders the car.  He then drives away in the car. The next day Dr. Loomis drives to Haddonfield which is Michael's hometown to try to stop the evil from killing.  Halloween day Laurie Strode keeps thinking she sees Michael Meyers but doesn't think anything about it.  Later on that night she is baby-sitting Tommy Doyle while her friend Annie (who's dad is a cop) baby-sat a girl, I forgot her name in the movie but her real name is Kyle, right across the street. Annie's boyfriend calls and wants her to pick him up so they can have sex so she takes the girl across the street so Laurie can watch them both and goes back to get into her car but realizes the car is locked. So she goes into the house and gets the keys and when she gets back to the car she just opens the door forgetting it was locked in the first place. She gets in the car and realizes that the windows are all fogged up. Michael Meyers pops up from the back seat and strangles her then slits her throat. Of course if she wasn't stupid enough to park in the back seat in the first place somebody would have heard her honking the horn. Later on the other friend played by P.J. Soles and her boyfriend comes to the house where Annie was sitting at and they go to the bedroom to have sex. After sex the boyfriend goes downstairs to get a beer.  Why he wasn't smart enough to turn on a light is beyond me.   There he encounters Michael Meyers where he gets impaled into the wall with a knife.  He then goes upstairs to kill the girlfriend by strangling her while she is on the phone talking to Laurie.  Laurie starts to get suspicious and scared so she tries calling back and gets no answer.  She then goes across the street to the house and there she discovers all her friends are dead. Michael Meyers then jumps out and attacks Laurie, who then falls down the stairs.  She breaks the back door to get out and screams for help with no avail. She runs back to the Doyle's house and gets into the house. Michael climbs through the window and hides behind the couch.  All you hear is his loud breathing through his white Halloween mask.  Laurie stabs him with a long sewing needle and thinks he is dead.   She runs upstairs and talks to the kids. Michael then comes upstairs so she has the kids lock themselves in the room and runs to the master bedroom. She opens the door that leads outside and then runs into the closet.  For all who wonder why she did that...would she be a responsible baby-sitter if she left the house with a killer inside and leave the kids alone? Don't think so. She hid in the closet and when Meyers started to chop the door down she grabs a hanger and stabs him with it. A little far fetched true but it got the job done.  She then goes to the kids and tells them to run out the Mackenzie's house and get some help. While the kids are outside screaming Michael sits up and gets up and walks to Laurie and attacks her again. Dr. Loomis notices the kids and runs into the house and shoot him till he falls out of the window.  When he runs out to see if he is dead or not guess what??? He's not there. He got up and walked away. A good classic recommended on Halloween night. But get the extended version."

Never has a scary movie succeeded in making me afraid of the dark, taking notice to little noises outside and always from now on checking my back seat of my car until I saw Halloween.  Michael Myers is definately one creepy guy and I think his mask will haunt me forever. The music is another thing, its so simple but yet so terrifying.  One thing that makes me like Halloween more is that is didnt try to be like another movie, sure we had The Exorcist, Psycho, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre but Michael Myers came onto screen with a whole new look on movie villians which led to many more trying their hardest to live up to him, like Jason.

","(***** out of *****)<br/><br/>Maybe not technically the first, but nonetheless, the granddaddy of all slasher films.  This is short on plot (a kid who murdered his sister on Halloween night breaks out of the asylum seven years later and returns to his hometown to kill some more -- that's it), but long on style.  Carpenter knows just how to create an atmosphere of fear and tension by mere suggestion, mainly through excellent use of shadows and lighting, widescreen framing, and that infamously creepy keyboard music (created by Carpenter, himself).  This isn't so much your typical movie with an intricate plot and well-developed characters as it is a full-sensory experience that should be studied as a text book on how to make horror films.  Indestructible `boogeyman' Michael Myers still reigns supreme over all imitators, and Jamie Lee Curtis is the definitive 70s/early-'80s scream queen.  Donald Pleasance plays the not-entirely-sane-himself doctor in pursuit of Michael, and Nancy Loomis (""The Fog"") and P. J. Soles (""Rock n' Roll High School"") -- whatever happened to them? -- also star in this monumental indie classic.  The first sequel's not bad, but avoid the rest.<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHT (AND Possible Spoiler):  `It was the boogeyman, wasn't it?'  `As a matter of fact, it was.'  Cue the missing body, riddled only seconds ago with bullets and left for dead on the front lawn, and the creepy music, and you have the perfect shocker ending."

Most movies take parts of this movie and have added it to their own.  I think that the music is one of the true elements of this movie that makes it as scary as it is.  And that Micheal Myers was a scary dude with that Capt. Kirk mask on and why in the world would John Carpenter use that stupid Capt. Kirk mask?  Maybe he should have used another mask like a clown or something or the mask used in the beginning of the movie.  Imagine Micheal chasing Laurie around with that on?  I loved ever character that played in this movie except the nurse which thank God her role was short. The death scenes were bizare especially Annie's which was the creepiest.  PJ Soles death was a little lame and cheezy with her just lying there in a closet and Bobs death was a little puzzling; how did Micheal get him off that door to get him dangling like that?

"rwsaxon2","Null","1","1","28 April 2003"," Slasher Genesis or Homage to Hitchcock?
","WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!<br/><br/> That's like telling someone that Rosebud is a sled.  I think we all see it coming.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, about the film.<br/><br/>Budgets and shoestrings and making the most out of what you have with which to work aside, this is a good film.  That's from a film appreciation perspective, mind you.  For a film that is often described (with varying degrees of accuracy) as the genesis of the slasher genre, one should notice that conspicuous by its absence is blood.  There is some blood, but not a lot.  Rather, Carpenter seems to have used the classic techniques of Hitchcock.  One of these techniques that seems to get far too much criticism from a jaded and ignorant modern audience is the use of the expected. Carpenter often puts the shock exactly where you expect it to be and this does nothing to diminish that shock.  Rather it allows the tension to build and release like a bow string.  Consider also the use of the false shock. Carpenter again uses a favorite technique of Hitch; the build up to the obvious shock only to be let off with humor or a minor shock.  In so doing, the director creates a web of emotional connection akin to the conductor of a symphony.<br/><br/>And speaking of symphonies, how about the use of music.  Legend has it that before Carpenter created the score for the film it was screened at the studio and was not scary.  Yet with the assiduous use of the ubiquitous score, Carpenter cues the viewer as to what emotion to experience and when to do so.<br/><br/>Consider the motives of our villain.  Done.  None.  None that we are allowed to know (unless you have read the novelization of the movie, which is a good work in its own right, but would have muddled the movie.  However, elements of the novelization seem to have worked their way into later Halloween efforts) and that is a good thing.  Fear of the unknown, the unknowable, is perhaps one of the most primal of all our human emotions.  What we are not told we will fill in for ourselves and the only limit is our own imagination and experience.  So we have a film that used shadow play and silence, music and emotion, and most importantly, perceived violence vice overt violence.<br/><br/>Again we see the skill of the Master when we think we see Jamie Lee Curtis's mother naked and stabbed seemingly endlessly in a shower when in fact we never see a blade enter flesh.  Perception.  The question left to be answered by the individual's psyche ""What did I just see happen?"" is the key to good horror in this particular sub-genre.  The principles of Hitchcock are used to great effect in this work.  Made in 1978 the film may seem a bit dated, but the basic concepts are not.  A force seemingly without reason fulfilling its own agenda.  Relentless.  Merciless.  Faceless.  Striking from the shadows and the dark corners of the mind.  The precise location Carpenter puts you with this film by forcing the viewer to fill in the intentional gaps.  A good film all around and deserving of the term ""classic""."

The one thing I notice about this movie was Micheal Myers didn't necessarily go after children but after the adults and teenagers. Then came two years later Friday the 13th (1980) with another maniac killing off another batch of teens. But this time the movie takes place at a camp site. Throughout the 80s Halloween,Friday the 13th,and A nightmare on elm street became popular to movie goers because of its sequels. There were also numerous type of other slasher films like Silent Night Deadly Night (1984),Sleepaway Camp (1983) and  variously other low-budget horror movies that wasn't really a box-office smash. By the early 90s slasher films started to fade away due to it's tiring predictable scenes. Then revived in the mid 90s with ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer.""

I can't for the other ones, after Ressurection. I liked all of the Halloween movies, but I like Halloween, Halloween 2, and Halloween 4 the return of Michael Myers the most. I don't really have a reason why, except I liked them. I think Jamie Lee Curtis was a good actress in the Halloween movies and all the other movies she played in.I also think that Donald Pleasence rocked. It was awesome when he always said the word EVIL, and I can't forget to say that MICHAEL MYERS is the coolest dude ever. I would really hope to own all of the movies, and play him in a movie or in a haunted house. Because he is the coolest. In my opinion anyways. If i had to rate Halloween from a scale of 1 to 10. It would definitly would be a 10. An that goes with all the other Halloween movies. But the third would have to be 5. Because I and I think some other people did not really like it that much. Well I just have one more thing to say before I go............ HAPPY HALLOWEEN"
"B-and-y","10","1","1","23 February 2003"," Simply a great slasher
","Halloween is a great film! It is probably the most influential film of modern horror films. It even created a whole new genre of horror films: the slasher film. Director John Carpenter delivers a superb directing (as always) and lead actors Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis are great in creating a unique atmosphere. Another point is the music. It is so simple and yet so scary and efficient. Who doesn't remember the melody? To everybody who hasn't seen it yet I recommend to rent it immediately. You won't regret it! 10 out of 10!"

I also think a final Halloween should be made forget Busta Ryhmes, its Laurie Strode v Michael to end the sags once and for all."
"MadReviewer","8","1","1","28 August 2001"," The Template For The Modern Slasher Film
","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" still stands out today as the best horror slasher film of all time, and it's certainly still the standard that all other slasher films copy shamelessly.  To be fair, ""Halloween"" isn't exactly a paragon of originality -- it borrows heavily from Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"", and a  number of the later Universal ""Frankenstein"" flicks, where the Frankenstein monster wandered aimlessly through castle corridors trying to kill people -- but it's the first film to distill all the elements of the slasher genre into a lean, mean core.  Other slasher films since ""Halloween"" have tinkered around with the elements of this core, trying to improve upon it . . . but so far, none of these other contenders and pretenders have come close to succeeding.   Despite its distinct low-budget look, ""Halloween"", by far, is still the most chilling, scary slasher film ever made. <br/><br/>
""Halloween"" features a very simple but well-done story: Years ago, on a fateful Halloween night, a young boy named Michael Myers puts on a rubber mask and savagely kills his sister with a butcher's knife. Michael is shipped off to a psychiatric facility, where is diagnosed as a sociopath -- an emotionless killer with no concept of right or wrong.  For fifteen years, he's held and studied there . . . until again, on a Halloween night, he manages to escape from captivity. He heads back to his hometown with a new mask and a new knife, ready to begin a brand-new killing spree back in his unsuspecting hometown . . .<br/><br/>Written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, ""Halloween"" works so well mainly because it keeps all details to a minimum.  No motivation is provided for WHY Michael Myers is a bloodthirsty knife-wielding maniac, but then again, one isn't needed.  The film works just fine with the basic fact that Michael Myers is an evil killing machine.  The same goes for the teenage characters/victims in ""Halloween"", particularly the character of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) -- these characters are developed just enough for the audience to get to know them, and more importantly, get to sympathize with them.  Once the audience starts thinking of the characters as genuine, likable people -- BAM.  Michael Myers shows up in full-on death mode, making the audience care about what actually happens to these terrorized characters.  It's a great technique for building fear and suspense, one that John Carpenter pulls off perfectly . . . . and one that's been lost with more recent slasher films.  Nobody cares if the Killer Du Jour of ""Generic Slasher Film"" starts butchering the unlikable characters, because the audience doesn't care if the unlikable characters die. With ""Halloween"", the audience cares, which is one of the reasons why it's such a good film.<br/><br/>
Another technique used by Carpenter that gets overlooked today is how the story moves along at such a rapid-fire pace.  ""Halloween"" takes place in a single night, with Michael Myers moving and killing at a relentless pace. Sure, the other characters do dumb things -- sometimes, they make it almost entirely too convenient for Michael Myers to slit their throats -- but at least the stupidity is plausible, simply because neither they nor the audience is given time to think about what's happening.  The characters don't have time for logic; they're running instead on pure animal instinct, and that instinct is often wrong.  Compare that to later drivel like ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", where the characters essentially wait around their hometown for weeks, waiting to be picked off by a knife-wielding maniac . . . stupid.  Those characters had time to think and to properly assess their situation.  The characters in ""Halloween"" aren't given the luxury of time, making their panic and irrational behavior all the more believable -- and making the film all the more terrifying.<br/><br/>There's other items as well that set ""Halloween"" apart from all other slasher movies, or at least mark it as an original -- Carpenter's claustrophobic use of Steadicam to give the film a nervous, uneasy edge; the fact that ""Halloween"" lacks a sense of humor and treats its story with deadly seriousness, unlike the smug, smarmy, slasher films of recent years; or the creepy way that Carpenter has Michael Myers moving through the background of otherwise innocuous scenes.  The bottom line, though, is that ""Halloween"" pulls all the right elements together -- and then assembles them together flawlessly -- to form the perfect slasher film.  I'll be honest -- if you don't like the slasher genre, then you probably won't like ""Halloween"".  However, if you do like the slasher genre -- or have never seen a slasher film -- then I highly recommend ""Halloween"".  Without a doubt, it's simply the best film of its kind.  Grade: A-"

","Critics label this the best slasher film ever made, but I just disagree 100%. The hailed theme is a no good piece of sh*t loop that gets repetitive after seven horrible sequels. Jamie Lee Curtis is just horrible, how is she labeled the scream queen? What about Olivia Hussey in the far superior film, ""Black Christmas""? Just like countless other exploitation films, it spends half the movie with unimportant dialogue, and you just wonder when the hell it's going to cut to the chase.<br/><br/>Speaking of the chase, the first part is all right, but then she hides the kids in a cupboard and she goes to hide in a closet? What about escaping through the window? After stabbing him in the face with a wire hanger, she believes he's dead, even though she previously stabbed him in the neck earlier and he faked his death then as well.<br/><br/>The ending was the only good part of the film, and his body isn't lying on the ground when Loomis goes to check. The sequel ruined it for me, though, I thought this was supposed to provoke thought! 1/10"

"MovieAddict2016","8","6","15","9 December 2003"," The Start of the Rest is the Best of the Best!
","Review Edited due to IMDb's word limit.<br/><br/>You can thank William Shatner for ""Halloween."" It is his face, after all, that the infamous Michael Myers (Nick Castle) wears in the shadows of ""Halloween,"" spray painted white and its hair frizzled up in all directions. Michael is always in the shadows, an ever-present force with hints of supernatural evil.<br/><br/>And that is where the granddaddy of horror film exceeds where all the others fail -- in its suspense, and not in its exploitation of horror. Michael Myers exists in the shadows as a primal fear in ""Halloween,"" preying on innocent passersby. And although it has been falsely mistaken to be a bloody slasher film over the years since its release, primarily thanks to its many sequels and uncountable rip-offs, the film features virtually no blood whatsoever. No, the film goes for real scares rather than blood and guts. It's the ""Psycho"" of its generation, and it pays its respects to Hitchcock in more than just the literal sense.<br/><br/>Its imitators and sequels (the ninth film coming out next year) all lost sight of this. Over the years, ""Halloween"" has been slowly but surely regarded with less and less respect, simply because its imitators used its original ideas so much they turned into clichés. By today's standards, ""Halloween"" may look tame and quite routine, but you must understand that back in 1978 it was anything but average and typical.<br/><br/>And despite the clichés, I still don't consider it average because John Carpenter knows how to use the camera to his advantage. It's the subtle stuff that counts -- such as the fact that we take the first person view of Michael Myers as a child, while he murders his older sister in cold blood. But after his parents unveil him, we never assume his perspective ever again. Sometimes we think we are, but then we see Michael's outline appear by the camera or far away from the camera. (Though this was ruined when the film was chopped for TV and Michael Myers wasn't always viewable off screen due to standard format.)<br/><br/>The camera also takes on the eerie presence of a third person  -- when Michael attacks Laurie in that coat closet, you're in there with her. When she runs along the street looking for help, Carpenter uses a dolly shot and makes the effect exist as though we are with her. As Michael drives the stolen car through Haddonfield, we're in the back seat with him. We're always with the characters, which is a very subtle but effective technique that Carpenter uses, separating it from the other slasher films. It is as though we become an unmentioned character ourselves. It almost turns the film into a sort of adventure ride.<br/><br/>The film opens on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, 1963. A young girl named Judith Myers is murdered by her 6-year-old brother, Michael.<br/><br/>1978. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) has been following Michael's case since its birth in 1963. He worked for eight years trying to reach the boy, to connect with him. (""He hasn't spoken a word for fifteen years."") Loomis worked another seven years trying to keep Michael locked up forever, after realizing what existed behind the boy's cold eyes was purely and simply evil. But now, the night of his transportation to a court hearing, Michael has escaped from confinement, and Loomis knows where he's headed: back to Haddonfield.<br/><br/>Michael does come back to Haddonfield, and there he preys on innocent virginal schoolgirl Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), left to baby sit two children on Halloween night. Meanwhile, Dr. Sam Loomis walks around town searching for Michael and saying such fun, clichéd lines as, ""It's your funeral!"", ""He came home,"" and ""Evil has come to your small town, Sheriff.""<br/><br/>One of the many keys to the film is Michael's hinted supernatural power. Now it's common fodder to feature supernatural bad guys in horror flicks, but back then nothing had made a villain into a supernatural mad man incarnate before -- not even ""Psycho."" Michael is the villain who always knows where to hide, where the hero(ine) is hiding, how to position himself in the shadows without being seen, and how to always be a step ahead of everyone else. He can appear to a single person in front of a bush and then disappear behind it, gone from sight forever. The supernatural eeriness of the character was copied in the 1986 thriller ""The Hitcher,"" where Rutger Hauer played a homicidal hitchhiker trying to prey on a young boy for no reason whatsoever. Hauer was played as a supernatural character but the film failed to make any sense of anything, wandering back and forth between a mortal foe and an immortal one. It also hinted that there was a purpose behind Hauer's killing spree, which was never delved into.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is smarter. Myers has not motive for killing. And instead of constantly featuring him on screen, Michael is revealed slowly and slowly, piece by piece. First the shoulders. Then the back of the head. Then the face from a distance. A bit closer. But he never walks around in the daylight, right in front of the camera, because that would completely diminish the film's creepiness. Even when Myers is seen in the dark towards the end of the film, and finally unmasked for a brief moment, we never really feel that we've seen him. He is still a dark figure.<br/><br/>All the sequels and rip-offs burned the storyline to the ground. In retrospect, ""Halloween"" is very predictable. But it still has a distinctly subtle style of psychological horror that all the other gratuitously violent slasher cash-ins lost. This is the granddaddy of teen slasher movies, and always will be. And after you get past the fact that it started an entire franchise of unwanted motion pictures, you'll realize that there's a lot more to ""Halloween"" than meets the eye. It's a cut above the rest, so to speak."

","I have to say that his film was kind of boring. Everybody says its a masterpiece and maybe it's just cause' this movies old but i didn't get any chills. Not even one! Bad camera angles and phony acting except from Jamie Lee Curtis. There were a few scenes worthwhile (not scary, just worthwhile) like the beginning when little Micheal kills his nude sister. Normally (in the case of Friday the 13th especially) old horror films don't have scares but have gore. This dos not even have that. The body count is low and the blood level is 2 out of 10. This movie gave me no chills or thrills. It was also silly. Some wack -job baby kills his sister and goes to the asylum where he escapes and goes on a killing spree for people occupying his old house. Why? No clue. Also kind of slow. It's not bad, just silly and boring."

I understand that this film must seem fairly tame compared to the blood-curdling garbage being churned out today and indeed I can applaud the fact that very little blood is shown here and that Carpenter relies mostly on suspense to generate terror. Still, it's an uneasy experience and for someone like myself (who absolutely hates the slasher genre) this is a turn-off. Hitchcock's PSYCHO was a masterpiece. This is not."

Every move was so predictable. The visual effects were not scary. The lighting did not impress. Keeping the room or the street completely dark except an unnatural, anonymous source of very sharp light shining in one particular direction does not make the movie scary but unconvincing. The shadows behind the characters under such sharp light sources who were supposingly in a dark room or a dark corner of the street made me laugh. And that girl who somehow claimed the guys thought she was too smart for them was indeed the dumbest idiot, who put the knife on the floor TWICE in order for the murderer to surge and attack her again. She should have stabbed herself and cut the movie short by an hour. Also, letting a highly dangerous prisoner at large and allowing him to drive in an official car freely in town is too amazing to be true.

","Can I be so bold to make that statement. ""Halloween"" is one of the few technically brilliant horror movies ever made. In fact without the chilling score the film wouldn't be as excellent as it is. Upon the first viewing I was an inexperienced horror viewer. I thought a horror movie was supposed to be bloody and gory. ""Halloween"" is full of suspense so when you get to the edge of you seat blood and gore doesn't mean anything. The sound and visuals are so key to the effect, it puts all of the gory knock offs to shame. Film buffs will especially love this for it's in-joke themes and names. Mostly from Hitchcock films including ""Psycho"" and foreign films. ""Halloween"" is too good to give a formal review and I must leave it for others to judge for themselves. It should be noted that without ""Halloween"" films like ""Psycho II"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday the 13th"" probably wouldn't have been made(Especially ""Friday the 13th"".) I give it 10 out of 10 stars."

Then I turned on the sounds (I was first trying not to disturb my mother) and realized that the music was supposed to do the thing. The movie is NOTHING without the sounds! It's full of cliche.

"nightmarelyre","4","4","9","11 April 2016"," Cookie Cutter Slasher With Some Nice Shots And Music
","Having been born after the era of the horror greats, I have gone back and watched most of them after the fact to see how they hold up. The first classic horror movie I saw many years ago was Psycho, which while somewhat problematic and outdated, at least held up as a pretty good film otherwise with great use of suspense, twisting the plot in unexpected ways and having a lot of character development both for the main character and the killer. The next one I saw was Halloween, and I just don't see why this is hailed as a classic honestly when compared to other movies of its era.<br/><br/>Halloween is a slasher film (not the first by any means though, Psycho, Black Christmas and Texas Chainsaw Massacre beat it by many years) about a boy named Michael Myers who kills his sister as a child and is then sent to a psychiatric institution for 15 years, only to escape to kill again. And that's about it really for the plot as none of the other characters are even remotely given any sort of character development, there are no twists to speak of and it's all very predictable.<br/><br/>The main character, a teenage girl played by Jamie Lee Curtis, basically just gossips with her friends most of the movie before going to babysit some kids while her other friends are out being killed in their underwear. She has no memorable lines of dialogue, no motivations of her own and basically could easily be replaced with a cardboard cutout, though credit to her for doing her best with the bare bones character she had to work with.<br/><br/>The only other characters we meet in the movie are Dr. Loomis, the psychiatrist who looked after Michael during his time in the psych ward, and the sheriff. The sheriff basically does nothing during the entire film, and has no bearing on the plot at all, while Dr. Loomis is a hammy scenery chewing ball of cheese who runs around shouting at people that the evil boogieman has escaped and will kill them all, which is both unintentionally hilarious and also give off the impression that he is completely unfit to work with mentally ill people and was probably the real killer all along (he is not though, the movie has no plot twist).<br/><br/>This lack of character development and a lazy mildly offensive ""psycho killer"" shtick at least could have been somewhat forgivable had the movie been really frightening or had some themes to it that could give you something more to think about, but honestly I feel the movie lacks that too.<br/><br/>The movie's attempt at creating suspense mostly relies on long loooooong shots of Michael stalking people while the admittedly spooky theme song plays in the background. However, it rarely builds up to anything. In fact, it takes almost an hour before we see any sort of action or horror unfurl after the intro sequence outside of a small glimpse of a dead man in a ditch that Michael killed off screen. Look, I am not saying every horror movie needs a ridiculous body count or anything, but you still need to have something unsettling happen once in a while during the build up, and this movie just has nothing to offer there other than Michael making a music video for Every Breath You Take, which gets old after a while.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the movie is pretty spooky at times, I'll admit, with lots of dark shadows accompanied by the iconic film score, but fear of the dark relies on not knowing what is out there that you can't see, and this gets completely ruined when we get a good idea of where Michael is at most times, even with his weird out of nowhere supernatural teleportation skills.<br/><br/>The only time the film actually seems to try and utilize keeping the audience in the dark about what horrors are unfurling is during the kills themselves, which are mostly committed in dark, claustrophobic areas. However I feel it falls flat here too, as they look very unconvincing even in the cover of darkness, show no blood at all, have a goofy buildup (he is dressed up as a Charlie Brown sheet ghost before one of them for crying out loud) and make me feel completely unaffected when I had no connection to the characters at all before they were killed off.<br/><br/>All in all, there really isn't much to this movie that I can see. Outside of the flat characters and family friendly horrors there is no deeper theme other than ""mentally ill people are spooky and the boogieman will get you!"" which is both mildly offensive and juvenile; the holiday of Halloween is not utilized in the movie in any substantial way (the film could have taken place during Easter and nothing would change), and the whole thing is just sorta dull and middle of the road throughout.<br/><br/>Psycho and Texas Chainsaw Massacre are much more memorable and scary movies with much more substance to them, and are much better films to watch if you want to see some of the roots to the Slasher genre while also being entertained. Halloween is mostly just good for it's soundtrack and filming techniques, and is probably best left for film history classes rather than hallows eve movie nights."

The script by Carpenter & producer Debra Hill really is as simple as any slasher out there, there isn't a plot to speak of to be honest. I thought just about everything in Halloween was average at best, the character's, the dialogue, the situations, the story & the kills. It's an OK film, there's nothing spectacularly wrong with it but I found it a bit of a chore to watch, nothing particularly exciting happens & to an extent I suppose it's become a victim of it's own success as there were so many imitators & copycat films that probably just about anyone will know where it's going & pretty much everything that's going to happen. I don't even think it's a particularly good slasher either, there are others that I enjoy far more than Halloween.<br/><br/>Director Carpenter does a good job, there's a decent atmosphere & he likes to use the whole of the frame by having Michael pop-up in the background & then have him disappear. Halloween also features lots of long nice looking tracking shots rather than quick edits which I liked. A special mention goes the opening credits & the theme tune which are admittedly very cool. Forget about any gore as there isn't any, this ones all about the build-up rather than the pay-off.<br/><br/>With a budget of about $325,000 Halloween is well made & quite a classy little film for the money. When released it became the highest grossing independent feature film ever although I fail to see why it's so highly regarded. The acting as OK, I can't say I remember anyone from it though.<br/><br/>Halloween is an OK slasher for sure, but one of the greatest horror films ever? I'm not so sure about that. If people love it than great but for me it didn't quite do enough & it's entertainment value was almost none existent."

","OK. Let's face it - Back in 1978 this sick & twisted little slasher-horror picture may have packed a substantial-sized wallop and wowed audiences everywhere.... But, today, nearly 40 years later - (Watching it with a very critical eye) - Halloween certainly left this somewhat jaded viewer quite bewildered and, yes, let down by the sheer tediousness that prevailed throughout its story..... (Need I go on?)<br/><br/>And, speaking about Michael Myers' teenage sister being butchered in the film's opening scene - No one (in their right mind) can tell me that this grown girl (who wasn't caught completely off guard by Michael's appearance) couldn't have fought off this 6-year-old (Yes! That's right! - A 6-year-old!!) who was wielding a butcher knife with the sole purpose of killing her.<br/><br/>I mean - C'mon, folks - Take the time to really think through how preposterous and implausible that scenario really is, especially when you take into account that Michael didn't take his sister by total surprise - No - She clearly saw him coming at her with the knife.... Sheesh! Spare me!!"
"SparxDragon","5","3","6","5 September 2016"," Not scary one bit
","I just saw this movie for the first time, as a 29 years old adult. There was nothing scary about it. The gore was cheap and unrealistic. The situations were awkward. Some things are magically opened and pushed while there was nothing in the story that suggested supernatural forces. Is Myers possessed by a demon, or is he a psychopath? Is he immortal? The unknown can make a character creepier, but that's not the case with Michael, because he isn't well grounded in reality. I think this movie was a money-grabber when it came out. Carpenter is a brilliant director and this movie just doesn't feel like any of his other works. To those who haven't watched this as kids, trust me, it's not worth watching it now as adults. Go watch any other film by Carpenter."
"Everything_PopCulture","4","3","6","16 December 2014"," A film that would be thrilling for its time but fails now.
","Finally got a chance to watch John Carpenter's 'Halloween.' After hearing so much hype about it, I was disappointed to say the least. A film lacking a terrifying and well developed villain, Michael Myers is there to kill, but we don't have any reason to be scared of him, falling back on the only evidence that he killed his sister years ago. Compared to the horrific character of Freddy Kruger, who we immediately fear from the fact that he can kill you in your dreams, Michael Myers failed to capture my imagination and did not frighten me at all. <br/><br/>Now I get to the film's characters, Jamie Lee Curtis plays the good stereotypical girl who is the last man, or in this case woman, standing. But with her lack of character development, knowing only simple things such as she goes to school and is a baby sitter, I failed to grasp her as a true human being. She needed a back story, she had none and the reason why Michael Myers is going after her remains vague (of course it is revealed in the sequel that SPOILER, Michael Myers is Laurie's brother. If we had known that she was adopted from the start, throw in a couple of subtle hints of the connection between Laurie and Michael then I may have been able to connect to her character. Alas she had no impact on me as a character.<br/><br/>With all the scenes of the film, it was utterly filled with irrelevance and, what appeared to me, slapstick comedy. Every time Michael Myers was seen across the street, around the corner, in his car, staring at Laurie and her friends, it didn't come off as terrifying, it came off as silly. The music cued every time we see Michael standing tall just adds to the hilarity of what should be frightening scenes. Also, a lot of the first hour of the film is filled with boring and not very necessary scenes filled with pointless chatter about sex, school and babysitting when it should have been filled with back story, reasons they should be killed or reasons they shouldn't. Ultimately I think the film succeeds as a horror film for when it was released in 1978, but watching it now in 2014, as a 19 year old (and keep in mind a huge horror fan as well as film fanatic) it just utterly fails to impress me like A Nightmare in Elm Street and Fright Night did. <br/><br/>In the end, this is my opinion, people who were around in the 1970s will enjoy this film, but for those who only get truly frightened by horror films such as Insidious and The Conjuring (Yes I believe James Wan is the NEW horror Master) then you will only laugh at this film.<br/><br/>Verdict 4/10"
"Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki","5","3","6","5 November 2013"," I don't get it.
","Slow moving, and with no big payoff - I think Jean Rollin could pull off something like that and make it work (and did, with several of his films) , but John Carpenter's low budget suspense flick does little to impress me, overall.<br/><br/>A point-of-view intro has a girl being stalked and stabbed to death on Halloween night 1963, by what ultimately turns out to be a small child. After being institutionalised for the next fifteen years, he escapes and returns to his hometown, and begins stalking a babysitter and her friends, with his shrink in maniacally obsessive pursuit.<br/><br/>The Shape brakes into a hardware store and steals a mask early on, but no one had seen him since he was institutionalised fifteen years earlier, so why did he even bother to steal a Halloween mask, no one would recognize him? <br/><br/>Film is technically well made, its photography lends it a certain amount of atmospherics; probably one of the most effective and instantly recognisable music scores ever; a good intro and tense climax all work in its favour, but it is a long, slow, verbose way in between. Before anyone says something stupid like ""Go watch Transformers if you don't want a slower paced movie!"", one of my all time favourite films is Rivette's Out 1, which is 13 hours long, so I am perfectly happy to watch a long, slow burn, if the plot and acting can draw me in, which Halloween never really did.<br/><br/>Contrary to popular belief, this was not the first holiday horror. That title probably goes to 1974's Black Christmas, which is more of a blueprint for holiday horrors than this film. Carpenter ripped off much from that film: Both use a large house at a holiday as the setting. Both films take place in a short time: Black Christmas, in a day and a half; Halloween, largely in one day. Both open with sequence filmed from the killer's point-of-view. Both have a strong, central female character. Both have an unseen killer stalking and killing those around her to get to her, for unknown reasons. Both have a brief shot of the killer's right eye, and part of his face briefly illuminated (in Black Christmas, the killer is shown looking through a crack in the doorway at the climax; in Halloween, we briefly see Michael Myers' right eye and most of the right side of his face at the very end) Admittedly, this is reaching, but both films have sequences centering around a large staircase in the house. Final end shot recapping, showing again all of the scenes of the crimes from earlier in the film.<br/><br/>Black Christmas is vastly superior; a much better view, in my opinion."
"mrkevvy","4","3","6","6 October 2013"," Utterly overrated cheese-fest
","There are very few movies where my rating is vastly different than IMDb's. This is one of them, by the largest margin yet.<br/><br/>The acting is ham-bone and provoked giggles, the plot consists of teenagers getting stabbed for no apparent reason by a mental patient in a mask who then... turns out to be immortal too, completely unexplained, but hey, I guess they were already planning on sequels. There are some other plot holes you could drive a bus through, the dialogue is best left unmentioned, there wasn't a gram of suspense or unpredictability in it, and the budget was so low that the production couldn't afford pumpkins... or music, which had to be done by the director, and it shows. I found myself begging him to explore the other 87 keys of the piano. They could however, afford a couple of dry leaves to drop oh-so-subtly in front of the camera to tell us it was autumn. Of course the rows and rows of trees with green leaves gave it away; guess we weren't supposed to notice that. It went downhill from there.<br/><br/>It has a little of that B-movie charm and it was filmed well on good stock, so I'll give it a 4, but otherwise it has no redeeming qualities. It is the most overrated movie here that I have ever seen, bar none. Currently at 7.9, I was expecting The Shining but got Manos: The Halloweens of Fate instead. I'm thinking that some may have seen it in the 1970's when they were teenagers and are rating by the nostalgia, or it's a cult film a la Rocky Horror and has plenty of zealots, but if you're a first-timer steer clear of this one, unless you enjoy unintentional comedy. Check out John Carpenter's superior later work instead so you won't be embarrassed for him."

","Many people praise Halloween as the ""Original Slasher"" and the ""Greatest Horror Movie ever"". Although I do like the movie a lot and John Carpenter is a terrific director, I have to say that both of those are false. The ""Original Slasher"" would have to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre which beat this by about 4 years. The ""Greatest Horror Movie Ever"" is always won by The Exorcist (I would disagree but hey, I'm not here to push my values on everyone else). I think this movie was slow and predictable at parts, and some of the kills took way too long to build up. Enough bad talk about this movie. Time for the positive. This movie has a good music score and some interesting scenes of The Shape sneaking around. The kills weren't half bad either. The lighting and music really set the mood. Dr. Sam Loomis was very interesting as well, much different than the modern stereotypical protagonists. I would say this movie gets a 7/10. Good, but not fantastic."
"raypdaley182","5","3","6","16 September 2007"," hmmm
","I'm going to start by saying this film does not stand up well to the passage of time and seems to get a little worse each time you see it. I was amazed when I looked at the list of stuff I'd reviewed that this film wasn't there! I've seen it many times and just re-watched it so here goes. So much in this film goes unsaid leaving far too much to the viewer to interpret.<br/><br/>I assume at the start it's Micheal Myers (i'll now be calling him MM) watching the girl and guy on the sofa. I think the camera POV is far too high up to be a child's eye view but thats just my opinion. How the boyfriend fails to spot MM as he looks back up the stairs is beyond me. MM's motive for grabbing the knife is never explained either. Also why the sister never tries to push him off, run away or defend herself in any way. His hair is light brown for those who debated it. And that knife looks very dry for having just stabbed someone seconds ago.<br/><br/>The next scene really bothers me to, The patients are out in the rain so we're never told hold MM escaped. He's clearly been out in that rain a fair while just waiting on a car to arrive to steal. Now another thing that annoys me, he was locked up as a little boy and has been there 15 years but he knows how to drive?<br/><br/>As Laurie Strode is walking with the boy to the Myers House no houses appear to be displaying any kind of Halloween decorations, that seemed odd to me.<br/><br/>Also how MM found where she lived is a tad unlikely too as he drove away from them and was at the house when she got there. I was trying to work out why Lauries friends car didn't fill up with cigarette smoke(and her dad would have totally smelt it as Laurie opened her window).<br/><br/>How far away was Laurie going to babysit? It was light when she left and dark when she got there. When Loomis & the sheriff 1st go to MM's house Loomis quite happily goes up to the stairs 1st with no gun or torch. <br/><br/>Now what did Laurie's friend spill on herself (and where) that meant she had to take off her shirt, t-shirt and trousers? (she later says butter, it must have been red hot for her to pull her clothes off like that!) The friend also just walks right back into the house where she was sitting (clearly having left the front door unlocked then?)<br/><br/>Who are the couple that go to where Lauries (now dead) friend is babysitting? They just walk into a total strangers house, have sex in their bed and smoke & drink in their house? And that single carving knife would NOT hold a grown adult off the ground like they show.<br/><br/>Right, Laurie ALSO walks out of a house where she's supposed to be watching 2 sleeping kids, leaving the door unlocked! Does NO-ONE lock their door in Haddonfield? Once in the other house she never turns any lights on - thats everyones 1st instinctual action in a darkened room, turn on the lights!<br/><br/>OK, Laurie discovering the bodies, Who screwed up there? Body 1 is her friend on the bed (still dressed only in a shirt). Body 2 is the boyfriend of the couple who had been having sex (but he was left in the kitchen stabbed to the wall with a knife!). Body 3 being the blonde girl of the couple who were having sex.<br/><br/>The fall over the banister down the stairs should have killed or at least crippled Laurie. And can't everyone spot the obvious pane of prepared stuntglass in the window waiting for Laurie to break it?<br/><br/>Laurie shouts for help a total of 11 times and no-one responds. Once or twice might be kids playing a prank but a girl on her own shouting 11 times? Real public spirited folks who live in that street, eh?<br/><br/>Now they expect us to believe that MM got through that tiny window ( and we didn't see him doing it in the background? Or that he'd survive being stabbed in the neck (in an artery no less!) with that knitting needle? And he pulled that needle out (at least 2 inches was coated in blood so he should have been spraying blood all over the place!)<br/><br/>Loomis put 6 (i counted them!) bullets into MM. He's dead. End of film. And no, screw getting up and walking away. 6 bullets from less than 10 feet, a needle in the neck and a carving knife. You Are Dead!"

","At best Halloween can be summed up as 'luke warm.' Given a stale one dimensional character to work with in the beginning is just what you would expect with most slashers. This would not be such a big problem were it not for the fact that four people are killed in this movie... That's right... 4. Throughout this ENTIRE movie four people are murdered. One which you barely see in a bush. Michael Myers is just a smaller and (Dare I say.) Weaker Jason Voorhees. Being taken down by a Coat hanger of all things. Laurie the heroine of the film could not be any duller if she tried. Dropping two knives while Myer's chases her. Here is an Idea: USE THE KNIFE TO STAB HIM INSTEAD OF A COAT HANGER. If I had to give credit to this movie, it would have to probably be the now famous music. Camera angles are uninspired and the character of Myers is just too dull, so you killed your sister. So what. I know people will bash this to no end but Halloween in the end just seems like a lame story done with a lame cast who basically are responsible for the stereotypes we see in Slashers today.<br/><br/>I bought this at a flea market for two dollars and I still feel cheated. Watch it if you're into old school stuff. If not, I'd avoid."

But when it came to music, I think I was fair when I said 5--I would have said lower, but it came from the seventies. And I rated the plot lowest of all--3.5--a sleepy little town on Halloween night suddenly suffers little more than an itch when, at the most, ten of its members fall victim to murder, murder attempt, or its effects. The most one can make of it is, ""A bunch of girls are planning on having a good time on Halloween night. A doctor comes in to keep a murderer from running loose. The girls, unaware, continue with their plans and three people are murdered, and the last of them gets chased around by the guy, twice finding an ingenious little way to 'kill' him before he gets up again. Finally when she's between a rock and a hard place the doctor comes in and shoots the guy, whose face we see only once, and never even hear a word from. The murderer comes to life again and we are left without even an explanation why he can survive all the death attempts on himself.""

Now that we are familiar with stalk'n'slash flicks, such as Friday The 13th and the overly contrived comeback of the genre when Scream made them cool again, a masked killer lurking in the darkness just isn't scary anymore. It's too brainless and uncomplicated to make us think twice about the plot.<br/><br/>The tagline was ""The night HE came home"" and the ""he"" in question is Michael Myers - no, not the guy from Austin Powers. I'm talking about a cold emotionless killer, who pointlessly murders teenagers while his face is hidden behind a William Shatner mask. It wears thinner than Calista Flockhart and the body count is lower than this reptile's blood/sugar level.<br/><br/>As a six-year-old child, Michael killed his older sister for no reason on Halloween night. Now, 15 years later, he escapes from the loony bin (suspiciously easy) and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield to kill random teenagers and, for some reason, picks Jamie Lee Curtis as his ultimate prey. I guess at the time the senseless killing was scary in a way, but recent attempts to give it logic are plain laughable. The sequels just got worse and worse, more so than any other smelly franchise. The only thing that improved was the score.<br/><br/>The 2.35:1 photography is quite good and it's bizarre that the rip-offs were never shot in full Panavision-anamorphic widescreen, because this is definitely the film's best quality. Director John Carpenter knew this and has stuck with the format ever since. The POV camera and the gradual fading-in appearance of Michael in the background is clever and quite cinematic, something the imitators and sequels never were.<br/><br/>No matter how tame it may seem by today's standards, this is landmark film will always remain a classic."

Halloween really is a true classic of its genre, it is genuinely scary, taut and is pretty much the only movie of the franchise in my opinion that is not only truly effective after all this time but also where everything works.<br/><br/>Halloween is very well made for starters, with atmospheric lighting and camera angles definite things to like. The score is resolutely haunting, the story is tightly paced and compelling, John Carpenter's direction is superb with some inspired, efficient techniques and while I have heard better the dialogue is good enough with some sharpness and nothing really that stands out as too cheesy or stilted.<br/><br/>The acting is very good, and the characters especially Michael Myers are iconic. Jamie Lee Curtis is more than just a pretty face, her acting seems very genuine and she gives her character welcome gravitas. Donald Pleasance is excellent too, while Michael Myers as a character is the personification of terror.<br/><br/>Halloween also works so well because of its atmosphere. It doesn't rely on excessive and cheap gore to make its point, or frenzied camera angles and the like. What it has is real suspense and genuine jolts especially in the last twenty minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, a true classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

The heroine Laurie is sort of pure and innocent wall-flower type, although she was followed by the irritating parade of the sex-hating, misogynistic slashers with their tomboyish Final girls. Even Carpenter mocked these tomboy virgins as sexually frustrated pervs, who needed the sharp objects to ""penetrate"" the body. Such witticism aside, the script by Carpenter and Debra Hill is not too good either, with Carpenter apparently claiming that one of his inspirations was a mentally ill boy he had seen in a psychiatric hospital, a psychotic with ""evil stare"". Gee, Carpenter, isn't it great exploiting a person's illness because he had an Evil Eye? Um, no, it's tasteless and SLEAZY!

His thoughts will be confirmed when Laurie's friends (Jamie Lee Curtis) are murdered and she might also be one of his victims.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" (1978) which put Jamie Lee Curtis on the map (but she would do better with Charles Crichton's so British ""a Fish called Wanda"", 1988) heralded a genre or sub-genre which has been thriving on the North-American continent for nearly thirty years now: the teenage slasher movie. The majority of these films are modeled in the same mold: a group of teenagers wrestling with an invincible, sanguinary serial killer who slashes them one after the other. This genre will be tapped again and again and will give masterworks like Wes Craven's terrifying, terrific ""Scream"" (1996) but also turkeys by the dozen: the likes of ""Friday the 13th"" (only the very first one is good) and saucy spoofs: the ""Scary Movie"" saga.<br/><br/>John Carpenter isn't a mastermind of the horror/fantasy film even of the B movie. In general his camera work, some of his technical abilities are plagued by weak screenplays and irritable features pertaining to him. ""Halloween"" is his most palatable effort, though. The thrifty scheme according to which he builds a latent tension to make the audience wound up and queasy is perhaps easy, simplistic (long travelings and camera movements to delay the murders) but rather efficient although not mind-boggling. I blamed Carpenter for the limited potential of his scenarios, it's a bit evident in ""Halloween"": different steps of the story interlock often in a predictable way and some well-worn tricks aren't very welcome (Laurie's little brother who claims having seen the bogey man (the monster in reality) outside. The latter looks out of the window and... you guessed it). That said, Carpenter's expertise to make fear last makes forget the drawbacks of the scenario.<br/><br/>Maybe the ones who will discover the film today will be disappointed.

","Horror classics are such a joke to the world, considering that they are either boring, have lame story lines, and very little suspense, this is one of them. Halloween, is something that should have stayed has a holiday, or should have ignored it like the plague. Halloween is very lamer than Friday the 13th cause only 3 murders are committed in this entire movie. And John Carpenter gets fans and money for it? Pathetic! Nightmare on Elm Street was more interesting and scary, but pretty stupid at times. The lightning isn't very good either because we barely see anything, and we can tell that it's a comedy. The scene with Bob and that other girl just shows it all, also the scene where Laurie fall down the stair rail is lot more funnier. Again, the main should either be Michael or Loomis, because females just annoy the hell out of me. Get this movie out of my life."

But he really has his eye on teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), while Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) is chasing him.<br/><br/>In the 21st century, slasher movies have become so common that we're almost numb to them.

Michael Myers is show to be a horrible killer. First, he kills the boyfriend with a large butcher knife and then he walks upstairs and kills the girlfriend with a telephone cord. Pathetic. Why would any killer drop a knife and pick up a telephone cord? The only good thing about this film is that it spawned the Friday the 13th films. Jason would kick Mike's butt any day."

Unfortunately, as far as the cinema is concerned, this was not the start of anything special.  The evil Michael Myers is a masked and crazed slasher who will do anything to kill his little sister (a very young Jamie Lee Curtis).  It is never really explained why he is after her, but he is.  Psychiatrist Donald Pleasance is the expert who knows that Myers must be stopped.  Pleasance is solid (as he usually is in these films) and Curtis shows a glimmer of potential here.  The screenplay is pretty weak, but the direction over-achieves.

I suppose those are odd reasons to keep looking at a movie you can't really stand, but I suppose I kind of like it too.<br/><br/>Halloween is very creepy towards the start. The scenes where the doctor and the nurse are driving to the sanitarium are excellent. I get chills just thinking about them! I would have to say that only other truly scary scene is the one where the camera pans the room at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate, but too many things got on my nerves. Annie spilled a little butter on the bottom of her shirt and for some reason feels the need to strip and wash her clothes in the laundry room outside the house. The way she rubs at the stains you would think they were all over her chest, but you can clearly see the butter only splashed on the bottom.<br/><br/>Once the terror begins for Laurie, she becomes incapable of doing a scene that does not include a bunch of groaning and grunting. I could barely stand it!<br/><br/>The young boy in the movie hears Laurie banging on the front door like a crazy person, but he takes his sweet time opening it for her. I wanted to punch him.<br/><br/>I always hated that Michael was able to do things no human should have been able to do.

The bright sides are cinematography and directing, but all the rest is bullshit, even for a self-produced film.

","This has got to be one of the best horror films ever made. John Carpenter made this creepy masterpiece in just a little over three weeks. Thinking it wasn't going to do pretty well, it surprisingly became the highest grossing independent film of the time. And it started a whole new sub genre in American cinema, The Slasher movies. Prior to Halloween, most American horror movies dealt with unrealistic premises that usually dealt with spirits, monsters, and so on. There were murder movies, but they were seen as more Thriller/dramas than pure horror flicks. But Halloween changed all that, it introduced a new concept to American audiences. I emphasize American because slasher movies were already being and made in Europe, but still weren't mainstream in the US. Halloween took a simple premise and made a cinematographic masterpiece out of it. Everything from its music, to its lighting, to its suspenseful pace. The movie became an instant classic. Jamie Lee Curtis truly owned the character of Laurie Strode, and this was the movie that started her career. Donald presence also did a great job playing doctor loomis, Michael meyres psychiatrist. The movie was so good and so successful, that immediately Hollywood flooded the cinemas with largely cheap imitations of Halloween during the 80s(Esp early 80s). And a new sub genre was born, all thanks to this great movie that I personally can watch over and over without getting bored. I highly recommend Halloween to not just horror fans, but to any movie fan. Because this is cinema art."

","Back in 1978, John Carpenter was hired to Direct a horror film with one of the simplest plots ever-- crazy escaped maniac escapes from the nut house and stalks babysitters. It's as simple as that. It's a simple plot, and yet it is held today as a film that you almost have to watch on Halloween night every year. Unlike other slasher knockoffs that came after it, or even before it, most of the characters are likable and you can actually be in suspense and hope that they get away. It's not just a bunch of stupid annoying teens. They're regular people just going about there business. The best part of the movie, of course, is the cat and mouse chase between Michael Myers and Sam Loomis. Donald Pleasance delivers some of the best dialogue in horror film history, which gives the character of Michael Myers more depth than he probably would have had otherwise. I also have to commend this movie for being able to be suspenseful without gore. I love gore, but I like when you can entertain me without is and there isn't much blood to be seen here.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I can find about the film is some of the acting. Especially the parents and Judith Myers in the beginning. And Laurie's friends were pretty bad, too. If I hear the word ""totally"" one more time, I'm going to jump on screen and stab her myself.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a fun slasher film in it's campy elements (mostly brought on by the passage of time) and its horror elements.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Truly is the first horror film i was afraid of when i caught a glimpse of it. ironically i watched it on Halloween, and the following sequel Halloween II (1980)was not as impressive but was enjoyable, but didn't have the same magic and fear Carpenter had created in the audience, possibly due to the overuse of blood and predictable next scenes. Jamie Lee Curtis is in her breakthrough role that will make her become a household name and be seen as a scream queen alongside greats such as Signourney Weaver and Mary Elizabeth Winstead. Donald Pleasence is in the best role he has been in since portraying Ernst Stravos Blofeld alongside Sean Connery in You only live twice (1967). It seems original that in this film a serial killer is on the loose, murders teenagers having sex but the virgin survives by sheer luck, but John Carpenter created this scenario and stereotypical setting. This is the greatest horror/thriller since Psycho and Norman Bates has finally met a match for greatest horror villain in cinematic history."

","Halloween – 1978<br/><br/>""It's Halloween, everyone's entitled to good scare"" ~ quote by Sheriff Leigh Brackett, Halloween<br/><br/>What can I say? ""Halloween"" is in the best of the best group in the horror-film genre. It has all the right ingredients to scare the crap out of you. It's campy enough to be almost laughable at times and scary enough to make you jump out of your seat. When it was first released in 1978 by a young John Carpenter as a little Indie film with a budget of about $300,000, movie-goers were in for a real Halloween treat.<br/><br/>Following in her mother's footsteps as a scream-queen, Jamie Lee Curtis (in her first movie role) was picture-perfect as Laurie Strode - the nerdy, goody-two-shoes babysitter who ends up in a tête-à-tête with the infamous, maniacal killer - Michael Myers.<br/><br/>It starts out on Halloween night (of course!) in 1963, in the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois, where trick-or-treaters are wandering the happy, suburban streets, clad in costumes and masks. Jack-O-Lanterns are on every porch. Young Michael Myers, in his plastic, child's Halloween mask (and seemingly in some sort of trance), enters his house, climbs the stairs to a bedroom above and stabs his older sister to death for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>So, there's a scary start. Love it!<br/><br/>The story jumps forward in time to fifteen years later in 1978 and once again it is yes – you guessed it – Halloween - and the grown-up Michael Myers (played by Nick Castle and by far the best Michael Myers) is in a mental institution, apparently in a catatonic state, having been devoid of emotions for the past 15 years. Donald Pleasence is marvelous as the intense and driven Dr. Loomis, the psychiatrist in charge of Michael's medical care and who has deemed him unfit for release into society – ever. To Dr. Loomis, Michael Myers is far more dangerous than a sociopath or a psychopath; Michael Myers is evil incarnate. He is a monster.<br/><br/>But, as is predictable in this story, Michael Myers escapes from the mental institution, steals a car and heads back to his home town of Haddonfield – the site of the grisly murder of his sister. How he has learned to drive a car and how he even knows how to get to Haddonfield after being locked up in an institution since he was a 6 year-old boy, is something we ignore. <br/><br/>Laurie Strode is unnerved when she first spots the very creepy Michael, who now dons a very creepy Halloween mask, standing outside her classroom window while she is at school. For some reason, he seems to be fixated on her. (There's a back story here but we don't find out all the details until the 1981 sequel, Halloween II, is released. But no matter, one does not need to know the back story to appreciate this film; on its own, this film is enough to make your heart jump out of your chest). Later, when she is walking home from school with her rather insensitive and obnoxious gal pals, she spots the masked-Michael once again, staring her down from behind a hedge. He disappears from sight before her girlfriends see him. Oh, geez, he is one terrifying dude.<br/><br/>Later, Laurie and her friend Annie are both babysitting some neighborhood kids. Annie is the local Sheriff's daughter and she is a spoiled, wise-cracking bad girl who would rather spend time making out with her boyfriend than babysitting; so she unloads her babysitting responsibility on Laurie, who agrees to take care of little Lindsey in addition Tommy Doyle, for whom she is already babysitting.<br/><br/>There are some heart-thumping, skin-crawling scenes of Michael Myers' ghost-like image appearing in the shadows, tilting his head to the side (just that gesture alone will make you wet your pants!) as he watches Annie in the laundry room, washing her blouse, and later, during her fatal encounter with him in her car. <br/><br/>Another teenage couple shows up at the house where Annie is supposed to be babysitting but no one is at home. They soon discover that Annie has dumped the kid with Laurie so they decide to stay and fool around. From here on in, there is non-stop terror while Michael Myers runs amok. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is frantically trying to track down his patient, knowing for sure that Michael is on a quest to return to his hometown and get revenge. He joins forces with the local police to hunt for the deranged Michael Myers before he kills again.<br/><br/>In the end, Laurie Strode must protect herself and the children in her charge. She must take on the evil -and seemingly indestructible Michael Myers - all on her own. You go, girl!<br/><br/>""Was it the bogeyman?""<br/><br/>Thrills and chills and a good amount of gruesome gore abound in this ""mother"" of the modern slasher-flick. John Carpenter's direction and his unforgettable, spine-chilling music score make this an all-time favorite for horror movie fans.<br/><br/>It just wouldn't be Halloween without watching ""Halloween""."
"antman3344","9","2","4","16 October 2011"," Michael Myers = concept of fear
","I have seen a lot of horror movies; some that use special effects or gore etc. For example, anyone can make a person with a absolutely deranged face with a hockey mask with a huge machete scary. In Halloween's case, Michael Myers is featureless, no human-like qualities; he doesn't run ( or change pace in walking for that matter ) it's as if he was inhuman, which he is. A blank mask, a jumpsuit, and something you and me see everyday, a kitchen knife. All these separate ( besides the mask ) are not scary, but these materials together, along with Nick Castle's deranged mannerisms make the most horrific and iconic villain of all time, Michael Myers. Today, films rely on gore, if your one of those people who get sick watching all that blood, watch this! An absolute classic."

","Watching ""Halloween"" has become part of the Halloween tradition - it's theme music conjuring up images of pumpkins, foliage, and the boogyman. Like ""It's The Great Pumpkin Charlie Brown"" it is permeated with images of jack-o-lanterns, trick-or-treaters, and autumn leaves, never letting you once forget when the goings-on are taking place. In this respect, it is one of those rare movies you can watch perennially to get you into the holiday mood. Coincidentally, it isn't much scarier or much more thought-out than the aforementioned Peanuts special, though that doesn't make it any less fun to watch. Michael Meyers is iconic - and still is a creepy vision decades after his debut. The music is simple yet effective, creating a tension that often surpasses what is taking place on screen. Can you think of a better movie to watch while you are carving jack-o-lanterns?? For bottling up the Halloween spirit and serving it with a harmless slice of slasher...I give this a 10!"

","What can I possible say about Halloween that has not already been said? The only original words that I can offer are those that come from my experience watching this film. It was the first film to spark my interest in the film industry. I had seen it probably more than a thousand times every year since birth, but in my pre-pubescent years the film seemed to take on a whole new dimension. It was like going from black-and-white to technicolor overnight, and I was literally in shock. It all of a sudden became the best film in the world. It was no longer just a masked killer preying on young babysitters, it became a whole new world. The color of the leaves and the way they floated gracefully down the sidewalk as Laurie Strode sang softly to herself, strolling along without a care.<br/><br/>I have never looked films the same way since Halloween. I began to understand the significance of things like lighting, score, and directing. It also exposed me to the first film-based subculture that I had ever seen. It took Halloween from being a world to an entire universe outside of the film. I could not believe it had such an impact on so many people all over the globe. There were fans everywhere, just like me, whose lives had been forever altered my this true work of art. I can still feel the Autumn sun warming the surface of my skin as the wind blows through my authentic 1970's skirt. I can hear Dr. Sam Loomis rustling in the leaves waiting for the boy who had come home, and feel the fear of being stalked by the prowler who would not die. Haddonfield, Michael Meyers, and the fatal events that took place on Halloween 1978 will always be real to me."

","This film is the founding father of the new modern generation of horror films. No poetry, no mysticism, no ideology, in one word postmodern to the core. The only objective is both to horrify and to terrify the audience and nothing else. John Carpenter uses the technology at his disposal in each film to create the atmosphere and to bring up the elements that are going to do what he wants to do : make the audience shake in convulsions of fear. In this early film he uses the new steady-cam to make long travelling sequences that can be more natural because the camera is carried by a person walking the way it is supposed to travel. We then really have the impression of looking at the scene through the eyes of a living person. We are then inside the characters and their fear, whereas the criminal is a lot more steady, immobile, even still. Then the theme is supposed to bring up all our deep dark fears : a child of six kills his own sister who has just had sex, hence sex as the disrupting element that makes people crazy, insanity as the utmost strangeness that turns someone into something that is no longer human, a little touch of satanic evil, knives and Halloween of course. And it works particularly well when we can see the face of this criminal who is wearing a mask, a mask that is expressionless and absolutely colourless. We have it all and we know we would be frightened ****less if we had to meet him in the dark around some lonely street corner.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"

I've always just preferred Freddy and Jason...they look ""cooler"", and still do actually. But, last night I grew up, I became a man. I watched Halloween. And I feel like a total bum loser for not seeing it earlier.<br/><br/>Halloween is the story of a young, emotionless, troubled boy named Michael Myers, who kills his sister on Halloween night. He is locked away in a mental asylum for many years, but during those years he planned his escape and is now on the loose. He returns to his old neighborhood and begins where he left off. The movie is a classic through and through. Halloween shines brightest through Myers. The way they use him - sneaking and following around. His slow movement and his calm demeanor when on screen are pretty eerie. How they used him in shadows. Halloween was shot incredibly well, and that is where you get most of the scares. The music also plays a part in the scares but it can't compare to how Myers is portrayed. The movie itself isn't perfect. There's somewhat unrealistic death scenes, a little corny acting by the younger actors, but these are minor grievances. At 90 minutes, Halloween doesn't bore you, but tricks and treats you.<br/><br/>I never really believed Halloween belonged next to Freddy and Jason as horror icons, but not only does he belong there, he's most likely the most evil. Great flick, great story, great cinematography and most importantly a great character. I'm now proud to be considered a fan of Halloween."

There is just no way that some one is going to make a great film like the Exorcist, or like Alien, or like The dawn of the Dead. These are milestones of horror and suspense. These film have integrity and everybody who tried to work off of those movies, I mean you tell me, there is not one film that comes close to these. The problem is that people will go watch ""re-makes"" and rip-offs because they hope that it will come close to what they saw in the original films. So they spend money going to see a piece of crap, they really don't wanna see it but they give it a chance. And that's what the movie studios target! That's just lame and it shows that the film industry is an industry and not an artdustry. very very sad!"
"livingincyn","10","2","4","13 November 2005"," Classic horror. Simply the best horror score ever!!!
","This is the best horror film to watch on Halloween night. Halloween II is also great (more gore though) the film is scary and spooky without the buckets of blood. Michael Myers is easily the most creepy of all the killers in horror Hollywood (not the most deadly that title goes to Jason) but he is the most scary and creepy. The score on both Halloween and Halloween II are outstanding. No other horror film in history has such a great scary soundtrack (which I think adds much of the spooks in the film) my favorite scene is the end when Laurie finds her friends in the old Myers house. Both this and the first sequel are the only two worth while in the entire series of Halloween films. Well Halloween 4: The return of Michael Myers was o.k. but no Jamie Lee Curtis."

","Halloween is an instant classic horror film, i mean the best, when i first saw this movie i get really scared at night, i really though that Michael Myers was going to coming out of my closet, after seeing that movie i became a fan of the series, i have all the movies on DVD, except the third, you know the reasons. John Carpenter create an amazing ambient, very creepy, i have to say that Donald Pleasence is a very good actor, but i only have seeing this movie of this actor. But the best is Jamie Lee Curtis, i love Laurie Strode, i love how she screams. When i first saw this movie i though it was a copy of ""Friday The 13th."", but the i realize that ""Halloween"" is oldest than Friday, that's why i hate to death Jason movies. No one can compares to the most original, scariest, spookiest movie ever, and no one can compares to the most terrifying serial killer Michael Myers.<br/><br/>I have to say that this movie is my favorite horror movie, but if it wasn't for the amazing music, this could lose something, that music is extremely creepy, in fact i did have to bought the soundtrack just for the original theme and 'Laurie's theme', my two favorites, i just can understand how can John Carpenter let Rick Rosenthal put that horribly copy of the song in Halloween 2.<br/><br/>I give 10/10 to Halloween for the amazing story, creepy moments, for Michael but mostly for the music."
"ODDBear","10","2","4","11 March 2004"," THE perfect horror film
","Absolutely one of the best horror films ever.<br/><br/>In 1963, on Halloween night, 6 year old Michael Myers brutally stabs his sister to death. 15 years later, to the day, Michael has escaped from his lunatic asylum and proceeds to wreck more havoc in the peaceful community of Haddonfield, Illinois. <br/><br/>A masterpiece of horror film-making. Granted, today's audience might not appreciate the film for all it's worth, but in 1978 this was groundbreaking stuff and set the tone for future horror films. <br/><br/>John Carpenter's masterful horror film has yet to be surpassed in many respects. It's the level of craftsmanship that is so effectively on display here. Working on a shoestring budget, Carpenter went as far as to paint the leaves on trees to give the film the appropriate look. The music he made himself (the least costly choice, he said), and it's one of the most instantly recocnizable movie scores ever. The music plays a big part in the film's atmosphere. In fact, the music basically creates the film's mood. Sounds a bit like a combination between Goblin's scores for Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso and Suspiria, it's one of the film's best assets. Dean Cundey's cinematography is nothing short of superb, the film's opening scene alone is worth noting. Lighting is brilliant, an often copied scene near the end (you'll know which one) is yet another indicator of the talent behind the film. <br/><br/>Carpenter's ability to create and sustain suspense has never been showcased better than here. It's tension filled grip on viewers begins from minute one and doesn't let up until the end credits roll (and not even then, it stays with you afterwards). A lot of thought went into creating the boogey man and Michael Myers is the perfect embodiment of what would scare us to death. An emotionless, nearly robotic force of evil that kills without remorse and seems to live for only that. The Shape is his official name, aptly titled given his mask, appropriately indicating his soulless nature. <br/><br/>Acting performances are generally good. Donald Pleasence is perfect as Dr. Loomis, Michael's main nemesis. Jamie Lee Curtis is very good as Laurie, Michael's main target. Charles Cyphers gives a good supporting performance as the town's sheriff. Other actors aren't as good, but not distractingly bad either. <br/><br/>People who say horror movies aren't very good should check this one out and try to argue their case. <br/><br/>10 out of 10."
"bsinc","6","2","4","31 October 2003"," Admirable cinematography, a disappointment of a movie
","First of all I have to give praise to the very neat camera movements and a cool theme score which definitely boost the movie to a higher enjoyment level so you never have the feeling you're watching a low-budget horror movie. The first slasher movie to be exact, or so I've read. But there's not much slashing in it, which is the biggest disappointment of them all. On a Halloween night, 25 years after this movie is supposedly taking place, I expected a nice little blood bath but on the area I was most expectant ""Halloween"" disappoints immensely. There's very little violence (to be honest, an average Jerry Springer episode has more of that-and bear in mind that it's even more phony on his show)and just a hint of the vein filler and the ending is so unexpected and unfulfilling it should be given a slap. On one side, I admire the movie makers for creating a big-budget-ish movie with flying colors and John Carpenter for creating the suspense he did, but on the other side the movie miserably fails the test of time since the level of violence and brutality in the present time is much greater and today's youngsters (me including) don't find it nearly as petrifying as our parents. A funny and interesting look at a young Jamie Lee Curtis, though 6/10"

","Halloween is one of the most influential Horror/Slasher movies ever made while there were certainly other influential horror movies that came before it such as Peeping Tom (1960) and Psycho (1960) which both greatly influenced this movie and many other horror movies but it was Halloween that started the Horror/Slasher movie craze that dominated the 1980s.<br/><br/>Halloween is a genuinely creepy and unnerving movie from the very start when you first hear the now classic Halloween theme play during the movies opening credits watching as the camera slowly zooms in on the smiling lit pumpkin you feel a tingle down your spine from there the movie takes it time building tension. During every scene your attention is not focused on what's going on in the scene instead your eyes are drawn to the movies background seeking out the masked shaped figure who has been stalking our main characters as they are ""Totally!"" oblivious of what's to come we know what will happen it's fate but the fun is in the hunt not a jumpscare which is something modern day horror movies have yet to learn.<br/><br/>The beauty of this movie is in it's soundtrack and the atmosphere it creates during key moments of the movie the sound of the sharp and low tones of the piano make the hairs on the back your neck stand up making you fear what maybe waiting in the dark.<br/><br/>Halloween also introduced (Jamie Lee Curtis) who plays the main character Laurie who thanks to the massive success of Halloween Curtis made a name for herself and became the original scream queen for her role in Halloween and many other Horror/Slasher movies.<br/><br/>Halloweens main star was veteran actor (Donald Pleasence) who played Doctor Samuel Loomis and who's performance is definitely the best part of the movie so much so that (Donald Pleasence) took part in four Halloween sequels and after Halloween II he became the only memorable thing about the sequels and the only reason anyone went to see them was because of his amazing performance as Doctor Loomis.<br/><br/>Halloween was made by then unknown director and writers (John Carpenter) and (Debra Hill) and it wasn't common for such veteran actors like (Donald Pleasance) to take a role in such a low budget, independent movie but after reading the script and getting to know both Carpenter and Hill and seeing the unique vision they had for this movie he signed on and his part as character Doctor Samuel Loomis would become one of the most memorable of his career.<br/><br/>I highly recommend watching this movie if your a horror/slasher movie fan and if by some miracle you haven't already seen this classic movie do yourself a favour and watch it if your of a new generation who hasn't seen the original Halloween movie yet I recommend watching it properly not just a casual viewing.<br/><br/>As a quick side note I reviewed Halloween after watching the 35th Anniversary edition on Blu Ray which is a fairly decent transfer the lighting is a little better the sound is a little clearer other than that it's pretty much the same as the DVD version of the movie although the special features are decent and includes an over 50 minute featurete entitled ""The Night SHE! Came Home"" which follows Jamie Lee Curtis stepping back into the spotlight in horror movie conventions after many, many years an interesting watch also in the special features is footage that was included in the cut for TV edition of the movie which are nothing special but do give us a look at a young Michael Myers in Doctor Loomis care and a scene that shows Loomis meeting the hospital board trying to get Michael put away for life. Having never seen the TV cut version myself I liked that this additional footage was added as a bonus feature."

","I've actually never been a massive fan of horror movies. My parents would never allow me to watch them when I was a kid, and I never felt the urge to dive into the genre during my teenage years. As a matter of fact, I think I can count the horror movies that I saw in my life with the fingers of my two hands.<br/><br/>What John Carpenter pulled off with Halloween is incredible : he basically invented a genre, while displaying his great filmmaking talents in a movie that had an incredibly small budget. From a cinephile's point of view, it's an absolute pleasure to watch. The atmosphere of the movie is deeply unsettling, the score is fantastic and Michael Myers' presence proved enough to haunt the nightmares of multiple generations since the film's release in 1978.<br/><br/>However, I can nit-pick some elements of the movie : the death scenes that have not aged all that well, the acting that, while not awful, isn't exactly the best, and the fact that the movie ends in a strange way and with a lot of questions still up in air. Nevertheless, Halloween remains a classic for a reason, and I will definitely rewatch it when Halloween season comes around one of these years."

","Halloween (1978) is a classic horror slasher movie that John Carpenter created. The main antagonist, Michael Myers, wears a Captain Kirk mask painted white and darkened hair. He mainly is seen stalking the protagonist, Laurie Strode (played by Jamie Lee Curtis). Here is the full quick recap of the movie:<br/><br/>
The Movie starts out with Micheal Myers as a young boy murdering his older sister (Judith Myers). Then he is sent to a mental asylum called Smiths Grove. About 15 years later, he breaks out of the asylum (which happens to be on Halloween). His psychiatrist, Sam Loomis is determined to look for Micheal. Then we are introduced to Laurie Strode. She is in high school and is happening to babysit this kid named Tommy Doyle. Her friends, Annie, Linda, and Nancy, are walking home from school and Laurie sees Michael. He walks behind a bush, and when her friend goes to look, he's gone. Micheal tends to stalk Laurie a lot through this movie, and every time he disapears. So let's fast forward to Halloween night, for the hell of it. Laurie is Babysitting Tommy, and her friend is babysitting this girl named Lindsey. Her friend drops off Lindsey at Laurie's, and she goes to meet her boyfriend. She doesn't because when she gets in her car, Micheal appears in the car and strangles and sliced her throat. Her OTHER friend is seen with HER boyfriend, and Micheal happens to come across them both, and he kills them both. Laurie happens to find their bodies, and she freaks the frick out. Micheal finds Laurie and starts chasing her. She manages to get a few hits on Micheal, on his eye and chest. Micheal is somehow immune to pain throughout these movies. Loomis shows up and shoots the living  outta Micheal and he falls off the house balcony. The ending of this movie is when Loomis looks down the balcony Micheal fell off, and to find out: HE'S GONE. THE END."

","""Halloween"" is a 1978 horror film directed by John Carpenter starring Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence. No Halloween time goes by without having watched this absolute masterpiece. With each rewatch, I increasingly like it more and more, because I can spot so much brilliance from time to time. First of all, it's a perfectly structured and paced horror thriller that gives me chills due to so many different aspects. There's probably no soundtrack more iconic and fitting than those simple keyboard notes. In a Hitchcock manner, it carries the tension throughout the whole run time. Additionally, Carpenter created something never seen before: While there are also a lot of scence taking place in the dark, many shocking scenes take place at daytime, thus destroying the stereotype that it's only frightening as soon as the sun set. Michael Meyers, as iconic as the horror movie genre itself, terrorises the audience at daytime. That's what makes it so uniquely uncomfortable. He's also one of the greatest characters ever written for a motion picture. He's unpredictable and evil, with no obvious motifs and rules he follows, neither human nor monster, just pure evil. Furthermore, the scenery and the setting are tremendously atmospheric and as soon as the sun goes down the most terrifying part of the film begins. With clever camera work the intense writing style of Carpenter and Hill comes to life, especially the haunting nature of the boogeyman. Lead by scream queen Jamie Lee Curtis, the cast consists of both extremely talented young actors and legends. The story might not be extremely gory, as the brutality lies in the paranoid atmosphere. The ending is without a doubt one of the most realistic staging of the sub-genre, as the character decisions might be imprudent but still justified. It's not like someone is tripping over literally nothing. All in all, this horror classic is the benchmark for any horror film in general and will always hold the place of the best slasher in history. Often copied, but never reached, it lives from its special kind of terrorising atmosphere, it's talented cast and the music score itself. With this motion picture, John Carpenter made himself immortal and justified the title of being the master of horror."

He is locked away in prison for 15 years. On October 30, 1978, Michael is now 21, and steals a car and escapes Smith's Grove.

I also really enjoyed the idea of how he is basically the embodiment of pure evil. Unlike most villains, his parents didn't die or society abandoned him - he doesn't have any tragic backstory. He was just born like this. And that is one scary thought which not a lot of films employ. Nowadays we're all so into gloryfying villains (e.g. ""Joker"") that we don't even take into account that some people are just born evil. It's a shame that most of the later instalments in the ""Halloween"" franchise depicted Michael crying and made him related to Laurie, giving him emotions and a motive. They missed the whole point."

The acting is somewhat lacking and it takes a while to get to the point, but it's very cheap but it doesn't show and makes something so stupid on paper into something so real and so terrifying.

","So watching this again after a long time (it was a double bill with the new Halloween from 2018) refresehed my memory in a good way. First of all the movie really aged well. I was a bit surprised about the nudity and all the teenage talk in general, but most of all I was surprised to see that Jamie Lee's character was or rather is not the sister of the killer.<br/><br/>That is clear pretty early on in the movie and something that would ""change"" in the sequels. Now having that out of the way and a very violent POV beginning, this really stirs things up. The original music that is so famous, even people who haven't seen the movie know it, is giving viewers a chill. And while the hairdos actually may be the one thing that has aged, the performances are really good. This is a classic for a reason, even if it may have the occasional flaw"

","For my money, ""Halloween"" is the best slasher ever. I've seen hundreds of them - the sub-genre went into overdrive in the decade after - and this is the best.<br/><br/>It's funny how with horror, less is often more. The original ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", itself a classic, had a budget similar in size to this, and it too was far more effective than any of the rubbish that followed it. It's as though money creates distance, which is anathema for horror. You have to feel like you're in there with the characters, and Halloween pulls that off perhaps better than any other horror movie I've seen.<br/><br/>It's also genuinely frightening.<br/><br/>Something else this movie gets right is that the heroine is believable and relatable. It's not the usual gaggle of obnoxious late-twenties ""teenagers"" whom you can't wait to see offed. Jamie Lee Curtis just had that charismatic quality, and her character is resourceful in a way that doesn't seem forced.<br/><br/>If the movie has a flaw, it's that the soundtrack (though iconic) can be overwhelming at times, and not necessarily in a good way.<br/><br/>This is still basically the blueprint for filmmakers to follow when they make a slasher, but somehow, they rarely, if ever, get it right."

Hazy imagery of a daunting figure stood in the distance or a shadow moving past a door leave corny computer generated monsters in the dust, while the final battle as Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) desperately struggles to survive against a seemingly unstoppable force of evil catches breath in the chest.

There's character yes but it has things written all over it telling you constantly, ""THIS IS A SLASHER FLICK!!"" Is that bad? No. I'm saying it's just not that creative in a lot of areas since it's based in that kind of genre.

","I've loved this movie for 34 years (first saw when I was 10,it was on tv).
Michael is still the most terrifying movie killer and for some reason every sequel/remake/reboot has got it so wrong. It's the simplicity of the character that makes him scary. He's a normal built, height young man, but driven by pure evil, not revenge.
Somethings just dawned on me for the first time and I can't believe I missed it and I certainly haven't heard any one else point it out.
First off there's no real evidence that Judith was neglecting Michael, she said ""around somewhere "" but that doesn't mean she's a bad babysitter.
Secondly, a lot of people scoff at the Judith kill scene because Michaels POV looks up while he's stabbing her but this could be because the evil is only starting to take over him and the bit of the boy that's left can't bear to watch it but he's powerless to stop it, when he's done he doesn't stop to admire his kill, he turns and runs out the door, when his parents take his mask off it's not the ""blank, pale emotionless face"" that Dr Loomis remembers, it's fear."

","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)<br/><br/>Even though everyone knows the story of Michael Myers, I'm still going to keep this spoiler-free since a lot of people might know this character without actually watching the movie. A lot of remakes, sequels, and spin-offs have been produced, but all of them are going to be retconned (thank God) in the direct sequel to the original coming out in the next few days. I couldn't be more hopeful...<br/><br/>Halloween is a horror classic that inspired tons of slasher films, and its core story is still relevant to this day. John Carpenter and Debra Hill's screenplay cleverly explores the concept of pure evil and youth's ingenuity, by incorporating the former in the character of Myers and the latter on stereotypical teens, who only do drugs or have sex without a care in the world.<br/><br/>Now, I do have to make this clear: this is a 70s movie. You can't watch a slasher film from 40 years ago with a 2018's mentality and knowledge of how movies are today. If you start to overthink stuff and really analyze this film without caring about when it was released, then you'll probably think this is one of the worst horror flicks ever. It isn't scary, it doesn't have huge set pieces or even well-developed characters ... for a 21st-century movie.<br/><br/>Nowadays, we use the word ""cliche"" a lot, especially in horror films, where silly jumpscares and characters who always make stupid decisions are trademarks. When Halloween came out, you couldn't really call its characters cliche since they weren't portrayed in hundreds of other movies yet. This film was one of the first to successfully use these formulaic characters. So, what made this movie so astonishingly famous and prominent? Besides its story, the mind-blowing direction and the addictive score.<br/><br/>John Carpenter both directed and composed the music for this film, which is something extremely rare. I just finished rewatching this classic, and his soundtrack is not going to leave my brain for a while. It seamlessly switches the tones of the movie, and it elevates the suspense throughout the more tense scenes. Everytime a distinct part of the score plays, the audience knows that Myers has to be somewhere close, creating brilliant build-ups to dozens of fantastic moments.<br/><br/>His direction is flawless. The way he plays with the background of every scene by changing the focus on a close-up or a wide shot is absolutely outstanding. The hand-held camera is excellently applied, and it helps to accompany the POV of the character, giving a better understanding of what he/she is actually seeing, hiding the potential scares and elevating once again the suspense.<br/><br/>The story delivers so many remarkable characteristics that became timeless and eventually turned out to be cliches in films of today due to their excessive use. From the villain who is literally crazy and wants to murder people on Halloween night just for the sake of it to the ignorant and naive teenagers who don't care about a thing in the world and make the silliest decisions every single time, this Carpenter flick is one of the most influential horror movies of all-time.<br/><br/>Additionally, they did all of this with an uncommonly low budget: 300,000$! This value was already considered low at the time, and it became one of the most profitable films of Hollywood to this date. They bought Myers' mask for one dollar! I mean, when I look at such a brilliantly directed and technically seamless movie like this, and then I find out that everything was made with this amount of money, I can't help but be utterly amazed.<br/><br/>It's still not a perfect film. There are some cringe-worthy acting moments throughout the entire movie. Nancy Keys is hugely annoying as Annie and P.J. Soles is just appalling as Lynda. These two are hard to watch and listen to, even with a 70s' mindset. Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) is fine, but since the characters' scripts are all over the place, hers provided some excruciatingly over-the-top screams. The only one who is able to deliver a good performance is Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis. He has the best lines in the entire film, and fortunately, he makes good use of them.<br/><br/>I don't really have more issues to point out, but I do think that this movie lost a bit of its essence throughout the years. Its technical attributes aged well, but its scaryness didn't, and if you can't appreciate the rest with the right mentality, then this will not be a very entertaining time. However, if you do take into account everything and if you are able to change your millennial mindset to a 70s one, then you're in for a fun experience at home.<br/><br/>Halloween (1978) became one of the most influential horror movies of all-time, and it's a classic of the genre, acknowledged and acclaimed by every fan of cinema. From the ground-breaking John Carpenter's direction to his own memorable score, every technical aspect of this film is jaw-dropping and aged surprisingly well. With a story that would literally inspire hundreds of other movies, it's an entertaining and suspenseful time that you should spend with your friends and family. Just be sure to change your mindset to the 70s and ignore some of its silliness. After all, it's Halloween!"

","For 40 years now, people have been obsessed with the sub genre of horror known as the ""slasher"" genre. Hundreds and hundreds of slasher movies have been made but why? Well, that's because of this movie. This one independent film that had a tiny budget of $300,000 was able to make a massive $70,000,000 at the box office and inspired hundreds of movies. Halloween is probably the most popular and influential horror movie of all time so I am here to give you my thoughts on it although you can probably tell what my thoughts are by my rating and the heading. Oh, well, I'm gonna give my thoughts on it anyway.<br/><br/>Starting with the positives, the biggest positive I can give this film is Donald Pleasence as Doctor Loomis. His performance is breath taking. He has so many brilliant lines and delivers them excellently like the famous line about ""The devil's eyes"". I think he is probably the best character within this franchise. You can tell he had so much passion for this because character. Donald Pleasence is a true legend and is one of the best characters in all of horror history.<br/><br/>The second biggest positive I can give this movie is the score, brilliantly composed by John Carpenter. This score is by far the most popular in all of horror history and it deserves that label. It perfectly blends suspense and tension, and is just a really kick-ass score that will never be forgotten.<br/><br/>My third positive is the brilliant cinematography. The cinematography in this movie is great. It has so many brilliant and iconic shots like Michael appearing behind Laurie and the wardrobe scene. I love all of this shots pretty much equally but if I had to pick a favourite one, I would say the shot where Michael appears behind Laurie. It's such a brilliant shot that uses atmosphere and a sort-of jump scare to scare us.<br/><br/>My fourth positive is Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Other than Michael Myers, she is probably the most iconic part of this franchise and for a good reason. She gives a brilliant performance and has one of the best scenes in all of horror with ""The chase"" scene. This scene alone makes her one of the best final girls in all of horror but including her inclusion in the rest of this movie and the 3 other movies she is in, makes her the second best.<br/><br/>This is where I would talk about the negatives I have with this movie but there really isn't any. There is a bit of bad acting here and there but other than that, it's a flawless movie that is my 4th favourite horror movies of all time. It obviously gets a 10/10."

","Halloween is a remarkable horror film but this in largely down to Carpenter's wonderful ability in building up and creating suspense. Using the POV approach, and a chill-inducing score whenever Michael Myers appears, Carpenter certainly does an effective job of immediately drawing the viewer into the proceedings. But it's the unconventional way of anticipation is the most terrifying thing about the movie.<br/><br/>I loved how Carpenter keeps us hooked for most of the movie (the first hour) just by making us waiting for Myers to strike, and yet nothing happens till the third act. That really made the movie an unsettling and unnerving experience, but also so captivating; my eyes was glued to the screen, TOTALLY!<br/><br/>Leaving us hanging for nearly an hour before Myers begins killing was a difficult challenge, and Carpenter just knocked it out of the park in terms of keeping me enthralled and riveted. That said, the slow-burning narrative and sinister atmosphere weren't enough to make this movie scary for me. Usually, I don't blame the movie for not scaring me when I find there are many things that the movie got right, such as the use of jump scares, simply because I don't get scared from horror movies at all! But I get nervous quite a lot when I watch decent horror flicks, and that didn't happen to me until the last, say, 15-20 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>Another issue I have with this movie is everything about Donald Pleasance's character. Besides Pleasance's stilted performance, his character's presence along with the Sheriff don't seem to be necessary, and I felt that there would have been no much difference if both Sheriff and Doctor were cut from the film. I found Loomis is just an expository tool that also hasn't been utilized well.<br/><br/>The characters, in general, aren't smarter than those in other slasher horror movies. Case in point, Thomas Doyle who I would only believe his actions if he was 3 or 4 years old! Not to mention, Brian Andrews's performance that was really bad. The character and the performance are the exact opposite of Danny in Kubrick's The Shining!<br/><br/>Needless to say, Jamie Lee Curtis's performance as Laurie is simply stellar. The same goes for the rest of the cast regardless of those who I've mentioned above.<br/><br/>I also didn't like that Myers was depicted as superhuman. I don't know whether the sequels justified that or not, but this definitely didn't work for me. However, I liked so much how Myers looks, and how we didn't see his face as much as we hear him breathing under his mask from a first person POV.<br/><br/>For all its flaws, Halloween will remain a landmark of slasher horror cinema, simply because it has set the standards for horror films in general. Standards that slasher movies have never surpassed to date.<br/><br/>(7/10)"

Halloween is a movie that makes the viewer look over the shoulders of the characters in anticipation of seeing the feared villain.

","Before the 10 follow-on entries in John Carpenter's classic slasher series there was the original low-budget 1978 film. Few films in the horror genre have had the impact that 'Halloween' has had - one that has transcended generations and is respected as something that is simple-yet-effective in offering up scares without needing to resort to obnoxious, in-your-face gore.<br/><br/>It was 'Halloween' that launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, whose portrayal of innocent high school babysitter Laurie Strode was etched in cinematic history thanks in large part to her screaming ability and authenticity she brought to the role. The late 1970s was a period when this type of film really did not exist, so audiences were captured by everything from the chills-inducing opening score to the well done jumpscares (before they became cliched) and of course, Michael Myers. Donald Pleasence's Dr. Loomis is also a character who became synonymous with the Halloween holiday - the duo of Curtis and Pleasence is one that will likely stand the test of time.<br/><br/>It may seem old, cheap and unsophisticated in this day and age of souped up, over stylized horror films, but the original 'Halloween' is a film that will forever be one that is credited with setting up the modern day horror film."

","I watched this movie in preparation too see the new one and while I knew who Micheal Myers was, I didn't know all that much about him. Looking back on it now I really regret not seeing this along time ago as the film, even with the cliches of modern horror, holds up really well even today. The opening scene was shocking back in '78 and is shocking now as it starts us of from a POV shot from Micheal and while you'd figure ""of course they do a shot from the killer's point of view"" but that is not what is shocking it is the fact that Micheal just killed his sister and he was six. After that Micheal spends 15 years in a mental institute and just stares a a wall and doesn't say anything, but as Dr. Loomis says ""he wasn't looking at the wall. He was looking at tonight, planning it. waiting for it."" The film plays a nice duality with the idea of Micheal being a 'normal' person or a more supernatural being. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the the soundtrack, in the opening credits we are shown a shot of a pumpkin and eerie music starts to play in the background as the names of actors pop up we slowly get closer and closer to the pumpkin, the beauty of this opening sequence is that it sets the tone for the rest of the film with the theme song playing and the pumpkin getting ever closer. Overall I would definitely recommend this film to any fan of the horror genre, of course it isn't perfect with a dated setting, some campy dialogue, etc. but I would look past that and just enjoy the movie."

When they showed the inside of the house next I thought omg here he comes. Then the movie ended. On the way home I remember being in the back seat of the car looking around thinking Michael Myers was out there somewhere.

","A film that hosts the most formidably foreboding group of followers since the original 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. Many have claimed this to be the perfect slasher. Whilst I disagree with the subjective consensus, it is irrefutably influential and a milestone in the horror genre. Michael Myers slaughters his sister and is sent to a mental institution. Years later he escapes and terrorises babysitters on Halloween night. Carpenter is a renowned horror director, particularly for his inventive utilisation of prosthetics. The low budget of this slasher forced him to be creative. Surprisingly the blood and gore is minimal. The tension and suspense is upheld by what the viewers do not see, and it's incredibly effective. The vast majority of the film relies on Myers stalking his sexually promiscuous victims by appearing and disappearing in the camera's backdrop, or by the exhaustingly heavy breathing beneath his mask. These aspects complement Carpenter's astute directing in creating horror. The introductory POV long take is a perfect example to illustrate this. Curtis somewhat broke the typical ""damsel in distress"" cliché and stood confidently against a physically intimidating Castle. The noteworthy score also elevated the suspense even further, and remains memorable to this day. The film however is equipped with a double-edged knife. The simplistic approach enhances the realism of the situation, without conforming to exaggeration. Yet, it's because of this that the pace is stagnant for a large portion of the film, lacking character development for both the protagonist and antagonist. The constant stalking rapidly becomes tedious, finishing off victims with badly acted deaths. The final ten minutes then exhumed surrealism which detracted from the film's realism. Shot six times, stabbed three times and fallen off a balcony. His supposed invincibility makes him less remarkable, which is a shame. Is this Carpenter's best? No. Is this the best slasher? No. However it's certainly an appropriate film for Halloween."

","The original film of the series, ""Halloween"" (1978), is one of the greatest depiction of the horror genre in cinematic history. John Carpenter's artful and patient direction is what sets it apart from other cash-grabbing slashers of the 1970s and 1980s. It's about pace and visual style as much as it is beautiful simplistic storytelling. <br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is a revelation as Laurie Strode, who is a female protagonist explored with an enormous amount of depth. Curtis puts forth one of the most notable breakout performances from any actor graced with the responsibility of playing a protagonist their first time out of the gate. Her co-star, Donald Pleasance's haunting, ineradicable presence as Dr. Samuel Loomis is also irreplaceable. If I would have been an Oscar voter in 1978, I would have voted for Curtis and Pleasance in the leading actor and actress races over Jane Fonda and Jon Voight in ""Coming Home."" <br/><br/>They're aided by perfectly crafted dialogue and a balance storylines. Some scenes are told through Laurie's eyes, others Dr. Loomis', and some Michael's; these three distinctive perspectives coalesce cogently into one streamline plot, which is astutely executed astutely through the screenplay and direction. Perhaps the greatest single aspect of ""Halloween"" is the film score, assured to strike fear into the most stoic of us all. ""Halloween"" is balanced, focused, scary, and communicates an idea into a fable."

","Halloween, a films that good filmmaking, good writing and being clever with simplicity are far more important than action, jump scares and buckets of gore.
From the initial reveal of a young Michael to the faceless granddaddy of movies villains being shot ""6 times"" and disappearing this film never lets up on the fear and tension of what it's like to be stalked. Michael Myers is the personification of everything we fear about that unknown person in the shadows and what we fear in ourselves. 
The hero of the piece is the director Carpenter. Who not only shoots a beautiful and subtlely brutal horror film years ahead of its time but creates one of the greatest scores in movie history. And with all great horror/thrillers the music amps up the tension to the breaking point. 
What psycho did somany years before Halloween does for the next generation of horror movies. But this time instead of giving you a simpathetic person to be disarmed by, you get a master of destruction in Michael Myers. This type of tension based horror in my eyes has never been matched or beaten since it's release despite so many filmmakers trying their best to do so.

","Halloween is easily one of the most influential and recognizable horror movies ever made. Even people who are largely unfamiliar with horror genre will likely still be able to identify the horror cliches that Halloween started, much like Friday the 13th and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
The iconic soundtrack and (unique for it's time) scene structure blend together to make a creepy and thrilling atmosphere that most movies can't pull off to this day. The story is may seem cliche now, but it's told supremely well, and adds a lot of suspense.
I can't really criticize the predictability of the movie because for it's time, it was really unique. What I feel like I can criticize though is the second act of the movie. It just feels like filler, and nothing of consequence happens. I feel like it was there to add suspense, but being bored while watching a horror film isn't good. The acting is also kind of hit or miss, especially with the child actors, but I can look past that for the most part.

","I only wish I could have been born in the early 60's so I could have enjoyed this movie in my teens when it came out in all it's terrifying glory.<br/><br/>Michael Myers, a kid who is described by his doctor as having the devils eyes, murders his sister in cold blood on Halloween night. Fifteen years later, he breaks out of the mental asylum he's kept in to go after his sister, Laurie Strode (Jamie-Lee Curtis).<br/><br/>The bulk of the movie focuses on Laurie and her two best friends, Annie and Linda. They all share their plans for Halloween night as their walking home in the afternoon. Annie and Linda are planning on spending it with their boyfriends and getting laid, and our bookworm Laurie is stuck babysitting as she seems to every year. The film does a great job in showing what enjoying the spooks of Halloween would have been like back in the 70's, kids watching popcorn and getting scared, dressing up in their cute costumes and stereotypical teenagers getting high and drunk.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film is set at night time which helps build its atmosphere and theme terrifically. The setting is great, Haddonfield, Illinois (which was actually filmed in california), with the big traditional style houses and big looming trees over the streets is perfect for a serial killer and the The musical score is the other thing for me that makes this film so amazing. the simple but very intimidating piano themes at the beginning of the main titles and throughout the film gets stuck in your head very easily and it repeats on your mind deliberately as your watching it. It's a perfect mysterious and frightening tone that tells you this is indeed not a movie with a nice subject matter.<br/><br/>The movie is literally 40 years old so there's really no point complaining about the quality of acting or the gore effects (if you think there even is any to begin with), but Jamie-lee Curtis in her debut role and Donald Pleasance are very memorable characters who we can't help but appreciate for what they bring to this film.<br/><br/>Put simply, Halloween is a classic slasher with all the familiar cliches. characters getting killed off one by one, the killer repeatedly getting up after being downed, freakish musical score, dark and memorable setting, it's a classic in it's own right.

","October 31st 1963; Mike Myers kills his sister and 15 years later on 'Halloween Night' he returns and goes on a killing spree after he manages to escape from psychiatric hospital staff that are transporting him to a mental institution. His doctor Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and the local sheriff are the only people in the area that know he has escaped and do their utmost to track him down...<br/><br/>Notable for being the film debut of established actress Jamie Lee Curtis, Halloween is a very good film but this in largely down to Carpenter's wonderful ability in building up and creating suspense. Carpenter leaves us hanging for nearly an hour before Myers begins killing, but he does make good use of the time (the film is most effective when Carpenter uses the first person/POV approach as this is when the film is at its most chilling). The thing with Halloween is that it is largely carried by atmosphere and tension - in fact these aspects of the film are strong enough to cover many of the film's weaknesses. Waiting for Myers to strike and determining whom he will kill first is the main hook that keeps you glued to the screen for the first hour, but like I say despite Carpenter's strengths as a director some of his weaknesses do show through as a writer...<br/><br/>For a start, Myers escape at the start is totally ludicrous; aside from never learning how he escapes, one has to wonder why hospital staff would transport a high security prisoner in a station wagon or estate car as it's known in the UK? Surely in the real world he would be transported in a prison van? Laurie sees Myers on several occasions, but then dismisses one of the kids when they say that they have seen him on several occasions? Donald Pleasance is a fabulous actor, but in Halloween he is effectively a 'chocolate fireguard' up until the final 10 minutes - his presence along with the Sheriff seem unnecessary and I felt that the film would have been no different if both Sheriff and Doctor were omitted from the film entirely.<br/><br/>The final sequence of events (whilst relatively tense) did feel as though they undermined a lot of the suspense that Carpenter had built up in the first hour. A lot of what you see in the finale is cheap and predictable although I did like the fact that Laurie used a knitting needle and coat hanger to attack Mike Myers - who needs a knife...<br/><br/>I think the one thing that ruined this film slightly for me is the way that Myers was depicted as being 'superhuman' - he gets stabbed with a knitting needle, coat hanger and shot about 6 times and then falls through a window only to then be able to get up and run away (ridiculous in itself, but is a really bad way to set up a franchise in my opinion).<br/><br/>Yes there are huge problems with this film, but the wonderful way that Carpenter builds the suspense in the first hour makes the whole experience worthwhile overall.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE; I also enjoyed the scene where Laurie and Tommy are watching the original 'The Thing' as John Carpenter directed a remake of this film 4 years after Halloween was released."
"matthewlee-47237","9","0","0","15 December 2017"," Man oh man do I love this movie!!!
","Halloween is one of the best and most intense horror films of all time, and it took me way too long to realize that. I first watched it ten years ago and enjoyed it, but I'd also been watching all the other slasher flicks and this one felt generic. But I revisited it recently to show it to my sister, and suddenly, all of the hype was very warranted.
I don't care that this was more or less the ""first slasher."" The fact that it was made on a shoestring budget is cool, but doesn't affect my rating of the film itself. What makes this film special is that it has the one thing that every single slasher after it has been lacking; Halloween has heart. It has REAL characters in a REAL place. The fact that Haddonfield is a lot like my own hometown, and the characters in the film are all like people I went to high school with makes this film hit very close to home and feel extremely genuine. Carpenter doesn't rely on gore or jump scares or special effects to scare you. He uses film techniques to create this feeling of suspense and pure terror.
What makes this movie a classic is that Carpenter uses music and actual performance and a sense of realism to convey what he wants the film to convey. He gives the town some heart and he makes us understand why we should feel fear. Michael himself doesn't look any more terrifying than Freddy Krueger or Jason Voorheis. What makes him scary is that he hits close to home.
I love this film. It holds a special place in my heart, and is always worth a watch around Halloween."

"bbmtl-21883","9","0","0","20 November 2017"," Brilliant political fable and a renewal of American horror
","In a pristine CinemaScope format with powerful and stunning framing, John Carpenter turned this film into a condensed version of his years of training and movie watching as a teen, and a specific homage to ""the"" master, Howard Hawks. On the night of Halloween, lateral travelings at ground level sweep a peaceful American suburb, where we know that a teenager who had assassinated his younger sister a few years earlier has come back after escaping from the asylum where he was being treated. Rustles in the trees, children playing in the schoolyard, preparations of masks for the evening, recurring white car crisscrossing the streets, and later The Thing (film produced by Howard Hawks in 1955) on TV screens-everything converges to increase the tension we feel, including the haunting musical score composed by John Carpenter himself. The moviegoer's pleasure resides in the setup of this device to increase anxiety-the killer only appears very late in the film, the first crimes occur off-camera until the paroxysmal finale, when Jamie Lee Curtis, helped by the young man's doctor, faces the killer who wears an inexpressive white mask, an emblematic and flamboyant image that's often been copied since.<br/><br/>The film sets itself apart from gore, a genre born a decade earlier in which blood flows and murders are explicitly detailed on screen. It rather uses suspense and a visceral discomfort, without voyeurism. John Carpenter's Halloween gave rise to several psychopathic characters, reviving enthusiasms for films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which then suffered three late, vulgar and dispensable sequels (Psycho II, II and IV). It was also followed at the same era by Jason from the Friday the 13th franchise (12 movies to date as a 13th installation is still announced) and Freddy Krueger in Nightmare on Elm Street (8 sequels). Halloween was also followed by nine sequels, the 10th directed by Rob Zombie (who also directed the 9th) and simply titled H2.<br/><br/>John Carpenter is one of those movie directors who led to a second golden age for American horror and fantasy (1975 to 1982), in which movies attempts to show America's daily life, and to capture on film society's rejects and the underbelly of derelict megalopolis. Political denunciation of corruption and misery is expressed through a production with effects that can be heavy, but are rich in ideas, in which each shot is filled with creative profusion and leads to a genuine renewal of the genre. Filmmakers such as Gary A. Sherman (Dead & Buried, Vice Squad), Tobe Hopper (Texas Chainsaw Massacre), Joe Dante (Piranha, The Howling) have made their best movies during that era and Abel Ferrara was revealed with The Driller Killer (1979) and Ms. 45 (1980).

","There are but a handful of movies in the history of film that could be said changed the very face of the horror genre forever. One of these is the 1978 immortal classic ""Halloween"" as directed by horror master John Carpenter. Set in the fictional town of Haddonfield, IL, the plot is so well known that it's barely worth mentioning here, other than to say an escaped mental patient named Michael Myers breaks out of the asylum he's been kept in for 15 years for killing his sister to terrorize the town's teenage girls on, you guessed it, Halloween night. Although the plot may not be the most complex, the film is elevated by that right mixture of talent, timing, and movie magic. John Carpenter is able to take what might have been an average slasher into a bona fide horror landmark. Almost everything great about this film is owed to Carpenter and his team, be it the camera angles, atmosphere, mood, the decision to use a creepy doctored up William Shatner mask for the killer (a mask that has gone into the annals of movie legend) and of course, who could forget that creepy music score composed by Carpenter himself. Without that piece alone, the movie wouldn't be anything near as infamous as it is. This is the film that launched the careers of so many Hollywood big wigs, from Carpenter and producing partner Debra Hill to Jamie Lee Curtis, and even the stardom of classically trained British actor Donald Pleasance as Michael's tortured psychiatrist who, in all honesty, is just as important to ""Halloween's"" success as John Carpenter is. This is the one, folks, the one that started the slasher craze of the 80's, the one that - for better or worse - launched the ""Halloween"" franchise, the one film you must see every Halloween. Miss it at your own peril. Happy Halloween!!!!!!"

","An huge example of low budget, almost bloodless violence, and strong music, can make for a pretty effective slasher/horror movie. Halloween is simply an American classic, and probably Director's John Carpenter best film to date, he also provides the popular score which is also masterful. The music actually makes you feel the events of this movie, but never overpowers it too much. The slowness of the film, gives you time to understand a simple story, and understand its characters. The whole movie is building up to a very scary, and very memorable climax. Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis, is probably the most memorable character in Halloween, next to Jamie Lee Curtis' helpless babysitter Laurie Strode, and of course Michael Myers himself, the creepy quiet, heavy breathing, masked killer of the movie. All 3 are great, but the minor characters are all great too. It's not your typical slasher movie, it's actually better, it doesn't depend on blood, it depends on the feel of the atmosphere, music, and your caring for some of these characters. Well directed, with strong performances, and pretty scary moments, Halloween is in my opinion, a true Horror classic. I highly recommend it."
"acemark102","7","0","0","1 November 2017"," An uneven yet effective classic
","Being the movie that popularized many of the tropes we see in slasher movies, does it still hold up? Much like Night of the Living Dead, the film manages to surpass the limitations of its budget and deliver a scary, occasionally uneven, experience. The slow pace and use of John Carpenter's minimalistic, yet effective score builds an atmosphere of dread, and the relatively smaller scale of the movie (the main setting is basically a single neighborhood, three houses at most) lets the viewer become familiar with their surroundings before the killings begin. The shots of Michael Myers appearing in and out of the darkness, as well as long shots of him from across the street, help give him a real presence and make him an effectively creepy villain. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are both excellent in their roles, with much of the supporting cast doing decently as well. Unfortunately, the film isn't without its moments of narm. While some times they're used effectively, the movie has an annoying habit of playing some loud, piercing sound effect whenever Myers does anything in the background, and it's not as effective as just having no sound effects and letting the audience take in the shot he appears in. A lot of times the dialogue can be hokey, and the ADR of Curtis' voice during the final chase can be pretty laughable (""THE KEEEEEEEEEYS!""). There's also the unfortunate matter that many of the scares can be seen as predictable because the film practically codified them as clichés, so modern viewers may find the movie boring as a result. That said, I still highly recommend Halloween as a great seasonal movie. The acting is mostly solid, the score is iconic and used well, Michael Myers makes for a great, creepy villain, and the smaller scale of the movie gives it a unique feeling of familiarity. If you're interested in the origins of the modern slasher movie, this is the movie to watch. Seven fake out scares out of ten."
"Screen_Blitz","8","0","0","31 October 2017"," John Carpenter's Halloween demonstrates a solid classic horror piece at its finest
","The late 80s was the age of numerous slasher horror films that later elevated into long-running franchises of far less superior sequels. John Carpenter's classic horror piece is the movie that raised wide influence of psychotic serial killers dressed in a mask and dispatching their victims of bladed weapons. Although Halloween was not the first slasher flick to hit the celluloid as the genre dates back to Alfred Hitchcock's classic 'Psycho', it is the film that set the bar of entries of the genre. The film is a spine-chiller from the opening moments when we are introduced to the psychotic killer Michael Myers, and the moments to follow are a series of sequences set to pull audiences into in dark, scare-your-heart-out frenzy where suspense is the key and the pacing moves at a reasonable speed. And if John Carpenter proves something crucial, it is that blood and gore, which stands as a staple of slasher pictures is only a bonus and not a necessity. This film opens up in 1963 where we meet Michael Myers, a mentally disturbed youngster who murders his parents and sister on Halloween night and is sent to live in a mental asylum. Fast forward to fifteen years, we meet high school teen Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis) who is asked to babysit her neighbor's young daughter Lindsay (played by Kyle Richards) and son Tommy (played by Brian Andrews). What starts off as a normal, peaceful night turns into a Halloween nightmare when Michael Myers (played by Nick Castle) escapes the mental asylum and begins stalking Laurie and her friends. And the worst part is, he has a knife and mask and is ready to murder them. <br/><br/>John Carpenter, director and writer, knows how to keep viewers shivering in their seat when things begin to go south. The minute the masked killer arrives on the scene, the atmosphere quickly boils, daring viewers to lean at the edge of their seats. If there is anything that the simple story falls short of, it is depth to what went wrong in the killer's background to turn him into the psychotic maniac. We are left to believe that he is just mentally ill. However, the film does not have time to dive into detail. It's main purpose is to scare the pants off of viewers, and with Carpenter's method on shooting each scene, generating sheer suspense, and warming the atmosphere with his eerie piano score that has now become iconic; it effectively gets the job done. Compared to most slasher flicks, this one is very tame on gore, so the graphic aftermath of the killer slaying his victims is mostly to your imagination. Carpenter's effective stabs piercing us with hair- raising scares brilliantly establishes the vulnerability of Jamie Lee Curtis's character as she is chased by the masked heathen. The only downside is Curtis's performance which, by today's standards, really did not age well and feels slightly below the bar of a solid performance. But there are just enough goods throughout the picture to forgive her for that. After all, Carpenter knows his way around the genre.<br/><br/>Halloween stands as a solid horror film that takes the crown on influencing many slasher projects of the 1980s, even if it is not the most glamorous entry of the horror genre. For an appropriate film to watch over the Halloween holiday, this movie bears a satisfying choice for those hungry for a good scare, if nothing more."

","Suspenseful in every way possible, John Carpenter's Halloween is a classic! An unforgettable, jaw-dropping, suspenseful masterpiece. Featuring a talented cast, including Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence.<br/><br/>Halloween begins with main antagonist Michael Myers, whom after murdering his sister on Halloween night (1963), returns home on the same night - fifteen years later - to resume his killing spree, following his escape from Warren County Smith's Grove Sanitarium. Pleasence's Dr Loomis is hot on his trail and will stop at nothing to track down his former patient.<br/><br/>Halloween sets a new bar for the horror and suspense genre and will keep audiences on the edge of their seat from start to finish. The cinematography and the well-paced screenplay is pleasing in many ways, as every suspenseful moment is captured so professionally. Every scene offers intriguing moments and keeps the viewer brainstorming, throughout, to find out what the main antagonist, Myers, is up against and when he will make his move.<br/><br/>Throughout, viewers will also be tuned into the classic, creepy soundtrack of the movie. There is a lot to enjoy here and Halloween is recommendable for everyone whom is a devoted fan to the horror and suspense genre."

","I first saw ""Halloween"" (1978) theatrically, during the first week of it's initial release during October 1978. To this day, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" remains a classic of the horror genre, with genuine suspense, terror and little blood. Though this independent film was shot on a small budget of only $300,000 in only 20 days, Carpenter's skilled direction is highly effective here, creating genuine suspense and terror throughout the film. The effective creepy stalking music score was composed by Carpenter himself in only four days. This film represents one of the first uses of the innovative Steadicam movie camera, which is used to excellent effect here showing the stalker's point of view. ""Halloween"" was hugely successful and became highly influential, as it created a new sub-genre of horror known as the slasher film. ""Halloween"" ranks as one of the finest suspenseful terrifying horror films of all time and the gold standard of all the slasher films which followed in it's success."

For those who have watched lots of horror movies, the old movie is boring and not exciting. However, we can easily be attracted by its features, which is its atmosphere making a spooky and creepy process as we follow the movie.

","The first 'Halloween' movie I ever watched was the Rob Zombie 2007 remake, it was long and awesome. I first heard of the remake when I saw it advertised on a bus. My friend, Ray recommended it to me and my brother, so we bought it and watched it the same day. But, after every remake I see, I'm bound to be interested in the original, and see all the differences in storytelling and which one I think is better and holds together more. I would have to go for the 2007 film, but I'll talk about that one way, way, way later.<br/><br/>PROS: What I really like about this film is that the slasher concept of it is not very violent or gory, as it doesn't need to be. This film did follow in the same footsteps as an earlier slasher film, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', which did feature a lot of blood, and in those days, BLOOD= SCARY. But what John Carpenter (the writer AND director AND music composer) has mainly dealt with for this film is atmosphere and suspense, and he certainly builds a lot of it. I also think that the premise makes for a great story and is very important to how well this film holds together. Musically, the score is very good and adds in that bit more of suspense. The actors are very good, too!<br/><br/>CONS: I guess the only negative part of the film to me is that 2 of the films main characters, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) do not interact as much as I thought they should have.

","For me a good comedy is one which makes me laugh, a good drama one which makes me weep or at least feel a lump in my throat, a message movie one which makes me feel the message and agree with it and a horror movie one which scares me indeed. Well this movie scared me enough though not too much. Its slow rhythm keeps us waiting for the climax all the time playing on our nerves and when it comes it doesn't disappoint us. That means that the movie is well balanced in terms of images and suggestions. Are we before a man which is insane beyond any limits and has got almost superhuman powers or are we before a creature which is human only in appearance and is indeed an evil supernatural being in human shape? The movie never explains it fully which adds to its terrifying power. A few flaws here and there are mere details and don't spoil much the logic of the plot. We can ask for instance why the plate number of the car stolen by the murderer isn't communicated to all authorities in which case he would have been quickly caught. But maybe it was and doesn't need to be mentioned in the movie because everything happened so quickly and the murderer went to a small town where that information would perhaps not get quickly enough. Well anyway if the murderer was caught too soon the story could not be told and the movie could not be made. Summing it up we can call this movie goodish after all."

"sjwest","8","0","0","23 June 2003"," The one that started it all.
","There are a number of labels attached to this movie which have led to it being incorrectly classified. This is because the movie is so good at evoking terror that it accomplishes more than what is given.  <br/><br/>
The first one is that this is a slasher movie. Although it can be seen why this label became attached  a bogeyman with no motive killing teenagers  there are more than enough reasons why this label is false. Firstly the body count is low. Carpenter relies on keeping the audience in a state of high tension by suggesting something horrific is about to occur rather than having it actually occur. This is done by letting the audience know where Michael is and not the teens. He also lets Laurie sense the ominous presence and allows her to catch glimpses of him. The audience knows what is there and the knowledge that they have suspends them in horror as they see and know the evil that stalks Laurie. The unwitting heroine is heading for a terrifying encounter with Michael and the audience is along for the journey. A sense of powerlessness pervades them which accentuates their terror. Carpenter has thus created a movie that can be classified more as terror and horror rather than a slasher flick. It is not in the same class as Psycho' but parallels can be drawn. <br/><br/>Another label is that of the babysitter killer. Michael does not stalk babysitters in particular. He is motivated by a dark obsession to kill his sister Laurie. The fact that Laurie and one of his victims are babysitters is not central to his drive. As Dr Sam Loomis, his psychiatrist, diagnosed he is catatonic seemingly oblivious to the world around him existing only for one purpose  the right moment to stalk and kill his sister. This inexplicable drive is another source of terror for the audience. They have a fear for the unknown and when the unstoppable evil has no motive, this unknown element creates a more inhuman killer who will kill all who stands in his way.<br/><br/>The fact that Carpenter is the screenwriter, director and soundtrack composer is the most obvious reason why this movie is so good. He created the words and translated these into images. He then composed a soundtrack to accentuate what he was attempting to achieve with the images. Thus we do not have three separate visions of the movie and Carpenter uses his multiple talents very well here.<br/><br/>For me it is the soundtrack that lingers most on the memory. We have heard the same soundtrack effect in Jaws'. As the killer approaches it's victim, the soundtrack pitches in volume and intensity as more instruments are added at a greater pace. This accentuates the illusion of an ever closing killer which escalates with audience tension. The deep piano sound darkens the atmosphere. This is probably Carpenters greatest talent and the one he enjoys applying the most. The fact that some actors put in very weak performances is indicative of the fact that he pays more attention to other things  fortunately for us an excellent soundtrack.<br/><br/>Michael's mask has been the face of terror for years. The killer who does not show emotion and is almost featureless means that you cannot reason with this man or appeal to any source of emotion he may have. The mask makes him less human and thus detached from ordinary man. By referring to Michael as the shape adds to this effect of creating an evil entity rather than a mad human being. This same effect is evident in Jason and Freddie, other horror movie villains, but they are behind the most infamous mask of all  the Captain Kirk mask of Michael.<br/><br/>The performances range from good to mediocre. Donald Pleasance was the archetypal opponent for his evil characters. He gave believability to some of the cheesiest lines in movie history. Examples: `he had the blackest eyes, the devils eyes' and `he's gone, the evil has gone'. His contribution highlights our impression of Michael as pure evil. Jamie Lee Curtis is less convincing, but her weak performance makes he seem more vulnerable to Michael and thus indirectly adds to the illusion.<br/><br/>This movie is a horror classic and is wholly undeserving of the horrendously pale sequels that it gave birth to, with the possible exception of the first sequel. Things got worse from there. Anyone wanting to see how one person can combine the various elements of filmmaking should look to the original one as a great exponent."

Little did John Carpenter and Debra Hill know back in 1977 while making this movie they were making the benchmark for all horror movies to come. Director's like Wes Craven and Tobe Hooper would go on record as saying that Halloween was the standard that they tried to live up to. Even if not a fan of horror movie fans will be mesmerized by young Carpenters cinematic genius. Carpenter made a true horror movie out of Halloween. With virtually no blood and guts in this movie Carpenter gave this a feel of the horror movies of the 50's and 60's where you got a good scare without a monster pulling off someones face in plain view."

Although, differently from your average 'Friday the 13th' movie, it has LITTLE gore, the teenagers DON'T Die 30 seconds apart from each other until the dumb blonde in ripped clothes runs around for half an hour, doing Superhuman escape moves and endurance (Eg. Jumping out of a Window, Falling Through the Porch, Landing Outside on Rocks and Pavement, then getting up and walking away? -Friday the 13th 4: The Final Chapter). This one just made alot of suspense. Micheal didn't just pop up and KILL the person, you just saw him stare at him/her for a second, and then dissapear, before the person notices anyone was there. You sit there, thinking ""Now he's gonna kill her!"" and...No..he just stares and disappears. It's COMPLETELY Unpredictable. Which, is needed in this Genre.

"onnanob2","8","0","0","22 November 2002"," The perfect film to watch on Halloween.
","""Halloween"" gradually became a huge success at the box office in 1978, and it continues to be a perfect horror selection for any Halloween. The film has a simple story that had a lot of thought and care put into it, which makes it a seasonal treat: A small boy named Michael Myers had murdered his older sister in a small town on Halloween Night. The boy was then locked away for several years in a psychiatric hospital. Now a grown man (billed as The Shape, and played by Nick Castle), he escapes the confines of the hospital to go back to his boyhood hometown where the murder had happened. He seems obsessed on stalking a teenage girl named Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), the one who comes closest to the now dilapidated house where he murdered his sister years before. He watches her and follows her. He also watches and follows the young boy (Brian Andrews) she's talking to as she drops off a key to the dilapidated house. Laurie will be babysitting the boy later that Halloween Night. During the day she catches glimpses of the masked Michael Myers several times, and it kind of haunts her. In the early evening Laurie is picked up by her friend, Annie (Nancy Loomis), since they are both babysitting children in the same neighborhood. Their friend Lynda (P.J. Soles), plans on stopping at the house where Annie is babysitting, so she and her boyfriend can have some ""quality time"" in one of the bedrooms. Michael Myers had followed the girls to the neighborhood where they will be babysitting the children. He watches and waits until it is the right time to begin his murderous terror on Halloween Night. ""Halloween"" certainly has that small town feel, and there are visual details (leaves falling off trees, trick-or-treaters, carved jack-o-lanterns) that give the film the mood of Halloween Night. There are also audio details (creaking doors and floorboards, etc.) that enhance the mood of the film. Also giving ""Halloween"" that seasonal feel is the use of clips from older thrillers ""The Thing From Another World,"" and ""Forbidden Planet,"" which are being aired on television that Halloween Night. The music soundtrack to ""Halloween"" is simple, but now classic. Every Halloween you can hear the main theme of ""Halloween"" used as background music to radio and television commercials. There was even a 90's techno rendition of the theme. The music by director John Carpenter is dark and chilling, and is one of the film's greatest features. The film also features extremely effective lighting. The night atmosphere is perfectly set in the neighborhood where the girls are babysitting; due to porch lights and lit jack-o-lanterns. The interior lighting is good, and the use of blue lighting excellently helps with the atmosphere and shadows. The acting in ""Halloween"" is mostly very good, and Jamie Lee Curtis gave a great performance in her first feature film (she would again work with director John Carpenter in ""The Fog."") Charles Cyphers (previously in John Carpenter's ""Assault On Precinct 13,"" and also in ""The Fog"") turns in a very good performance. Nancy Loomis (also in ""Assault On Precinct 13"" and ""The Fog"") nicely plays Annie, and P.J. Soles put a lot of spunk into her role as Lynda. Even the children (Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews) turn in very good performances. Donald Pleasence plays his Dr. Sam Loomis character very well, and would later play the character again in the film's sequels. The makers of ""Halloween"" put in a lot of effort to create a chilling and atmospheric horror film, and that effort greatly shows. ""Halloween"" may not be a perfect film, but it is very entertaining and the perfect film to watch on Halloween. On a side note, I have seen the film ""Black Christmas"" (mentioned in other ""Halloween"" reviews) a few times, and feel there are not too many similarities between the two films. ""Black Christmas"" has its own style and story. I greatly prefer ""Halloween."""

","Today, some may look down on it as a horrible slasher film piece of shlock made in the seventies oozing with teenage sex and violence. They couldn't be more wrong. 'Halloween' (1978) did begin countless slasher films dripping with countless teenage sex scenes and even more violent scenes involving horrible dialogue with one dimensional cardboard cut out stock characters. In every slasher film, it was the same: The big breasted bimbo, the jock, the joker, the stoned out character, the easy-to-kill black character the obvious virginal heroine and her suave sophistichated boyfriend (Although not all had one) who would also be killed off quick. The original thing about this film is that it had all these characters before they became the norm. Back then, it was truly suspensful. Of course, 'Halloween' still rises above the imitators either way, mainly because this one is a truly scary piece of psychological terror that gets even better with multiple viewings, as I discovered recently when I bought it in the 'Halloween: Ultimate Collection' DVD box set. The film begins with a different kind of opening credits. It features an evil, smiling pumpkin which the camera closes up to as the ever so memorable 'Halloween' theme tune runs on. After these credits quickly finish, we find ourselves in the POV of an unkown character outside a house. It's 1963 and we move around the house, eventually killing a young girl called Judith Myers who screams ""Michael!"" at us. At the end of this long shot the mask is pulled off us by Michael Myer's parents. Michael is 6 years old and has just killed his sister. Cut to 15 years later, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) is travelling to MIchael Myer's trial with his assistant Marion (Nancy Stephens) when Michael breaks out of his asylum and steals their car. His mission is to travel to his hometown of Haddonfield to kill a small town babysitter Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first role). The story is simple, I could give more plot points and character names but there is no point to that. The plot and characters are simple. 'Halloween' is meant as a very scary piece of fun and it succeeds on those counts. It's harmless fun yet it will have you jumping miles out of your seat but director John Carpenter does not rely on jump scares all the time. Most of the time, he builds suspense usually with his own haunting score. The film will have you on the edge of your seat more times than jumping out of it. The film's killer, Michael Myers' walks around slowly and patiently wearing a chalk white human face mask with sticky out hair. Michael is a one of a kind villain. Expertly written by Carpenter and Debra Hill and directed by Carpenter, his stalking scenes go up there with famous scenes like the shower scene in 'Psycho' or the any part of 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. But the person you have to thank most for those scares is Michael Myers himself, Nick Castle. An all-round nice guy who was cast as the killer because Carpenter saw a ""dark side"", Castle manages to play Michael in the right frame of mind with the right mood, building some of the best scares in the movies. It is he you have to truly thank for the role. For people who may not know this, an interesting fact is that during the unmasking scene of Michael, it is not Castle's face behind the mask but that of Tony Moran. The rest of the cast also deserve some sort of medal for their roles. Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles are all excellent as the trio of giggling girls. Donald Pleasance is absolutely brilliant (and completely essential) in his role as Sam Loomis, he really excells in the role. A nice thing to see. Charles Cyphers is pretty impressive in his role as the disbelieving sherrif of Haddonfield, not happy that Loomis is spreading his small happy town with horrible rumours. The camerawork and overall style of the movie is nicely done by Carpenter and makes it essential for repeat viewings, so you can see stuff you missed. I could rave on and on about this movie but I'll finish up by saying that 'Halloween' is essential viewing. It is the father of all horror films and Myers is the father of all serial killers. Go see it."

"Cowman","4","0","0","2 November 2002"," It's good, but is it really THAT good?
","HALLOWEEN, the infamous stalk 'n slash flick about an escaped lunatic bent on brutally murdering random teenagers, has often been hailed as the ""scariest movie of all time"".  It has been compared to (and sometimes even held above) PSYCHO, THE EXORCIST, and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.  It was, until recently, the most successful, most profitable independent movie in cinema history.  It helped launch the careers of several young, struggling actors and filmmakers.  And as of 2002, it has spawned seven big-budget sequels.<br/><br/>Okay, so we've established the fact that John Carpenter's HALLOWEEN has received a lot of attention and critical acclaim.  But honestly, is it really deserving of all of this praise?  Was it really worth all the hype surrounding it?  As a devout fan of not only horror movies, but of the art of filmmaking in general, I'm going to have to say no.<br/><br/>I strongly feel that HALLOWEEN, although stylish, horrifying, and generally well-made, should not be ranked among such classics as PSYCHO, T.C.M., or ROSEMARY'S BABY.  These films were far ahead of their time and broke new ground. HALLOWEEN, despite singlehandedly popularizing the slasher subgenre, was really nothing new, even for 1978.  Why didn't films like A BAY OF BLOOD (1971), I DISMEMBER MAMA (1974), ALICE SWEET ALICE (1976), or SUSPIRIA (1977) get this much credit?  They all had a formula similar to that of HALLOWEEN's, and in many ways, they were much better*...And they were made just a few years before!<br/><br/>Even in Italy, birthplace of some of horror's most talented filmmakers (Dario Argento, Mario Bava, Ruggero Deodato, Lucio Fulci, etc.), HALLOWEEN is still considered a cult classic!  You'd think that a country that has been responsible for some of the most horrifying motion pictures ever made would've seen the fad for what it was, and not have given in.  But I suppose trends like these are often international, especially when they originate from a nation as influential as the United States.  Again, keep in mind that I'm not trying to say that HALLOWEEN is a bad movie; only that it has been done many times before 1978--and better.<br/><br/>* This particular comment does not apply to ""I DISMEMBER MAMA"", which --ahem-- is not really what I'd consider a ""good movie""."
"Django-21","8","0","0","2 November 2002"," A genuine classic!
","This film is a genuine classic of the horror genre and not for nothing is it the most celebrated of slasher movies.  Contrary to popular myth it's not the first movie of it's kind (nor is the also terrifying ""Black Christmas"") but what makes it a classic is the performances, writing, cinematography, editing and above all it's flawlessly crafted by John Carpenter who was at the time a master of his craft.  Not only is his directing effective but his theme for the movie is one of the most recognisable horror film themes and gives the film a sense of ominous foreboding throughout.  The direction also gives a sense of unease to even the daylight scenes. Donald Pleasance, Jamie Leigh Curtis, Charles Cypher, Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles all give great performances in the film and the teen characters are well observed.  The film spends just enough time with the teen characters to convince you that they are believable characters.  Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles have some amusing quips throughout the film that keep the teen scenes enjoyable. Dr Loomis is a great character and Donald Pleasance gives a quirky neurotic performance that can be both amusing and gives some gravitas to the proceedings when he rants about how evil and dangerous Michael Myers is (and the film gives us no reason to doubt this). Some superb scares and thrills throughout.  This film scared the hell out of me when I was a kid and still packs a punch.  One scene in particular will always have you checking the back seat of a car before getting in. The end of the movie when Laurie Strode finds out what has been happening to her friends and discovers that there really is a<br/><br/>""boogey man"" is tense and gripping throughout up to the end credits.  John Carpenter was my favourite director when I was a<br/><br/>kid and this is a masterful exercise in why that was."
"erwan_ticheler","10","0","0","1 November 2002"," Ultimate Shocker!
","Halloween is one of the best horror-thriller movies ever. Everybody knows the story so I won't write that down. What makes this movie so chilling is the fact that for about an hour nothing really happens(but it doesn't bore one second) although you feel that at any moment all hell can break loose. Another great part of Halloween is the camera work, it doesn't move or shock when you see, for instance, Myers wander around in search of his victims. The soundtrack is although very ""simple"" very effective and is a soundtrack classic. The acting is not so important although Jamie Lee Curtis(even as a dear school-girl she looks stunning) plays very well and screams perfectly. The Shape is movie history and quite rightly so because the way that Myers moves around and kills his victims without remorse is unforgettable. Just look at the scene when he kills Tommy by ""hanging"" him with a big kitchen knife, the Shapes ultimate weapon!<br/><br/>The ending is rather over the top, you know when Myers can't be killed not even by multiple gun-shots but at the end who cares? Halloween made movies like Friday the 13th and Scream possible if not other dozens of Horror movies, for instance the inferior sequels of Halloween. It is the perfection of suspense combined with horror. 9/10"

Parts of the film will scare you like when Bob goes to get a beer or when the seemingly dead Michael Myers is getting up behind Laurie.<br/><br/>The score is one of the best in any horror films. It was very basic but very scary. <br/><br/>Michael Myers was a very scary character. He killed his sister in 1963 and spent 15 in a mental institute. He steals a car and goes to Haddonfield. In Haddonfield Laurie Strode and Annie Brackett are babysitting across the street from each other. Meanwhile Michael's doctor Sam Loomis is trying to stop what he knows is going to happen. He says to the Sheriff ""I spent 8 years trying to reach that boy 7 trying to keep him locked up because what was behind that boys eyes was simply pure evil"" What made Michael scarier in this film is that he didn't mess about. He killed them and pursued his next victim. In sequels he messed about.<br/><br/>Make no mistake this should not be the best horror you've seen. Dan Grant asked in his review ""what horror film would you rather watch?"" I would rather watch films from the Children of the Corn series which mostly are from the 90's which he keeps mouthing off about for bad horror. Yes the best Children of the Corn film was in the 80's but the 90's wasn't bad. He has a point though, modern horror should be like Halloween. Using the same technique and suspense.<br/><br/>I Know What You Did Last Summer is the only modern teen killer movie that can compare with Halloween. Halloween shaped horror. Every horror fan should know that.<br/><br/>Halloween is unpredictable but the predictable parts are scary when they eventually happen (good use of suspense) for example when Annie Brackett is getting into the car. <br/><br/>This isn't very gory so you shouldn't be put off and every horror fan should watch this!

"The_unemployed_cynic","9","0","0","18 October 2002"," The secret is in the writing
","Halloween is by far John Carpenter's best movie, and one of the most important horror movies ever made. It gave the cliche-ridden and almost extinct horror movie industry at the end of the seventies an adrenaline shot that has kept it alive for many years. Before Halloween, most horror movies had been about weird creatures in unlikely places. Dracula and Frankenstein were realistic only to the inhabitants of abandoned castles in England and travellers to Transylvania. Carpenter brought terror to the safe, familiar, boring American suburban environment.<br/><br/>The movie is an endless stream of classic scenes. The opening scene, of course, with it's innovative use of a hand-held camera, the breathing, the little clues (like the picking up of the mask) that force us to overcome our disbelief when the killer's identity is revealed. This is followed by a haunting scene in which a doctor and a nurse are driving to a mental institution to pick up a dangerous patient. Through the rain, we suddenly see patients wandering around like zombies in their long white gowns. We feel in our gut that something is terribly wrong. This feeling will stay with us throughout the film, even after we leave the theater. The best way to describe this feeling is... horror.<br/><br/>What makes Halloween the gem it is? The secret is in the writing. Carpenter has shown in many of his later films that he is a great director of horror flicks. He still knows how to set up a shock. Unfortunately, he has never again had a script like this."

"Sonatine97","Null","0","0","25 August 2002"," A Chilling Reminder of Carpenter During His Prime!
","Contains Spoilers!! John Carpenter's best years for movies were in the 70s when he was very much an unknown working the independent-studio circuit and making films as cheaply as possible with limited finances but without sacrificing the quality that goes into such superb film.<br/><br/>And as a consequence from 1974 to roughly 1986 Carpenter offered us such classic indies as, Dark Star, Assault On Precinct 13, The Fog, The Thing and Big Trouble in Little China. All of them had their cult following and all of them had a lot of film critics buzzing with praise & plaudits but only Halloween became perhaps one of the most influential movies in movie history.<br/><br/>Although a generally simple concept of a maniac-on-the-loose, that had done before in lesser films previous to Halloween in '78, a lot of them lacked the style and above all, the sheer terror of this Carpenter offering.<br/><br/>Even the opening titles were enough to set the mood in no uncertain terms: a halloween pumpkin with a rather threatening ""smile"" slowly coming into the camera's focus while a pair of synthesizers pound out one of those nerve-jangling & ominous film scores that really sets the mood.<br/><br/>Then we see a POV of our killer stalking the house of his sister who is making out with her boyfriend late at night. He then makes his way into the house when the boyfriend has left, enters her bedroom and then stares for what seems like forever before killing her.<br/><br/>So far, so normal. This kind of thing has been done a few times although never quite so calculating or sucessful. But what really makes this scene so shocking is that we then get to look at our killer, but instead of expecting some cruel & twisted adult, it is in fact the 6 year old boy of the sister he has just stabbed to death. And not only that but when the police arrive and capture him we find he was wearing a hockey mask throughout the entire murder.<br/><br/>An absolutely shocking first few minutes that totally unsettles its audience right from the very first note of the film score to the removal of the hockey mask some 6 minutes later. Carpenter is clearly very influenced by the works of Hitchcock but he succeeds where other lesser directors failed and packaged an opening with such calculating menace that lets the audience know we're going to be in for a roller-coaster 90 minutes of terror.<br/><br/>Throughout the film the lingering threat never seems to go away, even during the daylight scenes. Most horror films only really come alive when all is dark & sinister, but not so with Halloween. Carpenter uses everyday things to play hide & seek with our wits. One of the best examples is the escaped killer hiding behind a line of white bed sheets as he stalks the unsuspecting Jamie Lee Curtis. We get to see him only for an instant thanks to a sudden gust of wind that reveals his identity as the bed sheet tosses in the air. But for that one moment is just as terrifying as anything that goes on during the night, when an audience is expecting something horrible to happen.<br/><br/>Carpenter, very much like Steven Spielberg's Jaws, likes to tease us and tantalise us with never revealing the presence of the ""monster"" too early. He likes to play mind games with us so that we ourselves feel like we're been stalked in the same way.<br/><br/>Another highlight in the film is the way Carpenter unsettles us even more with the treatment of the dead people the maniac has killed. Perhaps the best example is the corpse of a murdered girl lying on her bed with her throat cut and the real tombstone of the killer's first victim at her head. Such simple little devices that work so well in Carpenter's hands.<br/><br/>Another similarity with the shark in Jaws is that this particular monster simply will not die as any normal person would do. Not even bullets, knives or falling out of first floor windows have any desired effect until perhaps the very ending. And as a consequence neither the audience or the potential victim in Curtis is allowed off the hook with a standard good-guy kills bad-guy finale.<br/><br/>The acting, chiefly, from old master Donald Pleasence and newcomer, Jamie Lee Curtis, is to be honest the weakest part of the film, although Curtis just does enough to make us care enough for her welfare.<br/><br/>Its also interesting that most of the killings that take place throughout the film occur usually straight after the eventual vicitms have had sex. I guess a lot of psychiatrists watching had a great deal to say about that.<br/><br/>It is not surprising, therefore, that this film became one of the biggest box-office successes in the horror genre ever, and by itself created a whole new industry of what is now somewhat unkindly called ""slasher movies"" but spawned some great films like ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Friday 13th"", and both of those films had their own franchises as well.<br/><br/>As for Carpenter, well he hasn't hit the high notes ever since ""Big Trouble In Little China"" back in 86 and even that film wasn't all that great. Ever since then he has had a succession of poorly directed or poorly received horror movies that simply don't have those key ingredients so evident in Halloween, which is a great great shame.<br/><br/>The logic of Halloween doesn't stand up to close scrutiny but back in the late 70s this film set the world alight and Halloween nights were never quite the same again!<br/><br/>***/*****"

I didn't think anything of it and turned the channel. (I had never seen the movie before, so I didn't even know I was watching it.) Later on, I rented it from the video store and watched it all the way through, twice. I loved this movie, it was everything a slasher film should and probably ever will be. The story revolves around a young boy named Michael Myers who kills his sister and is put in an institution, he escapes and begins to kill babysitters while trying to track down a girl named Laurie Strode.

It is the origin of 'the slasher flick'...and Michael Myers is the father of very Freddy Kreuger, Jason Vorhees, and every other too bit knockoff.<br/><br/>Halloween was directed by one time horror master, and genre veteran John Carpenter, and easily his masterpiece. The film stars Jamie Lee Curtis, in the film that would catapult her from little known actress to the crown princess of horror, and genre favorite for many years to come.<br/><br/>The film takes place of course, over the course of two Halloween nights, set nearly twenty years apart. The film opens with a young child, named Michael Myers dawning a clown costume, to which we are treated with an excellent and atmospheric third person view. The young boy walks into his sister's room right after she has finished making love to her boyfriend, and inexplicably stabs her to death. His parents come to find the boy in a near catatonic state. The film then fast forwards about fifteen years later, where and adult Michael Myers has espcaped a mental institution, and is in route home to once again kill, with his dr. in pursuit. The rest of the film revolves around Laurie,(Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends, and their night of terror on Halloween as they are stalked by the stealth assassin that is Michael Myers.<br/><br/>What makes Halloween such incredible film is the way in which every scene is handled. To truly appreciate the film, it will more than likely require more than one viewing to catch all the scenes in which you are treated to Michael Myers stalking his prey in the background...with him looking through windows and doorways at his prey in the background of the shot. John Carpenter does a good job of making Michael Myers, or 'The Shape', appear just as that. At some points alomst like an extension of the night, a pure entity of evil that seems to appear from nowhere and attack with ruthless aggression.<br/><br/>
The film proceeds until only Laurie is left with Micheal...and despite several attempts to kill him, is unsuccessful as The Shape is portrayed to be seemingly impervious to pain.<br/><br/>As with all of my reviews i try not to give any significant plot details away, and will uphold to that here.<br/><br/>John Carpenter directed this film in a manner where the viewer is kept on the edge their seats, even when they can see The Shape within plain view. Carpenter also is credited with the films perfect and eerie musical score, and in the process, crafted the most memorable movie theme ever.<br/><br/>This film is seemingly the inspiration for all slasher films...breathing life into the horror genre, and dollars in the box office at the time of it's release. To truly enjoy this film, go out and get the 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition VHS or DVD...containing extra footage and tons of other goodies.<br/><br/>Also, I almost kicked myself for forgetting this, be on the look out for Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis, Michael Myers doctor and the only man who truly knows just how evil and inhuman Myers truly is. It is his character alone that transcended many of the half hearted, ill conceived sequels that inevitable destroyed the legacy Carpenter had crafted."

","Yes this is proved to be the best horror slasher ever! it took 20 days to shoot, on a budget of $300,000 with $200,000 to get actor Donald Pleasance (RIP)the movie went on to make 50 million in (1978)!!!, it creatored the slasher genre as it took 18 years for the next slasher to come out from psycho (1960) on halloweens release the immitators were created, most notably jason and freddy now known as rip offs! Halloween was a great success, The character Michael Myers is now the leading icon of the horror villain, it is also proved that Halloween has many if not more fans than famous movies like star wars! Halloween out grossed movies like the godfather, casablanka and gone with the wind, and still was the most engrossing movie ever untill the great movie Titanic was released... Halloween is the best horror out there (The Exorcist is known as the scariest not the best, as we know). Halloween has more things going for it than any other horror movies with merchandise, fans, web sites and more... even on world-wide polls (where you can vote!) you will see on horror polls that Michael Myers remains as cinemas and everyones favourite villan and halloween gets placed as best horror ever (as it is no other horror movie has made more money than this!) Carpenter and creators did a very good job.<br/><br/>Here are words from the Halloween 2 disk special DVD...<br/><br/>""Untill recently it was the highest engrosing independant movie ever...""<br/><br/>""How many movies keep their popularity after 20 years? Halloween is the Gone with the wind of the horror movies"".<br/><br/>""He may be the only mass murderer on a first name basis with movie audiences around the world"".<br/><br/>""Halloween left the door open for two decades worth of immitators, but none have had the nail-biting effectivness of Michael Myers...""<br/><br/>Now you know this movie is great and shouldn't be missed, so if you looking for a great movie this is it, now you know it is a great movie and created the slasherm it shouldnt be missed!

","I'm a little ashamed because I saw 'Halloween' last year. But I didn't regret it. Even though I wasn't scared by the film, it was a still a very beautiful work of art. I'm 16, but if I saw this when I was 10 or 11 I probably would have got nightmares from it. But now, I wasn't scared, I mean Michael Myers does a half an hour just watching at his victim. Come on, I wanted to see, blood and gore and knifes cutting peoples guts out. After 3 quarters something finally happened (luckily). <br/><br/>I was a little bored at first, but when I saw the whole film and tried to analyse it, I came to the conclusion that it is one of the best horror movies ever. If John Carpenter directed it, it has to be a great film. With this movie, he probably came closer to Hitchcock than everyone else could. There's a lot of suspense in it. The music is very famous and I love it. The story is good, Jamie 'Miss Scream' Lee Curtis is in it. And Michael Myers is just pure evil, as the mysterious, unstoppable 'Bogeyman'. It couldn't get better than this. If you want to look for a decent horror movie with A plot, this is the one for you. Sleep tight and I wish you sweet dreams after watching this.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","John Carpenter's 1978 slasher classic, is the dawning of one of today's most infamous movie monsters. Michael Myers and his presence fills horror buffs like myself, with excitement everytime he shows up. Carpenter's original is still a staple of the genre ofcourse, with it's atmosphere, death scenes and excellent dialogue, coming most memorably from Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis.<br/><br/>At the beginning, Michael Myers is a young kid of 6, working his way into his house and stabbing his sister several times with the infamous butcher knife. After that, the movie takes place several years later, where Michael escapes his asylum in Smith's Grove, and heads back to Haddonfield, where Loomis begins the hunt that would never stop until Halloween : The Curse of Michael Myers. Michael is after his sister, of course this isn't known to film-goers until the sequel. One-by-one he hacks up Laurie Strode's friends until the great chase for her life begins and doesn't let up.<br/><br/>Carpenter did excellent in what would be his first horror film. He knew his stuff very well. He uses the night scenes in this movie incredibly. We never know what's out there, or when it's there. That along with the pacing, atmosphere and blowing winds all add up to a great hypnotic experience that entrances us all the way through, until the shocking ending, which ofcourse continued in the great sequel Halloween II. This is a great basic horror film, that will live on with the best of them."

""Halloween"" is one of the earlier examples.<br/><br/>A taught, excellent thriller, one of the first real ""slasher"" movies, with John Carpenter directing with panache. The camera angles, the point-of-view-of-the-killer views, the darkness... all create genuinely unsettling moments of unease. Every frame is filled in the outline with something, a tree branch etc. and Michael Myers seems to be lurking everywhere.<br/><br/>Many nods to Hitchcock throughout, the most obvious being the casting of Jamie Lee Curtis in her debut role - her mother, Janet Leigh, appeared in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and the infamous shower scene.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" has thus far spawned 7 sequels.

I own all the Halloweens and all different versions of them.  I have Halloween posters all over my wall, I have all the dolls and memorobilia.  I guess you can call me a huge fan because I am.<br/><br/>I remember watching this movie for the first time when I was a kid and I grew up loving it so this movie to me is not only a film, it's my childhood. It's everything I was scared of.<br/><br/>I always knew this movie was amazing but just recently before the opening of Halloween Ressurection, I decided to watch this movie again cause as you get older, movies look more different and now I am 21 so why not.<br/><br/>I watched it and fell in love with it even more.  I must admit that my favourite Halloween in the past was part 2 but not anymore.  John Carpenter's Halloween is probably the most underrated movie of all time.<br/><br/>
The score is absolutely haunting.  The acting by Jamie Lee Curtis is so real and the beauty about this is that it was her first acting gig so she was fresh, it was real and you get that feeling.  Donald Pleasance, God Bless him, did probably one of his best acting roles of his career probably.  His character as Michaels nemesis was so great.  I love how he represents good and Michael represents evil.  How can you even forget the face of evil. Michael Myers is the best villain in movie history by far.  His mask is brilliant as they took it off William Shatner but I love it so much.  It looks emotionless and that's what is so scary about it.  The plot is absolutely flawless.  I know for a fact that this is the best horror movie out there.<br/><br/>

"NeoMyers","10","0","0","13 July 2002"," The film that spawned more than two decades of imitators...
","""Halloween"" is truly a remarkable film. It broke the mold in many regards. While seeming tame compared to contemporary horror movies, ""Halloween"" was quite violent for the time and it could be argued as ""Psycho's"" replacement in the category of horror/thriller. ""Psycho"" appealed to one audience, ""Halloween"" to another.<br/><br/>The character of Michael Myers is more of a realistic serial killer compared to that of Jason or Freddy. Michael is smart, he's smooth, he fades in with the shadows. Jason's more of a brainless behemoth and in Jason X they scanned his brain and declared that it was abnormally small. No matter the circumstances, Michael always manages to come out on top.<br/><br/>The storyline of Halloween is more developed too. We see a clear progression of the Myers character through his actions and the actions of his chief adversary, Dr. Loomis. The movie starts out with a brutal murder and moves slowly along until Myers jolts you back into the movie with his seemingly senseless murders.<br/><br/>The ending builds with suspense until the final moment when you're still left terrified and hoping for a ""Halloween II."" That, in itself, is the sign of a good horror movie."

Then the killer steps in killing that girl and killing the other two people The funny part is when jamie has no idea where Micheal Myers is and then she turns around the body comes swinging down at her then she falls down the stairs. Now the part i dont get when jamie runs into the closet when she could of went out the window and climb down, I liked how when micheal loses his mask and you get to see his face and then the doctor shoots micheal six times and micheal falls out the window and then the spilt second u look outside Micheal is gone then the theme hits WHAT A CLASSIC!!!! i loved it 10 out of 10 and remember ALWAYS REMEMBER THE RULES EVERYBODY'S A SUSPECT!!!!!!!"
"clark-39","Null","0","0","19 June 2002"," A milestone.
","Halloween is a huge marker in the history of horror movies. As a low-budget, independent film with no known stars it still managed to become one of the highest-grossing independent films of all time. This, of course, led to many sequels with higher budgets. Back in 1978, it was said that people were jumping out of their seats because they were so terrified. Maybe people in 1978 never saw scary movies, but to jump at a movie like Halloween today would be ridiculous. Over 20 or so years, I think the film's scare tactics are dated. In fact, the whole film is dated. There is absolutely no gore, only a few deaths spread far apart, and no nudity (spare a brief flash of breasts). Still, while this may point out how old the film is becoming, it also points out that John Carpenter didn't need these things to make a good movie. Sure, the film doesn't make people jump or scream anymore, but it still has the power to scare. This film will make you think differently about how safe you are in the comforts of your own home. That's why the film works. Carpenter brings evil home to an innocent and unsuspecting neighborhood. Shots of Laurie, the heroine, show her walking down her neighborhood sidewalks alone, with ""the shape"" watching in the background. It'll change the way you think about walking down your street alone. While it's clear that ""the shape"" is Michael Myers, the kid who killed his sister in the opening of the movie, that fact is never stated. We never see Michael himself put on the mask and murder kids. He's just left as a being...an entity...devoid of identity. This makes the shape seem more like a thing than a man, which works very well and explains why he keeps coming back after being stabbed, shot, etc. Perhaps the most terrifying thing about this film is how true it is about our modern day society. In this film, forgetting the explanation in the sequels, Laurie and her friends are stalked and killed by the shape for no apparent reason. Later it was revealed Laurie is the shape's (then called Michael, losing that non-person feel) long-lost sister. A bogus explanation. It's much scarier to think that this man is killing these kids for no reason whatsoever. Meticulously stalking them. This is true today with all the serial murders and kidnappings. Were they chosen at random, too? This film also began the trend of mask-wearing psychos. After Jason and many others, the shape's mask is still the most frightening because it has no features. No emotion. I'm not sure if Carpenter hinted at these things on purpose or if they just came out, but Halloween stands as a terrifying reminder that evil lurks out there. No matter where you are, you're not safe. In a world where predators lurk in everyday society, Halloween is a shining example of the threat even an innocent neighborhood can hold. And while the film is very dated, the message still holds true."

I know that before HALLOWEEN, there is ""Black Christmas"", and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", but this was the movie that worked and was a major hit.<br/><br/>THE plot :  A young Michael Myers knifed to death his 23 year old sister on a Halloween night. Years later, Michael (as a grown up) returns to Haddonfield and that's when things start to get spooky. To make the plot simple : It's Halloween nigh 1978, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is baby sitting but little does she knows that Michael Myers is in the town looking for her. But she's not alone, at her side it's Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) who is in the search for Myers since he escaped from Smith Grove -the hospital where he was locked after murdering his sister-. <br/><br/>Loomis is obsessed with Myers and if necessary he will give his life in order to catch Myers. That means : Halloween night will become a hunt for Myers, while he is stalking baby sitters. So, Halloween night on Haddonfield is about this : Loomis and the local policemen are in the hunt for Myers while he is stalking women. Sounds fun eh? You'll have to check out the shocking ending, stuff for legend!.<br/><br/>The plot marks a rule in horror movies : We have a stalker, and a virgin heroine. The spinal cord of the movie is Pleasence's character, he knows everything about Myers, and he's the only one that can stop him from commiting brutal murders.    <br/><br/>HALLOWEEN set the rules for slasher movies, it's a scary movie, and it can be considered as one of the 20 best horror movies of all time. What can I say about acting? Pleasence and Curtis give the best performance by 2 lead actors in a horror movie, no doubt about it!.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, YOU SHOULD , and prepare to be scared!! Halloween night can be everyday."

","For the past twenty years, the horror genre has been in a quagmire of extreme disrepute. Since the early 1980's, there have been a seemingly endless number of slasher movies, the vast majority of which were nearly unwatchable exercises in nihilistic gore. It seemed as if the directors have forgotten what a good scare truly is, or have never known it. Nonetheless, there are a handful of good efforts that stand out from the mire. One of them is John Carpenter's ""Halloween."" <br/><br/>It's a rare animal indeed, one of the few horror films to receive positive reviews from professional film critics. Time has been kind to it; ""Halloween"" still holds up nearly a quarter-century later. The basic plot is nothing special; in terms of structure, it's very much the same as any other slasher. What makes it different? Simply put, the level of skill that was invested in it elevates the material. This movie's no hack job; it's clear that for once, the filmmakers actually put some time and effort into crafting a good, scary movie. <br/><br/>The object of the film is not to show an excessive quantity of gore, but to frighten the viewer. The film succeeds in doing just that, establishing an atmosphere of dread. Even when it's light out, you are keenly aware that no one is truly safe. The gore factor is practically nonexistent, but the human imagination is capable of imagining things that are much worse than can be visibly portrayed. The director usually acts as composer for most of his films; this project has yielded his best work in that area. The ""Halloween theme"" is simple, yet elegant and chilling, resonating in the mind long after the credits have rolled.<br/><br/>Another noticeable quality is the fact that its teenage characters are not nearly as annoying as they came to be in most of its clones. They may not be model citizens, but they come across as realistic human beings for once. The solid performance of Jamie Lee Curtis helps to make the proceedings more credible, its effect is to put the audience in her shoes instead of making us root for the killer.<br/><br/>Do I consider ""Halloween"" a masterpiece? No, I personally feel that the film is somewhat overrated by horror fans. However, no one can dispute that it is one of the most influential genre films ever. Donald Pleasance does a fine job in the lead, lending a gravity and reality to the situation that it otherwise may not have had. When he says that Michael Myers is not quite human, we believe him. Subsequent installments may have linked him to the occult, but even without a supernatural explanation, we just *know* there's something otherworldly about him.<br/><br/>*** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Compass International Pictures"

","I've read many reviews of this movie that imply that one cannot enjoy both this classic movie and recent movies like ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2,"" but this is truly not the case.  ""Halloween"" was made on a very low budget, yes, but everything about the movie reeked of quality.  The acting, writing, direction, etc., was wonderful, and succeeded in giving the film a ""reality"" that helped it enormously.  Movies cannot scare you unless you can believe in what is happening onscreen.  And it's not that the special effects were bad; there was virtually *no* gore (especially compared to the overkill [no pun intended] of today's horror films), which is much, much scarier.  The best movies don't show the horrific sights, they let you imagine them for yourself, and you end up imagining more than they (the filmmakers) could show.  ""Scream"" and its sequel were great, because they both honored true classic horror movies, like ""Psycho"" and ""Halloween,"" and poked holes in the cliche-ridden flood of slasher films that followed in their wake. ""Halloween"" fans shouldn't take the ""Scream"" films as an insult to their favorite horror movie.  Still, ""Halloween"" is infinitely scarier than any other slasher movie made since, and ranks with ""The Shining,"" ""Poltergeist,"" ""Psycho,"" and others as one of the greatest horror films of all time."

","John Carpenter's horror classic of 1978 about babysitters being stalked by a mute pyschopath is the first movie that I loved so much that I had to go out and buy it.  The killer, Michael Myers, is truly a landmark in the land of horror movie killers. Nick Castle delivers a presence throughout the movie that has not been matched in 6 sequels.  This film has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard which helps deliver fright after fright just like other great scores like in Psycho and Vertigo. The story is very original (although it has been copied numerous times throughout the late 70's and early 80's) and theme of Halloween was a great idea.  Jamie Lee Curtis makes her movie debut in a good performance as Laurie Strode, the shy girl in the babysitters club.  Donald Pleasence is great as Dr. Loomis and he adds a lot of energy to the film.  The film has some killing and brief nudity so it's not for kids but it makes a great teen date movie and adults can enjoy it as well.  A movie that will forever be one of the classic horror movies I would love to see this film on a list like AFI's 100 Years 100 movies. The thing that makes this movie so fun to watch is the suspensefulness and scares that make you jump in your seat.  I've never had the opportunity to see this movie on the big screen but I know that is the way this movie was meant to be seen and I would have to write an entirely different review for that experience. +++"

It shows how the character of Michael Myers truly works. This character is not one to just kill, kill, kill. He likes to set you up for the fall. He's one to toy just when you think you're safe you could end up like the character of Bob and be impaled on a cupboard door. Seeing this movie at the age of 7 I could say that it truly scared me. Today being 22 years old I can say that movie doesn't scare me but it does give me a haunting feeling. Halloween without a doubt is the greatest installment of the long running Halloween series. This was Jamie Lee Curtis's stepping stone and this movie shows Donald Pleasance in one of his greatest movie parts since his portrayal as the demonic Ernst Stavro Blofeld in 1967's You Only Live Twice opposite the legendary Sean Connery.

","John Carpenter's Halloween is the best horror film I've ever seen.  Never before has there been a movie to keep the storyline of their characters the same throughout the entire series ( Halloween 3 being the exception). Despite having a budget of a little over $300,000 this movie is worth watching over and over again.  You can never get enough of Mr. Carpenter's opening theme music to this 1978 classic.  For those who thought Scream would be the greatest horror film of all time think again.  Wes Craven couldn't even begin to touch this movie.  For those who followed the sequels ( even when they were not too hot ) you relize that this movie never lets up.  Even after 20 years you still get that scary feeling you did when you first saw it.  To top it all off the final sequel to the series ( Halloween H20 ) won't disappoint you.  Here you have the main two characters from the original battling it out for what you hope is the final time.

","Ja, this movie is nothing but a pure classic, that has earned its right to be the scariest movie I have ever seen. I watched this movie originally when I was 6 and it scared the hell outta me, I really didn't remember it till I bought it a few months back, and whew I almost wet myself. The movie is both stylish, very scary, and non-stop entertainment. The story has a young very disturbed man stalking (the then not known little actress who became huge in Hollywierd) Jamie Lee Curtis, why well you'll find that out in Halloween II, but he stalks her and tortures her throughout the entire movie. While her other friends get murdered in gruesome yet bloodless ways, Ja thats right this movie was like Poltergiest it needed no blood or gratuitous gore to make it scary. The acting by Nick Castle as the imafamous and endlessly copied psychopath is killer Michael Myers, who scares me even now all though he is awesome. Donald Pleasence is Dr. Loomis Michaels psychiatrist whom, is trying to find Michael who has escaped from the hospital and like i said b4 stalking Jamie Lee Curtis. When this movie came out it wasn't a million dollar movie, it was a low-budget horror movie that went on to make a whopping 47 million dollars. Yeah thats a lot for a movie that didn't even cost 500,000 to make. So if you're in the mood for a scary, stylish classic horror movie that pays much to the movie that started it all 'Psycho', which Jamie Lee Curtis's mom Janet Leigh played in then you're ready for 'HalloweeN' And if you pee your pants easily when scared, 'HalloweeN' isn't for you. I give this never-not-be-a classic a perfect 10 or ****. Don't watch it alone. Rated R for intense violence, sexuality, and some nudity."

","What more is there to say about John Carpenter's groundbreaking 1978 horror classic? Words cannot even begin to evoke the true visceral experience that was Carpenter's only true masterpiece (""Escape from New York"" not withstanding).<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock did it first, back in 1960 with his chilling masterpiece ""Psycho"", and the master indeed bragged about playing his audience like a pipe organ. No one thought it could be duplicated, much less even contemplated, but Carpenter rose to the challenge and went on to create the most indelible monster since Norman Bates....Michael Myers.<br/><br/>The plot was simple enough. A six-year-old boy, traumatized by his teenaged sister having sex, sets out to brutally kill her. This happened on Halloween night while their parents were away. Upon discovering his shocking crime, he is institutionalized under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who is convinced that this child harbors far more evil than even he anticipated.<br/><br/>Fast forward to 1978. A sprightly young teenager named Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) is looking forward to the eve of ""tricks and treats"", and spending time with her friends as she babysits young Tommy Doyle. Unfortunately for her (and them), Michael Myers has escaped and intends to wreak bloody murder on an otherwise innocuous night.<br/><br/>Why did this film work, when countless other cheap imitations didn't? One key word: simplicity. Carpenter was out to prove that a knife causing a bloody gash was far from a reason to truly horrify people. He bathed his set with shadows and darkness and gave us one of the most haunting film scores ever put on celluloid - the fact that he scored the music himself, only proves his genius and versatility.<br/><br/>Another key ingredient were the performances: Jamie Lee Curtis, making her film debut, gave us a real flesh-and-blood character in Laurie Strode; the heroine who has more in common with Michael than she initially thought (see the sequel). Donald Pleasance, one of the best B-movie actors, gave us real fear and real emotion as the doctor trying to stop the unstoppable. And credit must go to future director Nick Castle for his graceful and chilling performance as ""The Shape"".<br/><br/>""Halloween"". A true classic. Often imitated, but never, ever duplicated."

He was sent to a maximum security insane asylum, under the charge of Dr. Sam Loomis.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, on the anniversary of his first massacre, Michael escapes the sanitarium and heads to his home town of Haddonfield, Illinois.... to kill again.<br/><br/>With Dr. Loomis, memorably played by the late Donald Pleasence, trailing the mad man in the now legendary white Halloween mask, it seems that the small town of Haddonfield are in for a Halloween night of which the stuff nightmares are made of.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, the immortal stalk 'n' slasher by which all others in its genre are judged by, ( sometimes unfairly ), 'Halloween' spawned several enjoyable sequels; but there isnt a fan of the series I personally know who claims any of them can match the terror, the suspense and sheer class of this 1978 classic.<br/><br/>Legendary."

","I cannot believe I have waited this long to comment on my favorite horror movie of all-time!<br/><br/>This is a cult classic amongst horror followers!  In my opinion, it supersedes the ""Friday the 13th"" series and the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series.  In contrast to these other two, Michael Myers is the only one of the super-star villains who has not actually ""died"" and ""come back to life"", making him more ""real"" and believable.  It is a classic in its own time!<br/><br/>The acting is mostly believable, aside from a few scenes [after you've seen the movie for the 84th time, you start to pick things apart].  Of course, one must acknowledge a command performance by the distinguished, late Donald Pleasance!  Newcomer Jamie Lee Curtis was superb, but she had a great act to follow:  her mother Janet Leigh was a fine actress in her own right!<br/><br/>There are, of course, the usual blunders and errors that one notices after looking closely at the film, such as going into the Wallace house; the door is at the far right corner of the front of the house, yet when a person enters the front door they can turn to the right?!?!<br/><br/>But all in all, it is still a super fantastic horror chiller and spine-tingler!  It's sequel ""Halloween II"" is a fairly close second-best, but the rest of the sequels are not even worth acknowledging!!!!"

What most people don't realise about this film is that it was an independent movie made by Jon Carpenter & Debra Hill while they where still youths, and made them both very well known.<br/><br/>Michael Myres is now one of the most well known characters of the horror genre even by the very few people who haven't seen the film. This shows how effective the film realy is.<br/><br/>The version of Halloween that most people have watched is the TV version which is an extended version of the original. It was extended in order to fit a time slot on the 1st TV broadcast it was given. The extra sequences were shot durring the production of the 2nd Halloween film. It is quite noticable because the person playing Michael Myres in the 2nd film desn't have the same pressence that the person playing him in the 1st does, that is why the TV never realy got a video release until now.<br/><br/>The face of Michael Myres still haunts many people from the 1st time they ever saw the film, hard to believe a distorted William Shatner mask could have such an effect!!"

","John Carpenter's Halloween is, in my opinion, one of the greatest suspense films ever made. I call it a suspense film, because I do not consider Halloween a 'horror' film. My idea of horror films are The Exorcist and The Evil Dead. I think The Exorcist is the greatest horror film ever made. Carpenter's Halloween does not generate as much horror as it does suspense. In particular, the shot of Jamie Lee Curties frantically trying to open her front door as Michael Myers crosses the street in the background. I consider Halloween an updated version of Hitchcock's Psycho, just as I consider Scream an updated version of Halloween. In both cases, the earlier film is better. Both films feature memorable scores that contribute heavily to the mood and suspense of the film. Halloween is definitely worth viewing over and over.

","Surprising, huh? You may be asking yourself why I chose ""Halloween"" as the scariest movie I've ever seen. Well, there are a number of reasons why. Starting with the music by John Carpenter. That main title theme just chills me out the wazoo. It is the scariest horror movie music ever. Then there's the suspense and atmosphere. I think ""Halloween"" is unfairly regarded as a slasher film. There's practically NO blood or gore in it, which is a real plus. And yet, sadly, this film spawned numerous imitators and 6 [!] sequels so far. Anyway, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence are standouts in their roles. Curtis makes Laurie Strode a real flesh-and-blood teenager; one who babysits children rather than have sex with boyfriends. She's a smart girl. Near the end where she's running from Michael Myers, I'm really on edge and rooting for her. John Carpenter sure knew how to scare the hell out of moviegoers, and he did it for me with this one. ""Halloween"" is a horror film experience like no other, and one I will never forget."

","i've been a fan of ""halloween' for quite some time now, and i'm still not sure why people think of it as a 'slasher' film. there are violent deaths in this movie, but they are relatively few and the effectiveness of carpenter's masterpiece is due more to atmosphere, suspense and suggestion than to gore or brutality. this misconception degrades a movie that, as roger ebert himself said, can hold it's own with any of hitchcock's best stuff. over the years carpenter has become less and less exceptional and at the present moment at least i see him as a sell out and a charlatan, luring people into his derivative and mediocre movies on the strength of his reputation as a master of horror, which he no longer deserves. nonetheless, you have to hand it to him for this one, a terrifying tale of a seemingly invincible psychopath who is absolutely determined to kill his other sister, a young jamie lee curtis. from the start of the movie where michael brutally murders his sister to the end where he is shot repeatedly and falls of a balcony, this will keep the intelligent horror fan riveted to his/her seat. this movie is shown on TV constantly (particularly in october) and talked about even more by movie buffs, and yet is not in the slightest bit overrated. donald pleasance in particular gives a stunningly convincing performance as michael's tortured psychiatrist, dr loomis, and jamie lee curtis is at the top of her game as a shy but shrewd young woman who does not realize she is adopted or that she is the target of myers' rage. a must see."

","When you think of horror, certain images come to mind: Jason Voorhees, Fred Krueger, Leatherface, and (perhaps most importantly, at least to me) Michael Myers. Halloween is a classic movie and a favorite among horror fans everywhere. Plus it scared the hell out of me when I was younger. There's something oddly scary about a guy running around in a William Shatner mask killing teens. I get chills every single time I hear Donald Pleasence utter the lines: ""He's gone from here. The evil is gone."" Pleasence should be revered as one of the greats, sitting alongside Price, Cushings, and Lee. His absence is the reason that H2O never sat right with me. When he died, the series sort of died. But the first Halloween will always be immortal. As will Pleasence's performance. The atmosphere and music, especially the music, really add to the fear effect. Myers is extremely creepy himself. The mute, breathing of Myers is far scarier than any visual in any horror film. His silence is eerie.

","Halloween is, without a doubt, a horror film that is both excellent and influential. It was so successful that it paved the way for more movies of its ilk.

But it should be noted that Halloween was released in the fall of 1978, nearly two years before the first Friday the 13th movie was filmed. Needless to say, there would have been no Jason if it hadn't been for Michael Myers.<br/><br/>When it comes to watching horror movies in honor of the holiday Halloween, it would be both a mistake and an insult to exclude the film of the same name.

","I think Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of this film because when I saw it, it reminded me of his movies. What I didn't like is the fact that this film had such a sorry legacy, what I mean is that there were several sequels and to put it bluntly each one just got dumber and dumber. These films also inspired a lot of other mad slasher films showing women as the victims of psychopathic killers. I remember that Siskel and Ebert even did a show on Sneak Previews on this distrubing trend. Roger Ebert put it best when he said that this film didn't hate women it loved film! John Carpenter is a great director who knew how to make a true chiller. When you think about it, Halloween really doesn't have a lot of blood and gore in it. Carpenter created suspense and chills using things like shadows and scary music. He was masterful! So often today, filmakers just plop a plate of gore in front of us and call it a movie. Jamie Lee Curtis made her debut in this film and she is awesome, truly one of our great actresses. What I like is the fact that she has the guts to fight back against the killer and that she is not just another token victim. Donald Pleasance is wonderful as the psychiatrist determined to stop the madman. An interesting footnote, in one of his other films The Great Escape he played a WWII POW. In real life he actually served in World War II and was a POW for real!"

","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a film that single-handedly created an entire horror-movie movement, and it is a film whose place within the context of popular cinema cannot be underestimated.  Created on a shoestring budget and released in 1978, ""Halloween"" would go on to become the most financially successful independent film of all time--until, of course, 1998's ""The Blair Witch Project.""  Many consider it to be the Mother of all slasher films, and, to the degree that it has influenced horror cinema over the past twenty-three years, that can be seen as a statement of fact. However, what many have failed to notice is that, beyond the obvious fact that ""Halloween"" is a stunningly effective horror movie, it is also a highly accomplished piece of film making.  John Carpenter's economical direction is faultless, as are his use of light and shadow to subtly create an ominous atmosphere so insidious that it transforms the mundane trappings of a Halloween night in suburbia into nightmare incarnate.  From the very first frame, the viewer is introduced into a darkly suggestive world where ordinary objects and settings take on a twisted new reality.  It is this masterful evocation of impending doom and normalcy gone amok from which ""Halloween"" derives its tremendous impact.  Added to this unsettling aura are outstanding performances from a hugely talented cast (not the least of which are Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence) and a nerve-shattering finale that serves not only as a highly rewarding climax, but also as a thematic confrontation between the forces of good and evil.  ""Halloween"" descended upon an unsuspecting viewing public over twenty years ago and has emerged as one of the most important, influential, and respected horror movies in history.  And it can safely be said that, all these years later, its spellbinding power has not diminished."

","*SPOILERS*<br/><br/>Surely, the true measure of a well-made horror movie is how scary it is. If so, then 'Halloween' is still top of the pile. Admittedly there have been movies before, and since, that meet this criteria, but none have sustained that fear throughout, and even after the experience is over.<br/><br/>The key that lifts Carpenter's film above most films in the genre is it's nonchalant approach to the killings. Haddonfield is a hub of normality, white picket fences, and frankly dull lives. Nothing happens here, but the urban legend of the killer Michael Myers still does the rounds with local kids. He has, literally, become the bogeyman, living on in ghost stories, whose name has been whispered for almost twenty years, almost as a bad joke amongst the children who are too young to remember the truth. When Myers returns to his community the bogeyman becomes a reality. The suspense is unbearable in parts, with Carpenter using every inch of the screen. What you can't see is infinitely more terrifying than what you can, and what you don't understand is more disturbing. Myers' motives are never revealed, he just does what he does, he has no reason, and cannot be reasoned with. Myers' boiler suit and blank mask are perfect for this 'faceless' killer. He moves almost silently, even gracefully, like an automaton, yet is unbelievably threatening. Carpenter's score is the perfect accompaniment for 'the Shape' (after previews without the music Carpenter was told it simply 'wasn't scary '). The whole mood of the piece is changed and led by this simple, but effective music.<br/><br/>What, on paper, must've looked like an unoriginal and unimaginative plot, becomes, in Carpenter's hands a groundbreaking and genre-defining moment. Incorrectly regarded as the 'father' of many things (the stalk and slash sub-genre, the camera-as-killer motif, the unkillable killer, the 'false' ending etc) it still deserves to be THE reference point for all of these, as it combines them all more effectively than any other movie before or since. The tension never lets up, and the experience of this movie should stay with you for a long time. <br/><br/>Not only damn scary, but good fun for film fans to spot the in-jokes!<br/><br/>DO NOT watch any 'Friday The 13ths', 'Screams', or, indeed, any other 'Halloweens' until you have been through this one!"

","It is Halloween, 1998, and I have just seen the movie Halloween again for the sixth time. As the character of Linda in the movie would say, ""I totally love this movie!"" The repeated viewings have allowed me to see where the movie's power really lies. I have narrowed it down to two things: one, the movie taps into many of our subconscious fears; two, it is  technically brilliantly executed. On the first point: 1) The boogeyman. A relentless killer who cannot be stopped. He is like The Thing (the movie that plays on the TV in the background), an alien creature who cannot be reasoned with, who you cannot hide from. He is the kitchen knife-wielding Terminator, and he could represent any fear that has a hold on you. 2) The threatened Suburbia. Adults work all their lives to create a safe haven to raise kids - only to disappear when the real danger lurks. This also taps into the missing parent fear. 3) Sin. As one character in Scream accurately points out, sin must be punished. It is the morality buried deep within all horror movies. 4) The Dark. Darkness represents evil. The Devil always comes out at night, and the scariest thing about haunted houses (the Myers house) is the unknown - the unknown of darkness, the unknown of how such evil could have occurred there. The unknown is a powerful force for obedience. On the second point: 1) Camerawork. John Carpenter uses a roving, restless camera to good effect, the movie has a realistic street feel to it. This applies to characters as well. 2) Foreground composition. You never know where the killer is at any given moment. He's everywhere and nowhere at the same time. Until it's too late.<br/><br/>On a movie buff note, watch for all the parallels to Hitchcock's Psycho, a movie which has spawned more imitators than virtually any other."

","Watching ""Halloween"" is like having a knife tear through your heart.It grabs you and shakes you violently into a world of fear, suspense and terror that is so hypnotic that one cannot remember that they are only watching a movie.I have a lot of respect for ""Halloween"" Even though I considered ""The Exorcist"" a more scarier film,I also believe ""Halloween"" is just as effective and frightening because of the way our emotions are twisted through a maze that the viewer is unable to get out of or doesn't want to get out of.The plot doesn't need explaining.I am pretty sure who ever is reading this review has seen the film enough times to have it memorized.Basically,""Halloween"" really frightened me as a child and even though they are a lot of films in the slasher genre that I also like,""Halloween"" rides to the top because it relies less on gore.Don't get me wrong.I love blood and gore in horror movies but less gore and more atmospheric suspense gives the viewer a feeling of unease and fear that helps him or her remember that they are not having a walk in the park.Watching ""Halloween"" is not like taking a walk through a park.It's like being surrounded by complete darkness that traps the viewer.One thing I have to say about this film.""Halloween"" reminds me a little of ""Jaws"".Michael Myers and the shark are both alike.They prey upon their victims and they are both emotionless creatures.Yes,Michael is human,but throughout the film he doesn't show a shed of emotion which makes him and the film more terrifying.John Carpenter's direction is at his most superb along with his score and the cinematography by Dean Cundey is very effective.""Halloween"" is an emotional ride of terror that makes this film a must see horror classic.The best horror film I have seen in years.""Halloween"" brings true meaning to the word horror.""Halloween"" should not be missed.""Halloween"" is a true horror classic that teaches moviegoers the true meaning of horror films."

","There's not much I can say about this movie that hasn't already been said before. It's a classic in the horror genre. It didn't create slasher movies (Black Christmas did), but it made them popular. The creepy thing about this movie is it's real world setting and the way Carpenter directs.<br/><br/>STORY: Simple, but this movie didn't need a complicated plot. Complicated plots don't work in most slasher movies. The pace is slow, but the interaction between the characters and Michael's stalker habits keep it interesting. The script is surprisingly weak because of it's huge logic holes (Loomis found Michael's car across the street from the Myers house, yet he had been waiting there all night...how could he not notice it earlier?) and much of the action relies upon unlikely coincidence. Loomis just happened to stop where Michael had hid a dead body?<br/><br/>ACTING: No bad performances here. Everybody is decent, but Pleasence, Curtis, and Castle stand out. Pleasence is instantly likeable as the madman's doctor and I really wanted him to suceed in stopping Michael. His dialouge gave us insight into what made Mikey tick and what kind of man he was. Curtis is PERFECT as the anti-social babysitter who wishes she was more outgoing. She made her character seem real and she wasn't the typically stupid horror movie chick. Nick Castled, who played Michael, was a very believeable serial killer, especially since he had to use only body motion. One of the, if not the best, Michael of the series.<br/><br/>DIRECTING: I don't think that the lack of Carpenter was why most of the sequels failed, but without Carp this one would've sucked. This movie IS the directing. Instead of mindless blood + guts, Carpenter concentrates mainly on building up mood and making the audience wait as long as possible for the killer to strike. It simply works. I also liked how he showed the murders from start to finish. No wimpy cutaways here and no over the top gore.<br/><br/>MUSIC: Two 70s pop songs. One I liked, another I didn't. The score is awesome. The Halloween theme by itself is fine, but the distortion in the background that made it seem that much more creepy and foreboding. The music played during the chase scene is better than great.<br/><br/>OTHER: The stabbing of Judith Myers in the beginning is brutal and probably the bloodiest thing in the film. The other murders are brutal but bloodless stranglings or shrouded in darkness. It works for the film rather than against it. For those who dig T&A (like me), we do get some in this movie but not alot. There is also a pinch of black humor here and there that you may or may not be able to pick up on (like how Wynn walks...it's really funny.)<br/><br/>All in all, it deserves it's classic status. Rent this and the sequel and you have a perfect way to kill three hours on some dark, lonely night. An essential film in the horror genre and no serious fan should forsake seeing it. I give it ****"

","Without resorting to buckets of blood, director John Carpenter made one of the best horror movies of the 1970 (and of all time, for that matter) with HALLOWEEN.  I rank it right up there with JAWS and CARRIE.<br/><br/>Its story of a masked maniac who comes home to Haddonfield, Illinois on Halloween night to create more murderous mayhem after having been locked away for fifteen years has admittedly become a cliche.  It has been imitated hundreds of times over, usually with awful, bloody results (FRIDAY THE 13TH, SCREAM, etc.).  Still, what Carpenter managed to do with just $375,000 and with a relatively small cast and crew is far more remarkable than what a bunch of horror-film hacks can do with millions of dollars worth of gory special make-up effects.<br/><br/>The homages to Hitchcock's PSYCHO are by now legendary: our heroine, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, is Janet Leigh's real-life daughter; the character played by Donald Pleasance is named Sam Loomis (the same as John Gavin's character in PSYCHO).  Like Hitchcock (and indeed like Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma as well), Carpenter pushes the suspense angle very well. This, as much as anything else, is what puts HALLOWEEN head and shoulders above its atrocious rip-offs."

","HALLOWEEN is an undeniable classic, the one that started the horror trend of the 80s and that continues to this day. Even recent horror films show it's influence: the masked killer with utter determination, the strong heroine fighting to survive. Sure, not all of them have been good, but they all show the influence of HALLOWEEN. The film is one of the ones that helped spark my interest in filmmaking, and is just a great movie in general. Everything about it is superb: the simple story, the unstoppable character, the feisty lead character (the then-unknown Jamie Lee Curtis), the always reliable Donald Pleasance, the relentless suspense, the music, the direction, everything. A horror film that continues to beat all that have come since, HALLOWEEN is not just a great horror film, but a great film. Period."
"jakeandelwood","10","0","0","17 June 2001"," The beginning of an new HORROR era
","Almost everything that can be said over this film has been said. Still I want to add a thing or two too it. I rated this one 10 out of 10. Why? Because this was the beginning of a new kind of horror movie. The ultimate evil in the shape of a man. Something that could not be destroyed and was able to scare the living daylights out of Cinema viewers.<br/><br/>After this one there were many other movies with the same idea: Jason from the friday the 13th series, Freddy Krueger from Elm Street and more recent the masked killer from the Scream trilogy (which I hope will stay a trilogy). But none of them can be compared to Michael Meyers.<br/><br/>
The scene that I found the most terrifying is after Laurie (J L Curtis) thinks she killed the boogie man, we see a close-up of her face. In the back you can see the body of Michael. When the camera slightly off-focus on Laurie we suddenly notice that the shape is moving. Michael is sitting up!!! This was, for me, the most intense scene of the film. Just look at the way the actor sits up. So perfect in his movement it's almost not human. For me that was the scene I realized that Michael was the Boogie Man, the ultimate evil in a human body."
"Bill Mulder","10","0","0","5 June 2001"," Not like the inferior sequels and clones
","The story of a maniac killing people on Halloween night is a great scary movie. Director John Carpenter knows how to scare his audience primarily through the faceless Shape and his great use of the widescreen frame. Carpenter never falls into the trap that most of the sequels fell into. He shows very, very little of Michael Myers in the movie (thus the character's name is The Shape since he only appears in the shadows and backgrounds) where as the sequels show Myers ad nauseum. Carpenter co-wrote the movie, directed and scored it. The score is a landmark and stands with Jaws and Star Wars as one of the most recognizable scores of the 1970's. Overall, I think many people fail to see this movie as the classic it is. This is for the simple reason that it spawned a wave of sequels and clones that were (at best) terrible. Keep in mind though that the sequels and rip offs are all pale imitations to the original night he came home."
"mr composer","10","0","0","29 May 2001"," One of my favorite horror films
","Though I've now seen this movie about ten times, I'll never forget the first viewing of ""Halloween."" My first introduction to this series was the abominable and unrelated 3rd movie, ""Season of the Witch."" I then happened to catch the better, but still bad 4th movie in the series, ""The Return of Michael Myers."" While this movie was still not very good, I was interested in how this story got started, so I finally rented ""Halloween.""<br/><br/>It is still probably the best horror movie I have yet seen. It's not a perfect movie. The way Nancy Loomis delivers her lines is almost comical at times, for that matter P.J. Soles as well. On the other hand, their characters are somewhat ditsy teenagers so it fits.<br/><br/>This movie works because it is simple. It is a tremendously low-budget film that was planned very well. The story is straightforward. The suspense is gripping but not relentless. The musical motives of John Carpenter (though heavily influenced by Psycho) works like a charm.<br/><br/>I love the absurd music credits at the end of this and other John Carpenter films: His all synth score as performed by the ""Bowling Green Philharmonic Orchestra."" I believe ""The Fog"" happens to credit ""the Warren County/Bowling Green Chamber Orchestra"" or something like that.<br/><br/>One suggestion: See the theatrical version.. not the one with the extra few minutes of out-takes (like they show on the Sci-Fi channel.) Yes, they explain more, but nothing that is not ultimately revealed in Halloween II. This first film works better if you don't know too much, and just accept Michael Myers as a madman with no specific intentions... just a babysitter stalker. This is a film that you should go into with no intent to analyze. Just turn out the lights, plug the movie into your best audio system, and watch it with a friend."

"bmy2001k","Null","0","0","18 March 2001"," THE horror movie
","Halloween is a classic horror movie. The story starts back on Halloween night, 1963 in Haddonfield, Illinois. There, a small six year old child by the name of Michael Myers brutally murders his fifteen year old sister for a then unknown reason. He is then locked up in a maximum security prison for fifteen years. We then cut forward to October 30th 1978, when Michael's doctor Sam Loomis is driving with a young assistant nurse to the prison where Michael is being held to pick him up and take him to court for his trial. But Michael escapes and makes his way towards his hometown of Haddonfield to go after his other sister Laurie Strode (played brilliantly by Jamie Lee Curtis). He then stalks Laurie and her friends throughout the day and as soon as night falls, the horror begins. He brutally murders three of Laurie's friends and a guy called Bob before going after his sister. This is the night HE came home. I won't say anymore so that I don't spoil the surprise for people who have not seen it, but this is one of the greatest movies of all time. It's not at all gory, but it's ability to shock hasen't worn down even after all these years. It will scare you out your wits, especially watching in the dark. Halloween has had countless sequels, but none of them even come close too the first film. I have seen this film many times, but it still scares me every time I watch it. A movie that no fan of horror should be without. Buy it today! You won't be disappointed! 10/10"
"Beaux","10","0","0","25 February 2001"," Greatest horror film ever! Pure terror.
","Halloween is simply the greatest horror film of all time.  The film creates an eerie atmosphere that will easily frighten just about any viewer. Relying on this atmosphere of terror, John Carpenter creates a masterpiece in fear.  Excellent camera shots add greatly to the film, and Carpenter's original score remains the freakiest I have ever heard.  The film plays with your emotions terribly, and Donald Pleasance's performance as Loomis is one of the greatest cinematic performances I have ever seen.  *SPOILER ALERT* While speaking of Myers, he explains him not as a man, but as an evil being devoid of reason, conscience, fear or remorse.  When Myers is seen disguised in what is probably the scariest looking mask I have ever seen, it seems to add to his inhuman nature.  I really can't say enough about this movie..... certain scenes where Donald Pleasance is loomising Myers to Sheriff Brackett (like the scene in the Myers house) attests to Pleasance's acting abilities to portray the Captain Ahab-like obsessed doctor.  Many of the daytime scenes are also fantastic, such as when Myers is seen driving the wagon around Haddonfield, menacingly passing Loomis and Laurie repeatedly, or following Laurie and Annie down the road-- unnoticed!!  This gives example of Carpenter's ability to create fear without death... when Myers is prowling the streets, always in the background and always unnoticed, the feeling I get is relentless terror.  Finally, certain lines throughout the film are brilliant and chilling... most of them coming from Loomis, such as, ""he came home"" or ""as a matter of fact, that was"", and others.  It is too bad that many films throughout the 80's and 90's tried to copy certain things introduced in Halloween, turning them into cliches over time...  so I can only imagine how much better this film would have been back in '78... although it is still the ""original"" slasher film.  The death rate is very small in Halloween, but Carpenter proves here that death is not necessary to create fear.  A technique used by Carpenter that makes the deaths scarier, however, is limiting them to strangulations or slow deaths, while showing the facial expressions on the victims as they die.  This is a very terrifying effect.  I would enjoy ranting and raving about the film for another hour, but I should stop now.  The point is that this is the greatest, scariest horror film I have ever seen and it should be viewed and appreciated by all.  It is unparalleled in generating a feeling of fear and terror within the viewer.  10/10!"

","Sharp, blood-curdling scarefest with a magnificant debut from Jamie Lee Curtis, who's career launched into even more slasher and horror flicks before propelling to become a famous (and arrogant...j/k!) celebrity. This is the pivotial film for the (later celebrated) Miss Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween is a grand thriller that evokes fear aplenty. The suspense is top notch, the characters are actually sympathetic (albeit poor decision makers) for once, and unlike most latter day stalk and slash films, Halloween does a great job building atmosphere and mood which climbs from an lowly, unexpected beginning to a hair-raising, adrenaline rushing climax. Halloween is the film that started to all: This horror flick that paved the wave for hundreds, perhaps thousands of weak@$$ slasher films that foolishly tried to capitalize on the success of this precedented (much imitated) thriller. However, instead, these lame slasher movies inveigh into a whirlpool of obscurity... ~p~ You probably already know the notorious story but here goes... On Halloween Night in 1963, Michael Myers, (not the Saturday Night Live's Michael Myers) than 6 years old brutally murders his older sister with a kitchen knife. The pain is agonizing as Myers stabs his sister multiple times with a knife, until you collapses, lying in her own pool of blood... Myers is then taken to a mental hospital where he has been confined there for 15 years...but not for long... ~p~ On Halloween Night, 1978, Myers manages to break free from his incarceration and once again...he begins his unfinished killing spree eactly where he left off...at Haddonfield, Ohio... His particularly targeting a young, naive babysitter... ~p~ Dr. Loomis (the late British actor Donald Pleasance), Myers' psychiatrist is currently stalking Myers himself while the serial killer hunts down more victims, young and old...for his collection... Meanwhile, young, nubile Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), is the main heroine for this horror pic. She senses intimations of trouble when a stranger wearing a white mask begins to follow her every move... By Halloween Night, Strode gradually forgets about this taciturn man, but she tragically learns that it's a neccessity to remain precarious... ~p~ P.J. Soles (Rock and Roll High School Forever) is Strode's best friend in this movie. She's trustworthy...but rather dim-witted and has a couple of brief nudity scenes. Nancy Loomis (Assault on Precinct 13) is also an acquaintance of Strode. The three girls have decided to go for a night out, but Strode instead wanted to babysit a couple of downright naughty and out-of-control kids. The other two girls go out and have fun, you know, they act horny, have sex with their boyfriends...and get attacked by a homicidal maniac...whoops...gave away the plot twist...oh well... ~p~ Halloween is one of the most well-crafted horror films ever made. It is highly influential in its genre, and surprisingly, director John Carpenter does a great job fabricating a wonderfully fiendish masterpiece without having to resort to a high body count or gratuitous violence and gore. Halloween supposedly became one of the biggest independent films ever made, grossing receipts of over $55 million dollars at the box-office. Halloween is a persuasive horror film because it actually has a logical plot, semi-coherence, important dialogue, fine acting, and decent character angles. Also, director John Carpenter also takes care of the fact that the audience in this film is constantly feeling tense. Like the main character(s) in this film, Halloween, the viewer watching this movie feels consistently in danger to. This person wants to warn the character in this film to watch out...and whether he/she does follow the advice is to be determined... ~p~ Halloween, like a first-rate thriller, allows the viewer to vicariously feel the nerve-wrecking tension of many of the characters involved in this project. Halloween may not have a lot of action, but the continuous feel of jeopardy in this motion picture prevents Halloween from becoming a bore. Halloween is (shockingly) innocuous, tasteful, enjoyable, moderately horrifying, and providing plenty of goosebumps that will accompany u for restless, sleepless nights. Halloween is a film that most people will enjoy. You don't have to have a titanium stomach (unlike most gore drenched movies) to actually have the pleasure of delightfully being scared out of your wits for this horror film. Even 20 years later after Halloween was made, it is still a powerful and highly popular and rented horror video. Halloween scares the daylights out of the audience with **** out of ****."

","Halloween is the kind of movie where I can sit back, watch it, and NOT be relaxed. This is one of the few movies that actually scares me. It's not terrifying, but hey, with a movie that has the eerie music like this one does, it's bound to bring a couple of goose bumps.<br/><br/>The good thing about Halloween is that it dates back a few years. Now days the horror movies involve all of the blood and gore. Twenty-two years ago or so, the movies weren't as detailed to murder scenes as they are now. And that is a good thing. Sure, this movie has stabbings and killings, but not the kind where they are so ridiculous.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis does an excellent job as Laurie Strode. As a newcomer to the industry at that time, she sure does show that she is capable of being crowned a ""scream queen."" The rest of the cast performs well but Curtis really stands out. <br/><br/>The story that is being told is very creative and interesting. Of course, we don't find out why the killer is after Laurie until the sequel, but the one that started the endless series of Halloween's is great none the less. The mysterious (although we know who he is) killer who keeps lurking around, creates a very scary atmosphere. It may be a little dull to some, and that's fine, but I really like it because we DON'T find out why the killer is going on a spree. (Once again until the second film.) <br/><br/>The best thing about Halloween is that it is a very simple movie with a low budget. No expensive explosions or car wrecks were necessary to give this film a little bit of an edge. At certain parts, it couldn't of hurt to added some...exciting parts, but this film is pretty much good the way it is. The one thing that I would change is that the scenes are a little long and drawn out. The movie couldn't have been cut anymore since it is 90 minutes to begin with, but some scenes could have been shortened, and it might have held some more people's interest. One more thing that became semi-annoying was the music. As much as I like the scary music, after hearing it for almost the entire time of the film, it became just a little too much.<br/><br/>
Halloween is a must see on Halloween. Forget the modern day horror flicks that try to capture originality and chilling scenes with their computerized effects. Instead, see one of the movies that actually lives up to the horror title."

It is a classic within it's own right. Michael Myers in his scary white mask is probably the best remembered parts of the slasher pic.  Although there are others, but I won't give anything away. Carpenter's masterpeice was the starting of the rebirth of the horror genre since the B-movies died out in the 1950's.  Many other sociopathic monsters were created to feed the publics' need for scary movies at that time.  For example; Friday the 13th and Prom Night.

Her and her friends just think it's just going to be a normal halloween night, until HE came home...<br/><br/>Also starring in this film is the late Donald Pleasance(sp?) who plays a doctor that treated an escaped mental patient who is about to cause havoc in a small town called Haddonfield.<br/><br/>This is probably one of the top five best horror films of all time, and I highly suggest it for any new horror fan looking for a good scare."
"slamothe77","10","0","0","25 November 2000"," The ultimate movie
","This is the only movie that I have seen that deserves a 10/10. Being a huge horror and suspense fan myself, I have to say that this one has it all.<br/><br/>
The story is quite simple yet just what a great horror movie needs.<br/><br/>The actors are great, especially Donald Pleasance and Nick Castle, who plays ""The shape"" (also known as Michael Myers)<br/><br/>John Carpenter has done an incredible job directing this film, writing it and also taking charge of the music. The movie is really dark, yet fascinating for the eye. Carpenter really knows ""what the eye wants to see"", or what the eye is afraid to see... After using your eyes to scare you, Carpenter takes care of your hearing. The music is very ""creepy"", worthy of Bernard Hermann's score for ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>Halloween is a movie that I have seen at least 50 times. Carpenter does not waste a second; every moment of this picture is exciting. Even though one of the main characters is a really bad guy, you almost get to like him (somehow) because he's so unique, by the way he moves and walks.<br/><br/>I will never get tired of that movie. It's not just a ""horror flick"". It's a true classic. Romantic movies make you cry, this kind of movie scares you. It just reaches a different feeling.<br/><br/>I don't want to tell anybody anything about the movie. Just watch it. Trust me, you won't regret it.<br/><br/>Halloween is a movie that everyone should see."

","I won't go over the plot details...I just want to say that this is probably the scariest movie I've ever seen.  I'm more of a fan of the ""Universal Monsters"" horror films, and I don't really care for the ""slasher"" genre. But there's something about ""Halloween"" that really frightens me.  In addition to the fact that the killer moves about in broad daylight, there used to be a house on my block that looked just like the Myers house.<br/><br/>Truly a pioneer in its genre...good without being corny or too cliche.

","I'd say this movie's in a first place tie for the best of the series with Halloween H20.  This is my first Halloween film to watch and I was impressed.  Unlike the other horror movies I was actually frightened by this one.  I knew that Annie was going to die, but I didn't know when and when Michael sprung up from the backseat and whacked her, that scared the pants off of me.  And just seeing Michael finally appear in the closet when Laurie discovers her friends, that part haunted me for a long time.  I'd be frightened in the dark in my own room for quite sometime after that. Overall, one of the best Halloweens I've ever seen."

"eibon09","Null","0","0","20 November 2000"," From The Golden Era of Horror Films
","Halloween(1978) features a great POV shot at the beginning that's worthy of Argento.  The next comments are a summary of the opening murder scene. Opens in the year 1963 with an overview of a house.  The camera peeks near a window to watch a couple kissing(with the girl wondering where her brother is) who then going upstairs to make love.  The camera moves to the front of the house to look at an upper window(a light goes off).<br/><br/>
The person who the camera represents moves to the side of the house and into the kitchen.  A hand turns on the kitchen lights and reaches inside a drawer for a knife.  The person waits until the young girl's boyfriend leaves the house and then goes upstairs.  The camera glides upstairs, picks up a mask of a clown, and heads for the young woman's room.  The person proceeds to stab the young woman to death and after the murder, the person is revealed to be the brother of the young woman.<br/><br/>
Halloween's main reference is Psycho(1960).  The main actress is played by Janet Leigh's daughter's Jamie Lee Curtis.  Donald Pleasence's character is named after a major figure in Psycho(1960).  The murder of Judith Myers is a reworking of the shower scene in Psycho(1960).  Halloween and Psycho have nothing in common story wise with the exception of the horror element in the shower sequence.<br/><br/>
Halloween(1978) is closer to Deep Red(1975) in style and tone.  Halloween was influenced by the pictures of Dario Argento and Mario Bava.  John Carpenter has acknowledged that Halloween was done as a homage to Dario Argento's Profondo Rosso(1975).  He even was influenced by the Goblin soundtrack.  The haunted Myers house is inspired by ""the house of the screaming child"" in Deep Red(1975).<br/><br/>
Another film that Halloween's origin lie in is Bob Clark's pre slasher pic, Black Christmas(1974).  The two films take place on a national holiday.  The two films have an opening ending.  Black Christmas(1974) has a killer that's elusive and unknown.  Black Christmas contains set pieces that would influence Halloween.<br/><br/>
Halloween(1978) introduced a scary villain in Michael Myers.  Michael Myers as with the punks from Assault on Preceint 13 is a faceless killer that shows no remorse.  The mask that he wears is a way for him to not deal with the basic human emotions that make people good.  The unmasking of Michael Myers reveals someone who is human and scared while having the same expression after being unmasked at the end of the opening murder scene. Michael Myers would create a number of almost scariless murderers in many teen horror flicks.<br/><br/>
Nick Castle as The Shape is menacing and scary.  Seeing a six year old boy kill someone must have been shocking to audiences during the time it was released.  This is something that many studios today would not show or even suggest.  The idea of a six year old boy as a murderer is the most daring aspect of the movie.  Has very little blood and more suspense compared to the sequels.<br/><br/>
Its John Carpenter's most accomplished work and his most popular film. Halloween is also the director's best film.  Other terrific movies by John Carpenter are Assault on Preceint 13(1976), The Fog(1980), Escape from New York(1981), and The Thing(1982).  Laurie Strode is named after the director's first girlfriend.  Dean Cundey's cinematography is one of the top reasons to see Halloween(1978).<br/><br/>
John Carpenter's direction is first class.  One of the few slasher pics that I really enjoy to watch.  The acting is very good compared to other slasher films of that period.  Jamie Lee Curtis brings intellegence and strength to her role of the heroine.  The long camera shot at the beginning of Halloween is influenced by the opening Crane shot of Touch of Evil(1958).<br/><br/>
The mask worn by Michael Myers is a William Shatner mask from the film, The Devil's Rain.  Donald Pleasence was the third choice behind Chris Lee and Peter Cushing for the role of Dr. Loomis.  Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing would have been perfect choices for Dr. Loomis had they choose to star in Halloween(1978).  Donald Pleasence lends his experience among a cast of unknowns.  Halloween(1978) is a great horror film that was part of the last creative era in horror features."

"Shinwa","6","0","0","29 October 2000"," Impressively made low budget shocker
","John Carpenter's canny little exploitation film suffers some from its reputation; nothing makes a rickety shocker made on the cheap less potent than the complicated analysis of its characters' motivations.<br/><br/>As a shock machine, it leaves no stone unturned; it comes across as an enthusiastic low-budget film whose maker had just seen a couple of Dario Argento movies (the comparison in some scenes, such as the eerily lit driving-in-the-rain sequence early on, is striking). Many of what would be determined as the slasher film's worst excesses are here, as in, for example the topless-girl-getting-strangled scene, but the main problems with the movie are its intrusive soundtrack (telegraphs more than its share of scares) and the fact that Carpenter goes to the well too many times with scenes where a group of people have a conversation, and a cut reveals the killer observing them, stripping this ploy of its effect early on. The Steadicam work was influential but somewhat amateurish. However, effective use of sets and lighting work wonders for increasing the on-screen tension.<br/><br/>It isn't one of the great horror films of the 70's (its lack of anything but the crudest and most forced subtext makes it seem small-time in comparison to more challenging movies), but it's great for its genre, even if its phenomenal success helped doom the horror film."

","I first saw ""Halloween"" as a child and it scared the kudos out of me. As an adult, I've bought it and watch it every year around Halloween ( I don't like the edited version, I like to see the whole movie in it's entirety.) I don't care what anyone says about this film, it has definitely stood the test of time and is still scaring the kudos out of children (and adults) today. I love the characters in this movie too, they are all realistic and they play out their scenes very fluidly and true to life, which is what makes this film so eerie, it's so very realistic (except for a killer that won't die, but what do you expect from a horror film?) Jamie Lee Curtis is the ideal actress for Laurie Strode, very intelligent and a fun babysitter, but kind of shy and sort of a door-mat until the time comes to fight off a knife-welding serial killer (woo-hoo!) I really liked P.J. Soles character, aside from the fact that she's cute she can play the ditzy cheerleader VERY well without making her look stupid and totally cliched, Soles is a great actress and was the perfect one to pull it off...TOTALLY! Nancy Loomis plays the smart-aleck Annie to a T, very believable-I really like her line, ""Oh great! I've got three choices: Watch the kids sleep, listen to Lynda screw around or talk to you.""<br/><br/>Dr. Loomis is also a very believable character, searching frantically to find Michael Meyers. The setting was so well done that until recently I had no idea it was actually filmed in California in the springtime, it totally looks like an Illinois town in October. No matter how many times I see this movie I still get that ""Halloween/Fall time"" feeling which makes the movie very eerie (things dying and everything's cold.) The houses used in this movie for the Doyle House and Wallace House are absolutely perfect, that Wallace House at night is scary as hell! Michael's mask is pure genius, hard to believe it's actually a William Shatner mask, the gleaming white glows eerily in the dark, and it's instantly recognizable as the Michael Meyer's Mask. <br/><br/>(SPOILERS AHEAD!!)....... The scenes that have the greatest impact on me personally are when Michael attacks Marion Chambers in the car at the beginning, when Michael murders Lynda while Laurie's on the other end of the phone listening to it thinking it's a joke; when Laurie discovers Annie, Lynda and Bob in the Wallace house all the way up to where she's trying to get Tommy to open the front door at the Doyle House with Michael crossing the street and the Wallace House in the background (very tense moments!); and the infamous closet scene (particulary where Michael's mask is visible just as the closet light comes on) which shows excellent cinematography on such a small budget. The music of course sets the entire mood and is synonymous with Halloween, I can recognize it instantly and it makes my pulse pound just listening to it. I definitely think this film has stood the test of time and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it yet, watch it on Halloween alone if you really want the full impact. Very believable characters, very believable plot, and a very believable killer."

","John Carpenter's 1978 smash ""Halloween"",the most influential horror film since ""Psycho"",revived the slasher genre and spawned a countless number of clones and imitations,including its own sequels. The late,great British actor Donald Pleasence stars as spooked psychiatrist Sam Loomis (Carpenter,an obvious Hitchcock disciple,loads his films with references and homages to Hitch,as does fellow disciple Brian DePalma of ""Carrie"" fame). Loomis is tracking down escaped mental patient Michael Myers,an evil,remorseless killing machine who returns to his hometown (Haddonfield,Illinois) 15 years after he murdered his sister Judith on Halloween night as a young boy. Jamie Lee Curtis (daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh,the latter who preceded her daughter as Scream Queen of the slasher genre in Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho""),also stars as Laurie Strode,a teenaged babysitter who Myers stalks,along with her two friends, Annie (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda (P.J.Soles) on the fateful Halloween night in 1978. The final act of the film,in which Laurie is chased and stalked by Myers,boasts some of the most harrowing moments ever captured in a horror film. Along with the dynamic duo of Pleasence and Curtis,the other actors in the film,obvious amateurs,aren't half-bad: Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett,Kyle Richards as Lindsay Wallace,Brian Andrews as Tommy Doyle,Nancy Stpehens as Nurse Marion Chambers,and John Michael Graham as Lynda's doomed boyfriend Bob. The film's only flaws are the poor casting choices of Nancy Loomis and P.J.Soles,both AWFUL in their roles as Annie and Lynda,and both looking WAY too old to portray high schoolers. Aside from this,""Halloween"" is a classic....and check out that score by the director himself,John Carpenter! Its the best since Bernard Herrmann's legendary ""Psycho"" score. **** A"

","What can we say about John Carpenter? From the beginning with 'Assault on Precinct 13' right through until 'Vampires', he has never failed to provide horror lovers with fantastic macabre stories and wonderful suspense-filled scenes.<br/><br/>Although there are a few indiscretions ('Christine' and 'Halloween 3' spring to mind), he is regarded to be one of the greatest horror filmmakers of the 20th century (and into the 21st we can only hope), and why is this you say? Because of a low-budget shock film made in 20 days in 1978, HALLOWEEN.<br/><br/>This film is what started the teenage horror films of the 80's and 90's rolling off the production line. From this film sprang some other classic film such as 'Friday the 13th', 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', 'Scream' and so on and so forth. Although the other three I mentioned are among my personal favourites none match up to the thrill ride I discovered when I first saw Halloween. The creepy setting, the well thought out background story, the vulnerable teenage girls and the fearful Dr Loomis who believed all too much what Michael Myers was capable of; these factors set the stage for what would become a legendary film for several decades to come.<br/><br/>People have said that the film has no merit and is a waste of time to watch as it has no blood or gore and the thrills are less than spectacular, but in the seventies this was the thrill that was required to kick start the horror genre which was taken over by the monster movies of the 40's and 50's and then the sci-fi alien movies of the 50's and 60's.<br/><br/>As for the many sequels that have been spawned from the original, with the exception of part 2; I believe that they are getting out of hand like the Friday the 13th saga. I am the type of horror lover that can watch a movie over and over despite it being thought of as ""crap"" and I do enjoy the Halloween sequels but I think that they should have left it alone with H2O instead of announcing that it wasn't actually Myers in that movie because it can't go on forever and if they are not careful people will start to forget Carpenter's original story. If John Carpenter decides to be a part of Halloween 8 perhaps the master himself believes that the story can be salvaged and it could turn out to be quite a good film. My one true wish is that no-one will attempt to make a remake of the original Halloween, because you can't redo something that is perfect as it is already. You can look toward the remake of Psycho for evidence of this.<br/><br/>I will genuinely enjoy the new Halloween movie without a doubt but i hope that it will be the end for the originals sake."

","I first saw this scary slasher when I was around eight years old, on t.v. Michael Myers scared me to death and one of the scenes that scared me the most was when he kills Annie in the car. I own nearly four different home video versions of this film. I have the original Media version, the Blockbuster version, the regular Anchor Bay tape, and the Special Edition Anchor Bay tape in widescreen, with all the interviews on it. I fell in love with P.J. Soles, who plays Lynda. She is one of my favorite actresses. Of course, everyone knows the plot to this film. It deals with the murderous doings of escaped killer Michael Myers, who creeps through yards in a small Illinois town and polishes off babysitters and their horny boyfriends with his handy butcher knife. Of course there is little blood spilled here but the film is so incredibly well-made, scary, and atmospheric that it does not matter. This is one of my extremely favorite horror films, along with ""The Exorcist"", ""Black Christmas"", and ""Suspiria"".

","I first saw this film about 12 years ago and I am still awed by the genius Carpenter instilled into what could have been a by-the-numbers cheapie. Atmosphere is what this film is about.  Nearly the whole film takes place during one night, and even the daytime scenes seem somewhat evil and foreboding.  Let's also not forget Capenter's brilliant score to the film. Much like the music Williams did for Jaws, Carpenter's music is simple and terrifyingly effective.  Carpenter wisely doesn't make Michael Myers out to be some sort of unstoppable zombie (as in the Friday the 13th series) or some wisecracking killer ala Fred Krueger, but simply make him out to be ""The Shape"", who has no concept of morality.  Dr. Sam Loomis, in my opinion, is one of the most memorable characters ever in horror (one of the greatest Donald Pleasance performances).  This is not a film that relies on gore to scare people, but rather suspense.  Carpenter has said before that he holds great admiration for Alfred Hitchcock, and this film shows it.  And as for the ending, don't expect an overwhelmingly happy one, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  This is horror at its purest, and this makes it the best horror film ever (By the way, the THX DVD is awesome)."

","Minor spoilers:<br/><br/>The original Halloween did not invent the slasher genre. Merely made it popular. I haven't seen Black Christmas, but I hear that Halloween is remarkably similar and for those who site Halloween as the beginning of all slaughter films, should take close looks at Black X-mas and the Texas Chainsaw Massacres. With that all said, Halloween is a great film.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Wicked little child hacks up sister for no reason. Wicked little child is locked away where he grows into a wicked man. And on fifteen years from the day of the murder, he escapes and goes out on a killing spree. His doctor pursues him as Mr. Michael Myers set his sights on a trio of babysitters...<br/><br/>Solid direction, solid script, solid acting with great performances by Donald Pleasence, Nick Castle, and Jamie Lee Curtis. A few ""kewl"" references to Psycho. Some stuff that is just plain funny. Some stuff that is just plain scary. Some stuff that just simply glues your eyes to the screen. And other things that are just plain boring...I really didn't care for the excessive pointless girltalk, but I guess it was there to show that these characters were real people. The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't stand up to repeative viewings as well as it's sequel does...but it's still a great movie to watch on...Mother's Day!!! j/k...it's a must-watch on Halloween night, especially if you don't have plans...followed by one good sequel and the rest were either horrible or disappointing."

","Halloween is one of the last in the ""classic seventies horror"" era before we went into the sequel-thon camp of the 80s and the toned down turmoil of the 90s...Now this movie is fairly entertaining. The story has already been explained tenfold so I won't bore you with the details. But some of the stuff in this movie is simply plain brillant. Firstly, the opening scene is pretty scary stuff with the Killer's POV and all [not Carpenter's invention but it was still a good idea to use for this scene]. Then 15 years later Mr. Michael Myers is all grown up and he's stalking three teen-age girls for some unknown reason. In hot pursuit, is Sam Loomis played by the great Donald Pleasence. Pleasence is hands down the best actor in this film but we also get good performances by Jamie Lee Curtis as virginal babysitter Laurie Strode and Nick Castle as the psychopathic maniac. The rest of the cast is actually quite decent with little to no bad acting. This movie is loaded with sex and nudity but surprising kept it low with the gore. Nowadays, it's the opposite. In my opinion, Blood in some scenes could've added to the atmosphere, such as the kitchen scene.<br/><br/>Besides being a movie with good acting, a fair story, and great visuals/directing, it did have it's flaws. At times I found the dialogue between Laurie & CO. very BORING. Fans will say it was to develop the characters. Well there is a thin line between dialogue meant to develop the characters and dialogue meant to take up space. Halloween goes back and forth. And because of this, the film gets very slow between the 20 min-50 min mark. The first twenty minutes are a great set up and the last forty are pure brilliance, but the inbetween isn't anything special. Plus the movie's influence is heavily overrated. Halloween proved that slasher flicks were marketable, but did not invent them by any means. Not the best horror movie ever and it doesn't crack by top ten, but still a must-see for those with an serious interest in the genre.<br/><br/>What's the Bogeyman?-Laurie Strode As a matter of fact...that was.-Sam Loomis"

By today's standards, this film is full of cliched situations and sub plots, but in its time, these horror cliches were just being born, and therefore makes this film one of the most original and scary films out there.

","Halloween is considered by most to be the grandfather of slasher films. Although slashers existed before Halloween, John Carpenter created a truly terrifying film that caught the attention of the mainstream, which tended to dismiss horror films up until that point. <br/><br/>The plot follows Michael Myers, a man whom at a very young age, murdered his older sister, and was forever locked away in an insane asylum, never speaking a word. Fifteen years later, Myers escapes, and returns to the town he shocked many years before. <br/><br/>Donald Pleasence portrays Dr. Loomis, a psychiatrist that has been working with Michael in an attempt to reach the person inside. After 15 years, he knows that Michael is pure evil, and he most stop at nothing to prevent his terror from being released.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis gives an excellent performance as Laurie, a teenager in Haddonfield that catches little glimpses of Michael observing her in strange places. The tension slowly builds, through the expert use of the musical score, and perfect light and shadow combinations. When Michael starts to kill, you often are tricked into thinking you've just seen more than you have. The mood is so strong and compelling, that when we are given the suggestion of a knife stabbing somebody, our minds fill in the rest. This is a fascinating quality for a horror movie to possess, as the human mind can always dream up something more gruesome than even the best special effects wizard can produce. <br/><br/>During the scenes in the house, with Laurie fighting for her life against the seemingly unstoppable Michael, the use of light and shadow expertly hides the killer in unexpected places. When Michael abruptly sits up in the hallway behind Laurie, don't be surprised if you find yourself yelling ""GET OUT"" in a vain attempt to warn Jamie Lee. <br/><br/>The tension and pacing of this film is spectacular. All the movies that followed, from the Friday the 13ths, to the Nightmare on Elm Streets, to the Scream series, and Halloween's own sequels, all use this movie as the template.

","Halloween is possibly my favourite movie. From the moment John Carpenter's terrifying theme tune rings out to the end credits I was glued to my seat. Carpenter brilliantly builds the suspense. The opening steadicam scene, witnessed through the eyes of a six year old Michael Myers. Myers' escape from the mental hospital exactly 15 years later. The introduction of the various teenage lambs to the slaughter. There is a hint of the terrible things to come in the opening hour and the last half hour certainly delivers. Halloween has been often imitated, including a string of sequels, but, no other 'slasher' film comes close. Halloween was the original and by far the best. For me Halloween is the definitive scary movie."
"gino2013","10","0","0","15 August 2000"," Greatest Horror Movie of All-Time
","Halloween is the best horror movie out there made.  I'm the biggest Halloween fan ever since I can remember. When I was 9 years old, I was grounded for some reason on a Saturday night & so I went to my room and I had The Movie Network, I saw that a movie called Halloween 4 : The Return of Michael Myers is coming on...decided to watch, and that's when it all began.  Now, i'm a huge fan of the entire series. John Carpenters greatest flick of all time plus the best horror movie ever made.  The directing is unbelievable and the music is insane to say the least.  The characters are too real as we go into the life of Laurie Strode ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) and Donald Pleasances obsession with the little boy who killed his sister on Halloween night.  Michaels rage still sends chills down my spine when I hear the music. Halloween is not like other pointless slashers, in fact Halloween is the original, the rest came afterwards.  I know people who watch Halloween now and don't know why i'm so in love with it.  It's very simple, most people have seen the modern 90's horror movies and obviously it's much newer than a '79 movie but the mask, the plot, the soundtrack, the directing and Jamie Lee Curtis' first movie which made her a hit is so great that even today I praise its work. As for the rest of the films, I feel the sequel is equal to the original, very well done and very scary and number 3 doesn't matter, but part 4, 5, 6 and H20 maybe ruined the whole story because of Steve Miner.  Steve Miner wouldn't know a horror movie if it picked him up at a night club.  He absolutely ruined the whole story line when he made Halloween 20 Years Later.  I wanna know what happened to Tommy Doyle, Karen and little Danny. I must say but the rest are decent enough to be called horror movies but not the greatest. Other than that, Halloween is a definite must see.  A 10 out of 10 with me. Only movies that came pretty close to being as scary as Halloween is Evil Dead, Stephen Kings IT & Pet Semetary as well as I must admit the new and original I Know What You Did Last Summer ( Great example of a great horror flick ruined by the sequel ). I could go on about how great Halloween is and i'll go off by saying horror movies today wouldn't be the same if it wasn't for Halloween."
"applehuntr","10","0","0","14 August 2000"," A film that still scares after more than 20 years
","Halloween is a great movie. It's older than me, but it never fails to cause tension. Of course there will be the occasional person who will rant on and on about ""There was barely any gore..."" and ""There's not enough deaths"", don't listen to that person, there more happy with films like, well, those stupid and countless sequels.      John Carpenter creates a normal setting, just like where you or I live, and makes you fear it, because Michael Myers may be in the bushes or in your backyard. The piano score is extremely creepy. The movie is about a young boy, Michael Myers, who murders his sister on Halloween and sent to a mental institution for a long time. But 15 years later, just before Halloween, he escapes. He returns to Haddonfield, Illinois and starts to stalk and kill young babysitters, or whoever happens to get in his way. A young Jamie Lee Curtis brilliantly plays Laurie Strode, Michael's main target. There are some extremely suspenseful scenes, like when Laurie just barely escapes Michael in the house her friend was babysitting for, and runs to the neighbors house, they think her yelling and screaming is a prank, they ignore her. Michael comes out of the house where Laurie escaped him, and slowly pursues her.(he, unlike most horror movie killers, walks, doesn't run)She runs to the house she babysits for only to find she is locked out. Michael comes closer and closer and...I won't ruin the rest) This movie is very suspenseful and is a definite must see for the any moviegoer. Those who must have endless blood and gore, I suggest you skip this one. A classic. 10/10"

","From the opening, seemingly continuous shot through Michael's POV to the final, satisfying chase the film had me hooked.<br/><br/>The lack of budget barely shows and John Carpenter basically gives horror directors a clinic on how to effectively maintain suspense throught an entire film. The simple, effective story works and there has rarely been a more menacing villain than Michael Myers.<br/><br/>While not the first slasher movie ever made (Chainsaw Massacre 1, Black Christmas and numerous others preceded it) it is definitely the best, and the one which started the 80's horror craze.

","In 1978, John Carpenter had brought to the horror world...Halloween. Which was actually supposed to be a sequel to the 1974 horror flick Black Christmas. But Halloween became a stand-alone film and often a film hailed as the best slasher film ever. Despite what some say, Psycho is actually, the film that probably started the whole slasher film craze. And then The Texas Chainsaw Massacre kick-started it even more. So I wouldn't necessarily say Halloween started the slasher genre. But still, it's certainly often called the best.<br/><br/>In my opinion the best slasher is Freddy, and the best slasher movie, A Nightmare On Elm Street. But Michael Myers is always a haunting image and his series a very infamous one.<br/><br/>In Halloween, little Mikey, as well all know, slaughters his sis and ends up in a mental hospital. But he breaks out and heads for Haddonfield, Illinois to track down his second sister, Laurie Strode (who would later change her name to Kerie Tate.) Anyway, he picks up some victims on the way to stalking his second sis, and in the process, creating infamous horror moments, that will be zapped in our mines for our entire life.<br/><br/>John Carpenter, who has created other great cinema spectacles, created a film with strong atmosphere, mood and of course, music. And the cast members do a great job. Jamie Lee Curtis really deserves the SCREAM QUEEN title. And all the Michael Myers performers did excellent. My ratings of the Halloween series  *****"

","Where do I begin?  Well, when most people hear about a slasher movie, they think, 'Oh that's just a movie about a bunch of horny teenagers running around getting their heads cut off!'  Well guess where people got that idea? This is a tough one folks so think before you answer!!  'Halloween' set the standard for slasher movies, and since it's success, has been copied so many times I run out of fingers.  But unlike it's sadly delinquent offspring, 'Halloween' is actually worth watching.  I enjoyed it very much.  I don't know why.  I didn't find it all that scary, (although the closet scene was rather tense).  But I guess just because it's a horror, doesn't mean you have to be scared to enjoy it.<br/><br/>I guess the reason I enjoyed it was because the way it was filmed creates a mood, and while I watched it, I had a feeling of what the characters were going through as good old Michael Myers 'calmly' hacks his way through doorways and windows and the sort.<br/><br/>You'll notice I put the word 'calmly' in parenthesis.  I think it's neat how Michael just walks instead of runs after his victims.  I sat down and thought about why he would do this.  Is he 'Transportationly' challenged?  I finally came to the conclusion that he just doesn't care.  If he catches them and kills them, great!  If he doesn't, he feels that there will always be someone else to slash.  Maybe they'll be in the shower!  You never know. Anyway, to make a long story short, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it NOW!"

The killer Michael returns to his home town and takes it upon himself to go after Jamie Lee Curtis' character, Laurie. The movie takes place on Halloween night and  Michael stops at nothing trying to get at Laurie, he kills any one who gets in the way including all her friends and a pet dog!!!!<br/><br/>The reason Halloween was so successful was due to the chilling soundtrack ( composed by J Carpenter) and the imense feel of claustrophobia as Myers chases his victims through tiny suburban houses, a laundry house and down dark lanes.<br/><br/>This is where today's horror movies fail, they are all teenyboppers starring ""the beautiful people"", with a very poppy soundtrack ( the faculty, urban legend, the craft), the films are set in huge houses or vast schools, the victims being chased all over town, making the fact that the characters are being found all the more unbelievable"
"arturopanduro","10","0","0","10 May 2000"," A Horror Masterpiece
","Halloween is truly a horror classic which set the mold for many cheap imitations as well as many inferior sequels. The story revolves around a six-year-old boy named Michael Myers, who murders his older sister on Halloween night, 1963. He is placed in an asylum out-of-town under the care of Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance). He escapes from the asylum 15 years later on Halloween Eve, and returns to his home town of Haddonfield, IL, donning a frightening mask (hence the tagline: The Night He Came Home). He stalks three high school girls, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Loomis), two of whom are babysitting on Halloween night. The acting by all is above average, with the exception of Nancy Loomis, whose performance often plays out on a subpar level. The score by John Carpenter adds to the suspense and terror of the film. I highly recommend this film to those few who haven't seen it. If you're looking for lots of gore, this isn't for you. It's simply horror and suspense at its finest. I also recommend the best way to view this movie: the DVD widescreen version with the lights off and the sound turned up. You won't be disappointed. It wouldn't hurt to watch it on Halloween night, either. My rating: 10."

","'Halloween' isn't just the best true horror film of all time, it's the definitive example of how to make a movie for less than a third of a million dollars and still be infinitely better than the latest $150 million dollar blockbuster. And all that for a movie that's nearly a quarter century old. It has fared the test of time remarkably better than nearly any movie ever has, and will likely remain on the top of everyone's chart for years to come.<br/><br/>	The film is easily the only slasher movie that actually succeeds at scaring the audience. Friday the 13th, Child's Play, Leprechaun, ect., they never were suprising or even the least bit frightening, and piled endless buckets of gore instead of chills. Halloween is never derivative, never annoying, never boring.<br/><br/>	John Carpenter's haunting musical score captures the atmosphere perfectly, and his writing and direction show a seemingly never ending tap of talent not utilized in his post-Halloween movies.<br/><br/>	The story is by no means complex, but is still solid and very scary. Fifteen years after murdering his sister at the age of six, a soulless maniac returns to his home town to seek revenge.<br/><br/>	A perfect ten, in reality the movie has no faults, and the only thing it is guilty of is launching an epidemic of third rate clones."

","There is really not much new to say about ""Halloween"" that hasn't been said before. Virtually every horror fan has seen this film and Michael Meyers has become somewhat of an icon.<br/><br/>The plot is very simple and the film opens with a young Michael Meyers brutally stabbing his sister, Judith, to death on Halloween night. He is committed to an institution under the care of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who believe that Michael is pure evil. 15 years after murdering his sister, Michael breaks out of the institution on Halloween and makes his way back to Haddonfield to continue what he started years before by stalking a group of high school girls, including the virginal Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who happen to be babysitting.<br/><br/>The film is crediting for virtually creating the modern day slasher film and all the clichés that have come with it (though anyone who has seen ""Black Christmas,"" which came out four years before this films knows differently). Still, John Carpenter gives us on hell of a ride with ""Halloween."" The tone of the film is foreboding to begin with and Carpenter does great at capturing the spirit of a small town Halloween. Once night falls in the film, Carpenter is a master us using color and contrasts to create tension and suspense. Michael's white mask is often seen in the background of a dark scene or room. The score is the best and most recognizable of any horror film in history and is an example of a score matching perfectly to the tone and purpose of the film. The final 20 minutes of the film-the confrontation between Laurie and Michael-remains one of the best chase/stalk scenes in film history. The music, the atmosphere, Curtis's acting--everything combines perfectly to create a heart-pounding climax.<br/><br/>Often imitated, never duplicated, ""Halloween"" remains the paramount example of a slasher film done right.<br/><br/>My Grade: A+"

","I first saw this movie in 1980, when I was 18. I was absolutely enthralled even then. Of course, my mind was still young and relatively impressionable, so it's no surprise that when I readied myself to watch it the second time round, I was prepared to be bored.<br/><br/>To my utter amazement and somewhat disgrace, I was even more scared. And for the entirely same reasons as in 1980. The thought of a mindless maniac stalking the streets of American apple-pie suburbia appeals to the basest instincts in us all.<br/><br/>What more can I say? There is no doubt that it is the most successful horror series, not counting Scream. The villain is just indescribably evil: the lack of emotion and the lack of detail on his featureless mask make for a truly feared opponent. His methodical slashing of his victims and complete lack of care strikes terror into criminals and goodies alike.<br/><br/>The heroine is perfect. Virginal and straight-laced, she is not a beautiful blonde but your ordinary girl next door (not without her prettiness, though). She is clearly terrified of Myers, as one should be, and her determination to avoid him portrays natural feelings better than other films of the slasher sub-genre.<br/><br/>Even the victims are perfect. Foul mouthed, partying, sex-mad teenagers, loaded with alcohol and God knows what else. The film clearly sends out a moral here, one that only fools will miss.<br/><br/>And we must not forget the admirable Donald Pleasence, who devoted most of his life to on-screen psychiatrist Dr. Loomis. He is as methodical as Myers in his pursual; as determined as Myers to track him down. He is intelligent and knows Myers, yet is still always surprised at what he does next. He shows all the emotions of human beings.<br/><br/>Well, I must finish my worshipping there. Forget mindless rip-offs like Friday the 13th.

","This movie is probably more important for the development of the horror genre than any other film. It has spawned a whole new kind of films, with many rip-offs following in the 80s and 90s like the ""Friday the 13th"" series or Scream 1-3. Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is often referred as the film that created horror (I think it's more like a suspense film than a real horror film) but in my opinion Halloween set the standard for horror films. All the modern teen-horror flicks are basically nothing more than rip-offs with some comedy elements added. Not even Scream (which I thought was pretty cool) can reach the quality of this one.<br/><br/>Halloween creates an atmosphere that is unique. Michael Myers is much scarier than the killer from ""Scream"" (who is considerably dumb, running into every obstacle while chasing his soon-to-be victims). The acting in Halloween is exceptionally good for a horror film. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role) and Doctor Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) are two very well drawn characters and the directing by John Carpenter is ingenious and one of the best ever seen (point-of-view shot at the beginning of the film etc.). Carpenter also did a hell of a job composing the score which is one of the best in movie history, especially the title song.<br/><br/>An often criticized point is the story. Though I have to admit it is kept simple, a more complex story would probably have killed the film's charm. It is the simplicity that makes this film what it is. Michael Myers is killing people for no particular reason, he's just pure evil. After having stabbed, strangled and slashed a few kids he goes after Laurie Strode (in ""Halloween II"" we'll learn that she is his sister). The creepy effect of the film doesn't depend on gore since there are almost no bloody scenes. The end left the possibility of a follow-up which then was made three years later.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is a must-see not only for horror-fans but also for anyone who is interested in good films.<br/><br/>My rating: 10/10 (did I mention that it is my favored horror film?)"

","If you are a die-hard horror movie fan, this one is for you.  John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a must see for any true horror fan.  ""Halloween"" is about a psychopathic murderer, Michael Myers, who escapes from a mental institution to kill people in his home town, Haddonfield, Illinois.  I know it may sound a little ""obvious"" or ""terrible"" but it is very spine tingling.<br/><br/>It stars Donald Pleasence as Dr. Sam Loomis who is Michael Myers doctor, and a very young Jamie Lee Curtis (this was her first major film) as an innocent baby-sitter who is Michael's target.  Along with these two wonderful actors stars Nancy Loomis as Annie, Laurie's friend, (Nancy Loomis also stars in John Carpenter's ""The Fog"" along with Jamie Lee Curtis as well), P.J. Soles as Lynda, Laurie's other wacky friend (she has a small part along side with Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie"").<br/><br/>Annie and Lynda only care about going out with their boyfriends, unlike Laurie, who make tons by babysitting.  When Annie and Lynda decide to sneek out while on the job, Laurie is stuck watching her regular, plus Annie's. Laurie thinks how wonderful and fun it would be to go with them, but doesn't realize how lucky she will be that she doesn't.  One by one, Michael strikes, making his way to his final victim, Laurie.  Throughout the whole movie, Dr. Loomis and the Sherif (who is Annie's dad) try to find Michael. When Michael reached Laurie, he doesn't get Laurie right away.  Will this give her time to escape, and will Dr. Loomis save her in time?<br/><br/>Not only does this movie have great acting, but the musical score is terrifying and fun as well. All of the music you hear in this movie was written and performed by John Carpenter, a real jumper. Another good thing is how there is not a whole lot of gore and blood in this movie. Most of it is all in your mind. Rent or buy Halloween as soon as possible so you can experience the ultimate fright night that everyone is talking about. You'll be glad you did!"

","Halloween is one of the best horror movies for many reasons: excellent music,acting,directional style and camera angles. The plot is basic about Michael Myers who brutally murders his sister on Halloween when he is young and is locked away but escapes on Halloween night 15 years later and terrorizes his hometown of Haddonfield,Illonois. What makes this movie so great is that it is full of suspense and scares rather than gratuitous gore which most horror movies have. Halloween is a classic that ranks on top of other great horror movies such as The Exorcist and Psycho."

But, just because I didn't find it scary, doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I thought it was a great movie.  And, well, the part where Jamie Lee Curtis is in the closet did kind of get me going.

","While other slasher movies have been named the original slasher and horror movies, such as Friday The 13th, A Nightmare On Elm Street, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, I believe that Halloween is the only real slasher movie out there, and that a lot of other cheap movies have been modeled after it. Unlike other movies of this kind, Halloween makes a believeable storyline compared to other slasher movies, and a pretty much believeable killer, where he is not some invincible demon-like character that still doesn't die after 9 sequels. He is actually human and the acting in this movie is pretty good, not like other horror movies, where it sounds as if the actors are reading the script for the first time as they act it out. This movie is very original, entertaining, and one of the most important films to the horror genre. I highly recommend this movie to you, especially if you like this kind of movie."
"marko","Null","0","0","4 February 2000"," Maybe the Scariest Movie of All Time
","In a three week shooting schedule, and with a miniscule budget (even by 1978 standards), John Carpenter made what is certainly one of the two or three most frightening movies ever made.<br/><br/>This film is the archetype which many of the horror films of the 80's and 90's unsuccessfully tried to duplicate.  It pulled together many elements which have since become horror standards:  the silently relentless (and perhaps immortal) killer;  the sexy teens who get bumped off and the pure teen who does not; the musical theme which signals the audience of the killer's arrival.  All but eighteen minutes of the film take place in the dark.  The skillfully underplayed and self-contained performance of Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis may even foreshadow Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter.<br/><br/>One word of warning:  don't expect gallons of grue in this movie.  As Hitchcock shot ""Psycho"" without gore, so Carpenter proves that a film can scare the bejesus out of its audience without buckets of blood.  Leave Jason in his woods; let Freddie  stay on Elm Street;  you can even skip the Michael Meyers sequels.  But if you want to see how truly frightening a movie can be, nuke the popcorn, turn off the lights, and pop ""Halloween"" into your VCR."

","This is an excellent scary movie.  Those few folks who haven't seen it may have a couple of problems.  They must remember that this is the first true slasher film.  It created all the clichés so it can be forgiven for its miscues.<br/><br/>For example on more than one occasion, Jamie Lee Curtis' character wounds the killer and instead of running from the house, she drops her weapon and curls up into a ball a few feet from the stunned attacker.  This creates great tension but is fairly asinine.<br/><br/>Also there is a singularly gratuitous nude scene (oops I spilled butter on my clothes, I better strip to my panties this instant).<br/><br/>All in all, this is a film oozing with classic scares in a genre gone horror-comedy.  It should be a reminder that gore has nothing to do with scares."

","Why did Hitchcock film Psycho is black and white?  Mood.  Mood is essential to a good horror movie.  What two films best use mood?  Hands down - Psycho and John Carpenter's Halloween.  From a technical standpoint, both of these movies are perfect.  Let's look at Halloween for a moment.  Carpenter uses all the technical elements to create one movie that is 100% mood.  The music, the lighting, the direction and most importantly The Shape. Carpenter builds such tension that the viewer is almost relieved that the movie is over.  His use of foreground, lighting, and that unforgettable score put viewers right in the movie.  And let us not forget the most important element.  The Shape.  A faceless, emotionless being that doesn't stop until stopped.  Why does Michael stop to put the mask back on before he continues to attack Laurie?  He's not human.  The visuals and acting are so real and innocent that Haddonfield becomes AnyTown, USA.  Haddonfield is the town I grew up in.  I was being babysat during those years.  That's my life.  It's too real.  Carpenter knew that, and that's where he got us.  It 's not wonder this movie was causing people to seizure in the theatres.  If you've never seen Halloween, or haven't seen it in awhile, I highly recommend it (try to find it in WideScreen format).  It's my favorite film. And to all the skeptics, you know nothing about filmmaking or the art of suspense.  Carpeneter knew what he was creating.  It's the only movie that stands up to Hitchcock's classic Psycho.  The only one.  One last thing for the record - Halloween's 2-7 are nothing but Hollywood schlock.  I'd like to think that Michael Myers had no motive.  That these killings were being committed some random serial killer, not some guy with a vengenance to kill his sister.  It's absurd.  What is scarier than a random killer on the loose in your neighborhood?  Halloween II was created after the fact and the studios wanted something to continue the series so Carpenter wrote in that Myers was after his sister, it was the only way to continue.  If not, then what was Carpenter trying to say with those last shots in the original ?  And, if not, why didn't Myers just walk right up to Laurie and kill her instead of all her friends first?  All the sequels do is take away from the original.  The sequels created two decades of skeptics and non-believers. It's a shame.  Hollywood can ruin anything."

"MooCowMo","8","0","0","14 November 1999"," The Night MooCow Myers Came Home!! :
","Landmark, ground-breaking horror film from John Carpenter that created a whole new genre in horror: the Omnipotent Slasher flick.  Every film from the ""Friday the 13th"" series, the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series, up to and including the bland ""Screams"" series, owes everything to this pioneering chiller.  Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may have opened the door for psychological horror films, but ""Halloween"" blew the doors wide open.  A young murderer who grows up in an institution for the criminally insane escapes & makes his way back to his home town in time for Halloween, where he gives the frollicking, nubile teens what-for.  Michael Myers is a witches' brew of urban myth, homicidal psychosis, and obsessive, raging revenge, all in one monsterous metaphore unlike anything previous in Horror film history.  Some of Horror's finest scenes in come from this terrifying chiller.  The opening sequence, with the ""thru-the-mask"" 1st-person view of little Michael's first killing, is a stroke of macabre genius, showing that under the right circumstances, there is a little Michael Myers in all of us.  The final scene is a chilling shock that jolted screams from every theater in the country - never before had a killer/monster walked away from his death scene.  We are appalled by the ambiguous ending because it confirms once and for all that we are dealing with something beyond our scope of understanding.  Michael Myers has become a universal fear come to life, the boogyman, a force of nature that mankind cannot even cowprehend, much less kill.  At least ""Psycho""'s Norman Bates, for all his psychotic foibles, is human.  Somewhere, somehow, Michael Myers lost his humanity, and became the very living symbol of death.  How do you fight that?  You can't, and that's what ""Halloween"" is all about.  Every aspect of this film is superior, from the direction to the acting to the legendary creepy film score.  ""Halloween"" casts a frightening shadow over every horror film made since 1978, and it's influences on modern film cannot easily be cownted.  This is essential viewing for all horror fans, and the MooCow says you better get yer hooves on a copy, before Michael Myers comes for a visit... ;=8)"
"Chris(Runner)","Null","0","0","13 November 1999"," Horror at its undefeatable best
","When I say ""undefeatable best"" I am referring to the whole genre of horror movies like this. I am talking about the creepy, stay-with-you-and-scare-you-in-the-dark slasher genre. This is the type that makes you afraid of the dark, and scares all hell into you. Halloween is the best example of this, and therefore, in my opinion, the horror movie ever. Sure, ""The Shining"", ""The Exorcist""(which was VERY scary), and other horror movies of this type and caliber take their toll, but no horror movie scares you and stays with you like ""Halloween"". The thing is, I only saw it on TV, so it must be even better on video. But when i saw it on TV, for the first time, I was having a sleep over with my friend. He had already gone to sleep, and we were about to go to bed, so the lights were out. Only when I was in bed did I find ""Halloween"" on TV. And it was scary when i flipped it on, so I didn't want to get up to turn the lights on. The scenes with Michael Myers are just creepy. I know that you're all familiar with the white stalker mask that he wore, so I know i'm not giving anything away when I say that in the dark those scenes send chills through your body. And the chills vary in size according to the scariness of the scene. if you don't get what i mean, see the movie and you will. I know I reviewed the Shining and probably a couple other horror movies. the reason this review is better and more convincing is that the movie is better. It's scarier, the music is more frightening, and the acting shows that bad things can always happen. The scary part is you never know when. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent as Laurie Strode. She creates the eerie atmosphere, and Nancy Kyes and P.J. Soles create the ""nothing is wrong"" atmosphere that a good horror movie needs. The other thing that I found amazing and delighted me about this movie was that it has the scenes I worry about having in a nightmare. A wierd nightmare. That scares the hek out of me when I think about it at night. Which is what the movie does. I won't say anything more because to enjoy this movie to the caliber I'm talking about you have to have no idea. if you haven't seen this movie, and you like horror movies, for your sake and all horror movie fans, see it.

I mean, the scene where Michael is going after Laurie across the street to the Doyle's house and she doesn't have her keys.... that whole scene is scary to the core! The scenes where he appears in the dark, out of nowhere, right behind people.... frightening! This movie is so believable because it plays upon real fears... that this can happen to you, in your home, in your town, a madman after you, without you knowing why. (The reason Michael is after Laurie becomes clear in the next sequel).<br/><br/> Anyone reading this review who hasn't seen Halloween, I urge you to see this horror classic. It's truly frightening!

The two movies were featured on the TV during the movie.<br/><br/>People (mostly women) were yelling for Laurie to not go across the street and for her not to put down the knife. Then they screamed when Michael kept rising. >  The end was like the story they used to tell in basic training; kick him in the balls, break his nose, bash his head in and shoot him.  If he gets up, run like hell...<br/><br/>In many ways, Michael Meyers was like his distant cousin Jason.  You couldn't make him leave!  He just kept coming back.  I saw Halloween II and III on HBO and I haven't bothered to see any of the others that followed.<br/><br/>Personally, I thought they should have let it end with the first one.<br/><br/>It isn't quite as good on commercial TV because the commercials break up the continunity of the movie.

It's no wonder with quotes like this that Halloween is considered to be a horror film classic.  Little did the innocent people of Haddonfield, Illinois realize that on this particular Halloween night that Michael Myers would return home to seek havoc on them. John Carpenter's Halloween is a creepy and spine tingling experience for the viewer, that will keep them on the edge of their seat wondering what could possibly happen next.  Halloween is full of suspenseful moments.  An example of this would be the scene in which Annie goes into the garage, gets in her car, and has no idea that Michael Myers is waiting for her in the back seat. To this very day I still have to check the back seat of my car before daring to go anywhere.  Another suspenseful scene is when Laurie is frantically trying to get into the house, meanwhile Michael Myers is coming from across the street wanting to kill her.  Another key ingredient that adds suspense to Halloween is the music.  When Michael Myers is stalking a helpless victim this creepy music starts to play, and adds suspense to the already frightening scene. Halloween was released in 1978 and it is still frightening people to this very day.  In my opinion it is one of the best and original horror films ever made."

","I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view, nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception, it may have been a brilliant horror/thriller movie.<br/><br/>Beginning on Halloween night 1968, 6 year old Michael commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister. Michael is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder again.<br/><br/>From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable. The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Michael (the murderer) is exactly the same throughout the movie, thus alerting the viewer to the likely events to follow.<br/><br/>For the horror/thriller enthusiast, there is a severe lack of blood/gore compared to modern day films although I am not akin to the amount that is displayed in this day and age. A happier medium could have been found.<br/><br/>From a half hour into the movie, not one scene is unexpected. The acting for a horror/thriller film is fairly typical of the era and thus lacks any punch for the modern day enthusiast.<br/><br/>A positive for the film is its lingering camera shots and dark lighting which creates a frightening atmosphere. A second positive would be the character of Michael's doctor, who provides clues to the probability of where the story may lead.<br/><br/>However, it is clear that the star, in Jamie-Lee Curtis, is in the infancy stages of her acting career and thus fails to provide a truly frightened central victim.<br/><br/>It is hard for me to rate this film as it was in its day, but from other horror/thriller films of indeed the 80s and to a lesser extent, the 90s, it falls far short of a truly great horror/thriller film.<br/><br/>I suggest you move on and find a classic from the 80s.

","HALLOWEEN (1978)  **** Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance, PJ Soles, Nancy Loomis, Nick Castle.   Director John Carpenter's low-budget masterpiece of terror put him on the map (and opened the scores of b**tard pales-by-comparison rip-offs and sequels) as well as made a `scream queen' icon out of Curtis in this genuinely scary horror flick about a deranged slasher/asylum escapee on the loose and back to the scene of his crime, his hometown, the fictitious Haddenfield, Ill., for another stab at it. Pleasance is memorable as the dogged killer's shrink Dr. Sam Loomis (a nice homage to Hitchcock's `Psycho', named after one of the film's characters), who knows `evil' when he sees it.    Curtis became a huge star as her Laurie Strode did what few genre characters did: think and fight back!  Spooky, spine-tingling musical theme written by Carpenter and Castle as Michael Myers aka `The Shape' mershed together provides the right menacing tones.

Hot on his trail is Dr. Sam Loomis (Pleasence), who is convinced that Myers is evil personified and must be stopped at all costs.<br/><br/>Only stopping to pick up a creepy looking mask and some knives, Myers proceeds to slaughter a group of teenagers, eventually targeting the virginal Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) who is spending her Halloween night babysitting for some neighbours.<br/><br/>After taking time to introduce viewers to characters that they can actually care about, Carpenter expertly builds the tension, carefully using light and shadow to maximum effect, until the brilliantly tense climax which sees Laurie discovering her dead friends, and then battling against the seemingly indestructible Myers.<br/><br/>Myers - incredibly creepy in his white mask (actually a modified William Shatner mask) - is made even more menacing through his calm, emotionless approach to killing; at no point does he rush after his victims, preferring to take his time, as if content in the knowledge that they can never actually escape him, no matter how hard they try.<br/><br/>The end of the film sees Loomis shooting Myers, who falls off a balcony onto a lawn; however, when Loomis looks for Myers, the body has gone.<br/><br/>Surprisingly bloodless (but still shocking), brilliantly directed, and impossible to forget, Halloween is an absolutely unmissable horror classic."

"jones-markjones-mark592","4","2","5","14 July 2018"," Halloween - A Gem of its Time
","Released in 1978, pretty much everyone has heard of Halloween and its star, Michael Myers. That blank, white mask has been a staple in horror for years and this film is also viewed as the first of the slasher genre. <br/><br/>Now, I had never seen this film or any Halloween film. But after hearing so much about the franchise and being deeply impressed with the trailer for the latest instalment, I've decided to watch the entire franchise and review each one to see if they hold up today. Therefore, does the original Halloween hold up? <br/><br/>Not really. <br/><br/>I know many people will hate my opinion but the scares, acting and even writing do not measure up to film-making today. The film opens with a chilling opening (that seems very similar to Friday the 13th) to introduce Michael Myers. However, this is hardly ever elaborated on and we spend the entire film not knowing why Myers kills. This is probably explained in sequels, but I'm not reviewing those. The worse thing is we never get an explanation as to why he is going after Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and these supernatural powers he seems to have such as immortality and teleportation. As a result, it's quite difficult to be afraid of Myers when he's shrouded in confusion and it even becomes slightly comedic when he is killed and comes back to life again - think the original Child's Play, only not as exciting because we're meant to take it seriously. <br/><br/>The acting all across the board is lacking. Curtis shows potential but she's far too inconsistent. The kids are very annoying, but nobody is more annoying that Laurie's friend whose line delivery somehow never lands. Plus, she gets stuck in a window for some stupid reason which doesn't exactly instill fear into me. The only person from Myers' past is his psychiatrist, yet he is completely wasted. He claims to know a lot about Myers yet the writer just has him wait at his house and wander about aimlessly for the entire film only to burst in at the end and end it all abruptly. Maybe if so much time wasn't spent watching Curtis walk down a street or babysitting, I would be more excited with the action. But instead, one of the best themes in all of cinema is constantly shoved down your ears until you can't bear to listen to it anymore. Seriously, the two same themes play over and over again and it drives you insane!<br/><br/>In short, there's really no reason to go back to it watch the original Halloween. It may be a gem of its time, but today, it irritates, it bores and it disappoints."
"Leofwine_draca","10","2","5","27 July 2016"," Influential masterwork - one of the best low budget horror films ever made
","I'm not sure how much there is to say about this undisputed horror classic that hasn't been said already but here goes: John Carpenter's influential slasher movie is a superb example of low-budget film making. Despite being made on the cheap, with home-made synthesiser music from Carpenter and a lead of relative unknowns, HALLOWEEN still stands firm today as the pinnacle of the slasher genre. Many films have since tried to imitate the look and feel of this movie but all have failed, lacking skills in expertise film-making and instead preferring to show torrents of blood and gristle in an attempt to shock/disgust the audience instead of really frightening them.<br/><br/>The film's opening, with the P.O.V. shots from a killer as he goes about the murder of his own sister, may recall similar moments in BLACK Christmas but they are used far more effectively and copiously throughout the film, really putting us into the evil mind of the killer as he stares impassively at the people he is about to kill. The film is light on plot, with all of the events taking place within 20 hours; Myers escapes from the hospital, is pursued to Haddonfield by Dr Loomis, and begins to murder a bunch of teenagers. That's all there is to it. So simple, yet so effective, the film's casual simplicity is what draws you into the movie: the first half an hour is deceptively slow, introducing all the lead characters and inserting lots of little foreboding shocks and scares like the ace scenes where Laurie notices Myers watching her from behind a hedge or clothesline.<br/><br/>From then on, there are a protracted number of stalk and slash sequences, all played out slowly with lots of build-up and a sudden resolution as the victim is killed (apart from the finale, which turns into a game of cat and mouse between Laurie and Myers). Carpenter's camera-work is wonderful and unsettling, remaining totally unpredictable throughout, and his tinkly music score has been much imitated as well but never equalled. The main theme tune is an instantly recognisable and hauntingly atmospheric score that beats any rival tunes from the main studio guys.<br/><br/>The cast all do their darndest to make the film work, and succeed. Jamie Lee Curtis stands out as tough but human heroine Laurie, forced to face the evil head on and do her best to fight it, and found herself typecast for the next four years as a result of her efforts. Nancy Loomis and P. J. Soles are also good and realistic as everyday teenagers who unexpectedly meet their maker on that fatal Halloween night. The only really familiar face in the cast is Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis, Myers' obsessed psychiatrist who has come to believe that his patient is pure evil and cannot be stopped or cured. Incredibly the role was originally written for Christopher Lee! However, Pleasence, always an undervalued horror actor I believe, is excellent as Loomis, going way over the top (""his eyes... the devil's eyes!"") - he may be nuttier than the killer he's after! Seriously, Loomis plays a pivotal role and created such a memorable character that he too was forced to return in sequel after sequel with Michael.<br/><br/>The key secret to Carpenter's success is that he doesn't use gore as a method to scare the audience, realising that bloody prosthetics don't create real terror; instead, he relies on old fashioned jump-cuts, sudden bursts of music and shocking surprises, like characters stepping out of the darkness on to the screen unexpectedly. With at least twenty such scenes occurring within the film, this really is a frightening one to watch and not recommended for those with a nervous disposition (I remember watching it one night alone in the house as a kid... couldn't sleep that night... too busy looking and listening out for Myers). The finale is the best part of the film, with growing horror as Laurie realises that Myers may be an indestructible foe after all as he repeatedly rises from the seemingly dead to attack her one more time.<br/><br/>Although by now, many of the scares and methods that Carpenter uses have been diluted by the sequels that followed and the legions of imitators, HALLOWEEN still packs a punch and is miles ahead of any modern-day competition, such as SCREAM, which becomes over-complicated and too slick, self-referential and self-indulgent for its own good. What we have here is a simple tale of good vs evil, a classic horror story of the boogeyman coming home to kill, and one of the best horrors ever made!"

'Halloween' is a masterpiece on so many levels, it's a shame the current generation doesn't appreciate those who grew up before, during or slightly after its 1978 release. Obviously, they're used to ghosts with a 'Grudge,' 'Saw' or other torture-porn features, never realizing that despite 'Halloween' not being the first 'psycho-killer' film, it was certainly the most influential. This is proved with the countless imitators in the years that followed, including its own part 'II' and 'Friday the 13th,' which, no secret, literally stated they wanted to make ""another 'Halloween' movie."" 'Halloween' is suspenseful, original, scary and had an excellent theme (thanks, John.) Even with its incredible low budget, there was heart here, characters with real depth and one of my favorite aspects: simplicity. The movie relied on mood vs. gore, violence, nudity and a typical too-long background to explain why the killer Michael Myers is the way he is. You simply accepted he had the ""Devil's Eyes"" and went with his passion, stalking and drive. Curtis, ""Scream Queen"" #2 (loved the fact she inherited that from her mother) was someone you cared about, wanted to live – something sorely lacking in the movies that copied this movie's success. Halloween 1963: young Michael kills his sister for literally no apparent reason and gets locked up for 15 years, only to return and kill/stalk again. If you get a chance, you must simply watch the TV-version of this classic – it gives more depth to the young boy, Pleasence's (in a career defining/masterful role) plight to keep him locked up for good and Curtis's reasons for being scared. If only real film makers today could come close to capturing what 'Halloween' meant for Hollywood and for movie-goers. This should be taught in film schools. Totally."

And yes, it IS the most simple and predictable story ever written. But so what. It works a whole lot better than many other ""intelligent"" horror films so what the heck if it's a goofy story. A very disturbed child kills his sister at the age of six and is locked away under strong supervision since then. 15 years later, he escapes and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield. He sets his mind to a local babysitter and he starts to terrorize her and her friends. That's it. But it works on so many levels. If you don't like this film, fine. But at least you've got to admit the status this movie reached is very respectable. It was the inspiration to endless ( and inferior ) sequels, ripoffs etc. In fact the whole sub genre of slashers is based on this one film ! I'm sure it wasn't the first slasher film ever made, but it certainly was the most influential of them all. Now, 25 years later they're still making sequels to the original. I believe they've reached episode number 9 by now. None of them lives up to the original, of course, but Michael Myers has a lot of fans all over the world and because of that...he will never die !<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you want 90 minutes of pure suspense : you can't ever go wrong with watching Halloween. With the right atmosphere ( lights out, the TV loud ) I assure you, you'll be scared as hell. Not only thriller fans enjoy this film. It also has a lot of extra values attached to it. For example when the credits say "" introducing Jamie Lee Curtis "" This film made her famous and now, 25 years later, she still stars in the sequels. Although, I don't really think she's the star of the series, actually. Michael Myers is in the first place of course. The actor who plays him doesn't have to say a word, but still he is always present. And secondly...Donald Pleasance. This great actor died in 1995, but he'll always live on through the countless amount of memorable roles he played. One of them is his character in Halloween. Dr. Sam Loomis...he'll play this role 4 more times. He appeared for the last time in Halloween 6: The curse of Michael Myers."

","Fifteen years after killing his older sister, Michael Myers escapes from the asylum to wreak havoc on the town of Haddonfield, Illinois. At the same time, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) uses her time to babysit two youngsters and Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) begins to hunt the madman. When the three collide, the you-know-what hits the fan.<br/><br/>What do you say about a film that has been analyzed for over 25 years, praised by almost everyone and copied by some of the biggest people in the horror industry (although it is hard to be bigger than John Carpenter, really). Everything has been said, but I will try to say it again in my own words.<br/><br/>This movie does everything right for the budget it was given and the time period it was filmed in. Mixing innovative new ideas with several homages to Alfred Hitchcock (not least of which is casting Jamie Lee Curtis, the daughter of ""Psycho""'s Janet Leigh). We have scenes that are much too dark to see what is going on, but set a very good mood. We have first-person perspective from the killer or from over the shoulder of the killer (an often imitated technique). But best of all, I liked how the film constantly built suspense without ever letting the viewer relax (you never knew when the killer would strike).<br/><br/>A criticism could be that there is absolutely no gore in this film at all... maybe only a spoonful of blood. But somehow Carpenter does what others have failed to do and made the deaths such an inconsequential part of the killer genre. Unlike Freddy or Jason, who hack their victims in half, Michael can kill off-screen and still be menacing.<br/><br/>I was a bit curious how scary a killer could be when he stalks his prey in a station wagon, because nothing says terror less than the soccer mom vehicle of choice. But it worked. Carpenter employed many distant angles, as if we were watching the prey from a distance, tracking them, closing in for a kill.<br/><br/>I could complain that the women of this film were not attractive at all (especially the hermaphrodite Jamie Lee Curtis), but somehow it did not seem to matter. PJ Soles, who played Lynda, totally kept my interest as a victim. And I mean totally. The other girl, Annie, I could have done without. Writer and producer Debra Hill was allegedly ""unusually thin-skinned and defensive about the film's sexual side.""<br/><br/>As much as I would like to give the best actor award to Nick Castle (who played Michael Myers and later became the director of the crappy ""Major Payne"" movie), no one would deny it to Donald Pleasance. Already a veteran actor, Pleasance is now pretty much known best as his role as Dr. Sam Loomis.<br/><br/>After seeing the film a handful of times, I still notice new things. I think that is a testament to some of the subtleties of the film. That, or the theater version has scenes that were not on the home video, because I watched it on the big screen and heard lines I never recall hearing before...<br/><br/>If you enjoy modern horror films, give this one a shot and see why it remains ""the most profitable independent film ever made."" Before Freddy and Jason, there was Michael Myers... and not the crappy Michael Myers from ""Halloween: H20"" or ""Halloween: Resurrection"", but a real ruthless killer from the 1970s. (Also, ""Halloween 2"" is alright, just do not bother wasting your time on the third part unless you want your brain scrambled.)"
"kurtishill","2","3","11","8 October 2018"," Just terrible
","My first ever movie review... purely because of how terrible this film is, I would describe it to something like tommy wiseau's the room with pointless plot devices and about 45 mins of useless material. Some may argue that the director was building tension but I would argue that he was making the audiences bored, me and my girlfriend wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a comedy but after 45 mins of nothing but a guy skulking round town in a mask we assumed otherwise. I'm not sure if the exciting is where it all fell to bits for example a good long time after michael Myers was established as being in the town and after driving round and stalking his prey the two main characters drive past a store that had been robbed that we are led to presume was by Michael... how is this possible the alarms are still going off in the store and only stop at the end of the policeman conversation which lead you to belive that this robbery has only just been committed but Michael has been walking around a good chunk of the film where these 'stolen goods' such as his Halloween mask. There are so many other instances of this issues not to mention the doctor stood next to his own car for what we are lead to belive a good few hours and then only just realises... that wouldn't be too bad but it has a very distinct sticker o the door panel... what was 1978 thinking. Poorly written and poorly directed"
"Silverzero","4","3","11","9 March 2003"," Artificial and overly cliched. So dated it's unintentionally funny.
","""Halloween"" is not a classic. I don't know how anyone can say that it is. Yes, it did begin the genre of Horror in the 80's but that doesn't mean that this is any good. The film is now 25 years old and it shows. The murder scenes which take place look fake and as I said, it is sometimes unintentionally funny. <br/><br/>Michael Myers, the Charlie Chaplin of serial killers, is just ridiculous and fails in striking fear in the viewer. The style in which he kills his victims is so unconvincing you could nearly laugh at it.<br/><br/>
Overall, ""Halloween"" tries to hard to be an intelligent horror movie and fails miserably in its attempts. The acting is terrible, the dialogue is subtle and boring and the murder scenes are just funny. 4.7/10."

","Halloween (1978) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>It's hard to believe its been thirty-years since this thing popped onto screens and it's even harder to believe all the countless imitators that have followed. It's hard to do so now but if you clear the needless remake out of your mind and the various plot twists that would follow in all the sequels, this film remains incredibly true to form and hasn't lost one bit of its power. The story is pretty simple as Michael Myers returns to his hometown fifteen years after killing his sister and begins to stalk three babysitters. Such a simple plot line yet this film is the perfect example of not needing money to make some terrific and in the end this film remains one of the greatest horror films ever made. I've always loved the bit from Roger Ebert's review where he quotes Hitchcock as saying he loves to play an audience like playing a piano. That's pretty much what Carpenter does here as we haven't an idea why The Shape is stalking these girls or even what he is exactly. This entire mysterious form would be lost due to various elements of sequels but, again, it's best to put those elements out of your mind if you can. Carpenter's mastery behind the camera can be seen early on with the brilliant opening sequence that takes us from outside the house, to the murder upstairs and then back outside. This is a now classic sequence and it still holds up well today. The middle sequence of the film is perfectly written for us to get to know the characters but I love how Carpenter also uses it to build up the atmosphere of it being Halloween. The various pumpkins, the horror movies on television and even something as simple as the leaves falling perfectly puts us in the mood for everything that's going to follow. Then there's the final fifteen-minutes, which are just downright brilliantly executed and I'd say some of the best moments the genre has to offer. There's enough suspense in this sequence for two films but the same Carpenter builds everything up when The Shape is walking across the street with Jamie Lee Curtis' character pounding on the door is remarkably done. The performances by the entire cast are top-notch as everyone from Curtis to Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles fit their roles wonderfully well. Then there's Donald Pleasence turning in a now legendary performance in the role that he will always be remembered for (which is saying a lot when you look at how many wonderful films he was in). I love the way you can read his eyes to feel everything that he's feeling and the way he delivers the lines are top-notch. Then we have the terrific music score by Carpenter, which is scary enough on its own without anything we then see in the movie. Thirty-years later many, many films have come along with the same formula but nothing has ever come close to capturing the power of this film."

","A young Michael kills his sister. Now, fifteen years later, he's escaped from a mental hospital... and he's coming home.<br/><br/>This film undoubtedly kick-started the ""slasher"" trend as we know it to be today. It was relatively low budget and proved to be rather successful with minimal advertising.<br/><br/>This is a slow-burn horror movie. It doesn't rely heavily on the number of people killed, nor are you watching the movie to root for the bad guy. This, quite simply, is what horror should be. There's been no demystification of the villain, so you're not rooting for the character, and there's a degree of fear when contemplating the character.<br/><br/>This film - perhaps as a result of desensitization, which is always an issue with horror movies - doesn't pack the punch it may once have offered, but it's not hard to see what made this movie so effective and scary back in the day. The low budget filmmaking made it a more frightening experience and, perhaps, continues to this day with the imperfections in the digital transfer from 35mm film.<br/><br/>It's a certified horror classic and, despite its flaws, is well worth its place in horror history."

"powersd-48281","10","1","2","30 November 2019"," One of my favorites
","Halloween is one of the greatest movies ever made. Not just in horror, but in general. I'd say this is maybe my second biggest reason for why the 1970s is my favorite decade in film. The best part of this movie is clearly Michael Myers. Without any doubt he could annihilate any of his contemporaries, whether Jason Vorhees or Freddy Kreuger. You name it, he'll take em down. Unfortunately, he's now just another slasher movie villain. But I find his character to be perplexing. He's a fascinating specimen that stands out from the rest. The movie did a great job of creating those Halloween vibes in spite of the fact this was filmed in spring. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance are the only good actors in this movie. Just joking. There's also Charles Cyphers. Everyone else did a ridiculous job, and the dialogue is at times kind of dumb. But the acting and dialogue is sufficient to make the characters believable and, to some extent, relatable. The kills are pretty great despite the lack of blood. That's partially why this movie is so great. Minimalism. It's creepy, atmospheric. The music really drives that mood. I quite enjoyed this movie. It has its occasional flaw, but what movie doesn't? It;s too bad that they had to go out and make a franchise of it. The second one is pretty aight, the third is good on its own; the fourth was decent, but should never have been made; the fifth blew chunks; the sixth is the worst of them all, and yet they had the audacity to claim it the scariest of the entire series; H20 is alright; Resurrection isn't as bad as people say, but it still sucks; Rob Zombie's first movie is kind of lame; and his sequel is purely and simply awful. As for the recent sequel, it's pretty good. Other than the first sequel and the thrid film, it's the only one in the series that should ever have been made. Well, that's debatable. This movie's good anyway. 9.6/10. Rounds up to 10. Good movie. Check it out. Merry Christmas, and Happy Halloween. This review was posted two days after Thanksgiving."

","Halloween has since spawned a plethora of inferior imitators, but John Carpenter's original classic slasher simply cannot be beaten. A masterclass of suspense building, chilling imagery, and iconic music produced by the legend himself, Halloween shows what can be accomplished with a meagre budget when the right person is in full command of his craft.<br/><br/>The premise is so widely known its pretty much etched into the minds of anyone with a taste for films... Michael Myers escapes from a mental institution and returns to his hometown to torment and kill his sister, randomly killing anyone in his way. A figure of pure evil, Michael Myers is one of cinema's strongest villains: a voiceless, masked spectre who moves and kills with chillingly inhuman skill. One minute you see him, next he's gone, like a whisper in the wind, though a breeze that leaves a path of bloody carnage.<br/><br/>From the impressive opening sequence featuring an outstanding long take, to the creepy instances of glimpsing Michael poking out in the background, and then on to the bone-chilling climax as he wreaks havoc with vicious intensity, Halloween rides on its drawn out dread build-ups, ignores jump scares, and never forgets the audience its destined to frighten. It's a simple script, but its the imagery that Carpenter creates that linger long after the credits fade.<br/><br/>Strong performances from a young Jamie Lee Curtis and the ever-watchable Donald Pleasance ensure that while Michael stalks his prey there is still enough human emotion to ground the depravity, in what is one of the greatest horror films of all time.<br/><br/>9/10"

The music also created by the filmmakers, John Carpenter and Debra Hill, increases the fear factor and tension as remarkably as Bernard Hermann's score for ""Psycho"" had.<br/><br/>While a few other 60s and 70s, horror and suspense films are more original than ""Halloween,"" none synthesized or perfected those elements as masterfully as ""Halloween"" has. The girls are real, rounded out characters, who are smart and funny. It hurts to see them in peril. In a way this film is an antifemist film with a pro-feminist bias.<br/><br/>If you have not seen it, you are missing out on something uniquely scary and foreboding.

Michael Myers proves to be the scariest and most formidable villain of the genre, and arguably the best movie villain of them all. He has no reason, is highly intelligent and resourceful, you can't kill him, and he seems to have a sense of !@#&ed up humour. Example: he wears a ghost sheet with a pair of glasses to disguise himself, then murders a woman immediately thereafter. I can't focus all of my attention on my admiration for character.

","Horror movies hardly scare me. There may be a couple of scary scenes, like in The Exorcist, but that does not keep me in fear. And movies like Texas Chainsaw Massacre only happen because logic isn't used. And finally, others are predictable and therefore lack fear.<br/><br/>That's why Halloween is the best horror film I have ever seen. The movie begins with a horrifying open from a boy's point of view. His older sister and a boy are kissing and hanging out. The boy then stabs his sister to death. After running outside, his parents stop him and pull his mask off, revealing his terrified face. We see that he is about 6 years old.<br/><br/>The movie fast forwards to 15 years, without Micheal-he's been institutionalized for his murder. But he returns to his hometown-to terrorize a babysitter(Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role) who watches a little boy Halloween night.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert gave this movie 4 stars(his highest rating) and called it the 7th best movie of the year. In his review, he starts with these words:<br/><br/>""I enjoy playing the audience like a piano.""
<ul><li>Alfred Hitchcock</li></ul><br/><br/>So does John Carpenter. ""<br/><br/>I highly agree with this statement. John Carpenter not only directed the movie, but he composed the eerie score that repeats consistently throughout. The classic music first starts when Micheal Myers kills his sister. It's heard over and over to fill up the time when the characters do not speak, but nothing fearsome really happens.<br/><br/>After sometime, the music is still played, but less often. And it's when the music fades that the actual terror happens. Carpenter induces the fear, and when our fear withdrawals and we no longer expect disaster, such disaster strikes.<br/><br/>I was terrified throughout, never knowing what was going to happen. The only time I truly felt calm was when the commercials aired(I saw it on 10/31/18 from 11am-1pm on AMC.).When the movie was on, there was never a moment that I did not feel an ounce of fear.<br/><br/>During a commercial break, I told my Grandma that even as it was scaring me, I was excited that it was actually working on me. It still excites me now, almost 6 hours later.<br/><br/>This truly is my favorite horror movie now, along with Salo or the 120 Days of Sodom. It's frightening, barely predictable, and hits the notes I feel most horror movies miss, even if I love them. Halloween is all treat and no tricks!"

There are a mere five kills, modest by today's standards, and very little gore.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", which he co-wrote, co-produced, directed, musically scored (legendarily so), and co-edited, is a tight thriller built on the back of a Canadian thriller from four years prior called ""Black Christmas"", and it's the starting gun for the slasher genre.<br/><br/>You can't get from ""Psycho"" to ""Friday the 13th"" without passing through ""Halloween"".<br/><br/>It's the afore mentioned economy of narrative that maximizes its tone and amplifies its horror. The movie is incredibly suspenseful.<br/><br/>I mentioned how influential ""Black Christmas"" was on this film, and ""Christmas"" is a great movie, but even there, the increased scope and scale of ""Black Christmas"" demands more drama, it mutes the scares by not being singularly focused on them. Not so ""Halloween"". ""Halloween"" is a pure, perpetual suspense machine.<br/><br/>It has its flaws, of course. Some of the acting is rough (though never from Jamie Lee Curtis) and a lot of the dialog rings false. You'll probably feel the need to yell at the protagonist when she, TWICE, throws a knife away from her in disgust without making sure her attempted murderer is dead. You might find Donald Pleasance a bit of a scene muncher.<br/><br/>But for a budget of about $300,000 John Carpenter changed genre cinema forever, and the genius of what he achieved here has never been matched, certainly not in a film that bears the name ""Halloween""."

"classicalsteve","10","1","2","3 November 2017"," Halloween 35 Anniv Blu-ray A Superb Facelift of a Horror Classic
","Overall, the slasher film genre is pretty pathetic, most films so insipid as being worthy of the proverbial trash can. Save one. The original ""Halloween"", which brought intelligence to the slasher film, is still the best of its sub-genre, or one of two, the other being the original ""Psycho"". Sadly, its sequels, and other films it spawned, such as the Friday the 13th series and other films associated with holidays like ""Silent Night, Deadly Night"" don't just scrape the bottom of the barrel, but aren't worthy to be in the same company as barrels. Other films, aside, ""Halloween"" is both scary but also has a somewhat literary context, as far as a slasher-horror film can muster. It was recently released in a 35th Anniversary edition on Blu-ray, and it looks and sounds better than ever.<br/><br/>First what the Blu-ray offers: the look is cleaner and more vivid while simultaneously retaining the subdued colors and hues of the original. During Halloween day, the sky is overcast which is a spooky prelude to the horrific events which will occur in the evening. Apparently, there had been released a previous Blu-ray version where the colors were brightened, ruining the spooky and even misty feel of the original film. After many complaints from fans, this 35th Anniversary edition essentially solves the problems of the former release. It retains the less saturated filters of the original while simultaneously appearing much cleaner and more vibrant than previous DVD and VHS releases.<br/><br/>What makes ""Halloween"" such an effective film of a genre replete with so many irredeemable examples unworthy of your time and expense is that there's more to the story than simply a mad guy in Halloween mask running around killing people. Yes, that is more or less the main plot. However, there is a subtext. An effective plot device which becomes the springboard of the story is that the baddie, Michael Myers, murdered his sister in a suburban home in Haddonfield, Illinois in the early 1960's which is the first sequence of the film. The story then jumps ahead to 1978. The night before Halloween, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) and a nurse are traveling on a rainy night to an insane asylum. The inmates are wandering around the grounds in the rain. They realize something has let them out, and suddenly their car is hijacked, the nurse nearly becoming the first victim of the baddie in 1978. It's most certainly Michael Myers, the ""Evil"".<br/><br/>Loomis suspects Myers plans to return to the town of his boyhood. Part of the story is Loomis following Myers' footsteps. Loomis travels to the suburban town Haddonfield, a good 150 miles away from the asylum. For a boy who has been locked up for 15 years, he seems to drive a car fairly well, which gives a somewhat supernatural aspect to the Myers character. Then we meet Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) who has to leave some keys at the abandoned Myers residence, which has become the local haunted house. A figure stares from inside the house when Laurie makes her deposit of the keys. For the next several hours, Laurie sees the strange figure of Myers off and on which is one of the most effective aspects of the film. In other words, there is great build-up before the horrific events actually transpire. Laurie and her teenage friends, Annie and Lynda, become the focus of Myers' wrath. Laurie and Annie babysit two children who are watching ""The Thing"" on television. The three young women, the two children, and one young man become unwilling characters of an horrific reenactment of the events of Halloween night 15 years earlier. Other subtle hints that there is more to the story than simply the slasher aspects, such as the reference to the mythological monster, the ""boogeyman"" and Laurie's vow to keep the children safe. Not to give anything away, one of the most disturbing and yet brilliant scenes is not when Myers is doing what he has come to do, but one of the characters discovering the nature of the reenactment. <br/><br/>No question, even the original ""Halloween"" is a terrifying example of fright-cinema. This film is not for all tastes, and if you would rather not be scared into submission, do NOT under any circumstance see this film. Simultaneously, if you desire to be scared and not necessarily ""grossed out"", ""Halloween"" is quite possibly the best slasher film of the genre next to ""Psycho"". And it's a real treat on Blu-ray. As a codetta, ""Halloween"" redefines the concept of ""Trick or Treat"". Are the other films and similar offerings in the genre worthy of being seen? In my humble opinion, only ""The Nightmare on Elm Street"" is worthy of viewing. The rest have no redeeming qualities at all, particularly ""Friday the 13th"" and its sequels, as well as the other Halloween films. I don't know how any other film can say more than the original ""Halloween"" without it becoming merely a cinematic blood-fest."

","Halloween is a great movie with a well developed plot and a great cast. It is a top notch horror that kept me at the edge of my seat from start to finish. It had an excellent use of music that perfectly builds up the tension and suspense, it never rushes the plot, allowing the audience to feel fear long before anything ever happens. <br/><br/>The only thing that really bothered me was that you knew when every death was coming from a mile away. There were no surprises, no characters who I thought would live ended up dying and no characters that I thought would die ended up surviving, it was all very expected. <br/><br/>The films two main stars, Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance, are excellent in their roles. Curtis takes on a very strong female lead and provides several traits to make her character unique. Meanwhile, Pleasance classes up the joint with his experienced acting, it really is a pleasure to watch this man perform and naturally slip in to every role. <br/><br/>It may have set the standards for today's horror films, but it is better than most of them, it maintains a structure throughout that works and remains thrilling, unlike most that get boring and predictable after awhile. Thrilling and suspenseful, Halloween is a very enjoyable film that I would certainly recommend to all fans of horror. <br/><br/>After escaping from an asylum, maniac Michael Myers haunts the streets he use to live on during Halloween night. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Donald Pleasance / Worst Performance: Brian Andrews"
"keithbrown-90195","9","1","2","8 September 2016"," Classically Terrifying
","It's kind of a shame that this movie is grouped with all the other slasher movies that were inspired and popularized by its success. I would hardly even call this a slasher, considering the tonal and formal dissimilarities between it and all the others. You know, kind of like how Nirvana are constantly grouped as a grunge band because they rose to prominence around the same time in the same place, when in actuality they don't really sound anything like those other bands. Maybe it works in the film's favor through comparison, but I still don't like it.<br/><br/>The movie is terrifying not because we know Michael Myers is a hulking, killing machine; it's terrifying through suggestion, by using shadows, static cameras, unexplained motives, and that creeping piano score. It's terrifying because we see the peaceful suburban neighborhood during the day where later in the night we witness these events unfold. It's terrifying because we follow these regular high school girls as they're terrorized and mercilessly killed by this unknown figure.<br/><br/>The film doesn't glory in blood and extravagant death scenes. It treats the deaths seriously, like huge moments that we shouldn't be excited for, but rather dread. It treats the audience like empathetic viewers rather than eager and bloodthirsty voyeurs.<br/><br/>There are those moments that have become cliché by way of theft from lesser talents: the suggestion that sex and drinking and general shenanigans leads to death, but done without the self-aware winking. This results in a film that feels familiar, but not dated. The whole film operates this way, and if you give yourself over to the concept without the baggage the genre has reaped, it's just as terrifying as it was when it was first released."

","John Carpenter's masterpiece holds up the test of time. With no CGI or practical effects, this movie manages to create a sense of suspense and dread that makes for one of the scariest movies of all time. As each scene reveals more and more of Michael Myers disfigured mask, the dread for what is coming increases tremendously and becomes more and more gripping. The opening first-person sequence is very impressive and places the viewers in the place of a psycho. I was incredibly impressed on the first viewing and cannot wait to watch again. This movie's scares are by no means cheap and they will continue to be scarier and scarier with each watch."
"The-Social-Introvert","8","1","2","25 August 2015"," Quickie Review: Halloween
","Before the endless sequels being crapped out for a quick buck and we were confused by muddled plots involving supernatural incest and satanic cults there was the original, simple Halloween. What John Carpenter and Debra Hill produced in 1978 went down in cinematic history, and rightly so. Right from the title credits with Carpenter's iconic, simplistic chilling theme (which is associated so closely with the film that it was subsequently used in every Halloween sequel and remake) to the shocking genre-switching ending, few films grip you with the amount of suspense Halloween does. Almost every slasher cliché can be traced to this film, and yet it feels fresh as ever if watched today. The character Dr Samuel Loomis is a staple of the horror genre. Before he hobbled around Haddonfield screeching at 10 year olds, Donald Pleasence played the good old Dr with a cool charm. His composure, often broken in rare fits of rage, reinforces the seriousness of the situation to the people of Illinois – that death has come to their little town. Yes, you cannot talk about Halloween without paying homage to the personification of death himself, Michael Myers. The simplicity of Myers is what makes him the best of the slasher villains. Simple clothes, a simple weapon, a simple mask. And yet he is incredibly enigmatic and without motive (until the sequel came along). He's just a pure killing entity. Every scene with him is expertly fashioned to make him as creepy as possible, and we never truly get a proper close up view of him. Even when 'the shape' isn't on screen his presence can be constantly felt.<br/><br/>John Carpenter expertly (and on a budget of a measly $300,000) crafted a horror movie that should be studied and dissected by modern directors of the genre. He uses lighting and subtle details to provoke scares. In some scenes, knowing what is about to happen is often what provides the thrills, as opposed to what we actually see. A combination of dark lighting, a lesson in steady cam shots, and the eerie tone of the music give Halloween a spine-chilling and claustrophobic tone. The low- budget cameras used gave the film a grainy look, which adds to the creepiness of scenes. Halloween is truly a perfect horror film. There is nothing that merits a change and as such this comes highly recommended to horror fans.<br/><br/>Best Scene: The killer ending is still implanted in my memory. After having six gun shots fired into his chest and falling off a balcony, we breathe a sigh of relief with Dr Loomis as Michael is shown sprawled on the front porch, still and unmoving. Loomis takes a minute, looks down andhe's gone. Cue the classic theme. We then cut to a number of different shots of Haddonfield ending with the spooky Myers house, accompanied by Michael's signature hoarse breathing. Brilliant. What makes this scene extra special is Dr Loomis' reaction when Michael goes missing – He lifts his head, and Pleasance's eyes themselves tell us that Loomis, deep down, knew the six shots wouldn't have killed the escaped mental patient. Which begs the question, just what is Michael Myers?"
"gweez-37769","10","1","2","13 August 2015"," The one that gave birth to the slasher films
","I love this film it gave birth to my favorite horror genre the slasher films. What John Carpenter and Debra Hill did with a next to nothing budget says what great film makers that they are. The beginning is creepy as homemade sin with Michael Myers stabbing his sister to death and the brilliant camera work that made you feel that you were witnessing it happening is just remarkable and scary. Creating the shape was masterful in that Michael Myers was a force to be reckon with not a human being that you could take down easily. Always around getting ready to strike at any instant was bone chilling frightening. I love the scene when the boy looks out the window and sees him standing across the yard that is one of the most creepiest scenes that you'll ever see. Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis was brilliant in this film. Donald Pleasence had some funny lines in the movie. Like where the head of the mental facility was telling Donald that Michael Myers can't drive. Dr. Loomis says to him he was doing very well last night somebody around here must have gave him lessons. The other one is when he's at the Michael Myers residence and three kids stop at the house and dares one of the kids to go up to the front door and when he does Dr. Loomis shouts out from the bushes get your tush away from there was funny as hell. He made you feel safe because he was on the case ready to reel in Michael Myers also I thought he added a creepiness to the film by his expressions in different scenes he did a masterful job especially when he's describing Michael Myers to Sheriff Brackett was pretty creepy. Jamie Lee Curtis gave an outstanding performance as Lori by being the first strong heroine to take on the force of evil and surviving. She was the typical girl next door and was able to overcome the evil atrocities that Michael Myers laid out for her.The score was masterful everybody knows that theme by heart and it creeps everybody out. This is such a classic horror film that it still holds up after thirty years is remarkable. One of my all time favorites."
"Diddisnap","10","1","2","13 June 2015"," A Classic
","I wish they didn't try to remake this one. Why bother ? It just can't be done. I think the two best things about this movie - the music and Jamie Lee Curtis. Without those two, it just wouldn't have been the same. I have the theme music, which I play every Halloween through a front open window of my house to add to the creep factor - that and the theme from Exorcist. The best movies don't need special effects to make it awesome. It was just well done. Halloween will always be one of my favorite horror movies of all time and in my opinion, Jaime Lee Curtis' best performance (and Trading Places). If you haven't seen Halloween yet (which would be hard for me to fathom since I grew up on it, watching it every Halloween), then I suggest waiting until Halloween. It usually comes out every year."

","HALLOWEEN is the first film in the HALLOWEEN franchise and I will reviews the sequels, with the exception of Halloween III: Season of the Witch. The plot is set in the fictional Midwestern town of Haddonfield, Illinois. On Halloween night in 1963, a six-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister by stabbing with a kitchen knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes from a psychiatric hospital, returns home, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode and her friends. Michael psychiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis suspects Michael's intentions, and follows him to Haddonfield to try to prevent him from killing.<br/><br/>The story is just amazing and John Carpenter & Debra Hill wrote a very good story and they really did a very good job bringing it on screen and this film shows that it's about building up suspense and characters and story , not about the violence and gore, which was something that the other films lacked.<br/><br/>The acting is okay. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Laurie Strode and she is amazing in that role. Donald Pleasence plays Dr. Loomis and this was his breakout role and he was amazing in that part until the last one that he was in. Nick Castle plays Michael Myers and he is great. P.J. Soles as Lynda is really cool in her role and she was spectacular.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is just amazing. The music is just amazing and I love that Halloween theme song, because they have done different versions of the film and it was really cool. The kills in this movie are not as bloody and that's what I like about this film. My favorite kill that has been re-enacted a lot of times is Lynda's death and I saw the remake and it stays true to it's source material.<br/><br/>Overall, I love HALLOWEEN - the 1978 version, but there are some problems with this film and the 2007 remake fixed those problems. 8/10."
"squirrel_burst","10","1","2","12 April 2015"," The original, and still the best; my personal favorite horror film.
","""Halloween"" is a low budget horror staple that you shouldn't miss on your scary movie night. The story is simple but effective and offers some good thrills and scares. It boils down the premise of a horror film to it's primal essentials, making it relatable and genuinely frightening. You're alone in the house and there's a maniac out there trying to get you. It keeps coming without any sense or reason and no one can come to your aid. That's all there is to it on the surface, but the more you examine the movie, the more you can see that there's a lot going on here, it's deceptive in that way. The film's been constantly re-imagined and copied but what makes this one stand out from the rest is an excellent musical score, memorable characters, good suspense and enough vagueness to produce some good screams (after all, what you imagine in your head will always be scarier than what is shown on the screen so vagueness helps build atmosphere and frights). While there are a few moments that are odd and perhaps a bit dated, it's one of the original slasher/dead teenager films and one of the best too. If you're a fan of horror movies or if you want to introduce yourself to the genre this is a must. (Extended TV Cut on DVD, October 31, 2012)"

","When I get to read critics about current horror films, people usually mention something involving the classic ""Halloween"". For this reason, this movie has always caught my interest, and last week I finally watched it. One thing that remarked me was the anticonventional directing; John Carpenter proves to have an unique way of filmmaking, and that really impressed me, along with the visible care he has taken while doing it. The plot varies from being slow to quick, so it feels hard to say if it takes long to become interesting; either way, I felt entertained for most of the time. By the way, whilst things were going on, I could easily notice how inspired, in this film, ""Scream"" was. Sometimes I thought it was just a ""Scream"" version without the press intervention. The soundtrack is very 70's and it feels nice to see a movie made in a decade when false scares weren't used in horror projects. That being said, in resume, I admit that ""Halloween"" is an indeed classic that deserves all the recognition it (still) has!"
"Gray_Balloon_Bob","10","1","2","3 November 2014"," Hearing those insidious chords in the cinema will stay with me forever. As will the film itself.
","Where do I begin? Well, there is absolutely no need to introduce the premise or detail the narrative in any way as I am sure this film, as influential and timeless as it is, has been thoroughly ingrained in the consciousness of every man woman and child, through one of the single biggest acts of horror-culture osmosis. Perhaps that's a little overblown, but if you haven't seen the film yet you have somehow trawled through unimaginable depths to read this review, then stop here, and watch the film with haste, you oblivious little thing. Like Freddy and Jason, Michael Myers is one of the eminent figures of horror, and like the other two, he sports iconic clothes and relies on simple acts to scare us witless. He stalks silently, determinedly, he lets his hulking frame stand seemingly indomitable in the sight of his soon-to-be-victims and the audience, yet he disappears and re-appears so ethereally that we are left terrified. Myers is a perfect composition of an intimidating human physicality and a menacing supernaturalism, chillingly demonstrated in the final moments of the film. <br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to see this in the cinema on Halloween night, as part of a one-off screening, and of course it was nothing short of marvellous. The film supposedly had some sort of 'digital restoration' but none of that modern-technological-intervening-crap harmed the film, or seemed to have any effect whatsoever. The grain was intact, and the film still had the generally warm and the rich pallet that is exclusive to shooting on film. That said, the film's look, especially in the outdoor scenes, is distinctly cold and greyish and that wasn't eliminated here, perfectly in keeping with the isolation and seclusion that Laurie and the audiences are subjected to. It looked stunning, sounded stunning, with an occasional vinyl-like crackle quality to it that made it all the more authentic. Seeing all the events unfold on the big screen is nothing short of spectacular; it completes the experience. There was a couple sitting in front of me that was giggling, but the dread of the film is so palpable that they were easily ignored. B*****ds.<br/><br/>The opening, in which we are forced into the POV of a young Michael Myers, is a master-class unease and discomfort. It is one long, brooding take, in which the malicious child slowly approaches his house and orchestrates his ritual with such calm; peering in windows and lurking in the shadows of staircases carrying us every step of the way. We are the unwilling participant. Even in the act of killing his sister we are not allowed to leave his eyes. I love how the stabbing is shown in this scene, which recalled the infamous shower moment in Psycho. We don't see any penetration, which would be completely unnecessary, but we hear the impact of the knife, and we see the brutally methodical motion of it as it swings back and forth. It's mechanical and has enough consequence to be horrifying but never graphic enough to be tasteless. None of this encourages identifying with the killer because we don't know anything about him, and the reveal that what we just witnessed was through the eyes of a 6 year old boy is brilliantly disgusting and confounding, because we are forced to acknowledge that the innocent exterior of the child evokes some humanity, yet completely disagrees with his previous actions. <br/><br/>There is a voyeurism that continues throughout the film in which we watch with Michael Myers the people he stalks. His body is never entirely in view, yet we are not completely disconnected from him and it all the more uncomfortable. There is a moment when the camera sits in the passenger seat alongside him, and we don't feel like an accomplice but a victim of kidnap; the brief glimpses of his haunting white mask and frenzied hair separate us even more. Later in the film, when Laurie is being attacked in the closet, we are thrust into the situation and the camera remains on the floor beside her. This involvement is brilliant because in a way we are fearing just as much as for Laurie as we are ourselves, and we can't help but think how we would react in that situation. Of course, we can't know how we would respond, and in the height of such fear and irrational actions are perfectly acceptable. Criticisms of Laurie's response are invalid because they fail to take into account vital elements such as the extreme weight of Laurie's fear, the fact of her injuries, that she had a responsibility not only to her own wellbeing but the children she was looking after, the fact that Michael Myers is a completely relentless unnatural being and that she is a fictional character and not us. The shot of Myers in the background in which he is lying down listlessly, hopefully dead, and then raises himself so mechanically upright is one of the most chilling and malevolent moments in cinema. <br/><br/>Of course, Donald Pleasance hasn't been mentioned, but his gravitas and the emotional weight he conveys goes without saying. He is given some of the (for lack of a better word) cheesiest lines in the film, but in context, and when uttered by him, they work without fail. They are haunting because Pleasance is haunted, and because he believes them, so do we. <br/><br/>The film plays beautifully with the power of suggestion, and what we don't see, or what we barely see. There is no indulgence in gore, or any violence. Atmosphere is the key to horror, and every element is perfectly constructed to heighten this; the soundtrack, layered and moody, the cinematography beautifully employing wide desolate spaces with oppressive confines, the acting, all of it conveying the necessary terror and confusion, the unforgettable figure of Michael Myers himself..<br/><br/>There is much more I would like to have written about, but this will have to suffice."
"russell-michael17","10","1","2","27 June 2014"," The best horror movie ever made!!!

I love most all slasher movies, but after a couple of times watching the same one, i don't want to see it anymore for a long time. This one,however,is unique. From Jamie Lee Curtis's powerful screams to a wonderful musical score, this movie has been imitated many times but never matched. A must-see for any horror fan. That said, if you are into movies that are filled with gore, nudity, and non-stop action from beginning to end, you will be sorely disappointed here. The emphasis is on atmosphere and suspense which builds over time, and not on over the top action and naked screaming women running around everywhere."

"caseynicholson","10","1","2","30 October 2013"," This is such a brilliant film...but worth seeing with its immediate sequel!
","I'm a lifelong Halloween fan who just left the theater after seeing this film for its 35th Anniversary release. <br/><br/>The thing that introduced me to the Halloween franchise was seeing ""Halloween II"" and ""Halloween III"" on the USA Network each Halloween as a kid. For at least two or three years I would watch Halloween II, which picks up where Halloween 1 leaves off (the two are really meant to go together--more on that later) before ever viewing the original, and so for years I was only getting the second half of the original Halloween story.<br/><br/>That having been said, when I finally was of age was able to rent the original Halloween, I remember feeling like it was an awfully slow movie. It wasn't as gory or as fast paced as some of the Freddy or Jason movies that came after it, and in fact one can make a good argument that its immediate successor, Halloween II, gives it a run for its money in the suspense and horror categories.<br/><br/>But now, as an adult, and being a bit more well rounded and also more well read, I absolutely positively label this film as a brilliant film, and a true classic in most every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Why is that so? Well, for starters, this movie came before ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", and before ""Friday the 13th"" (and, if you know anything about the Friday the 13th movies, you know that the Jason character wouldn't develop into a more Michael Myers-type of character until basically the third film in the franchise). In many senses, Halloween 1 is the original slasher movie. It spawned a whole generation of films. I say that as a movie buff more so than as a horror buff, and I'm sure that more prominent horror fans could and would point out Halloween's own influences. But regardless of that, when it comes to the 1980's slasher films that would follow, and when you consider that this film was released in 1978, it's clear that this movie had a lasting impact on a whole genre of films.<br/><br/>Another point to make that adds to one's appreciation for the film is that if you go and read up on it, you'll learn that this was essentially an independent film that was pitched to a studio and made on a shoestring budget. That shows when you watch the movie. There's no real tremendous special effects here--it was made long before the days of computer generated graphics, and aside from a bit of blood and some creative ways of displaying the deceased in the film, there's not a lot to be said for special effects.<br/><br/>What the film makes up for that with, though, is its cinematography. The camera angles, the use of shadows, and the use of sound (and theme music!) in this movie is just spectacular. It takes mundane elements of everyday life--or things that we all live with each and every NIGHT of our lives, for that matter--and turns the ordinary into the terrifying. That shadow in the corner? What could be there, hidden just beneath the darkness? That tree in the distance? Do you know what's on the other side of it? Those are the questions that Halloween will have you asking yourself for days after you watch the film.<br/><br/>Finally, I'll say this brief word about Halloween 1 and 2. I've not marked this review as a spoiler, and so I'll be careful not to give away much here, but it's worth knowing going into this film that Halloween 2 picks up where Halloween 1 leaves off, and not just in a generic sense that most sequels would, but in that the sequel is set on the same night as Halloween 1, meaning that if one imagines the first movie ending at 11 pm or midnight (no exact time is given in the film), then Halloween 2 is the story of what happens between that point and dawn the next day.<br/><br/>That having been said, I used to believe that Halloween 1 and 2 should be viewed together if at all possible, and I still think I'd make that case. Halloween 2 is an outstanding film, and too often it doesn't get the credit it deserves compared to the original, so I'd very much recommend seeing it as soon as possible after the first movie.<br/><br/>However, having just seen this film in the theater for the first time in my life, I think I left with a newfound appreciation for it as a standalone thriller. As I said earlier in my review here, I was introduced to the franchise by seeing the sequel first, and for several years I never even knew what happened in the first movie to lead up to the sequel. I think that it was because of that that for many years I'd always find myself feeling like Halloween 1 was an incomplete movie. In a sense, I still feel that way, as the sequel adds a fair amount of character and plot development. And so, as such, I continue to argue that the two belong together.<br/><br/>And yet, having now seen the film in a theater, this time around I could very much see how the first movie ends on a satisfying note. Indeed, the ending--particularly the last sixty seconds or so just before the credits roll--adds to the film's thrill factor. That's pretty much as much as I can say without spoiling things here. Suffice it to say that a first time viewer will find that the film is both brilliant in how it is self-contained, and yet at the same time my argument for why Halloween 1 & 2 belong together will be obvious to anyone who has ever seen both of the films."

","Horror is an iffy genre in the film world. It's a genre that isn't as highly credited like others like drama, and often times shrugged off from the film world as being ""B films."" But, every once in a while, there comes a horror film that shakes the very foundation of film and change the way we think of the art much like a great drama does. Horror is hard to pull off, but ""Halloween"" is one of those films that not only delivers genuine scares, but also does it artfully, and, in the meantime, has created quite possibly one of the most terrifying and notorious movie villains of all time, Micheal Myers. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" is about a mental patient named Michael Myers who brutally murders his sister on Halloween night. Since the incident, Micheal turned into a catatonic. Fifteen years later, Michael escapes, and is out to finish the job he started, and kill his younger sister Laurie (though you don't figure this out till the second film).<br/><br/>One of the things that makes ""Halloween"" such an excellent film is the simplicity. The plot is simple and straightforward, and is a very good, exciting story. Though the concept of a ""slasher"" was already done with films like ""Psycho,"" ""Black Christmas,"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" the plot still offered new ideas to the genre and expanded it to new levels, inspiring waves of horror films like ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""Maniac,"" or others like ""My Bloody Valentine.""<br/><br/>One thing I find interesting about ""Halloween,"" though not exactly rooted in fact or how the film was actually made, was that ""Halloween"" seems very much like a modern version of the ""Frankenstein"" story. A mental patient (Frankenstein's monster) escapes from a hospital (laboratory), and his doctor, Loomis (Dr. Frankenstein) sets out to find him to stop him. This is most likely no connection to how the filmmakers intended the film to be perceived, but it's an interesting way to look at it nonetheless. <br/><br/>This film is also the beginning of the career of Jamie Lee Curtis, who would become popularly known as the ""Scream Queen,"" ""Halloween"" giving her more jobs in more horror films.<br/><br/>John Carpenter did a great job in crafting an ideal horror film. He has set a standard that now all horror films wish to achieve. On the same level as horror films like ""The Exorcist,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Omen,"" and other greats, this film changed the way people thought how a horror film should be made.<br/><br/>This horror film is a must see for any film advocate. It is a piece of cinematic history and should be on everybody's ""to watch"" list not necessarily just for the entertainment, but for the educational experience attached to it, and learn about one of the great milestones in horror film history, and film history in general."

","This movie is a classic, hands down. I have watched this movie about 20 times since it first came out in the late 70's. Possibly the greatest theme in a horror movie ever.<br/><br/>When the camera is closing in on the pumpkin, as well as all of the creepy shots in this movie, just keeps you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>Friday the 13th is great, but does not hold a flame to Halloween. Myers is such a crazy killer.<br/><br/>Almost every Halloween we watch this with the family.

","The movie is simple. A young boy is screwed up somehow or born evil, and he kills his sister while she is topless! The parents come home to find little Michael Myers in the front yard wearing his Halloween costume, a clown, with a bloody kitchen knife in his hand. What a great opener for a movie. Many years in a mental institution he escapes just to go and kill more people back in his hometown. The weird thing is that he drives there in a hospital gown. Who taught this, now man, to drive and how to get to his home town, and they do not wear hospital gowns in mental institutions.<br/><br/>The adult Michael Myers slowly walks around the town not being noticed killing off all of Laurie Strode's friends and stalking her all in one day.

"jdkraus","10","1","2","12 February 2013"," The perspective of a serial killer...true terror
","The film opens with a hand-held, one shot sequence of a person's POV. This person lurks outside a house, watching as a teenage girl makes out with her boyfriend. The individual then runs around the house and enters through an opened back door. Casually, the person walks into the kitchen, retrieves both a butcher's knife and a mask of some sort. As the teenage girl's boyfriend leaves, the person climbs up the stairs, enters a bedroom, and viciously stabs the teenage girl to death. Walking now down the steps into the street, this person is revealed as no more than that of a 6-year old child. This whole opening is about 3 minutes long and it gives us both a perspective and insight to this character, who will be later known for seven films and a cult following. This is Mike Myers. Is he a deranged nutjob or just pure evil? John Carpenter leaves that for us to judge.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" works so well on many levels for a B-movie horror flick; the types of camera angles, the deep shadows and dimly lit night scenes, and ominous/suspenseful music. ""Halloween"" is not just another low-budget slasher film; it established both John Carpenter's and Jamie Lee Curtis's movie careers and it shows wannabe filmmakers what can be done successfully with few actors and little money. Many amateurs have tried and failed miserably at what Carpenter accomplished with this film, but this is only because Carpenter, the auteur that he is, knows how to make a great movie. <br/><br/>For 92 minutes, he gives us two strong lead characters, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Laurie (Curtis) that we enjoy and care for. He knows exactly what specific composition and lighting to use for each scene to set a mood. He knows when to pace the action (When will Myers kill his next victim? He's staring right at her!) He even knows when to cue the sound effects and music to heighten the suspense. The fact that he both directed and scored this film is nothing short of remarkable—the music fuels the film's emotions beyond believe. Who would have thought that a simple walk from home to school could be so eerie, or a murder be even more terrifying? <br/><br/>I have seen my fair share of B horror flicks and slashers. ""Halloween"" tops them all. For an R movie, it's quite tame in terms of blood and gore, but the fear that the man in the mask instills is more frightening than dismembered bodies or evisceration."
"piratecannon","10","1","2","27 December 2012"," The Night He Came Home
","It's that time of year again, when candy clatters around the inside of plastic pumpkins and horror movies descend on cable television like zombies assaulting an isolated farmhouse in the hopes of scoring some freshly scooped brains for dinner. In honor of the shifting season and my favorite month of the year, I've determined that there's no better way to honor All Hallow's Eve than by review each and every Halloween movie. There are 8 if you discount the Rob Zombie debacles—which I do— so, over the course of the next several weeks, reviews of each will follow in steady succession.<br/><br/>So, without further ado, let's dig into entry #1: Halloween.<br/><br/>If you're new to the Michael Myers universe, allow me to let you in on a little secret—this is the movie that started it all. Many credit the original Halloween as being the father of the modern slasher flick, but, as I've stated in previous reviews, it is my contention that said honor falls squarely in the lap of Hitchcock's Psycho. Nevertheless, Halloween helped usher in the contemporary horror film, which is defined by cheap scares, brutal violence, and, for lack of a better term, a ""robotic"" killer.<br/><br/>Here, the killer's name is Michael. At the beginning of the movie, director John Carpenter introduces us to our antagonist by smartly utilizing a first-person perspective. We don't know that the killer is only a boy until after we're allowed to see him murder his teenage sister (who's prone to fornication and late night hair brushing, something that we'll later learn is a staple of the modern horror flick) with an over-sized kitchen knife. Fast forward a decade or so. Michael has spent his time since committing his crime in a maximum security mental institution under the watchful eye of Dr. Sam Loomis, a brooding psychiatrist who believes to be the now full-grown adult to be the full embodiment of true evil. Late one night, Michael manages to escape his confines, secure an awesomely wood-paneled station wagon, and return to his hometown to finish what he started; specifically, to ""off"" Laurie Strode, his baby sister and the last surviving member of his family.<br/><br/>What follows is a slow burn that ultimately leads to Michael slaughtering a smattering of unruly teens up and down the street he once inhabited. More important than ""what"" happens, though, is ""how"" it happens. As previously indicated, everything about Halloween has come to define ""horror"" as we know it, and the mechanical pursuit of his sister—played by a young Jamie Lee Curtis—helped vault the actress into stardom. The final thirty minutes are especially nerve-racking, and everything that plays out is a little too realistic to be written off as sheer scary-movie-fancy. This, among a myriad of other elements, helps give Halloween the staying power that it's enjoyed for thirty-plus years.<br/><br/>If you consider yourself a student of horror and have never seen Halloween you're doing yourself a grave (hardy har har) disservice. In other words, go buy it. Immediately. And revel in one of the great slasher flicks of our time."

","""JOHN CARPENTER'S HALLOWEEN"" is a 1978 horror-thriller film directed by John Carpenter and written by Carpenter and Debra Hill. The story follows Michael Myers (Tony Moran), who killed his sister, Judith (Sandy Johnson) 15 years prior. Years later, as his doctor (Donald Pleasence) and a nurse (Nancy Stephens) try to transfer him to complete mental lockdown, he escapes and heads to Haddonfield to go after a couple of teens (P.J. Soles, Nancy Kyes, John Michael Graham) and his sister (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first film role.)<br/><br/>This film is absolutely one of the best films I've ever seen, not just one of the best horror films. In fact, this IS THE BEST horror film I've seen to date. The film just sticks with you even after you go to sleep, it haunts you in your dreams. Tony Moran really defines the Michael Myers character. I mean, it's easy to just stick a mask on a guy and then have him walk around and kill people, but he adds a sense of madness to the character that you wouldn't expect. Jamie Lee Curtis, who's first film role was this movie, did a great job playing Laurie, especially in the final climatic 15 minutes. Donald Pleasence really defines the Dr. Samuel Loomis character, as he is an important plot point and his speech about Michael while him and Sheriff Brackett are in the Myers house is truly a great scene. The rest of the cast are also great, especially Nancy Kyes and P.J. Soles, who play Annie and Lynda, respectively.<br/><br/>The music and cinematography in this film is beautifully chilling. Considering this movie was made on a real shoestring budget, it's amazing how they were able to construct this film in a way that it is one of the scariest horror films to audiences. The music was created by Carpenter in a matter of 4 days, which is equally shocking because it could have taken much longer, and would have been bad. But Carpenter truly created the theme of the holiday. The cinematography and direction is great as well because you feel like you are with the people as the film progresses.<br/><br/>The writing of this film is just brilliant, Hill wrote the girls speech, and it was sounded like real girls were chatting amongst themselves. I'm assuming Carpenter did the speech of Dr. Loomis and it's just as equally brilliant.<br/><br/>I'm going to stop rambling now, but to close off, the film is excellent and is a classic amongst the genre. Rating: 10/10."

The next night is Halloween and he is returning to finish he mess he made and no one is gonna stop him either. In the end when the aftermath all sad and done no one knows where this killer is. Is he hiding or did he die or what? The reason this is so great is he never speaks or goes out of his way to be a nice guy he simply does what he does best scare the living wits out of ppl and kill characters we kinda feel sorry for.

"illbebackreviews","10","1","2","4 November 2012"," The moment that redefined the slasher/horror genre
","This is my second time watching it and I'm writing this review based on my experiences of this film the 2nd time around. When I first watched it, I never really enjoyed the film as I found it too boring. But boy, people have convinced me to watch it one more time telling me of how good it was, and strangely, I loved it! <br/><br/>This film pretty much defines what fear is, and this is the film that has people fear for Halloween. The character of Michael Myers is like none other. His character is simply a maniac who killed because he was a psycho. All the Michael copies, such as Jason and all the others kill for revenge whereas Michael doesn't. Just imagine the image of your older sibling actually coming after you to kill you. Its horrifying. <br/><br/>The idea of this movie is amazingly done and the creepy score was just PERFECT! Pretty much anyone knows what this score is, and who its for, whereas for others like Jason and Freddy, the score doesn't give you the creeps.<br/><br/>I found the cast to be brilliant, especially the late Sir Donald Pleasance. He was perfect as Michael's doctor and he gave an extremely powerful performance giving us the backstory to Michael. <br/><br/>The ending was perhaps the greatest cliffhanger of the past century and perhaps the greatest end to any horror film. After the success of Halloween (1978), we had those copies such as Friday the 13th where every ending is the same with Jason coming back. Its so overused it got boring and not to mention it was ripped off Halloween. <br/><br/>With the ending to this film, you have no idea exactly where Michael could've went. He could've went back into the house or ran away or....<br/><br/>The ending to this film was such suspense and the amazing score at the end perfectly did it nicely! <br/><br/>This is a must see for any horror fan, though I must say this film doesn't seem like a slasher but more of a thriller. <br/><br/>Perfect film!"

"cblakes2015","9","1","2","1 October 2012"," Halloween
","Halloween is a suspense film about an insane man named Michael Myers who escapes from a mental institution and goes on a killing spree in his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Throughout the movie, director John Carpenter uses a combination of music and lighting that keeps you on edge the entire movie. It also seems like throughout the film the main characters see Michael in about every scene. He is just a looming presence stalking these girls waiting to attack. All of this combined created a very suspenseful and downright scary movie. Before watching Halloween you might think it will be like a lot of other horror movies, a lot of gore blood and gore trying to shock the audience as much as possible. After watching the movie however you see it's more about trying to use different lighting and sounds to genuinely scare the audience. This is what makes Halloween so different from other movies in this genre like Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street. It doesn't depend on how bloody and graphic it can look but how the scene is set during the killings and his reaction to it. One of the main things that make this movie so scary to me is the mask worn by Michael throughout the movie. The mask is just a plain white emotionless mask of a human face. This seems to mimic the way Michael acts during the movie. He never communicates to anyone or shows any sympathy toward any of the people he kills. He is just a cold and emotionless person who only gets joy from hurting other people. To me the mask is what makes the character of Michael Myers who he is. Another defining characteristic of Halloween is the lighting used during the movie. The light used for certain situations can invoke certain feeling or suspicions as to what is going to happen next. When all the lights are off and all you have moonlight in a house you know something bad is probably about to happen. In contrast when the lights are on in the house or if it's daytime you might see Michael, but nothing is going to happen during this time. This is very prevalent when Dr. Loomis is going with the nurse to transport Michael from the insane asylum to a court hearing. This scene could have been shot during the daytime but then it wouldn't be as suspenseful. Instead this is shot on a very dark night in the middle of a rain storm. Also the music is used quite a bit to let the audience in on what's about to happen. Whenever someone is walking through the house and you hear that droning piano music, then Michaels face appears in the background you know that character probably won't enjoy what follows. These two factors together create a lot of tension, and enhance the experience of the movie. I also found the fact that Michael never moves faster than a quick walk which is very creepy. Even when Lorrie is running across the street trying to get inside to safety Michael is walking behind her not appearing to be in any hurry. This is the opposite of what you would expect out of someone trying to murder somebody. This really adds to the suspense of the movie. Watching Lorrie pounding on the door and seeing Michael slowly walk up behind her, not knowing if he's going to catch her or not. It keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. This technique seems to have been copied in other movies like Friday the 13th because it was so successful at building suspense and keeping the audience interested. I also think Jamie Lee Curtis does a very good job portraying Lorrie in this film. While watching she seems to paint a picture of someone without anyone to defend her but herself. She doesn't have a boyfriend and is more concentrated on homework and grades than finding one. You also never see her father which creates a sense that she doesn't really have a male figure to turn to for help. Jamie Lee Curtis is just great at playing the damsel in distress. In my opinion Jamie Lee Curtis does a very good job at playing the role of Lorrie. Halloween although is a very scary and suspenseful movie you have to keep in mind it's all a work of fiction. It creates this image of a man that can just walk around a neighborhood killing teenagers and not get caught or have anyone even seem to take notice. When looking at it compared to real life it just seems kind of dumb, that's why Carpenter had to do such a good job of drawing the audience in so they don't realize its all fiction. That's what Halloween such a great movie."
"RomanJamesHoffman","8","1","2","28 September 2012"," While not the first, arguably the consummate slasher flick
","What's remarkable about John Carpenter's 'Halloween' is that, despite the endless sequels and slew of imitations that followed, and the subsequent decay of the slasher sub-genre into ineffectual parody, it nonetheless retains its chilling and suspenseful atmosphere, keeping it fresh, vital, and (stop press) scary.<br/><br/>The strength of the movie is the simplicity of its concept and the directness of its execution. On the former point: a crazy kid (the ever bemasked Michael Myers of lore) hacks up his sister, is incarcerated for a couple of decades where he gives his doctor (Pleasence) the heebie-jeebies from his general vibe of evil-ness, escapes and returns home to hack up more kids in general and Jamie Lee Curtis in particular as an archetypal, nightmarish monster-who-will-not-stop. On the second point, 'Halloween' is refreshingly free of the over-the-top gory ""kills"", such as in 'Friday the 13th (1980)' or 'Halloween 2 (1981), which went onto become such a predictable characteristic of the genre. Instead, Carpenter has Michael silently lurk in peripheral vision and shadows from which he periodically emerges, usually accompanied by the minimal and haunting score, to take another life.<br/><br/>The characters are all fleshed out in a way that makes them more than slasher-fodder and the performances are strong all-roundyet all eyes (deservedly) remain on Pleasence and Curtis. As Dr Loomis, Pleesance's earnest exhortations of Myers' evilness and that the local police force don't know what they're up against, build suspense where in later films they elicit a ""rightreally really evil, got it"" and roll-of-the-eyes response. Complimenting all this is Curtis's shy and uber-awkward Laurie Strode who as a virgin and the surviving female seems to be the prototypical ""final-girl"" which would become another trope used in the genre. However, while certainly surviving the ordeal she is far from the ""final-girl"" in the sense of being empowered by her ordeal (like the spiky, booby-trap setting moxy of Nancy from 'Nightmare on Elm St. (1984)) but instead Laurie remains the perfect victim, even when brandishing a knife, and is wholly traumatised by the whole affair. Sexist? Probably. Draw from that what you will.<br/><br/>The movie is often erroneously cited as the first slasher flick. While certainly the quintessential example of the genre, the honour of the first slasher actually goes to 'Black Christmas' four years earlierindeed, so impressed was John Carpenter when he saw 'Black Christmas' that he originally envisioned 'Halloween' as being a sequel! However, perhaps the key difference which presumably seared 'Halloween' into the collective imagination (while relegating 'Black Christmas' to an undeserved 'Halloween' footnote) is that it gives us something 'Black Christmas' chose not to: a contemporary revision of the movie-monster in the boogieman-made-real form of Michael Myers. Trick or treat? Definitely a treat!"
"MartianOctocretr5","7","1","2","26 November 2011"," Iconic slasher killer mixed with old school horror
","This horror classic is a grand example of how a great, low budget movie with production flaws can be so entertaining that nobody cares about those flaws. In some ways, the amateurish approach of flicks like this is even a plus, since no one asks a movie like this to make sense anyway.<br/><br/>There is no logic whatsoever to the Michael Myers that we see in this film. One moment he's just a human whack job; the next, some kind of paranormal entity that defines evil and malevolence. For example: how did he learn to drive if he was institutionalized since the age of six? If he magically learned it because he's supernatural, then why does he need a car in the first place? Can't he just ""beam up"" like he does in the clothesline scene? Guns and other weapons stop him; then, he gets up like nothing happened. The great thing about this flick is that it doesn't matter. John Carpenter fashions the character in such a way that he has a dual-nature, making him that much more frightening. The iconic killer's mask and the simplistic but spooky theme song identified with him add even more. <br/><br/>The movie's flaws are all small problems, and so easily overlooked. Since most horror films don't bother to try to make sense, we're all used to this formulaic approach, anyway. Carpenter knows his audience well; just make them squirm and squeal. To no surprise, the characters go through all the clichéd motions of doing just the dumbest thing at the worst time. Except for Donald Pleasance who is superb, and Jamie Lee Curtis, who is fair, the acting is some of the most laughably forced mugging ever. At least, it's the worst anyone will ever see in such a popular film as this one is. The lines they utter are pretty unrealistic, as well. Some scenes are dragged out deliberately to crank up the fear factor, but end up being way too long to maintain it. One example of this type of scene involves a laundry room and then proceeds to go absolutely nowhere.<br/><br/>Not a genius work like Night of the Living Dead, which was made on an even more shoestring budget. However, it is definitely entertaining in the same way, and succeeds in what it set out to do: just give some hair raising chills and scares. With the less than creative title, that's all you should expect from this. From that point of view, it's a scary classic that every horror fan should watch and re-watch about 500 times."
"eytand94","10","1","2","1 November 2011"," Halloween: Carpenter's Classic Chiller
","Michael Myers has become a bigger icon than Ronald McDonald. He has carved his way through eight sequels, a remake, and a remake of a sequel, and he is the first major horror movie villain to inspire other classics to follow in his wake(""Friday the 13th"" and ""A Nightmare on Elm Street""). But to really know who Michael Myers is, to understand why he frightens us, you have to go back to 1978, when John Carpenter released a low-budget independent horror film that not only gave birth to an icon, but stood the test of time after more than 30 years as one of the scariest movies of all time. That movie is ""Halloween.""<br/><br/>The story is extremely simple: In 1963, a six year old boy murders his sister, Judith Myers, in cold blood with a kitchen knife. After 15 years of confinement to Smith's Grove Sanitarium, the killer escapes and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois, with Dr. Sam Loomis(played magnificently by Donald Pleasence) in desperate pursuit. Enter Laurie Strode(played by Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends Annie and Lynda. It is October 31st, and Laurie and Annie are babysitting in houses right across from each other while ditsy Lynda messes around with her boyfriend Bob. What they don't know is the killer has targeted them and has some pretty gruesome plans for this Halloween night.<br/><br/>Such a bare-bones plot could have resulted in an average exploitation film a la ""The Hills Have Eyes"" or ""Black Christmas."" But, obviously, John Carpenter and Debra Hill had other, more serious intentions when they wrote their script and filmed the movie. With a tiny budget of just $300,000, they were out to make a horror film that would transcend the way we looked at the genre. And it did. ""Halloween"" still terrifies, with its mind-numbing suspense, its creepy villain, a fantastic cast, and a nightmarish musical score.<br/><br/>When it comes to supernatural forces, John Carpenter knows the way to any movie buff's fear factor, after such films as ""The Fog"" and ""Christine."" ""Halloween"" was Carpenter's first major film, and he knew exactly what he was doing when he created the character of Michael Myers, or let's just say 'The Shape.' The character may be a human being (isn't it always more scary when a killer is human?), but he is not seen that way by his creator or the audience. Michael is frightening because he almost gets a kick out of killing his victims. He plays psychological games with them until the time comes for them to die. Michael is treated as a furiously violent force of nature, a predator that can be anywhere at anytime, ready to strike. His strength is overwhelming, his lack of emotion is shocking, and his inability to die makes him all the more spine-tingling. That is why he is called 'The Shape' in the first film.<br/><br/>We never need to see Michael's face, and we barely do. Everything that we're afraid of can be projected on his choice of visage. The mask that he wears(originally a Captain Kirk mask that was spray-painted white, with the hair teased and eye-holes widened) is disturbingly expressionless, allowing the viewer to project anything they want on it.<br/><br/>As suspenseful as the movie is, the score(composed by Carpenter himself) is almost just as effective. The recurring musical themes symbolize evil, the feeling that something horrible is approaching us from a dark corner or at our front door. No shrieking violins are found here, but Carpenter's simplistic music makes the movie more chilling.<br/><br/>Later over-analyzed in the ""Final Destination"" movies, ""Halloween"" subtly hints at the subject of fate. The film has something to say. It tells us that fate is inescapable, that no matter what, some form of evil or death will come for you, whether it's watching you from outside, or crossing the street, or staring at you from a backyard.<br/><br/>Dean Cundey's cinematography is something worth noting. The film takes place almost entirely at night, making the streets of Haddonfield and the Doyle and Wallace houses a little abnormally dark. This allows for our villain to creep into the shadows and watch from places you can't see him.<br/><br/>The cast is pure gold. Back in 1978, the choice to cast an important cinematic performer in a horror film kind of brought some skepticism. Donald Pleasence was an exception. He could have portrayed Sam Loomis(the name of Janet Leigh's boyfriend in ""Psycho"") in a cheesy way with over-acted dialog. But Pleasence wouldn't allow it. He plays Loomis with great intensity, the fear that Michael will kill again evident in his eyes. Annie and Lynda are played by Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles(famous for Brian De Palma's ""Carrie""). Both are played very realistically and sympathetically, especially by Soles. She is funny and a joy to watch. Her death is disquieting because of that.<br/><br/>And then there's Laurie Strode. ""Halloween"" marked the debut of Jamie Lee Curtis, and for an actress that doesn't exactly love the horror genre, she makes for a flawless heroine. Thanks to Curtis, Laurie is human and likable. We don't want to see her die. We want to see her triumph and fight back. She is our protector. This role was meant for Curtis from the beginning, and being ""Psycho"" star Janet Leigh's daughter, she knows how to scream!<br/><br/>Overall, what hasn't been said about ""Halloween"" that hasn't been said by everyone else? The movie is a horror masterpiece, a classic that no slasher follow-up, not even the wonderfully entertaining ""Friday the 13th,"" can possibly beat. Not including part 3, this movie franchise is a ball for all genre enthusiasts, even Rob Zombie's films. Like Michael Myers, ""Halloween"" will never die. After more than 30 years, I think it's safe to say, I quote the character of Tommy Doyle, that ""you can't kill the boogeyman."""

","John Carpenter transforms an everyday neighborhood into a theater of agonizing terror. No need for blood, gore, or a Hollywood budget; subtlety is the name of the game here. The film uses delicate cinematography and unsettling sounds to create an atmosphere of relentless tension. Empowered by Carpenter's iconic score, simple images - such as a silhouetted figure lurking in the neighbor's yard - become horrifying motifs that linger in the viewers mind for days. In conclusion, 'Halloween' proves there is no setting more scary than the American suburbs, no monster more horrid than our own misperceived sense of safety."

","An hour and a half long exercise in style, atmosphere, and suspense by director / co-writer / composer John Carpenter, ""Halloween"" remains one of his finest works, a top notch slasher film whose incredible success opened the floodgates for scores of similar films. It's done in a true minimalist style, with utterly relentless automaton Michael Myers taking his time and putting much more effort into his stalking, ultimately, than his slashing.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is so well executed that, much like ""Psycho"" before it (to which ""Halloween"" is admittedly indebted) its murder set pieces can still grip the viewer. Carpenter and company try hard to create a true autumn feel as well as a sense of the American Midwest, despite filming this in South Pasadena in the spring, and sometimes they succeed and sometimes they don't, but overall their film is a classic that continues to hold up very well.<br/><br/>Making her feature film debut, young Jamie Lee Curtis makes for a likable, sympathetic ""final girl"". Nancy Loomis provides funny comedy relief as wise ass Annie. Sexy P.J. Soles is likewise a hoot as air headed cheerleader Lynda. Strong support is provided by Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Brackett, with long time Carpenter friend Nick Castle impressively creepy as Myers. Star attraction Donald Pleasence is wonderfully sincere and intense as Myers' persistent nemesis Dr. Loomis, really bringing Carpenters' memorable dialogue to life.<br/><br/>Fluid camera-work and Dean Cundey's striking cinematography are incredibly important assets. The use of the Panavision aspect ratio enables Carpenter to fill the frame with as much detail as possible while still allowing Myers to ominously linger at the edges. Carpenters' haunting score - reminiscent of Goblins' work for ""Suspiria"", and ""Tubular Bells"" from ""The Exorcist"" - has gone on to become one of *the* iconic horror movie scores, and the film simply wouldn't be the same without it; it makes even the day time scenes rather eerie.<br/><br/>Carpenter begins the film with a flourish, and gives it a mighty fine ending that basically shows us that true evil - whether personified in a bogeyman wearing a Shatner mask or not - will never ever go away. True enough that there are elements here that are not exactly original - the use of subjective camera-work to indicate the killers' point of view, the idea of the killer that keeps coming no matter what - although for better or worse ""Halloween"" *did* definitively bring them to the public consciousness. The screenplay doesn't hold up to much scrutiny, but overall the film is still so well made and compelling as to remain essential viewing any time of the year, not just tonight.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."
"geminiredblue","10","1","2","15 September 2011"," Creme De La Creme of Slashers!!!
","In 1978, a young filmmaker named John Carpenter set out to make a chilling horror movie about some babysitters being terrified by a masked killer. From this one film spawned a whole generation of what came to be known as the slasher/ dead teen flick. While the countless slashers to follow would borrow or blatantly steal from it, none come close to its greatness. Every Halloween, I make sure to set time aside to once again view HALLOWEEN. What's not to like about it? You have a simple creepy premise: Years ago a young boy murders his sister and now as an adult escapes from a mental hospital to kill again. You have a stellar cast, including the young Jamie Lee Curtis as heroine Laurie Strode and horror great Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis. John Carpenter and his crew wisely borrowed techniques used in Italian horror, like electronic synth music, to ramp up the tension. Of particular merit, I'd like to mention the art direction, lighting and cinematography. Using a mixture of varying amounts of light and shadow, the filmmakers wisely allow the viewer's imagination to run wild. Sometimes you'll think you see things hidden in the shadows and nothing's there, and vice versa. When the deaths come, they are usually swift and filmed in partial shadow/light also. If ever a movie embodied the spirit of Halloween, it would be this one. So I highly recommend this for either group viewing or, if you dare, to watch it solo. Just be prepared to be thrilled by the creme de la creme of slashers!!!"
"TheRagingBull94","10","1","2","6 September 2011"," The Ultimate Horror Masterpiece
","When discussing what the best horror movies of all time are the most common examples include films like Psycho, The Exorcist, Dawn of the Dead and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. While all of these films are great, I hold the opinion that the greatest horror movie ever made is John Carpenter's 1978 film, Halloween. It's not just a must-see film for fans and non-fans of horror alike, but it's also the perfect example of John Carpenter's directorial talent, a great example of budget-conscious filmmaking, the main inspiration for the slasher subgenre, an influential movie for aspiring filmmakers like myself, but most importantly it is a monumental achievement in horror filmmaking and a landmark film for the entire genre that has not been surpassed by any horror film since.<br/><br/>The premise is simple, but absolutely perfect. Michael Myers murders his older sister, Judith on Halloween Night 1963 when he is six years old. He's locked away for fifteen years and is treated by Dr Sam Loomis until he escapes before he is to stand for a trial. What is to follow is a night of terror as Michael sets out to his home town, Haddonfield, to stalk and kill teenager Laurie Strode and her friends on Halloween Night whilst Dr Loomis searches the streets looking for him. It may seem very basic, but it is the perfect set up for the essential horror film.<br/><br/>The main reason why this film is so amazing is how well it is directed. John Carpenter was clearly an absolute genius. The camera angles and lighting perfectly compliment each other and create a great sense of atmosphere that is creepy and the editing is outstanding and the film never feels like it is slow or wasting any time, making the hour and a half running time perfect. However, the greatest aspect of Carpenter's talent has to be the music. He composed it himself, he uses it at the appropriate times and the movie really wouldn't be anywhere near as suspenseful without it. I really don't see how this film could have been directed more perfectly.<br/><br/>Outside of Carpenter's excellent direction, the cast should be commended too. Usually in a horror film you expect the actors to be terrible, but it seems like everyone does a good job here. Jamie Lee Curtis is brilliant as Laurie Strode. She captures the image of the innocent good girl very well and this was her debut performance. Nancy Loomis and PJ Soles are really good as Laurie's friends, Annie and Lynda. Charles Cyphers was great as Sheriff Brackett. The child actors who played Tommy and Lindsey were great, especially for their young age. Nick Castle was excellent as Michael Myers and really gave off a creepy vibe. Despite all these great performances, the best is undeniably Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis. This man's acting was unbelievably good. The scene in which he gives an eerie monologue in the Myers house is just breathtaking.<br/><br/>As far as kills go, there isn't quite as many as you would expect in a slasher film and the gore is basically non-existent, but this is because Carpenter didn't want to make a splatter fest with piles of bodies and is instead focusing on something much greater. Suspense. This beats violence anyday as it is true terror and it shows off much greater filmmaking quality.<br/><br/>While there were earlier films that influenced the slasher genre such as Black Christmas, Halloween is the one that deserves to take the title as the original slasher movie because it created the basic formula that made later films like Friday the 13th possible. Interesting to think that such a little independent film went on to change the history of horror as we know it. In that sense, I also have a huge level of respect for it and it influences me as an aspiring director.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has certainly made some great movies, but Halloween takes the trophy as it simply is just the perfect horror film. I really can't see how this movie can be beaten. It's suspenseful, spawned a great franchise, laid unimaginable influence and is truly defining of its genre. Do not miss this masterpiece. It's something that you just have to watch regardless as to whether or not you're a horror movie fan.<br/><br/>10/10"
"fullserve","Null","1","2","1 September 2011"," A Very Disappointing Revisit
","I hadn't seen this film in over twenty-five years, so I decided to give it another look. I remember going to the movies as a teenager to see this film and being scared to death, so I was looking forward to seeing it again. I can only say I was sorely disappointed. The film I thought was basically an inferior remake of ""Black Christmas"" (1974) with Olivia Hussey, which was a film Carpenter was obviously familiar with, and I feel he copied many film techniques and plot lines from. The fact that Carpenter has never repeated this success speaks volumes to me as his skill as a director. Carpenter is an excellent mimic but not an original."
"raghibali94","10","1","2","8 August 2011"," Scary. Really scary.
","As it was released way before I was born, in 'old times', I really didn't expect this to be as scary a movie as some of the more recent ones, say 'Saw', 'Dead Silence' or its own remake in 2007. However, upon watching it, I was stunned. This remains to be one of the most scary movies on my list, although I had least expected it. From the moment Michael kills Judith, to the time he falls to his apparent death, this movie carried with it unexpected and original moments of horror and suspense. With that said, I believe it IS a tribute to Jamie Lee Curtis in a way, as her mother Janet Leigh appeared in unarguably the scariest movie of the 60's, 'Psycho'. Great work by the cast and crew, and the directing body."
"vadnj0","10","1","2","8 July 2011"," An Intense Classic!!
","I don't think that anyone born after 1990 should be allowed to review this movie. All's your gonna get is: ""This movie sucks--It's no Saw--I have seen better"".<br/><br/>All slamming young people aside, this movie will be an eternal classic. It scared me when I was a kid and it still scares me now. Nothing holds a candle to this John Carpenter classic. The music is chilling, the story is awesome and the characters are very well done.<br/><br/>When John Carpenter was given the OK, he knew exactly what scared people and his view of the killer sends chills up and down my spine when I see the Shape closing in on people. Even though I have seen the film 100's of times, it is still worth the view.<br/><br/>Even decades from now, Halloween will still be celebrated by those who know a classic when they see it and many conventions will be held to cater to those people. Michael Myers, the man and name, is tantamount to terror and night time shivers to the nth degree. Even though Hollywood seriously botched the sequels (until Halloween H20) they still offered Halloween fans something to help them appreciate the original.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis started out as a nobody in the film but became an instant scream queen because of her excellent portrayal of Myer's sister. All the angles were covered by Carpenter which adds up to not only a great story but a good lesson in how to make a scary movie that will endure.<br/><br/>So, keep up your head and enjoy the classic, the only--Halloween!!"

","Halloween was about a child sociopath who murdered his sister at six years of age, and is released back into society after fifteen years of unsuccessful psychiatric treatment.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis was very good playing the killer's sister. I love the famous speech by Dr. Loomis about how evil this child truly is, despite his best efforts to help him. I love the other scenes when Lori Strode and Tommy Doyle are watching ""The Thing"" and ""Forbidden Planet,"" unaware of the danger. It's a tongue in cheek homage to the other horror films as well as a clever way to build tension. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" is more interesting than ""The Thing.""

Funny thing is even though I could not go to sleep for a while after viewing the movie, I watched it again, and was still scared out of my mind.This is no doubt one of the best slasher films(right next to scream).This is a must for fans of horror films(and not for an 11 year old awkward boy).Why is it so terrifying? easy the mood, the soundtrack, and the killer.

"sme_no_densetsu","7","1","2","7 November 2010"," A classic in the annals of horror filmdom
","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is basically a must-see for any discerning horror fan. It is a touchstone in the 'slasher film' sub-genre and has spawned hordes of imitators. Also, it is among the most profitable independent films of all time.<br/><br/>The story is fairly simple. A killer, institutionalized since childhood for the murder of his sister, escapes and preys again on Halloween night. It's basically a high-concept premise meant to set up a suspenseful series of set-pieces culminating in a climactic showdown late in the movie.<br/><br/>On the acting front, ""Halloween"" launched the career of Jamie Lee Curtis. She stands out among her co-stars, though that's faint praise considering the rest of the cast. I make exception, of course, for Donald Pleasance, who lends the film some credibility.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's direction is nicely handled and the film shows some interesting touches from a visual standpoint. Carpenter takes the time to establish atmosphere and create suspense, aided in part by his own moody score.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Halloween"" is a good low-budget picture but (inevitably) some of the acting and writing is a bit amateurish. However, the movie is still worth watching as a straightforward horror flick whose success is based more on suspense than blood and guts."
"rokcomx","4","1","2","27 October 2010"," Groundbreaking and perfect for drive-ins
","Worth noting are groundbreaking aspects like, say, spawning the birth of the ""holiday themed"" horror movie (future slashers would stalk Mother's Day, Christmas, Valentine's Day, Prom Night, even one schlocky Aussie entry called The Day AFTER Halloween). Or the then-novel notion of an indestructible human (as opposed to mutants, vampires, witches, zombies, blah blah). Or the innovative marketing that blew up Halloween into a virtual Hollywood franchise that still churns 'em out to this day.<br/><br/>Or how the epically low budget was overcome by doing things like hand painting paper leaves to make a California summer look like a rural autumn (requiring the cast to gather up all the leaves in bags after each shot, lest they loose their ""fall"" atmosphere).<br/><br/>Though not classic cinema by any means, Halloween was still innovative and, at the time, more riveting than just about anything else touring drive-in theater screens (which was, after all, the intended market from its very conception).<br/><br/>And also worth citing are the performances of genuinely gifted thespians like the late Donald Pleasance (who returned for several sequels) and Jamie Lee Curtis, not to mention cult cutie PJ Soles, fresh off the film's kindred precedent Carrie and soon to all-but-steal the Rock 'N' Roll High School spotlight from headliners the Ramones.<br/><br/>I admit that Halloween isn't the kind of movie I'd ever want to watch more than once. But that one time certainly made its mark on my movie-going psyche --- I counter several commentators' single star with three more, for a total of four.

"dee.reid","10","1","2","1 September 2008"," The night HE came home!
","Co-writer/director John Carpenter's 1978 masterpiece of horror and suspense remains to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The simple story of a masked maniac going on a senseless rampage on Halloween night in a small suburban community and the determined psychiatrist hot on his trail still rings true even to this day. For the longest time, I avoided this movie, I'm not sure why. I don't normally like ""slasher"" movies, although I do consider ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" (1984) to be the best of this particular genre. I would guess ""Halloween"" follows at a close second. This is often cited as the one that started it all, even though earlier slasher flicks such as ""Black Christmas"" (1974), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974), and Alfred Hitchcock's classic ""Psycho"" (1960) could definitely be seen as influences on Carpenter's work here. Compared to the horror movies of today, what's most striking about ""Halloween"" is that the violence and gore is actually very minimal. The surreal, minimalist violence and gore is far more frightening than anything produced in the sequels or any of its countless knock-offs. Carpenter instead relies on his direction, actors (especially Jamie Lee Curtis as would-be female victim Laurie Strode), camera-work, and overall atmosphere and suspense to get his chills here. Rob Zombie's 2007 remake couldn't even compare! Carpenter's moody score (most effective in the opening sequence) sets the tone for the rest of the film, a series of relentless shocks and ever-mounting tension; ""Halloween"" is the sole reason why Carpenter is oft-cited as the master of suspense. What we have in ""Halloween"" is one of the greatest and scariest horror movies of all time, a horror movie that influenced an entire generation of filmmakers.

"CelluloidRehab","10","1","2","24 January 2008"," 30th Anniversary and counting
","As I mentioned previously, John Carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies I can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic Conan the Barbarian). It so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was Michael Meyers, whom I eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. Now that is terror for a 10 year old.<br/><br/>It is a horror classic and I am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. The most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. This all could happen. It isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. Hostel, Touristas, Cry Wolf, Saw,etc). At times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. I believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. It still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. So we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.<br/><br/>Carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on Halloween and kills his sister. He then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous Haddonfield. On his way he kills and kills. The child's name is Michael Meyers, though he is not a person. John Carpenter uses Michael Meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. In the bastion of American safety and security, chaos can still strike.<br/><br/>Michael ceased to be a person once he killed. He is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. He is as unstoppable force. The generic overalls, bleached-white Shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete Michael's generification. This is the source of all his power. He is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. This is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of Donald Pleasence (Dr. Loomis). His over the top performance and uneasiness sells ""the Shape"". This is also the first film performance by Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit). <br/><br/>Though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (Black Christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. If you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. I highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of John Carpenter's career."

Myers is hidden well until fully revealed at the exciting conclusion.<br/><br/>Although ""Halloween"" is certainly outdated, it is by no means less chilling.

"moviesleuth2","8","1","2","27 November 2007"," The best there is
","Every now and then a movie advertises itself as scary or frightening, though they usually aren't. Most modern horror movies fit into this category.<br/><br/>Then there are those movies that don't simply cause the tension and adrenaline to pump through your veins harder than usual. They actually frighten you to a level that you've never experienced.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is such a film. It takes so many risks that would make most movie producers cringe. But nearly all of them work. ""Halloween"" is awe-inspiring in its simplicity, and terrifying as a whole.<br/><br/>The story is simple. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is babysitting some kids on Halloween night, while a madman is on the loose after escaping from a mental institution after brutally murdering his older sister 15 years ago. Of course, the madman, later known as Michael Myers, begins killing the local teenage population, and eventually he comes after Laurie.<br/><br/>Sounds familiar, right? Just another brainless slasher filled with dumb teenagers and gobs of gore. Not a chance.<br/><br/>I think James Berardinelli puts it perfectly in his review of ""Halloween:"" ""Because of its title, Halloween has frequently been grouped together with all the other splatter films that populated theaters throughout the late-1970s and early-1980s. However, while Halloween is rightfully considered the father of the modern slasher genre, it is not a member..."" <br/><br/>He has a point, and for a number of reasons. First and foremost, it's downright terrifying, whereas most entries into the teen slasher genre are dumb gore-fests (one could argue that many recent ones are tongue-in-cheek, but most of those fail as well). Second, there is almost no violence (very little of which is bloody). John Carpenter knows that violence does not equal scary, and he relies very little on it (actually, the body count is pretty low). In fact, one can argue that this isn't really a horror movie, at least not by todays standards of having the most deaths that can be crammed into a single movie, each gorier and more sadistic than the last. He relies on ideas for scares, and also skill. Third, while some of the characters may do stupid things (that sometimes seal their fate), they don't do them because they're dumb. The characters are real people, so instead of thinking that the characters die because they're idiots, we're frightened because they're making a mistake.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons why ""Halloween"" is so scary is because it is so easy to believe that it's real. Nothing is hard to swallow in this film. There's no supernatural, there's no ridiculously creative plot elements, or ""inventive"" murders, or whatnot. Instead, all the set pieces and camera work (save the opening sequence) are simple. Carpenter just sets the camera in place and says action. What we get is the feeling that we're actually seeing a murder take place right in front of us.<br/><br/>Horror movies are probably the most difficult films to make because in order for something to be scary, everything has to be perfect, and ideas never work twice. It's a hit or miss game, which is why if I were to tell you all the good ideas that Carpenter has (which I'm not), they'd seem primitive (particularly since they have been repeated with lesser effect over and over again through the years).<br/><br/>Acting here is not a plus point because it doesn't need to be. This is a movie about scary ideas, not a movie about dramatic, conflicted characters. The actors act like real people, not characters from a story. Nothing more. The exception to this is whoever plays The Shape, or later known as Michael Myers. It can be scary to have a person say nothing and simply kill, but it's hard to pull off (and even harder to keep people from asking why). But the guy pulls it off, and the result is terrifying.<br/><br/>This is Carpenter's movie through and through. He directed it, co-wrote it, co-produced it, and wrote the chilling score of it. This is a man of brilliance, and his later movie ""The Thing"" supports this statement, though The Thing is not as scary as ""Halloween."" Unfortunately his success has dramatically diminished, as it happens when the lure of big money for less freedom is taken advantage of once big time producers ""recognize your potential."" As good as this film is, it's not without flaws. The famous opening scene is disturbing, but not very scary. And not many of the scares work for the first part of the movie. It's not that it's bad, it's just that there's no good reason to fear ""The Shape."" Luckily, Carpenter mostly uses this time to set up a relationship between the characters and the audience. While there's no intimacy in this relationship, it fits the purpose. We grow to know the characters, but not so much that it's disheartening when they die. But once the film gets to Halloween night, that's when Carpenter kicks things into high gear and it NEVER stops until you get to the end.<br/><br/>While ""Halloween"" may be flawed, it is only slightly so. It is an immensely terrifying film, and a must see for anyone who loves scary movies. Be warned though, this movie will scare the living hell out of you!"

","Needless to say, not as abjectly terrifying as it was when I was 12, and it was 2 am, and the lights were out, and I was alone. In 35mm widescreen, which is how I was lucky enough to watch it this Halloween, the now-you-see-him-now-you-don't shtick is less than subtle, and at this remove I find myself critically appraising the stylistic devices instead of being swept up in them. I guess that's what happens after you've seen a horror movie twenty times. Michele hadn't seen it before, and she was scared. And I guess it's impressive that Carpenter aims not for shocks or grossouts but for creeps - whenever anybody turns their head, the boogeyman is behind them, watching. The accusation that this sets the template for the 80s' f*ck-and-die fetish is tempered by the fact that these teenage women are brilliantly detailed and likable, certainly more so than silly old Donald Pleasance who spends half the movie in a shrub. And Carpenter is at pains to indicate that this movie is really about other movies, about the process of being scared - and also about the pleasure of inventing your own icon. Michael Myers is here, get used to it."

"Son_of_Mansfield","9","1","2","31 October 2007"," The night John Carpenter came to town.
","Halloween has a simple premise, a psycho stalks babysitters on the title day, but it's the style brought to the table by John Carpenter that makes this movie a classic. He turns Michael Myers into evil personified and you can't kill evil. Myers has this catlike quality, he likes to appear in rooms suddenly and rather than killing his victims straight off, he prefers to maneuver them into corners, letting their fear do most of the work. Carpenter frames Myers from the neck down, making the already terrifying sight of William Shatner ever more so, and he was, to the best of my knowledge, one of the first to heavily use the point of view shot that gives the character a lot of it's menace. The best of his touches may be the simple, yet always effective score. Halloween is one of his best, the opening titles' music creeping out like a masked man and the stalking music, the single, repeated pounds on the piano, coming across as the beating of the victim's heart. Halloween has aged and been imitated to the point where some of it's power may be lost on younger audiences looking for buckets of blood, but make no mistake, this is the main reason why Carpenter is considered a horror icon."

To stop him, his doctor is the only one who can stop him and will him, but will he be too late to tame or stop the killing machine? This movie is truly a horror classic no one should go with out seeing if you are a horror movie fanatic. Up until the late summer of 1999, with the release of The Blair Witch Project, this movie was the most successful independent movie that spanned two decades.

We' ve got a ghoulish figure with a butcher knife (can anyone find more simple weapon than that? It's used for slaughtering pigs. We've got an average man, not some musclebound 300 pounder. His mask is white painted (we can call it blank either - no emotions, no nothing, just work. A machine). No psychological profile, no torturing in his childhood years which brought him to this psychotic state, no hopes, no dreams, no higher purpose in his acts. Pure evil. That kind of purity is the signature for all of Carpenter's work. Look at the Assault on the precinct 13 or Prince of the darkness, or The Fog."

","If you haven't seen Halloween yet, you are missing out. This movie is very respectable because it proves that even with a very low budget, you can still scare people. First off, the two things that really make this movie are: the character of Michael Myers, and the theme song. What's scary about Michael Myers is that he really is a psycho who has had a rough past and now has a revenge against everybody. The music is just a simple piano part, but it's extremely effective. A couple days ago, I had about seven of my friends over to watch scary movies and we were still jumping out of our seats in shock even though the majority of us had already seen it because it's so suspenseful. If you haven't seen this movie, and you want to see a classic horror film that will shock you and make your heart pace, rent Halloween."

I don't really need to tell any of the story because everyone should have seen this film already. What i would like to mention is the brilliant acting from Donald Plesance and Jaime Lee Curtis. Also the theme music has to be the best there is and this really added to the suspense in the film. Sure there is a few plot holes in this movie but who cares when the rest of the film is so brilliant for any one else to notice. I loved the ending to this film where Michael is shot over the balcony by Dr Loomis and the way they left it open for the viewers to make up their mind whether he was human or just some sort of supernatural force.

"TRUNKOMAC","10","1","2","13 June 2007"," The best horror movie..........ever.
","This movie is truly amazing. For a movie as low as the budget, 300 g's, it is done very well. WHat i liked is that there was like no blood, because suspense is what makes most horror movies. you can get gore like saw or Texas chainsaw massacre, but that is just pure gore, no suspense. Donald PLeasance and Jamie Lee Curtis have excellent performances, showing the obsessed doctor, and the unaware quiet smarty pants who babysits for extra cash on the side. And there is this guy, who just stalks her and decides to do whatever to reach her to KILL her. I think why that storyline is so powerful is because many people can relate to a movie such as this in their real lives. A babysitter is worldly by virtually everybody, and that certainly gives it a good affect on people because really, it could happen to anybody in the movie world or not. But the only thing is........Michael Myers isn't a man........he is evil on two legs............"
"captaincracker","10","1","2","13 June 2007"," The Trick is the Scares, The Treat is The Film Itself
","In 1978 John Carpenter introduced Michael Myers to the world in his mega-hit blockbuster ""Halloween"". Starring Donald Pleasance as the obsessed doctor hunting down psychopathic Michael Myers, the low-budget film immediately became one of the most successful films ever made and spawned seven sequels plus a remake, as well as countless knock-offs. With its introduction of modern day star Jamie Lee Curtis as well as appearances by legends Charles Cyphers and PJ Soles, ""Halloween"" landed a spot for itself as being a classic, and a well deserved title it is.<br/><br/>The plot is standard and has been copied so many times that you would think the world would be tired of it, but the world will never be tired of the immortal ""Halloween"" story. It is about a man who murdered his teenage sister on Halloween night fifteen years ago, but who escapes his mental hospital and heads back to his home town where he stalks three teenage girls around the same age as his deceased sister relentlessly. Meanwhile, his obsessed doctor tries to track him down, understand him, and ultimately destroy him with the help of local police.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" still has the power to scare people nearly thirty years after its initial release. It is one of the few slasher films that doesn't rely on gruesome deaths, such as ""Friday the 13th"", in order to deliver a shock. The stalking scenes involving the three teenage girls are unforgettable and realistic - making them all the more terrifying. John Carpenter truly mastered his camera-work to give us not only the point of view of the killer (earlier seen in ""Black Christmas"" and ""Jaws""), but to also give us truly eerie shots involving lighting as well.<br/><br/>Unlike many of its imitators, ""Halloween"" will keep most everyone entertained while still having the power to scare you. It is not a film people will be turned off due to gore and blood (there is very, very little shown), however slasher fans will enjoy the thrills that the film has to offer (the last chase scene is the one that set the standard for all to come). If you are a slasher fan, this should be a no-brainer, but even if you find those particular films to be nothing but nonsense you should still check out John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" - its bound to give one good scare and the trick is that you'll find a treat is this nice American classic.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" has had a lot of DVD editions due to its popularity, but the one that would most satisfy a fan would definitely be Anchor Bay's 25th Anniversary Edition, which features commentary tracts, radio spots, TV spots, a trailer, an 80-minute documentary, a re-visiting the sets tour, actor and director profiles, photo gallery, and more! A sure treat for ""Halloween""."

The first hour of this movie is so slow, you'll be crying for something that is more then a glimpse of a white mask.<br/><br/>I don't find the dialogue in this movie to be all that impressive, even for the 70's. Although some of the dialogue will keep you entertained, most of it will seem like nothing more then a time-filler. I also understand this movie was created on a 320,000 dollar budget but that doesn't mean it had to be so slow.<br/><br/>That's really my only beef with the film. There are some really impressive things in this movie. For instance: when she tries to trick Michael by opening the balcony door and hiding in the closet. You don't see that kind of intelligence in horror films anymore.

"beingjohncarpenter","10","1","2","10 April 2007"," There is no matching the original!
","With its almost blood-free frights, gutsy heroine, and peerless score, Halloween became the gold standard for the late 1970s-1980s teen slasher cycle (as Scream cheekily acknowledged in 1996). Taking full advantage of the widescreen frame (and offscreen space), John Carpenter builds tension through the constant suggestion that something terrible lurks just out of Laurie's and the audience's view, whether it's behind a bush or in a passing car. Carpenter also shifts to the killer's point of view, leaving the audience with only the sight of the unaware victim and the sound of Michael's breathing. Evoking Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and Vertigo, as well as Howard Hawks's original The Thing, Carpenter and co-writer/producer Debra Hill render Myers an inhuman force that paradoxically points up the psycho-sexual anxieties under the surface of small-town life, especially in the wake of the late '60s-early '70s sexual revolution. Teens responded to Halloween's thrills, as the 325,000 indie film went on to gross 47 million, begetting six sequels and numerous imitators like the Friday the 13th series.

I also wanted to say how good Halloween truly is, I never saw it until about 3 years ago and fell in love with it, I have watched 2 of the sequels and they're just as good.

In it, we are given the story of a psychotic child who kills there sister for being unclean (e.i. having sex, doing drugs, etc.). He is then locked up in a mental institution for fifteen years, in which on the fateful night of October 30, 1978, he escapes! Thus bringing upon mass hysteria and mayhem as he stalks Laurie Strode, a high school baby sitter. It is the basis for most of todays slasher flicks unfortunately, but this was the first movie to use it and do it the best. Keeping in mind, that John Carpenter actually got the idea for this movie from Bob Clark's 'Black Christmas', the first actual slasher flick, he puts atmosphere and suspense to good use, instead of just throwing gallons of blood and guts in when ever some one gets a paper cut. And the climax is very good, it has left me wanting to see the second one now.

","+++++++ THIS COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS +++++++<br/><br/>John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is no doubt a very good horror/thriller product. Right from the start little Michael Myers brutal murder of his own sister in Halloween night is quite shocking; and years later as he escapes his psychiatric imprisonment and comes back to town for more savage killings the film sustains its high tension and interest all along.<br/><br/>My only complaint on this excellent film comes from the very end when Myers ""body"" disappears in a sort of supernatural focus after being shot no less than five times by Donald Pleasence from no more than 10 feet away and falling out from a balcony. What I mean is that when it turns into something supernatural, the story looses credibility and all the fear the film transmits during its running time -and it surely does- sort of looses a bit of impact. I think that either Michael killed or escaped alive would have made a better finale. <br/><br/>That aside, ""Halloween"" is indeed a very good picture in its genre and the first kick for all those teenagers-chased-by-mysterious-murderers products such as ""Prom Night"" and ""I Saw what You Did Last Summer"" as a couple of examples, none of which came out better than this one."

"martijn-56","10","1","2","3 December 2006"," The absolute very best in the genre
","The reason for my 10 out of 10 rating is that this movie is the archetype horror movie, or, to put it another way, the movie that set the standard for the genre itself. Time has shown that this first one could never be equalled, let alone surpassed. The reason for this is probably that everything that makes a good horror movie (and there are a lot of components that have to perfectly work together) is all present in Halloween 1978 to an almost perfect degree. To sum it up: -There is the excellent acting (esp. the 'sqream queen' JL Curtis)that really portraits fear in stead of merely hysterical teenagers that can make those movies almost ridiculous. Jamie Lee Curtis is totally convincing and an important factor in making the watcher believe that what he sees is real. That of course is what horror tries to achieve, but only rarely happens. The Blair Witch is one of the very few other examples. -There is the brilliant music (which was composed by Carpenter himself in only a weekend!) that does so much to help build up the nasty atmosphere. No other horror movie has used music so effectively to build up the atmosphere than this one. Possibly only The Thing comes close, but it took Ennio Morricone to do it! Some movies use music too much, let it overrule, but in this movie it is in total harmony with all that happens. -There is also the excellent camera-work. An example is the almost misty white mask of the evil Michael Myers in the dark house when Jamie get's stabbed from behind in the end. It makes him almost look nonhuman, alien, like an idea, which in fact he is, the 'evil'. The white that apart from being innocent, can in some cases (white shark) indeed be the face of death. -Also camera angles and effects are there that go almost unnoticed but are highly effective. An example is when Jamie walks with her school friends home. One by one they turn left to their houses, until Jamie is alone on the lane. Suddenly he stands there in front of her, human, not human? Evil himself? Jut as sudden as he is gone, she bumps into..not him, but a police officer. Or later, when Jamie is alone in a room in the house and looks out in the garden. There is an almost mysterious wind, laundry waving in it, and between the white of the blankets and the trees is Michael Myers again, or, as you almost think, not? It almost appeals to the possibility that Michael Myers might not even exist, only in her mind. - Build up of the tension. Probably the most difficult to achieve. In Halloween the tension is built up terrificly, and slowly mounts into an incredible climax in only the last 15 minutes, which are now legendary. The truth that this movie wants to make us believe, is that Michael Myers is human, but at the same time a devil, not human, supernatural. The way he keeps erecting, and disappears in the end, together with all the items I described above, what actually makes you buy it as well. That is an incredible feat, that we all know after laughing at almost any other horror movie we have seen since! This is a serious one that gets in your system!"

The person proceeds to walk up the stairway and picks up a mask From here on in you are introduced to one of the most creepy horrors ever made.<br/><br/>It is extremely difficult to define what films are ""pure horror"" and why over the last few decades' horror has become a repetitive and most importantly clichéd. Well we can thank Halloween (possibly Psycho or Suspiria) for that because Halloween created the slasher clichés before they became clichés. Halloween is the handbook on how to make the perfect horror film and it has succeeded at being one of the most effective films ever made.

Donald Pleasence the most famous of actors at the time creates one of the best horror heroes of all time and the fact he's different to what you'd expect a hero to be.<br/><br/>And then you've got Michael Myers, the horror icon that famously stalks victims in a white, oddly shaped mask similar to that of the later Scream. The fact that the mask is so simple is what makes it so creepy, it's as if it represents an evil energy and one that is un-stoppable. The truth is that all this was created from a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out and that's surely a unique and a genuinely surprising truth.<br/><br/>For an independent film that relied on a low budget, it's managed to do a lot more than any ""big buck"" Hollywood blockbuster has managed to do. The cheap feel helps create the cold, disturbing, creepy, pallid and un-nerving atmosphere. The uses of Kubrick style tracking shots fit in perfectly and create some of the most memorable pieces of camera work ever put on screen. The film's setting is perfect because it's a town just like any other and that makes it all the more realistic.<br/><br/>John Carpenter creates the perfect Hitchcock feel to the film and packed with references from Hitchcock films. The stairways sequence is the ultimate Psycho tribute. The film's use of shadow and the fact that even in the light of the day the terror remains alive. The first 50 minutes of the film are somewhat similar to the style of Strangers On A Train relying on setting up characters, having a hidden evil and general terror that could pop up at any moment. Carpenter is not just a director, but also an excellent musician and with the simplistic brilliance of his score he proves the fact he was a musical prodigy. In fact it remains one of the best scores ever written.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has always been one of my favourite directors ever who rarely fails to grab my attention with his unique style of film-making. He puts his love and care into his works and with the attention to detail he is a timeless director of his genre. Carpenter's respect to his favourite films and directors (most famously Howard Hawks) is worthy of approval.<br/><br/>Yes it's dated at times and maybe the script isn't as brilliant as it could have been, but Halloween still remains one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most nerve racking films ever made. A masterpiece of its genre, that has stood the test of time and remains just as effective today as it did in '78."

","On Halloween night in 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister with a carving knife and is subsequently locked up in a mental hospital. Fifteen years later to the day, he breaks out and returns to his hometown ...<br/><br/>John Carpenter and Debra Hill's Halloween is one of the greatest films ever made, and a peerless example of how to make a terrific movie from virtually nothing. It was made by a bunch of talented, enthusiastic kids who had very little money or equipment, hardly any experience, no famous actors, an absurdly thin script and an extremely tight schedule. Despite all this they made a modern classic which looks sensational, is deliriously scary and exhilarating and, despite being ripped-off by a thousand other movies since, still holds up nearly thirty years later as a fabulous fright flick. The simplicity of the film is its key strength; the hoary old tale of the escaped lunatic on the loose gives it a delicious creepiness and there are no complex explanations or subplots to drag it down - Michael is just the boogeyman, coming to get you ! Many critics have read all sorts of sociological meanings into it (Laurie doesn't get killed because she's chaste ! Michael is a physical manifestation of the town's social repression !) but all of that is hokum. It's High Noon in Horrorland - he's coming, he's coming, here he is !! What sends it into overdrive is the cinematic treatment, which is a textbook in visual and aural craftsmanship, the generation of suspense and atmosphere. The crucial dynamic in it is the forty minutes following Michael's escape at the end of the first reel to Annie's death - during this period, nothing really happens, and yet everything happens. On paper, some girls walk around their hometown, a guy follows them a bit and a worried psychiatrist meets the local sheriff; that should only be worth about five minutes of screen time, but what is really happening is terrific character development (Hill's girl-talk dialogue is great), physical mapping of the houses and spaces that become so crucial later, and a fabulous slow-burning build of tension. The almost unbearable suspense of the last half-hour is the payoff, and what a payoff - if you aren't hiding behind the couch or clutching your girlfriend then it's time you started ! The performances are wonderful - Curtis is the perfect smart girl next door, Pleasence is a masterful sinister narrator, building Michael into some hideous fiend in our minds before he's even done anything, Loomis and Soles are both adorable and Castle's creepy balletic movements as Michael / The Shape make him the definitive Psycho With A Knife. The young (he was thirty) Carpenter's direction is simply faultless, and his eerie 5/4-time piano music is one of the most memorable and effective film scores of all time. What more is there to say about this stunning movie ? If you're a horror fan, see it; if you're not, see it anyway and become one. Halloween became so popular (though not immediately) that it wins my vote for most influential picture of all time - aside from all the imitators and direct references to it (such as Wes Craven's Scream), many of the style elements have permeated through multiple layers of cinema. In virtually all Hollywood action movies for years it's been a cliché that the villain has to die three times (you think he's dead but no, he's up again), despite the fact that this never makes sense. They're all just copying Halloween (where it does make sense, because he's the boogeyman and you can't kill the boogeyman). If you're a movie geek, this film is bursting with trivia - the Cyphers character is named after the screenwriter of The Big Sleep, Haddonfield was the name of the town Hill grew up in, Carpenter does the voice of Loomis' unseen boyfriend, the killer was named after the British distributor of Assault On Precinct 13, the kids watch the 1951 version of The Thing on TV (which Carpenter later remade), and so on. I've never seen a movie that I would rate a perfect ten out of ten, but for sheer style, thrilling entertainment value and passionate commitment to film-making, this low-budget masterpiece is pretty damn close. I love movies, and I love Halloween."
"DavidSim240183","10","1","2","1 November 2006"," The original slasher film that frightened a generation
","Here is where it all began. Before it became milked to death. Before it became an extended cliché. One of the defining horror films of our generation. John Carpenter's classic Halloween.<br/><br/>The slasher film genre is something that has been hijacked by Hollywood. It's been done so frequently that it's become tedious. All shock tactics and no style. Occasionally we get one that surprises us. Like the superb Scream. It was a witty, cutting satire of the whole genre, deconstructing the clichés and expectations while telling a good horror story at the same time.<br/><br/>But back in 1978, nobody had ever heard of the slasher film. People didn't know it existed. Or knew what a verdant pasture there was to be mined. But John Carpenter knew it. And he managed to tap into that undiscovered world with an astonishing skill. Halloween was so ahead of its time. And is a far superior film to all the others who jumped on the bandwagon but failed to understand what made Halloween stand out as a classic.<br/><br/>Carpenter has set out to make a horror film. Through and through. Halloween is a film that's not about characterisation and depth. It's about scaring the living hell out of you. And making you realise that even in the heart of suburban normalcy, you're not always safe.<br/><br/>The character of Michael Myers is given such scant motivation. He never speaks. We never see the face behind his white mask. We know practically nothing about him. He exists as a physical manifestation of pure unadulterated evil.<br/><br/>The opening scenes are the most effective because they leave such a lasting impression. The opening credit sequence is quite absorbing. The image of a jack-o-lantern grinning evilly as the camera closes in on it. But the added bonus that helped propel Halloween to classic status is the wonderful backing music, composed by Carpenter himself. So effective because of its sheer simplicity. Striking the notes of two piano keys, it helps to establish a jarring mood from the onset that never lets up.<br/><br/>The next scene provides one of the most absorbing three minutes of suspense ever put on film. Something we wouldn't see again until Drew Barrymore's infamous stalk and slash job at the beginning of Scream. We see through the eyes of Michael Myers. We don't know it's him at first, but the brilliant camera-work allows us to experience exactly what he's experiencing. Watching the outside of a house. But slowly...ever so slowly the camera moves position to one of the windows. We see a couple of teenagers making out. Then with a shocking rapidity, the mask comes on. We see a jack-o-lantern on the porch so we know its Halloween. We continue to see through the eye-holes. There is something almost voyeuristic to this moment. The scene changes to inside the house. Slowly creeping up the stairs. Until the eyes lock upon the girl. Out comes the kitchen knife. And the rest is history. The final shocking moment comes when the killer is unmasked...and revealed to be a six-year old boy.<br/><br/>Back in 1978, that type of image would have been unthinkable. Its amazing Carpenter got away with it. But it works. And sets us up for the thrill-ride to come. Halloween was the film that discovered Jamie Lee Curtis. And she acquits herself quite admirably in her feature film debut. She makes the character of Laurie Strode quite an intelligent heroine. Someone who is far more interested in her studies than boys. She is also a caring and considerate person. Willing to put others before her own safety. Like towards the end when she's babysitting two kids. Rather than leave them to Michael's devices, she goes all out to save them.<br/><br/>Halloween is a film that takes some time to get going. For the most part, it waits a while. The camera angles are set up to appear like stalking movements. Like the image of Laurie in the background. And the image of Michael's shoulder in the foreground. Michael Myers is an ever present menace in this small town. Because Halloween was filmed on such a tight budget, it means they didn't have enough money to have extras on the streets. For example no trick or treaters. But that in actuality works in the film's favour. It creates a heightened sense of loneliness and isolation.<br/><br/>As night closes in, Michael's voyeuristic impulses begin to take on a life of their own. And he can no longer contain himself. One by one he starts slaughtering the promiscuous girls in town, leaving the virtuous Laurie left. There is a hidden subtext there about chastity surviving over promiscuity. Whether deliberate or not, it definitely feels that way. Something Scream made a point to comment on!<br/><br/>Halloween is also a film that has a sense of humour about itself. The image of a grinning jack-o-lantern crops up frequently throughout. Almost acting as silent witnesses to the events. Even Laurie is watching The Thing on TV, mirroring what is going on in the real world. And even the intervention of Donald Pleasence at the end turns convention on its head. Portrayed as a crackpot beforehand, he arrives as the cavalry to save the day.<br/><br/>Halloween is a film that works wonders. John Carpenter economises the budget restrictions and produces a taut, expertly paced horror show. They never should have bothered to make sequels. The wonderfully ambiguous ending would have been the perfect cap on events. But like with Freddy Krueger, the sequels only served to dilute the character of Michael Myers. The less we knew about him, the more fascinating and menacing he was. But still, the original Halloween is a master classic of horrific events, and a genuine perennial favourite every October 31st."
"mlraymond","9","1","2","24 October 2006"," Killer plays deadly tricks on All Hallows Eve
","I saw this movie several months after it had been on its first run in theaters. On the way home, I kept looking back over my shoulder as I walked down a very long, dark street similar to the ones that Michael Myers stalks in the movie. I knew logically that there wouldn't be a maniac in a white mask following me, but the impact of the movie was strong enough to cause that kind of fear, however unrealistic. I think this movie is a modern classic, even if flawed. There are plenty of holes in the plot and unexplained details and down right impossibilities, but I think you have to see it not so literally to enjoy it. I think that Jamie Lee Curtis makes an astonishing debut here, having to carry a great part of the movie. I told friends at the time that it was clear she was a young actress headed for bigger things. There are good, strong performances from Donald Pleasence as the doctor and Charles Cyphers as the sheriff, and the teenage girls and their boyfriends are realistic and appealing. In fact, I think that's a lot of what gives the film its power to terrorize even after repeated viewings: Carpenter makes us care about these young people and get to know them SPOILERS AHEAD: before they are brutally killed, and the powerful sense of loss is overwhelming when Laurie discovers the bodies of all three of her friends displayed as a ghastly Halloween joke. There is a real feeling of the grief and shock felt by Laurie, followed by genuine terror as she realizes the killer is coming after her next. Carpenter is very effective at capturing that feeling of fun and excitement, mixed with the possibility of actual danger, that many of us can recall from our own childhood trick or treating adventures. One of the most unsettling aspects of the movie, that helps to make it really creepy, is the realization that all of his dreadful actions are clearly seen as 'fun' by Michael Myers, including the theft of his sister's gravestone and dressing up in a ghost sheet and his latest victim's eyeglasses before killing his next victim. The fact of his inscrutable silence and that we have little, if any ,clue as to what makes him do what he does is seen as a weakness by many viewers, but others feel that his very inexplicability and apparently random attacks on people he doesn't know is what makes the movie so frightening. Perhaps Dr. Loomis is right when he argues with the nurse at the beginning and she objects to his use of the word "" it"" to describe Michael Myers, and when he later tells the sheriff "" This isn't a man."" Who or whatever he may be, Michael Myers occupies a special place in the pantheon of movie villains, and Halloween remains a tight, spooky little thriller that has lost little of its power to scare viewers over the years."
"fmarkland32","10","1","2","24 October 2006"," Do fear the reaper...
","Halloween is usually remembered as a fun time for trick-or-treating, watching scary movies and basically all sort of festivities but in Haddonfield, an escaped murderer has escaped from an asylum and now he's going to paint the town red. Unless Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) can stop the seemingly invincible killer. Jamie Lee Curtis is the goody-goody teenager who is the killer's number 1 target. There are many reasons why I give this movie a four star rating and give Friday The 13th only a 2 star rating. The reason is because Halloween represents the ultimate slasher flick build around suspense and letting your imagination picture what happens before it actually does. Friday The 13th on the other hand is just splatter used to mortify and contains only passable suspense. However Halloween has aged very well as the 70's vibe has actually created a more gritty film that is somehow more creepy. The movie itself isn't scary because I've seen too many slasher films to remain disturbed after the film however Halloween is extremely suspenseful and offers pretty much everything you could want from a scary movie. John Carpenter's score adds tension to an already suspenseful movie.<br/><br/>**** out of 4-(Excellent, Must See!)"
"MarieGabrielle","9","1","2","24 October 2006"," The first, and best....
","There is something to be said for cult films. While I haven't liked all of John Carpenter's later films (especially ""Escape from L.A."", but also I had a problem with Kurt Russel in that movie). This film, plus Donald Pleasence and Jaime Lee Curtis equals good entertainment.<br/><br/>Jaime Lee Curtis and P.J. Soles (also from ""Carrie"") are being followed by Michael Myers, who we see as a young child, committed murder on Halloween (or Sam-ha-in, as the psychiatrist/Donald Pleasence calls it) The film was shot in South Pasadena, yet is supposed to be Haddonfield Illinois. The art department worked overtime creating autumn and an ominous environment to complete the setting.<br/><br/>It is a basic slasher film that doesn't rely on cheap tricks and special effects, unlike the later films. It is horror/suspense at its best. A must see for Halloween. 9/10."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","10","1","2","19 October 2006"," An atmospheric slasher movie
","A young boy viciously murders his sister and is sent to an insane asylum for it. Years later he breaks out and returns to the same neighborhood on Halloween where he begins to stalk three teenage girls. The doctor who supervised him in the institution is hot on his tail and determined to stop him.<br/><br/>It must have been around 1980 when ""Friday the 13th"" came out and slasher movies literally turned slasher. Big knives, lots of blood, and by now the genre is almost a parody of itself. Wes Craven's ""Scream"" literally turned the genre on it's head, by having the victims trying to survive by obeying the ""laws"" and trends in slasher flicks. This film came out in before the blood and guts craze and in watching it you can easily see that. Not that blood and guts aren't good in a horror film like this, but when they are at the expense of atmosphere, loads of gore never help.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has always been a horror director who heavily limits his carnage but focuses on creating unease and tension in the mood which is the real thing that scares you. Gore can only accentuate certain scenes and add some shock, but it is just icing on top of a cake. Here the empty streets, shadows, and that haunting theme make a for a terrific horror atmosphere. And it scary because it seems real. Nothing is excessively over done, the pacing is great - the film basically takes place over the course of one day, with flashbacks - and the ending is one of the best chillers out there. Too bad that all the sequels came out as this is the first and without any question the best in the series and one of the best ""killer on the loose"" movies ever made. 10/10<br/><br/>Rated R for horror violence"

","By Hitchcock's shadow, I mean that Halloween is almost a tribute to Hitchcock. It refers to Hitch's movies but it is a whole other thing much like your shadow.<br/><br/>Halloween is a simple movie to follow, which makes it easy to watch, but hard to forget. A group of teens babysit on Halloween and are killed off one by one by Michael Myers AKA The Shape. Myers killed his sister when he was six, which leads to several murders and even more sequels.<br/><br/>Don't worry. Though there is violence, there is NO gore, heck, there is no blood. So we aren't left with a seizor inducing murder like in Suspiria. The killings are simple but very effective, because the genius music makes us tense as heck.<br/><br/>10-10: There's nothing wrong with this movie. A definite Halloween classic."
"jed-estes","9","1","2","28 August 2006"," Good, But Overrated.
","I love Halloween and all of it's sequels, but I am tired of everyone acting like this is the end all be all of the horror genre, because it's just not true. Everything in this film that is supposed to be so original had been done before and in most cases much better. Look at Black Christmas were the dolly shot was first pioneered, Blood Feast and Psycho, where some of the first slashers came out to play. See also the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Last House on the Left, and The Hills Have Eyes, for all of you people who say that Halloween was the first to be instrumental in bringing the modern wave of horror to America. I also hate it when John Carpenter acts like no one else can possible make a movie as great as him. You know what Rick Rosanthal's Halloween II, it's a better movie and it should be the one that is praised. Yeah I said it Halloween II is the better movie, and John Carpenter needs to get off his high horse and stop bad mouthing his legacy. Halloween is just a very, very slow paced independent movie that was lucky because it had a soulless producer named Moustpha Akkad who in later years would destroy every thing he worked so hard to build with Halloween H-2-0. To add to that he also never admitted it. I can say never because he's dead now (Which I am sorry for, when he died it felt like the Joker died, he was my enemy, and I miss him.)<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong. Just because I went on this rant does not mean that I do not have an affection for this little film. I just wish people would stop acting like it's the Beetles and maybe see that it's a little more like the Rolling Stones (It will never die.) I also in fact do love John Carpenter I just feel that he tries excessively to go out of his way and put down this series, and toot his own horn. I feel that his films Dark Star, Assualt on Precinct 13, Escape From New York, The Thing, and They Live are all better indications of his style. Why can he not be known for those films, and not for this film that is it's self a knock off, however a decent knock off. If you want to see real horror watch Halloween II (which Carpenter wrote but did not direct) and stay away from this dull first installment unless you just want to see where Michael started.<br/><br/>It should also not go without mentioning that Donald Plesance rules in this just like everything else he does and he is the true spirit of the Halloween series (Not Carpenter, Curtis, or even Micheal Myeres can take that title away from him!!!)"

It's a one of a kind horror film. Halloween was shot on a very low budget and over just 20 days. It opens with a bang, and is constantly filled with action throughout, strapping viewers to their seats. <br/><br/>There is some great acting in the film. Jamie Lee Curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, Laurie Strode. She is an intended victim worth rooting for, however, it is Donald Pleasance who steals the show. His portrayal of the good doctor who has a strong intent to stop Michael from killing innocent bystanders, gave viewers hope for Laurie's slim chance for survival. He was the only character in the film that understood how evil Michael was. <br/><br/>Halloween does something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. Carpenter sets up the relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. Viewers never get a good glimpse at Michael, making him seem dangerous and powerful<br/><br/>Carpenter used a haunting score, creepy lighting techniques to write and directed a tightly pieced suspense film. He also created a grainy feel to the movie, making it seem creepier. Carpenter makes excellent use of shadows and dark skies. It's not totally flawless, but overall, it makes a solid impact to viewers.<br/><br/>I recommend all daring teenagers and young adults, with enough bravery, to view this vigorous, chilling film. Its adult rating however, restricts only 18+ to watch it. It's a perfect movie to watch on a stormy night when you feel like having a terror-ific evening."

The film builds in suspense with the fantastic moment in the car when Dr Loomis and the Nurse are talking about Micheal's history to the menacing shots of Micheal (wearing that iconic mask) just standing, watching...and breathing. Donald Pleasance hones the art of frustration in getting somebody, anybody, to believe him that pure evil is on it's way and only when the bodies pile up will he taken seriously, however, it's then too late...<br/><br/>Sure, John Carpenter's career has stalled in recent years but looking back this is surely proof positive that a horror film can be dubbed a ""masterpiece""."

When Bob's girlfriend was strangled when she tried to call Laurie, and Laurie is unaware of that. I liked the part where Laurie stabbed Myers with one of the knitting needles when he attacked her.

","Of course, here we have the original slasher movie, the one where countless imitators started popping up after.

Jamie Lee Curtis is of course, The Girl in Peril who for unknown reason (at least until the later sequels) An Unknown Killer Is After Her. And of course, if her friends get in the way, well, I'm sorry, but they'll just have to go! I was quite surprised at this as the body count is quite low (4) and the violence is quite tame. I guess it's one of those things where your memory suggests that this movie is much more gruesome then it actually is, and I do believe that contributes to it's success. Nowadays (going into my old fogey pose) the horror movies aren't made like this! Sometimes you gotta say, is to keep it simple, stupid.

","This is a very good and suspenseful film who's reputation is slightly disturbed by the fact that it inspired several lesser efforts by creating the slasher genre. The minor problem that I could predict everything since the formula is so well known held this movie back from a perfect score. Not that this is the fault of the movie, but the other lesser slasher films. But just knowing that this movie pretty much invented a genre makes me admire it on its own. But ""Halloween"" still has many scenes that are original, different, and most importantly, SCARY. Carpenter slowly shows more and more of adult Michael Myers in each scene, first starting from a point of view shot, then a man seen from a distance, then a pair of hands, until he is completely revealed in all his terrifying glory. Carpenter also is a master of tension,where in some scenes I look around to make sure I am alone.

","""Halloween"" is by far the most genre defining classic horror film of the modern age. I first saw the film probably in the mid 80's when I was still young, this is a special film to me for two reasons one it was released in 1978 the year I was born, and second it was one of the first horror films I saw. Good story here for a horror film, you have Michael Myers escaped mental patient who after being away for years, returns home to his Midwestern town on Halloween night to terrorize the town as a psychotic murderer. This time Michael focuses his attention mostly on young teenage girls, a hobby he still remembers from the murder of his sister years ago. This film introduces us to scream-queen and later Hollywood legend Jamie Lee Curtis who is terrific as baby sitter Laurie Strode, one of the few that gets to stay alive! Donald Pleasence is great as the determined but yet worried Dr. Loomis who tracks Michael's every move! Also John Carpenter must be given most of the credit for the way he directed this film with the camera angles, and his use of dark shadows and the way he hides Michael Myers around corners, it's what you can't see that frightens, then no look out he comes out of the darkness! Most of the music and the score of the film is great, probably one of the best for a horror film. The score is pulsating from start to finish which was done by John Carpenter himself this music just gets under your skin. Watching this film thru the years it was finally good to get the 25th anniversary edition on DVD, the special features disc is good with information many didn't know. You find things out like the film was done in California even though portrayed in Illinois, plus Carpenter's father was music department director at Western Kentucky University, and finally just how cheap the Michael Myers mask cost! John Carpenter changed the shape of terror forever believe me this is why many young girls will not baby sit today! Also many horror films have tried to mimic this but have failed, this is simply and always will be the granddaddy of horror flicks of the modern day, a timeless classic that will never get old."

I just thought how clever were the writers and director at creating suspense and terror with minimal blood and gore. Halloween still remains one of the scariest movies of all time, the original and best of the franchise, a classic! Just forget about the poorer sequels! Some of them really ruined the story, but thats enough about them! I'd recommend this film to anyone who hasn't seen it already, go buy it it'll be worth it!"
"Horror-Lord","9","1","2","24 February 2006"," A fantastic Horror Slasher
","This is, by far, one of the greatest horror films of all time. It has everything from fantastic acting in the forms of Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis to suspense and gore as, slowly but surely, Michael Myers- a crazed psychopath- butchers his way through a group of unsuspecting teenagers. Be warned: This is NOT like Scream or Friday the 13th. It has some top notch acting and a gripping storyline that is slowly peeled like an onion, until revealing its shocking core, a twist that will leave you reeling for more! If I was to suggest one film to you this year, it would be this as it is so excellent. And, its sequels aren't too bad either to be truthfully honest."
"ashleywincer","10","1","2","6 February 2006"," The last comment raises some good points..
","The last comment mentioned brought up a good point regarding the low budget side of Halloween. How is it that the low budget horror films of the 70s and 80s have had more success over time than the big budget Hollywood horrors of the 90s? All of the successful films of the 70s and 80s were made not only on low budgets, but also were one of the film makers first few films they made. Not only Halloween, but also Texas Chainsaw massacre, and Friday 13th. I'm sure there are more. Is it possible these films were successful because the film makers were in it to make films and not money? Why are todays horror movies from major Hollywood studios lousy? I do not know the exact answer, and there are probably different reasons for it. I recommend watching low budget horror movies made by no name small production companies that recruit actors that are not known in Hollywood. Thats where I look for good horror films."

","This movie scared the daylights out of me and in turn I developed a major crush on Jamie Lee Curtis! The creepy music added greatly to the scare factor of this film. I may be wrong but I don't think you ever had a film with such intense killing before. All the ""Nightmare on Elm Streets"" and ""Friday the 13th's"" came after this movie. As for all the copy cats, even their own sequels and prequels to ""Halloween"" never came close to the original for sheer terror in your movie seat. You could probably equate it to ""Physcho"" in originality for its time. Having a killer not able to be killed was very unexpected. Unfortunately, it's lost some of it's original freight due to the times we live in along with the abundance of movies that try and out-due each other gore for gore."

And another thing that makes this a terrifying movie is all the shots and camera angles of the killer. I never saw this movie for the longest time, but after I got done watching it I slapped myself for putting it off for so long.

"Egg_MacGuffin","10","1","2","26 March 2005"," An absolute classic of the horror genre
","It's really a shame that nobody working today can make a film as simple and as effective as Halloween.<br/><br/>It's simple: Crazed lunatic breaks out of a mental institution and starts killing random people.* His doctor follows him for the whole movie while the psychopath follows a babysitter and kills some people in the process.<br/><br/>In Halloween, there's no cgi special effects, no elaborate backstory*, no extensive shots of blood and gore and viscera and body dismemberment. Halloween succeeds on a purely cinematic level, using music, lighting, and the camera to scare you. Sure, there's some (as Carpenter calls them)""fun-house"" scares, where something jumps out of the darkness at a certain point to make you jump, but the effect is not over-used like in today's horror films.<br/><br/>John Carpenter not only wrote the film and directed it, but he also wrote all the music for it, too. And if anybody knows Halloween, then know the music. Not only the main theme, but EVERY piece of music is amazing. The main theme, however, would probably still remain scary if placed in a Disney film.<br/><br/>Special mention is needed for the superb job with lighting and cinematography. I have never seen another film in which daytime seemed as frightful as in Halloween.<br/><br/>You might have noticed the two asterisks in the above paragraphs. I would like to stress the fact that all the sequel plots and backstories in the Halloween sequels were not written until AFTER the original film. In Hallwoeen (the original film), Michael is NOT related to Laurie. It was not written that way. Michael is NOT possessed by the curse of thorn. It was not written with that in mind, either. When you watch the original film, you take what you get. Michael is killing random people for no reason at all. That's how it was written. And I must say...that's a hell of a lot more believable and a lot more scary than anything in any of the extremely inferior sequels."
"corynye-1","9","1","2","20 February 2005"," The Original Slasher
","The music. The mask. <br/><br/>It's the best slasher movie ever made and the first mainstream slasher movie that spawned a generation of imitations. Halloween singlehandedly started the trend of the unstoppable, teenage-hunting murderer in film and - regrettably - the sequel-after-sequel cash cow of slasher horror that we've witnessed from Friday 13th, a Nightmare on Elm Street and many others. But John Carpenter's original is the flagship. To this day, it's one of the most successful independent films of all-time. <br/><br/>Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), a prudish high school babysitter feels like she's being stalked. And she's right. The person doing the stalking is none other than Michael Myers, an escaped killer who was sent to a detention center after stabbing his naked sister in her bedroom on Halloween, back when he was just a child. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) warned anyone who would listen that Myers was too evil for a minimum security facility, however doctors argued there was no ""diagnostic evidence"" to support Loomis' assertions. Now that Myers is on the loose, Loomis has to stop this maniacal killer before the body count gets too high.<br/><br/>Halloween takes place in a middle class suburban community called Haddonfield, Illinois. This setting and its characters might have been a large factor in the film's success because it looks and feels like YOUR town. The main character Laurie is also a very likable, modest girl that you truly wouldn't want to see get harmed. <br/><br/>Halloween doesn't hit home runs with gore or action, but rather suspense. It's not an overly violent film and may not appeal to younger generations that grew up on more blood and guts fright flicks. Those who appreciate great horror, great suspense and a higher degree of believability should enjoy watching this with the lights off."
"FrankBooth_DeLarge","9","1","2","26 January 2005"," A Classic, The Horror Film That Started It All
","In 1978, John Carpenter wrote, directed, produced, and wrote the score for Halloween. The movie didn't have any real famous actors in it during the time, and it only cost $325,000 to make. The critics looked at this film negatively, they didn't think anyone would like this new style of horror that we now call ""slasher films."" One critic looked at this movie and thought it was excellent, and soon the other critics re-reviewed it and also started to really like it. Soon, Halloween became a box office smash and for a while it was the most successful Independent film(it held this record until Pulp Fiction came out). Now, Halloween remains a horror classic that spawned many sequels and quickly started the ""slasher"" genre of horror.<br/><br/>(Spoilers) The movie starts in the 1960's, with a scene where we see through the eyes of 6 year old Michael Myers. He stabs his older sister to death, and ends up in a mental institution. The film picks up about twenty years later when Michael escapes from the mental institution and goes to his old town. In the town we see a group of high school students who are completely unaware that anything could go wrong in their peaceful town. However, everyone in the town knows the story of how Michael Myers killed his older sister and everyone thinks his now empty house is haunted by the ""boogeyman."" Michael's doctor(played by Donald Pleasance) tries to hunt down Michael Myers. Part of the scariness of the movie is when he is explaining how evil and dangerous Michael really is.<br/><br/>The elements in Halloween were new during it's time, but have been repeatedly used in other movies. Such as the villain targeting teenage girls, going into a car at night and having someone in the back seat waiting to kill you, or even going into a house, finding your friends corpses and then having the villain reach around the corner. These elements made a great and horrifying horror movie, but unfortunately today's generation won't be able to see this the same way because of rip off horror movies that make this seem like a cliché just as well.<br/><br/>Everyone who considers themselves to be a horror fan should see this to get the idea of where horror movies today got their inspiration from."

","I know this is the original slasher, but I don't think it's the best. (My favourite is Friday the 13th.) After the initial murder, you're kept hanging for the next. At least two thirds is without any killing, although you get many creepy glimpses of Mike. While this was effective, I was anxious for him to do something. His escape was good. Then he stalks. Finally it's night time. Slash time. I could certainly see the influence on Friday the 13th & others. Like Jason, Mike is silent, strong & surprising. There is no passion involved. The victims were the standard horny teenagers, heroine & cute kids. I just wish the bodies hadn't all been crammed into the third act. A useful blueprint though. 6/10"

","John Carpenter's first film is set in the sleepy town of Haddonfield. It tells of a person called Michael Myers who was locked away as a child for the brutal murder of his sister one Halloween night. Fifteen years later, he comes home to relive the killing again, and again, and again.<br/><br/>It's a deeply chilling film. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent in her first major role as the quiet, innocent Laurie, and Donald Pleasance of course is up to scratch and brilliant as Myers' psychiatrist. The music, composed and performed by Carpenter himself, is simplistic yet eerie. When you hear the first chord towards the end of the film you know that the terror is only just beginning.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Halloween, because the genre is of great interest to me. I enjoy that thrill in the film of knowing that evil exists, knowing it is out there, and wondering if it would come after you next.<br/><br/>It isn't popular with myself alone, of course. Halloween spawned a slightly ridiculous number of sequels and opened the portal into a whole new type of horror: the slasher. It inspired the creation of many other movie maniacs such as Freddy and Jason, however none of them invoke the same force of horror and dread that Halloween achieved.<br/><br/>So if you like horror and have yet to see this film then please do so.

"insomniac_rod","10","1","2","23 October 2004"," ""Halloween""'s importance: establishing most of the slasher rules.
","Often reffered as the ""greatest slasher movie of all time"", John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a basic element for the genre.<br/><br/>A lot has been discussed about ""Halloween""'s inspiration on 1974 slasher ""Black Christmas"". It has been said that John Carpenter's movie was meant to be a sequel to the 1974 cult classic but it has never been confirmed; but if you've seen both movies you will find many similarities. Also, it's been said that ""Halloween"" is the first slasher flick of all time. I won't even discuss about it. Those topics are very important for die hard fans of the movie and horror fans in general. In my opinion, the relevance of both topics consists in giving ""Halloween"" the place it deserves in the history of horror movies.<br/><br/>This movie surely inspired most of the 80's slasher movies and that's something to say. The Michael Myers character is an institution in the genre. John Carpenter is one of the most respected directors in the genre. The score for the movie is supreme and probably the most popular from the genre. Jamie Lee Curtis is to date the ""Scream Queen"" of the slasher movies. Donald Pleasence's character is also a role model and a necessary reference in EVERY slasher movie. The acting is excellent. Jamie Lee Curtis delivers a brilliant performance as she is extremely cute, beautiful, and knows how to scream and show fear. Donald Pleasence is also excellent. <br/><br/>Setting the standards was ""Halloween""'s most important accomplishment.<br/><br/>There's no gore but it isn't necessary here. That's probably the only ""rule"" that ""Halloween"" didn't establish as 1980's ""Friday the 13th"" started the whole gore in slasher flicks thing. <br/><br/>The storyline is simple but scary. Myers killed his 23 year old sister when he was 6; since then he's been a patient in a mental sanitarium until he escapes on Halloween night 1978. Nobody knows where he's heading neither what are his motives. Haddonfield, Illinois has a reason to fear. Meanwhile Laurie Strode has visions of a man dressed in black following her. She thinks it's her imagination but later in Halloween night the nightmare materializes. <br/><br/>The 3 deaths that the movie offers are simply great. There's so much suspense, tension, and the feeling of not knowing what's going to hapen that the scenes are truly scary. Myers looks scary as hell and the way he acts gives him a more menacing look. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" is an important part of horror cinema history and that's enough to own it. Witness the movie that started the craziness for masked killers, butcher knifes, frightening chasing scenes and much more.<br/><br/>10/10. -The first slasher movie to watch if you want to get into the genre. -The movie to watch at night when it's raining. -A basic movie for the genre, it gives a name to fear in movies."

","I'm not a very big fan of the horror genre in general. There are a few movies that I think are successful. Ironically, I think the Scream movies, which pay homage to this film, are far superior. I'm sure my credibility is gone now, but they at least accomplish their goals, which is more than I can say for this film. <br/><br/>Stupidity of the kind these characters exhibit is not found anywhere other than horror movies and short buses.<br/><br/>So many of the supposedly scary scenes could have been easily avoided by anyone with the brain power of your average squirrel. This made it difficult for me to feel anything other than frustrated. It's impossible to experience any fear when you're constantly shaking your head in disgust.<br/><br/>*Spoiler* For instance, when Jamie Lee stabs the killer and leaves him for dead, why the hell does she drop the knife right next to him. He's pulled this act before, just five minutes earlier, and she knows it. And why does she turn her back on him, nobody would do that. A normal person would take the knife and slit the guy's throat. This is supposed to be the movie's big moment and it's ruined by the ineptitude of a director who knows nothing about suspense.<br/><br/>Watching Psycho and ripping of Hitchcock does not make you a good director. I also love the way the doctor justifies not notifying the town's people that there is a psychotic killer on the loose. Sure, that would happen.<br/><br/>Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the best horror film of that era, no question."

It is here that John Carpenter successfully confounds us with the truth that this monster is a twenty one year old kid who brutally murdered his older sister when he was six and has returned to Haddonfield fifteen years later to relive that past crime over and over by stalking Jamie Lee Curtis and her sex mad friends and offing just about anyone, (or any animal, it must be said) that gets in his way.<br/><br/>Excellent performances from Curtis, Donald Pleasence, and the supporting players, plus a special mention for the actor/director Nick Castle who brought to life probably the most frightening bogeyman of them all.<br/><br/>On its own, Halloween plays as a one off, but its first sequel, Halloween II, is excellent and essential viewing as a worthy concluding companion.

"Gafke","Null","1","2","14 March 2004"," Classic Slasher
","Halloween, believe it or not, was not the first slasher film of it's kind. It was also not the last and continues to spawn imitators to this day.  Four years before ""Halloween"" was released, the slasher film ""Black Christmas"" came and went<br/><br/>without much notice, even though it boasted a more seasoned cast and a<br/><br/>slightly better budget.  So why was Halloween more popular than its<br/><br/>predecessor?  I don't know for sure, but I have a few theories.  #1  It has a great, catchy score going for it.  #2  It didn't take itself quite as dead-serious as Black Christmas did and provided more than a few laughs, and #3 SEX!!!  Halloween<br/><br/>may not have been the first slasher film, but, if memory serves me correctly, Halloween was the first slasher film to suggest a direct correlation between sex and death.  The point of Halloween seemed to be that young, sexually active<br/><br/>girls die and good, virginal girls live.<br/><br/>Michael Meyers, very much like Rhoda in ""The Bad Seed"" was just born bad. <br/><br/>He is six years old when he commits his first murder, stabbing his sister to death after she finishes having sex with her boyfriend.  Showing no remorse, or any other kind of emotion for that matter, Michael is locked away in an insane<br/><br/>asylum to await his 21st birthday, when he will stand trial for his crime. But on the eve of the trial, Michael escapes and heads home to Haddonfield. <br/><br/>
No reason is ever given for Michael's urge to kill, nor is it explained (in the first movie, anyway) why he chooses the three main targets of the film; Annie, Linda and Laurie.  Laurie is the good girl, the plain Jane with a brain wallflower played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  Her two friends, Annie and Linda, are far more popular, better dressed and more confident, and seem to like having Laurie around if<br/><br/>only to make themselves look even better.  Both have boyfriends and are<br/><br/>sexually active.  Laurie is a little afraid of boys, and this may be what saves her. She is suspicious of the mysterious man who seems to be following her and her friends around, but her friends never take the threat seriously.  For them, the shadowy form of Michael is either a potentially cute guy to flirt with, or a creep who needs to ""buzz off.""  Linda and Annie never consider the danger.  Laurie<br/><br/>does, and she is on the alert for the rest of the night.  Annie is the first to die, after stripping down to her underwear in front of the window and having a<br/><br/>sexually explicit phone call with her boyfriend, whom she is on her way to pick up when she is murdered.  Linda drinks beer and has sex with her boyfriend in the parents bedroom, and even flirts with Michael (thinking he is her boyfriend in a ghost costume) brazenly baring her breasts.  Her boyfriend is stabbed to<br/><br/>death, she is strangled, and Laurie, left alone across the street, is next. <br/><br/>
Laurie, shy and afraid of men as she is, cannot seem to fight back at first. She runs, screaming for help after finding the dead bodies of her murdered friends. But when no one will help her, she learns she must help herself if she wants to live.  Her maternal instincts kick in when the killer invades the house where she is babysitting two small children.  Laurie screams and whines and doesn't<br/><br/>always use good judgment (and, compared to today's butt-kicking heroines, she seems pretty wimpy and spineless) but she manages to fend off her attacker<br/><br/>long enough for help (in the form of Dr. Loomis - Donald Pleasance) to arrive. Laurie has survived, but the boogeyman is not dead.  She will have to be<br/><br/>stronger next time.<br/><br/>Halloween showed us what happens when young adults engage in premarital<br/><br/>sex, the consumption of alcohol and marijuana and attitudes which suggest that they are too big for their britches.  But it's also just a good, scary little film to watch with the lights off, if you're not one to be bothered with pseudo- psychological insights.  Michael Meyers is a dark angel of judgment and death, making examples of Linda and Annie and pushing Laurie back into her place. <br/><br/>Laurie, who chokes and coughs over a joint that Annie has no problem with,<br/><br/>now understands; she is not meant to fit in with That Crowd.  She has been<br/><br/>singled out forever, and now sees the danger that awaits her there. <br/><br/>
Halloween is a classic of the genre and should not be missed by  horror fans. No excuses: you cannot call yourself a true fan of horror until you've seen this film.  Michael Meyers has indeed achieved immortality, right up there with<br/><br/>Jason, Freddy, Pinhead and many others.  He will never die, and neither will the impact this film made on history."

","Halloween has inspired so many clones, rip-offs, and inferior sequels (i.e. Resurrection...the horror, oh the horror) that there is absolutely no denying its impact, not just on the slasher genre but on horror films in general.  It's incredibly atmospheric, always keeps up an ominous tension throughout, and the characters are realistically portrayed (well, Sam Loomis is sort of larger-than-life and endowed with a theatrical grace, but in a good way, thank you Donald).  Although slasher flicks now are obsessed with body counts and gore (doesn't really bother me, but hey!) Halloween is probably the only slasher that both fans and non-fans of the genre can enjoy.  This is a superb movie, period.  The way Michael Myers moves, tilts his head after every kill as if studying his victim's death twitches with some sort of morbid fascination...it's chilling.  The music is ambient and simplistic, underscoring the non-convoluted and straightforward, malevolent way Myers goes about ending the lives of everyone close to Laurie Strode (beautiful acting by Jamie Lee Curtis).  And the ending is nightmarish and jarring, leaving the viewer's mouth gaping wide open with shock, but only if it hasn't already been spoiled before you see it!<br/><br/>Director John Carpenter was at his prime in the late 70s and early 80s.  His work today pales in comparison to his brilliant early films, which is probably why a Halloween remake is (apparently) in the works.

","All out my favorite slasher movie of all time.  I've seen it too many times to count.<br/><br/>Halloween delivers as the first major slasher (Michael Myers) hits Haddonfield, IL like an A Bomb.  <br/><br/>John Carpenter's score, story and innovative direction (along with camera work)leaves the audience glued to screen.  Donald Pleasance gives a command performance as Dr. Sam Loomis and Jamie Lee Curtis hits the mark as the tortured baby sitter Laurie Strode.  There really isn't a weakness in this great horror movie.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  9/10."
"MF210","9","1","2","18 August 2003"," A Horror Classic
","Halloween is to Jamie Lee Curtis as Alien is to most of its cast.Both of these movies were career starters, and they came out in consecutive years. Both movies also started careers for their directors. In my opinion, Halloween is the better film though.<br/><br/>John Carpenter is usually regarded as a hit or miss director. He wasnt that successful in the 90s. Village of the Damned and Vampires were eaten alive by critics. His recent movie, Ghost Of Mars got absolutely horrible reviews. Besides the other three movies I have mentioned, I saw his version of Stephen King's Christine which I believe to be kind of underrated. But whatever he has done or will do in the near future will never beat this Horror Classic.<br/><br/>The acting is actually pretty good. Jamie Lee Curtis is very believable as Laurie Strode. Donald Pleasence does a solid job. Lauries friends(forgot the actresses names) do solid jobs too.<br/><br/>One element of Halloween that may be a bit underappreciated is the dialogue. Some may find the dialogue a little lame. But I think the dialogue fits the characters perfectly. Laurie's dialogue is more intelligent than her friends because basically she is more intelligent than her two friends. They both have kind of airheadish dialogue (especially Linda).<br/><br/>Other features notable of Halloween are its music. Its actually quite memorable music. It gets more climatic and eventually ends when Michael has killed his victims.<br/><br/>Some critics and moviegoers may compare Halloween to Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho and actually may say that it is better. While I dont happen to think it is better, it is a very good movie.<br/><br/>The one flaw in Halloween is that in someway its a little too similar to Psycho. Im not sure how, its just afeeling. For that I cannot give it a 10.<br/><br/>Overall, Halloween is definitely worth a 9 out of 10."

Another unmemorable film that made a killing at the box office.

I thought Jamie Curtis gave a terrific performance, though most people are annoyed by her constant screaming. You can really feel simpathy for her character as for the numerous sequels, all I can say is that they were probably just made for profit and probably won't be entertaining to most viewers."

","John Carpenter wrote and produced (with Debra Hill) and directed the first slasher film on a shoestring budget about a six-year-old boy named Michael Myers who murdered his teenage sister and is placed in an asylum for fifteen years.  On Halloween, 1978, he escapes and returns to his hometown to stalk and slash. His doctor (Donald Pleasence) goes after him and tries to save the peaceful town of Haddonfield, Illinois.  Jamie Lee Curtis makes her film debut as one of the victims who successfully defends herself.  Fun slasher film delivers plenty of suspense, unlike its sequels and countless clones. Carpenter also composed the creepy score.  My evaluation: *** out of ****."

","I'm not here to toot my own horn (my neck isn't long enough), but, if you look real close, I think you'll find that Yours Truly was the first person in this country to praise HALLOWEEN in print (way back in Famous Monsters of Filmland #155, I believe it was). I felt then (and still feel today) that it's one of the finest supernatural suspense dramas ever lensed. The premise is simple but effective and John Carpenter, by focusing closely on his cast of characters, manages to evoke edge-of-your-seat suspense from beginning to end (it helps that his characters are believable, and sympathetic); his chilling score only serves to (quite literally) underscore that effectiveness. The HALLOWEEN ""formula"" is relatively simple: put sympathetic, well-drawn characters in jeopardy, and you're halfway home (something the makers of the plethora of slasher films that followed in its wake didn't seem to be capable of doing). HALLOWEEN has been ripped off more than any other film I know of, but remains the unequaled original."

"LagerLagerLagerShouting","10","1","2","22 July 2001"," Horror At Its Finest
","The greatest horror film ever made, John Carpenter's classic is a masterclass in suspense driven terror and resourceful film-making. Made on a shoestring budget of $300,000 it become the most successful independent film of all time and its easy to see why. Carpenter's masterful use of the Panaglide camera creates an atmosphere of unease as it stalks around the prey of serial killer Michael Myers. The framing is brilliantly dynamic; characters remain in darkness as the shape repeatedly interupts the frame to create sudden moments of terror and the claustrophopia closes in as the film progresses, culminating in a behind-the-sofa climax as the revelation of the ultimate personification of evil becomes apparent. Michael Myers becomes an iconic killer, the symbol of a serial killer that middle America had feared through growing media speculation since the 1950's and this coupled with Donald Pleasence's Dr Loomis as the oracle, and Jamie Lee Curtis' virginal but strong heroine Laurie you have the influential makings of the contemporary slasher.<br/><br/>Quite simply if you don't like horror you don't appreciate how groundbreaking and masterful this film is. If you want a pointless,run-of-the-mill slasher watch Friday the 13th, if you want an imaginative, brilliantly made film that delves deep into the human psyche, which also contains the most haunting score ever committed to celluloid then watch Halloween, the pinnacle of the horror genre.<br/><br/>10/10"
"mord39","Null","1","2","10 October 2000"," It's good, but not THAT good
","MORD39 RATING:  ***  out of  ****<br/><br/>This is a good horror movie, but it's NOT great, nor is it the ""best horror film of all time"". I think its reputation has gotten a bit out of control lately, and here's why:<br/><br/>First, there isn't much going on during the film and when the shocks arrive they aren't that sensational after so many years and clones to this slasher pic. I think HALLOWEEN is the unfortunate victim of too many rip-offs blunting its sharp edge. It now looks like just another one of its own knock-off's.<br/><br/>Where I feel the film is effective is in its atmosphere; you really get that ""Halloween Time"" feeling, and it seems just like Fall. Michael Myers is a chilling presence as well, at least in the first couple of films.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence is priceless as the obsessed doctor who wants to keep Michael locked up for everyone's own good. He is vital to the success and classic status this film continues to enjoy.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is way too mature-looking to be convincing as a school girl, but she delivers when the time comes to be frightened out of her wits.<br/><br/>The music is one of the best ever created for a horror film, even though I think it was copied from THE EXORCIST'S ""Tubular Bells"" a little.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's direction is nice, and he knows what to do to set up scary shots. But he's not quite Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>-Which leads me to my final point: HALLOWEEN isn't the first true slasher movie; that honor goes to a movie made nearly twenty years earlier....it's called PSYCHO."

It is very hard to see how such a dull film has come to be regarded as a horror classic."

"refinedsugar","9","1","2","25 July 2000"," Often imitated, never duplicated.
","Halloween for it's time and place was undoubtedly memorable, but for as far as horror films and the genre itself go, it was groundbreaking. Who could have known it would end up reinventing the word 'suspense' and wake up the long dormant genre that was stuck in a dismal state too. It's no word of a lie to say today many movies owe their existence to Halloween. It was the first of it's breed. It had all the right ingredients and it came at the right time. People were waiting to be scared and scared they soon would be. Featuring no gore (that would come soon enough), a real low budget, a great cast, atmosphere, it also held a story that would prove to be both critically and financially successful. A story that at the heart of it was very simplistic and pretty straight forward. A psychopath whose tendencies lie dormant for many years escapes from the loony bin. His target - some pretty young babysitters. Now the tale of survival with sexual undertones wasn't new - it's an universal theme in horror - but it's simplistic nature in the hands of those who crafted and carried it turned out some fantastic magic. The cast, the direction and undoubtedly the music. Who can't remember that. It was all these factors that came together to make history.<br/><br/>Then remind yourself when it came out. Yep, the tail end of the 70's. Enter John Carpenter, a young director who had promise. Donald Pleasence, an English actor of some rebut who decided to work on the project because his daughter liked Carpenter's ""Assault On Prescient 13"". Then there was Jamie Lee Curtis. A virtual unknown who landed her first major role in part because her mother was Janet Leigh of Psycho fame. Then there was the talented crew behind the scenes that made it all happen - director of photography Dean Cundey, production designer Tommy Wallace, producer Debra Hill and the original shape himself, Nick Castle. <br/><br/>All on a budget of $200,000 US 1978 dollars. Perhaps there's a lesson to be learned here for the continuously overproduced, Hollywood flicks ... and again, the music! Who can't relate the success and scariness of the film to the music? The score by Carpenter was like the story - simple yet effective. Time may not have been friendly to Halloween as the years pass and that's about the only real negative remark I can offer other than in no small part did this film lead the way for a new type of horror. The slasher genre with the use of more and more gore unfortunately replacing actual suspense and fear. It was bound to happen and Halloween was the film to do it. It was only time (and not long) before a push towards more graphic horror would occur after Halloween's blockbuster success. Case in point, Halloween II.<br/><br/>Putting the rabid analyzing aside, Halloween is still a great movie today. A venerable classic of the horror genre that many films have tried to emulate on many levels, but Halloween will forever be in a class all it's own. Forgoing the never-ending series of lesser-returns sequels, there will only ever be the one and the only Halloween. A pinnacle in the horror genre and a great movie in it's own right."

","I'm getting quite desperate here. I love being scared, but the last few years I haven't seen a single movie that has actually scared me. Sure, some films really make me feel uneasy, e.g. ""The Exorcist"", ""The Shining"", ""Seven"", and ""The Hills Have Eyes"", but they do not scare me. At least not anymore. ""Halloween"" also fails to scare me. Sure, it has some shocking surprise scenes, but as I remember it there are only two or maybe three of those. And the whole film really doesn't get interesting until after an hour, so only the last 30 minutes or so are really intense. ""Halloween"" is of course much better than most of the horror films that were made in the late 70s and early 80s. It is better than ""Terror Train"" for instance, and it is better than the only other sequel to ""Halloween"" that I have seen; ""Halloween H20"". But unfortunately, that does not say much. The music to ""Halloween"" is brilliant, though. Absolutely brilliant."

","Before I even saw this movie I had practically made up my mind that it was going to be one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love well-constructed stories, especially ones that keep you on the edge of your seat, tensely wondering what's going to happen next.  After reading so many glowing reviews on this comment board, I knew Halloween would be the movie to end all movies.<br/><br/>I was wrong.  Maybe I built the movie up in my mind that no film could meet, but whatever the reason, this movie disappointed me.  Although it is nicely filmed with interesting camera angles, light and shadows, and good direction, it just isn't at all scary.  Yes, yes -- I know that we should look at it in the context of the time it was made in, etc., but it still didn't work.  The single most damaging thing to this movie's scare factor is the speed that Michael Myers walks.  He practically inches forward in every scene!  All he does is stiffly step forward with his knife held high.  If he were really that intent on killing, I think he would have a little more urgency in his step.  To see what I mean, watch The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br/><br/>At least Leatherface knows how to run, and it makes all the difference!  To see Michael walk so slowly makes it just look like a cheap excuse to give the heroine a chance to get away and make the movie last a little longer. Also, the touch of the supernatural at the end makes things even worse. It's much scarier to believe that Michael is a normal human being who has gone terribly wrong than to think that he has some type of magic powers.  In any event, watch it and decide for yourself.  It might not have worked for me, but apparently it worked for a lot of people here, so give it a try."

Being the ""brave"" teenager I put the movie in the VCR and pushed play. The music was so scary that it added so much to my reaction. After hearing the music I was creeped out, but couldn't tell anyone to turn it off for fear of being called a loser or something. I could barely sit through it. I did though and I can see how it is considered a ""classic"". I unfortunately have my own ""horror"" story connected with the film; after seeing it (I was 13 at the time) the next day when my parents arrived to pick me up I was looking over my shoulder and being more paranoid than ever. I eventually developed a fever from it and threw up and had to sleep with my mom that night. Even though I went through all that, I see that only a good movie can do that to you.

It's interesting that the adult Michael Myers really doesn't start killing until later in the movie. There isn't as much slashing in this slasher movie as most would expect.

","Sorry but all of you artsy fartsy posers who think the original was a horror masterpiece need to go take a cold reality shower. The 1st movie was nothing more than a art cliché. Many site the fact that Michael was mysterious as being profound and scary, well guess what cousins, it was done to death and back in books before the movie was ever conceived and the 1st movie was probably one of the few horror movies in the 80s that I was NOT afraid of. Mind you I was about 5 when I saw it. I didn't even know it was considered horror until I was much older. The imagery was stale, the suspense was yawn inducing that even as a child I couldn't watch it most nights out of boredom (it was being shown several times a week on channel 2 back in the day). Frankly, if you were scared of this, then any thriller of the time would have done the same to you.<br/><br/>The bottom line is keeping things 'mysterious' is a cheap cliché in itself and gutless discussion when it comes to movies. It is what a director or writer does when they know that they do not have a good story to tell or when they don't know how to tell a story. No different than a Michael Bay movie today. Don't have a story? Just avoid story and distract the viewer with something else. Some nudity here and there, sex talk, cheesy music (even then it was cheesy, for petes sake some of the best music in history came from that era), and some blood.<br/><br/>If I wanted no story, I would visit an art gallery and use my imagination to fill in the blanks. If I wanted more detail and deeper explanations, I will read a book. But when I go to a movie, I expect the writers and directors to have at least enough skill and guts, to try and tell a good story otherwise there is no point in making a 1.5 hour motion picture. Even if the story stinks, at least they try which is more than I can say about John Carpenters Halloween. Sorry but I am no fan.<br/><br/>For what its worth, back when I was 5 or 6, some movies did scare me. Poltergeist, The Exorcist, The Brood, and even Alien was scary to me. Jaws, and Piranha also got some adrenaline going. Hell even the original Blob from the 50's scared me more than Halloween."

I'm not crazy, just really bored. C'Mon, I live in Wisconson. So, on to explain my title. Horror geeks across the world know that the famous mask was a William Shatner mask. Legend has it, john carpenter painted it on a whim, and basically rushed through. I, however have a theory. Possibly, Michel myers' mask could be on purpose. Keep in mind that this comment focuses on the first film and no sequels of this film hold water. My theory is that little Micky was a Trekkie. Worst yet, I think he thought he was captain kirk. His sister must of let him in on the sad truth. That hard truth could only be the lack of toupee. Or it could have been another kid dressed as the potbellied captain who isn't a raving lunatic(or severe voyeur). Maybe his sister commented politely on his costume which sent him into a rage. Suddenly, in his eyes, a mustache appeared on her upper lip. Every one he see's from then on out bear the mark of the evil doppleganger so set forth by the annals of Trekdom. MORAL-dressing up like your favorite media character is fun for parties or kinky sex. But it can become a serious addiction. If you or someone you know thinks he's a star trek charter.

He's committed to a mental institution. 15 years later, on October 30, he escapes and returns to Haddonfield and starts stalking three teenage girls (Jamie Lee Curtis, P.J. Soles and Nancy Loomis). His doctor (Donald Pleasance) also comes looking for him...but can he stop him before he attacks the girls? <br/><br/>I saw this great film back in 1978 with an audience full of teenagers (I was 16 myself). How this film got an R rating is beyond me--there's only a few flashes of nudity, one instance of swearing, no sex shown (only under the sheets) and very little blood. I was very lucky to see this film when it first came out with no knowledge of it. By the end of the film I was downright terrified! The whole audience was rooting for Curtis to get away and went wild cheering when she thinks she killed him. This was the first horror film (that I know of) where the killer lived and got away at the end. I have never forgotten the chill that went up my spine at the end when you realize he's still alive and on the loose. <br/><br/>It was nothing new plot-wise but it was well-shot (beautiful Panavision images and director John Carpenter makes full use of his wide screen), reasonably well-acted (this was before Jamie Lee Curtis hit it big and she's somewhat awkward) and very VERY scary!<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** The bodies falling out of closets, Michael jumping up from behind a couch and sitting up when he's supposed to be dead were terrifying. I had nightmares that night over this! <br/><br/>Unfortunately most people now see this after seeing the countless inferior copycat films which stole many things from ""Halloween"" like: sex=death; a masked killer; no motivation from the killer (in ""Halloween"" it's suggested that Michael is the boogeyman but I always found that kind of silly). What those copycats left out was: likable characters; suspense; teenagers who talk and act like teenagers; scares; logic and lack of gore. Also you're rooting for the girls in this picture not the killer as you are in some others. AND the girls in this one fight back when the killer is after them. Curtis' one on one with Myers at the end is just great and terrifying. <br/><br/>A must-see classic. Wide-screen viewing is essential. Great music score too."

","This has been heralded as the most scary/influential/original/trend setting horror movie of all time by a many of horror enthusiasts.I disagree with all those claims except for maybe its influential claims.I first saw this at age 10 when it came out in the theaters {and have since watched it several times to try and see just what it is I'm missing} and back then it didn't scare me so it surely isn't gonna now ,30 years later.I like Carpenter films but this is my least favorite out of the numerous ones I've seen him direct.Not only is this a low budget film {which is fine by me as long as there are other elements that make up for it} ..but it is totally missing any substantial gore/character development/inventive storyline/thought provoking dialog/etc.etc..to make up for its low budget.Next to the Blair Witch Project..I consider Halloween to be the most overrated horror film of all time. The ending is undoubtedly the scariest part of the movie and thats where IMO, it also displays the most original ideas..unfortunately to get to that point,one must sit thru a lot of dumb teenagers walking to and from school on the sidewalk with Michael Myers being voyeuristic and watching this from a distance..fast forward the 1st hour and 20 minutes and watch the last 10-15 minutes..and thank me later..the time you will save by doing this means you could go to the gym and get a good work out in..your body will thank you later too :}"

","I really thought this movie would be a masterpiece, but I was wrong. Let's begin with Loomis, this man knows Michael Myers is dangerous, his car is robbed and he just never mention it to the police so the car could be easily found with the psychopath? So easy for Michael Myers just drive around the city, uhn? Then let's talk about Laurie, she sees a man following her, he's with a mask in front of her hause and she doesn't call the Sheriff? Which, by the way, is her friend's FATHER? Is she dumb? Why the characters in a horror movie must be so stupid? Why? And finally, Michael Myers, he's a person, a crazy serial killer, but yet a PERSON, and he's stabbed on the neck, takes five or six shots on the chest, falls from the second floor and doesn't die?

It's just incredibly boring and I have a hard time sitting through it. It's not that it wasn't thrilling at one point, just that I've seen too many movies much better than this for it to affect me in any way a good horror film should. Even at its most basic form as a work of entertainment and sadly when I feel a movie has failed at entertaining me in the slightest I feel it's failed at doing anything. Because that's a films job, first and foremost is to be entertaining to the audience. Bad movies can be bad but can still be a joy to watch.

"ashboomstick-50540","10","1","3","31 October 2018"," Halloween 1978 Review: Horror and Simplicity At It's Finest
","Its a dark night in Haddonfield, 1963 in more ways than one. No one in this compact suburban town could even begin to imagine the unspeakable terrors that would haunt Haddonfield for years to come. The fact that it all began on Halloween, 1963 with a small little boy named Michael Myers is part of the simplistic brilliance of the film. Just think about it! The films commencement includes the sound of children speaking in a monotone voice, amidst the simple image of a traditional 60s home. That's it! Yet, between the sound of the cheering children and the realization from the viewer that you are walking into a horror film, the average viewer will feel frightened and nervous about what's to come. By the time the scene ends, (only five minutes into the film) a six year old kid wearing a mask has murdered his sister, his parents have come home, and have found their son with a bloody knife in hand. These images are not confusing, they don't reveal a lot about what's happening or who anyone is, all we know is some little kid has brutally killed his sister. The fact that an event such as this could happen in actuality, and that the scene isn't drowning in confusion is what makes the scene so effective. This streak of simplicity that continues throughout the film, combined with the phenomenal performances from the main cast, and the haunting cinematography is part of what makes this film a classic.<br/><br/>The horror genre is always in desperate need of help. Questions frequently asked are, when is enough enough, when do supernatural elements become too confusing, and how much development should a character have? Halloween makes you care for it's characters, it has no supernatural elements, which is part of what makes it so effective, and it features barely any blood. These three things combine to make a much better film than if it featured a plethora of blood, one-domensional characters, and confusing supernatural subplots.<br/><br/>In the horror genre, it's always interesting to see how the director asked the director of photography to move the camera. Should the camera move slowly, without any movement to try to replicate a POV shot? Or maybe they should shake the camera excessively, which makes the viewers full of annoyance? Halloween does a little bit of POV wotk which is great, but the main type of cinematography that John Carpenter uses is what would now be considered the Steadicam. When this movie was being filmed, the Steadicam had not yet been invented, but a similar technique was used called the Panaglide. Throughout Halloween, the camera is constantly moving to show the fact that there are a multitude of different perspectives as to the sinister actions that are taking place. Many people walk outside when they hear something unusual, while the camera starts moving with the character. But the movement of this film's camera is unlike that of a dolly or film crane, which often moves too fast to actually be able to enjoy what you are witnessing. In this film, (even though this was during a time when the image was grainy) you can clearly make out what's what, which I can't always do in a modern action movie! This simplistic movement is an immense part of what makes this movie so effective.<br/><br/>Generally, the acting in horror films feel cheesy, generic and honestly, just a big hunk of meaningless crap. There's no better way to say it. However, for Halloween and a few others, I make an exception. The acting in this film makes you feel like you are in real life, watching real people talk about an evil maniac with a mask. The conversations between the characters, especially Donald Pleasance, are enjoyable because of the true range of emotion that these actors give in their performance. Pleasance really is what makes Halloween such a classic 40 years later. He's such an experienced actors, and gives several essential and brilliant monologues on evil, and Michael. The best thing about his performance is several of his conversations are incredibly to the point and (yes you guessed it) simple! Hell, you could give this guy a two page script to memorize about how to brush your teeth and it would be interesting. Why? Because of his knowledge, his impeccable use of words, and his cool voice. No one could ever surpass his radiance and intellect.<br/><br/>All of these topics have at least one thing in common. The cinematography, acting, and plot of the film are all done with attention and in a facile nature. Simple is always best, especially in the horror genre. Halloween has defined the true essence of the horror genre because of it's creation of teens getting stabbed to death, slasher killers, and a multitude of other horror tropes. This film is currently the brightest-shining star in the already bright world of horror movies. Welcome home Michael..."

One can see the standards it set for the specific genre, though I can't see it living up to the hype surrounding the almost glorified title: HALLOWEEN<br/><br/>The characters act dumb and almost in the opposite as any normal human being would; like the killer does. He has little to no background. As a viewer one can't find the motivation the killer has - or has not. <br/><br/>Spoiler down below:<br/><br/>The killer just walks around, slowly. Yea, I get the point: he's an unstoppable, almost mystical machine of death, but... there's no deeper point. It just doesn't make sense. It all leads to the movies climax, slowly.

"isaiahwilson15","9","1","3","20 October 2016"," The title says it all
","It's that time of the year. When the nights give off a different chill, the house seems to make creepy sounds, and the horror movie marathons begin. Now I am not in any way a fan of horror movies, but when Halloween season comes around, I can't help but sit down and watch a few of the so-called classics. While there were a number of movies that ended up being duds, there was one that truly caught my attention. Within the first 10 minutes, I knew that Halloween was a scary movie that deserved the full scary movie treatment, getting watched 12 o'clock at night in the pitch black. By the time the credits rolled, I was chilled to the point that finally made me realize why so many actually enjoy the feeling of terror. Halloween makes the most out of its very simple story and uses a number of creative filming techniques that results in a fantastic movie, and helped create Hollywood's greatest movie monster of all time. As you could guess, the film's greatest strength lies with its monster, Michael Myers. Myers is the perfect example of a character that benefits from simplicity. Everything from his non-existent motivations to his vague backstory and even the characters unsettling design comes together to form a character that's just downright terrifying. Then there's also the interesting cast of characters each with different intentions. There are the stupid horny teenagers, the smart responsible teachers, and the doctor who ties everything together. The movie does a great job playing off these different characters, and throughout the movie, each character ends up getting what they deserve. All in all, it's easy to see why Halloween is the archetype for modern day horror movies. Everything from the setting to characters to Michael Myers himself has that creepy factor. Combine that with a couple of camera tricks that result in some of the best jump scares I have ever scene, and you have a movie that encompasses everything Halloween."
"brchthethird","9","1","3","14 November 2014"," The gold standard for slasher films
","If PSYCHO is the prototypical slasher film then HALLOWEEN is the blueprint and set the standard for all that followed. You have John Carpenter in top form, creating one of the best, if not the best, slasher film ever. Of note is the creepy piano/synth score by John Carpenter which, in addition to the impressive cinematography, helps maintain an atmosphere of tension and dread. He also makes excellent use of location to create a sense of claustrophobia, particularly in a closet scene where Laurie is trying to hide from The Shape. However, there are a few things that keep this from being a perfect film. First, the acting from most of the principle cast is marginal at best, with Donald Pleasence and Jamie Lee Curtis being notable exceptions. Still, Donald Pleasence isn't given too much to do as Loomis because his character is woefully underwritten. He is meant to be the link between the Michael of the past and the Shape of the present, but he mostly shows up to provide exposition and nab the bad guy in the end. Still, I'd say this is one of the best horror movies ever made and definitely the best in the Halloween series. It's a movie that defined a genre and continues to bear the standard for it."
"get_bh0235","10","1","3","19 July 2014"," The Beginning is always the best part
","Halloween is considered by many including myself, to be the greatest slasher of all time, Allot of imitators followed throughout the 80's. Allot of the Imitators failed in capturing what Halloween was all about. However one or two found there place Such as Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm St. like Halloween they created their own style while taking notes from older movies. I saw Halloween: H20, it being my first ever Horror movie I was 12 at the time and loved every second of it. My best friend slept over that night and I watched it again this time with him and he fell in love with it just as I had. I knew there were other movies that my mother had told me about. I and my friend were on a hunt for all of them at the video store. We came across the original one. I remember the cover. The evil Pumpkin head holding the large kitchen knife.<br/><br/>Halloween has a simple premise but an effective one. On Halloween night 1963 A young boy by the name of Michael Myers butchers his older sister in an upstairs bedroom. He runs down stairs, where his mother and father find him holding the bloody kitchen knife.<br/><br/>Cut to fifteen years later the night before Halloween we are introduced to Dr Samuel Loomis who is riding passenger with a Nurse on their way to pick up Michael Myers and take him to a different facility. Hear we learn Michael has not spoken a word in 15 years. Loomis is also convinced Michael is pure evil and not even remotely Human. <br/><br/>However as they approach the front gates to Smiths Grove Sanatorium. In the shadows penitents are roaming free. Loomis begins to panic and runs to the front gate to see what is happening. Meanwhile the nurse struggles with a penitent on the roof of the car she escapes. Michael however drives off into the night. <br/><br/>Loomis states ""It's gone, the evil is gone from here"".<br/><br/>Moving onto the next day October 31st 1978 we are introduced to Laurie strode who is on her way to school and drop off the keys to a place her father is selling. We learn that it is the old Myers house. She is joined by young Tommy Doyle who she is babysitting tonight.<br/><br/>Tommy informs her that the house is haunted and calls it ""The Spook House"" Here see Michael from behind as Tommy and Laurie leave the old house to the school.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Loomis is hot on Michael's trail knowing full well where he is heading. Loomis even tells the other doctor who he is arguing with where he is heading.<br/><br/>After Night Falls, Michael begins his plans.. And Laurie Strode is his main Target.<br/><br/>(The Characters)<br/><br/>Dr Samuel Loomis. Dr Loomis is played by the late Donald Plansecne. Loomis spends the entire tracking down Michael Myers. We get a sense Loomis knows Myers better than anyone and spends much of the movie trying to convince the Sheriff, a fellow Doctor and even the nurse at the beginning that Michael is pure evil. Loomis also gives one of the best speeches in a movie (insert clip) At time Loomis comes off as over the top. I think this plays along well considering Michael is like an unstoppable force. Loomis Spends the night in the old Myers place waiting for Michael to return home. Sheriff Brackett helps Loomis in tracking down Myers. On the off chance that Loomis is right. Unlike his fellow colleagues Loomis does not see a man but rather a dark force of nature. Donald Plansece makes the movie. He is the Angel to Michael's Devil. <br/><br/>Laurie Strode Laurie Strode is played by Jamie Lee Curtis. Laurie is a responsible young women who is intelligent and well to do. However she does puff on a joint a bit into the movie. While Laurie maybe a good girl she is not afraid to be a little on wild side. Her best friend Annie is the daughter of Sheriff Brackett and another friend Lynda who uses the word totally allot. Annie tries to get Laurie out of her shell a little. We learn that Laurie has a crush on a boy and even though this leads to nowhere, we see the friendship between Laurie and Annie. We spend most of the movie following Laurie throughout the day. Along with Michael stalking her. But also letting her know he is there. Setting in the motion for his final act with Laurie and how close they are. Annie even goes out of her way to ask the boy Laurie likes to go out with Laurie.<br/><br/>Michael Myers. The star however is only seen from a distance except at the start and the final act. Michael is mostly shown from a distance stalking Laurie. He often gazes at her from a distance outside her classroom and in her backyard looking up into her bedroom. When Michael stalks at night he is only seen by the little boy Tommy Doyle. When he is near the Teenagers he is a shape in the darkness moving carefully and swiftly without hesitation. The only noise we is his deep breathing. Michael spends a majority of the movie stalking and watching. He builds the tension and when he strikes it is unexpected.<br/><br/>The Mask. The Mask Michael wares is a white emotionless mask. It has no expression when a victim sees it they are faced with blank expressionless face that is indifferent about life and death. The mask is well done, less equals more in this case. It is unsettling."
"CowherPowerForever","10","1","3","31 October 2013"," Was it the boogeyman? As a matter of fact, it was.
","35 years ago director, writer, and composer John Carpenter made one of the greatest horror films ever. To this day everyone talks about the film and for good reason.<br/><br/>Only a few films can say they are the best at something and Halloween is easily a movie that can say it is the best of the horror genre. With a good story, good acting, and fantastic suspense it deserves to be called one of the best ever. Unlike many horror films in the 70s and 80s Carpenter went suspense rather than a blood filled movie. Michael Myers popping up from the dark background makes for a truly fantastic scare. Sadly much in today's horror jump scares are the norm and they happen a lot. Halloween is very much different with true suspense that will truly scare you.<br/><br/>The acting is actually very good. Donald Pleasence, an acting legend, dominate this rule. He is truly a masterpiece not only in this film but the rest of the franchise as well. Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role did an amazing job and you truly believe she is being terrorized by this monster. The rest of the supporting cast while not perfect does a good enough job to still make the performances memorable.<br/><br/>John Carpenter as well did the score for this film as well. As the film is a well known classic so is the score John Carpenter made. To this day 35 years later when that Halloween music hits everyone thinks Halloween and Michael Myers. Sadly in today's horror genre this rarely happens as the music is parted to someone outside the production.<br/><br/>With the huge success of the film came sequels. John Carpenter made Halloween 2 in 1981 and Halloween 3 in 1982(which is the film without Michael Myers but still a very good film none the less) but not as a director only as a writer. After Halloween 3 he left the franchise for good never looking back. In total the franchise had 8 movies before the reboot came in 2007. Although Halloween H20 completely ignores parts 3 through 6.<br/><br/>Overall this is without a doubt one of the best if not the best horror film ever made. But no matter where you stand on that issue we all should agree John Carpenter and Debra Hill created a classic character that will live on forever."
"hellraiser7","Null","1","3","14 November 2011"," Season of Terror
","Halloween is one of my favorite season's of the year, best thing for is to go to parties. And this film is another one of the reason's I love the holiday, this is one of my favorite horror films as well as one of the first horror movies and films from my favorite movie director John Carpenter.<br/><br/>I love this film for many reason, from the fact that it was made on a low budget which made it all the more great because this film really didn't need a big budget, it a funny how most films with a high budget sometimes disappoint me while ones on modest or low impress me. I think it's because of it's strong content and that the whole cast and crew really put lots of energy and effort into what they do to simply aim to make a good movie even if it doesn't turn out great though most of the time it really does whether they know it or not.<br/><br/>I love the camera work where at time were in Michael's perspective, also just love the use of shadow and lighting really making the neighborhood seem foreboding. The darkness really give plenty of opportunities for danger, we see Michael appear and disappear in places and he doesn't cheat doing this Mike just knows the right places to go as if he has some GPS. One of the spookiest moments was when we saw Michael following the kid Tommy Doyle in front of the elementary school he goes to, it really made me wonder how secure our own public schools are. After this film I checked the back yard, since we have a medium sized back yard. But also on how Michael always seems to take his time, it's like you can never get far enough away from him, it's true he walks but if you even get cornered then your fraked.<br/><br/>But also just does suspense really well the fact that we are at times in Mike's perspective is the classic element of being a step ahead of the protagonist, the suspense is in hoping the hero will figure out what we know sooner. It even has a participatory sense where there were time I could help but almost yell out ""C'mon walk it off and get moving."" or even ""C'mon open the damn door, hustle; this is not something that I do in most horror movies which is why it's such a great feeling.<br/><br/>I love the sense of relatablity, that neighborhood looks like my own neighborhood, certain features to it like the Myers house which is creepy where in most neighborhoods they have those houses which just breeds stories that may or may not be true of the house being either haunted or a bad incident occurred. But most of all the main protagonist Larrie Strode which was of course Jamie Lee Curtis's debut role. Larrie is actually a lot like myself when I was her age. She is shy, insecure, a bit of a geek ( I mean that in a good way), always want to be in control, and isn't looking for trouble but as a saying goes trouble may'be looking for her. I really love how her character can hold her own against danger, which goes to show even though she's scared she's not a wimp she can defend herself.<br/><br/>Supporting character Dr. Sam Lomis played by the late great Donald Plesance is also great, he's sort of the classic vampire hunter archetype. His character knows the nature of the man he hunts and we are on his side and want him to succeed because we do as well. My favorite moment with him no doubt is his monologue on the story of Michael, which really sends chills because his story fuels our imagination.<br/><br/>Michael Myers is one of the best horror movie figures and villains to grace films. There is just a lot that is scary about him from the breathing much like with Darth Vader. That mask of his I'll admit looking at it still give me chills, it is just so pale white, inhuman, expressionless, it perfectly reflected his evil nature. As well as how he behaves which is creepy, he's like a game hunter we don't see him do anything at first but we know he will and soon. But to me what make Michael really scary is the sense of enigma he carries. We don't know what his motive for his crimes are there is none, same with his first crime when he was six it just simply came out of nowhere. Personally I don't think he's human, as you can see the look he had when he was six he clearly didn't kill by his own will, my theory is that Michael is possessed by a demon. I don't know your theory is as good as mine but still from that site where the grave of Judith Myers was stolen the hole looks clean as if the grave was pulled up not pulled out, as well as other things you can't help but wonder.<br/><br/>And of course who can forget the score, it is one of the best damn score in both the horror genre and just movies in general. Without it the film wouldn't of worked, it really helped create a creepy and foreboding atmosphere you constantly feel dread and impending danger, there is even music as the action is conducted I really loved it in that chase scene which is one of my favorite chases ever. As well as the theme song which is one of my favorite themes ever and hopefully our current films and TV show will take the time to make an actually theme to their works.<br/><br/>So, Happy Halloween but beware there may'be something in the night.<br/><br/>Rating: 4 stars"

This movie is created by John Carpenter, a genius when it comes to horror movies. ""Halloween"" is the first of the slasher horror films, with many more(not always good) to come.

","Micheal Myers has become in icon in horror, and in film in general, and it all began with a tiny, super-low budget movie by John Carpenter.<br/><br/>Halloween is scary in a way that's not only intense during death scenes, but also builds tension on silence. It is also very mysterious, especially towards the end. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you've seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about. Rather than reveal everything about Micheal and his past, like the remake did, it makes Micheal a total mystery, which makes him all the more scary. I suppose Rob Zombie wanted to dig deeper into this interesting character, but we pretty much get all we need with this single film. That's why I don't intend to watch the sequels for the movie. I would rather have Halloween as a stand alone movie. <br/><br/>My only complain is that some of the acting was pretty cheesy, but this is only from minor characters. Donald Pleasence and Jaimie Lee Curtis do great jobs, however, and help make the terror more believable. John Carpenter directs the movie in a way that makes the audience feel the same fear that the main character feels. Along with it's famous creepy music, John creates a unique and eerie atmosphere that most slasher films these days seem to lack. <br/><br/>Overall, Halloween is a horror classic, and is a great movie to watch during the well-known holiday."

","When John Carpenter was making this film he had no idea that it would be one of the most amazing horror films ever made! The basic plot for this film is that Michael Myers escapes a mental institution after 15 years of being there for killing his sister in 1963. Well he escapes and goes to Haddonfield (his old home town)and as you can predict he kills a bunch of people. But why did he just kill teenagers not to mention only 1 of them is a boy. Did Michael just hate women? Anyway John Carpenter decided that gore just made people go ""eeewwww...."" and he wanted a different reaction from the audience so what better than a bunch of jumpy scenes and little gore at all? So this is one of few horror films that focuses on suspense and jumpy scenes rather than gore.<br/><br/>The later films focused more on gore and weren't as successful and were just plain crappy.<br/><br/>Don't watch any of the other films in the series just think that this is the first and last Halloween film ever.

","In 1978, John Carpenter, a filmmaker nobody had ever heard of produced, for $320 000, a simple little slasher movie in the vein of ""Psycho"" and ""Black Christmas"", that was about a six-year-old child who murders his older sister, grows up, and proceeds to rampage through his home town on Halloween. More than thirty years, half-a-dozen sequels, a remake, and a sequel to the remake later, we have what's been hailed as one of the greatest horror movies of the twentieth century, an impressive accomplishment considering... well, the entirety of the rest of the twentieth century, with a few equally great exceptions. Donald Pleasance, in the role that almost defined his career (would have, too, if not for Blofeld) as Dr. Sam Loomis, perfectly embodies the obsession with Michael Myers' evil, fused unrecognisably with his altruistic need to stop his inhuman patient. Jamie Lee Curtis, in the first role of a now decades long film career, shows us the true face of Laurie Strode, fearful but strong as she faces Myers' unstoppable force. Then there's Michael Myers himself, more pure darkness than human, too elemental to even belong to the faceless actor who plays him so well. The eyes, black, staring and soulless betrays no semblance of humanity as his ghostly white face shines from the shadows as though a fixture in the night itself. But it's the breathing, raspy and loud. It lets you know that he's there, all around you, shrouded too perfectly to see until it is far, far, too late. Whatever we tell children, this movie shows the truth. There is something to be afraid of in the dark. It's name is Michael Myers."

Easily one of the best slasher films ever made...The elements that really make this film a great one is the suspense,camera-work,the score and of course Michael Myers...What's so great about the film is , that it never truly tells you what Michael is...The Movie enters into the realm of the supernatural but still refers to Myers as nothing more but a simple human.When Laurie pulls off his mask , we can see that he is truly nothing more than a human being...Yet at the same time he is so much more...He is darkness and evil personified.He is the devil beneath human flesh...A being born of darkness and shadows with no conscience or knowledge of what is right or wrong.Carpenter and Debra made a monster who is not ""really"" a monster , but is far more scarier , for it was proved with this movie that nothing is more scarier than a human soul engulfed in darkness...The fact that we never get an explanation as to ""what"" Myers really was (Loomis even refers to Myers as an ""it"" )or his motives adds to the inhumane nature of this great character...It seems his only motive to kill was because he was evil to the core...Astounding !!! The score is absolutely amazing and is a huge part of the film's success...I dare to say that Michael's theme has become as much of a general representation of the Horror Genre as Hitchcock's famous shower scene...It sends chills down your spine every time you hear it and makes you think of Michael Carpenter really knows how to build up suspense and keep you on the edge of your seat , the scenes are magnificently depicted and the acting by both Jamie Lee and Pleasence was top-notch...<br/><br/>Cons : <br/><br/>So what's NOT so good ??? Like any movie ""Halloween"" has it's flaws...For one it is extremely cliché ( but this can be forgiven since some of the cliché killings and frights were not really cliché when the movie was released...) The scene in the beginning where Michael stabs his sister to deaths was very poorly done...I also think it would have been better if Carpenter would have kept Michael's face in the shadows...The mask could still come off , but keeping his face in the dark till he put his mask back on would have been even better...<br/><br/>Conclusion : <br/><br/>Michael Myers is the pure depiction of evil and darkness...He doesn't need a reason to kill and that's what made him such a good slasher monster...This is also my first movie review so take it with a grain of salt..."
"MistAh_Justus","10","1","3","12 August 2009"," Perfect!
","Calling this movie anything less then a classic is simply unacceptable. Everything about it just screams ""Yes, I am perfect and this is how horror should be done!"" From the cinematography to the suspense and realism, John Carpenter hit the nail on the head. Like a fine wine, this masterpiece only gets better with age. This is what legends are made of, this is what gave birth to an icon.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with the viewer seeing through the eyes of evil itself. We're shown a predator stalk it's prey, until we're rewarded with it's first kill. Then we're greeted with an early surprise, when it's revealed the hunter behind this madness came in the shape of a boy still in his costume on Halloween night. This anything but innocent boy goes by the name of Michael Myers. Ladies and gentlemen...meet the Boogeyman.<br/><br/>Immediately, the tone is set and this is just the beginning. Shortly after, we flash ahead a few years where we're first introduced to the good doctor himself, Samuel Loomis played by the great Donald Pleasence. He arrives at an institution to see our young killer from earlier who is now an adult. But something is off when he arrives as many of the patients seem to be roaming the yard in the rain unsupervised. This is when Michael Myers makes his great escape, as he makes his way back to his hometown of Haddonfield where his terror will be unleashed...once again.<br/><br/>This is where our young group of girls first appear. This group consists of the original scream queen herself Jamie Lee Curtis playing Laurie Strode as our lead, and her two friends Annie Brackett and Lynda van der Klok played by Nancy Loomis (Now Nancy Kyes) and P.J. Soles. These are the girls our Boogeyman decides to terrorize and torture...now he certainly has good taste.<br/><br/>The tension continues to build, as we're shown Michael in only small doses. This master of horror director, John Carpenter, seems to know how to work suspense like no other. The vibe throughout is creepy as hell. We as the viewer never know what dark corner or behind what doorway Michael will pop out of, we're stuck guessing and preparing for each scare and I wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>Now Michael Myers himself is a force to be reckoned with! When you have a silent killer like him, you can only judge him by his actions. He ain't exactly the most outgoing or talkative person you'll ever meet, but his lack of words, he more then makes up for with his art of killing. Each kill is done in such a stylish way, whether it's intelligent and patient like Annie's demise or slick and forceful like Bob's. Each one is impressive and helps us get a feel for who he is in such a unique way. His mask is timeless and like everything else about this movie, it just feels so right.<br/><br/>One thing that must be mentioned and really adds to the overall vibe and creepiness factor is the incredible score. Whether you're a fan or not, you know the main theme! It's as recognizable as Michael Myers himself, it's what makes you tense up in your seat, it's everything that it should be. Wouldn't feel like a Halloween movie without it and that's the reason it appears throughout the series, even if it's through variations.<br/><br/>The exciting conclusion and thrilling finale ends with Laurie fighting for survival against The Shape as he unleashes a relentless attack. With each encounter Laurie narrowly escapes but young Tommy Doyle who she happens to be babysitting throughout the chaos says it the best ""You can't kill the Boogeyman."" Truer words have never been spoken. Dr.Loomis finally makes his heroic appearance to save the day after searching for Michael throughout the night. The bullets fly until Michael is shot off a balcony and implanted in the ground. But as we've been shown already, one second he's there...the next he's not.<br/><br/>This film really has it all and I can't praise it enough. Often imitated, never duplicated. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it or when you seen it last, the next time you get a chance to watch it...make sure you do. Each sequel only adds to the legacy, this is what nightmares are made of and it will continue to scare until the end of time! John Carpenter's Halloween is the epitome of a classic.<br/><br/>10/10"
"YakuzaElite1980","10","1","3","7 August 2009"," Still a classic! Nothing comes close!
","A man once asked me ""how can I scare myself?"" I told him to go watch Halloween which coincidentally he never had. Was he in for a good scare!<br/><br/>Yet its funny that after 32 years no other horror movie has captured the power of Halloween. While other horror movies depend on shock value and gore, John Carpenter relied more on mood and atmosphere to keep us in suspense and terror. Throw in a haunting soundtrack and Halloween proves that only a master knows how to craft the perfect movie. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor, if you have never seen this movie do it immediately. But to get the full sense of the movie, turn down the lights, close all doors, and prepare to be scared."
"Sirus_the_Virus","10","1","3","4 August 2009"," Perhaps the best horror film ever.
","Halloween is probably the greatest horror film ever. Like The Omen, Psycho,and other films, Halloween is a cult classic. I am not a fan of John Carpenter's horror films, but this is actually a fantastic film. I wish more films were like Halloween. The Plot: Halloween is the story of a kid named Michael Myers who murdered his sister on Halloween many years ago. Many years later, Michael is on the loose and Dr. Loomis is trying to look for a girl named Laurie. Michael is trying to look for Laurie also. Only because of something that he could've done years ago. Michael murders all of Laurie's babysitting friends to find her. Michael Myers is a convincing killer. Until the fourth film, I thought he could actually be out there. Until I saw him get his head cut off and he returns, I was convinced he was real, sort of. Of course I knew he wasn't real, but he's the only serial killer who could actually be real. Like Norman Bates. Halloween is actually a realistic horror film and that's why I appreciate it so much. Halloween is a film that will shock you, creep you out, and keep you up at night. It didn't keep me up but for people who haven't seen it, it may keep them up at night. Halloween is a clever, top notch horror film."
"Matt_Layden","8","1","3","20 July 2009"," The One That Started It All.
","So here is a film that defined and ignited a genre. It wasn't the first, but it was one of the first and one to start so many imitators that never really got the formula down right. Carpenter is a master at his craft and he doesn't always score, but I applaud him for what he does and I can say that I enjoy most of his work. Halloween is one of his finest.<br/><br/>So what is scarier then William Shatner? How about William Shatner spray painted white. Honestly, I find this mask scarier and more menacing then any hockey mask or fencing mask (ha, I hate Urban Legends 2). They ruined it in the sequels, then got it right again with Zombie's vision, but here it was the first and best. I was surprised that his mask came off in the film and we saw his face underneath. I grew up in the 90's, so I always saw the masked killer, then have the reveal at the end. Never did I see the victim tear the mask off during a scuffle, I was taken back....and I liked it. That scene makes it seem more real. Well done.<br/><br/>I guess since I grew up with the horror films being more in your face and graphic with the killings, I wasn't too impressed with the deaths in this film. Everything felt kind of slow to me, like the actors were taking it easy with each other in those scenes. Small nitpicks I have.<br/><br/>With other killers, they all have their reasons. Krueger is getting revenge on the kids of the parents who killed him, Jason is getting revenge on the kids who let him drown and killed his mother, the killers in scream are all about revenge. Then we have Michael Myers, who is described as PURE EVIL, from the one man who probably knows him best, Loomis. Not Loomis from Scream, that was a homage for you young kids out there.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence's most notable role? Some would say so and I would agree. Also Jamie Lee Curtis pops up here and she is quite good. I never really cared for much of her stuff, but I took notice here, even if it was one of her first gigs. Although, yes, her screaming at the end in the closet can get on the nerves.<br/><br/>Halloween is the horror film to watch on Halloween. It's almost a rule, ritual, given. I can't say much for the sequels, but the first is always the best.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, the cover? Simple, yet badass."
"teeteejconner","10","1","3","13 July 2009"," The Thrill of Classical Horror Films
","When sitting down and watching John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", I began to wonder why a film made over thirty years ago still has people sitting at the edge of their seats. I'm sure many believe this film is a piece of work, but what is the thrill? In ""Halloween"", a six year old child named Michael Myers (Will Sandin) had the will power to murder his older sister on a Halloween night of 1963. The gruesome murder led the young psychotic Myers right into an asylum. A doctor by the name of Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) spent fifteen years with Myers trying to figure out the cause of evil within him. Unexplainably, the adult Myers (Tony Moran) escaped on the night before Halloween in 1978. His goal was to go back to where it all started in Haddonfield, Illinois, and search for his seventeen year old sister. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) had no idea what evil was coming her way. Dr. Loomis seeks to stop the masked killer in his path, but Myers won't be stopped by anything. Like every good director of horror films, Carpenter created ""Halloween"" to be scary and suspenseful. The ultimate question is what makes Carpenter's ""Halloween"" scare his audience? The film is obviously the 70s style of movie making; with its cheesy script and beamy music in the background. We already know that those poor little teenagers ""had it coming,"" for no bad act goes unpunished and so their fornication led to their doom. If that scares you, you must be a newbie to horror films. You must dig deeper and understand that Carpenter makes you feel like you're in the movie; he has you peering into the screen checking to see if Myers is behind the door or if he's hidden in a dark corner. The main characters pretend that nothing is wrong, while the audience knows full well what's coming next. You'll find the horror in Carpenter's screenplay creeps up on you as much as Myers does throughout the movie. However, some areas in the film did not make sense at all. For instance, how does a psychotic killer escape from an asylum and learn how to drive the first time behind the wheel? The audience clearly knows Myers was away for fifteen years and an asylum does not offer driving lessons. Perhaps its maternal talent! If Myers was six years old entering the mental institution, he'd be twenty-one years old in 1978, not twenty-three as listed in the credits. Incredible explains ""Halloween"", how could anyone forget those piercing eyes behind that mysterious mask or that theme song that puts the Halloween series together. This low budget film had a few mishaps, but in the end it was all still worth the fifty-five million."
"EricVierthaler92","10","1","3","8 July 2009"," The scariest movie I've ever seen! So scary it changed my life!
","The greatest horror movie ever made in the history of man kind! Many people have tried to copy this movie but none had succeeded. Nobody can out beat this movie. I remember back in 5TH grade one day in PE class me, my PE teachers son, and my friend Zach were all talking about the scariest movie we've ever seen. I started the conversation. And then Zach brought up this movie and he told us how scary it was. After he told me about it I immediately got interested about it because I liked the idea of a horror movie taking place on Halloween. So then I remember one night around October of 2004 I couldn't get any sleep so then I decided to go on the computer and watch the movie. At the time my parents still cared about what movies I watched so I went onto some website I don't remember what website it was and I watched the movie. Before I watched it I said to my self 'This movie isn't gonna be scary!' But oh boy was I wrong!! This movie scared me more then ANY other movie ever made. What mainly scared me about this movie was the music score! The music score had so much power on this movie. Just like how the music to 'Jaws' changed the movie. Without the music the movie wouldn't of been as successful. After I saw this movie I got curious and I wanted to learn how to play the 'Halloween' theme song on the piano. So then I asked for a piano for Christmas and I got one then I went onto Youtube and I learned how. To dedicate John Carpenter just in case you do not know who he is he's the director, screenwriter, and music composer of this movie. I decided to play the 'Halloween' theme song on the piano at the school talent show with the lights off, a scary looking hood on. You couldn't see my face and with this kid named Taylor have a flashlight over me so you can actually see me play the famous theme on the piano. My gig at the talent show got the biggest applause and gained me a ton of attention and a ton of publicity. I owe this movie a lot. This movie changed my life. I highly recommend this gold! This movie even inspired me to create my own horror movie back in 6TH grade titled as 'Torn'. After seeing this movie I was to afraid to go trick or treating. Even to this day I still am to afraid. And even though I'm to old to go trick or treating now I'm still afraid that maybe Michael Myers is out there. After seeing this movie whenever I take a shower I have to have the door locked. After seeing this movie I always have the door shut. Michael Myers mask in this movie was the best, next to it's terrifying 1981 sequel. A classic! A master-peace! Without this movie I wouldn't of had as much publicity. Without this movie I would've never started playing piano. I never got so scared by a movie in my entire life!! I even had nightmares! Donald Pleasence's lines in this movie creep-ed me out and they still do! Especially the last line he says in the movie. His lines/speeches about Michael Myers really creep-ed me out. Even looking at the poster gives me the creeps. A 5 out of 5. Brilliant work. Instantly John Carpenter's best movie. It's sad he wasn't involved with that many of the 'Halloween' sequels or the remake. This movie scared me so sad that it changed my life!"
"I_am_worst_at_what_I_do_best","10","1","3","7 June 2009"," As good as a horror can get
","This movie executed everything well. It started off as an independent film, but now it is much more than that. It had little gore and blood, but it related back to the 50s when Alfred Hitchcock used suspense to thrill audiences. I wish they still used suspense now. And it was scary. It always kept you guessing where Michael is. ""Don't go there! Michael's there!"" Then, they turn the corner and Michael isn't there. Jason could behind any tree or in any cabin in the Friday the 13th films. But Michael could be behind any door, at any window, around any corner or be in any backyard. This made Halloween WAY more exciting. It also made it scary about what he did in 1963. Michael is pure evil, and no-one can stop him."
"jasonjennybrown-1","10","1","3","15 April 2009"," Simply Frightening and Brilliant!
","Halloween was shot under budget and still provided more scares and fear than modern horror movies do this day and age. The score alone does magic and cannot be compared to todays modern music replacing just a simple scary score. This movie gave birth to the serial killer genre and all successful horror movies today have John Carpenter to thank. I WILL always love the Halloween series and horror movies will never compare. It's simple, scary, and haunting all at once. What else can a real horror movie fan ask for? There are only a hand full of ""scary"" movies out there. Even less in this time and age. No doubt that movies made in the 70's and early 80's were true horror."
"VivaLaGloria18","10","1","3","1 April 2009"," A little over 30 years later and its still the greatest entry in the horror genre
","It took me awhile to write this review. I wrote one on here last year but nothing I had said seemed to suffice. None of my chosen words could describe the true and utter brilliance of this classic horrific tale. We all know the plot so to rewrite it is useless and I'll go straight to describe its insanely scary moments, Eerie musical score, and genius cast.<br/><br/>I saw this movie summer of last year. It was one of the first horrors I'd seen that truly scared me. The plain white mask and soulless eyes of Michael Myers are enough to instill fear in any who see him. I developed a phobia of him after seeing it which is still going strong. I'm afraid to walk down dark hallways for fear he will jump out at me and sleep with a light on. Yes its funny but you know what this proves? John Carpentor is a bloody genius. I've seen a long list of horror movies (over 50) a few have frightened me but none left such a scary impression although most were truly good. <br/><br/>I must say this now. Without Donald Pleasence I have no clue how this film would have been as good. Yes, Jaimie Lee Curtis is amazing in it but I think Donald Pleasence made this movie. He puts an intelligent feel to the scary element. And if he hadn't returned for sequels 2, 4, 5 and 6 (due to his sad death was not present for 20 years later and Resurrection).<br/><br/>And yes I am going to touch on Jaimie Lee Curtis's legendary performance. I admire this woman deeply. She portrayed a strong lead who showed how smart and clever she was and never let her guard down. Most of our lead woman in all slasher are similar but never come close to Laurie Strode who like the film did for the genre set the standard. <br/><br/>This film wouldn't be half as scary without the music. The fast tapping piano, and deep organ at certain points is the eeriest music I've ever heard. It makes the lengthy shots of Michael walking robotically down the street with butcher knife in hand as scary as they are.<br/><br/>And Michael Myers himself. The inhuman killing machine. His soulless eyes and robotic movements are chilling. Kudos to anyone who came up with a simple white mask. Put it the right place simple things as white masks, crazy orange hair, a blue janitor suit, and butcher knife can be one of the scariest sights to behold. <br/><br/>I come to a point where I'm unsure how to end this. I have no idea how many times I said 'Scary' but I'm sure the tally is high. I still am unsure if this review captured how truly timeless and thrilling this film is. But if you would like to know for yourself please do check it out. Its survived 30 years and is still just as scary as it was then, its seen a lot in this 30 years and will never be replaced no matter how many mediocre imitations will surface."
"lastliberal","8","1","3","26 October 2007"," It was the boogeyman.
","John Carpenter's classic is definitely a scary film and a real treat.<br/><br/>I will always think of Jamie Lee Curtis as that hooker with a heart of gold in Trading Places, but it was fun to see her as Laurie in her first film. She did a great job of fighting off the bogeyman.<br/><br/>And there is P.J. Soles (Death by Engagement, The Devil's Rejects) that i remember from Private Benjamin. She was also great as Lynda:<br/><br/>Lynda: It's totally insane. We have three new cheers to learn in the morning, the game is in the afternoon, I have to get my hair done at five, and the dance is at eight! I'll be totally wiped out! Laurie: I don't think you have enough to do tomorrow. Lynda: Totally!<br/><br/>And, there is Ernst Stavro Blofeld, I mean Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) in his first ""good guy"" role. <br/><br/>Enjoyed it immensely, and plan to see the rest."

","Halloween started it all, referring to slasher movies. Actually it pretty much created the genre if you ask me. I'd have to say out of all of the horror films that I've watched, this is number one. It's a perfect plot line; a boy kills his sister and is sent to a mental institution where he then breaks out on Halloween night 20 or so years later to murder his other sister.<br/><br/>I love the score of the movie as well. When you could here the faintest music, you knew he was there. Then, when he popped out the music starts going faster. They did a heck of a job.<br/><br/>The acting is great as well. Jamie Lee Curtis' scream can be heard for miles. The doctor of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis is fantastic. The two kids and the other babysitter do a heck of a job as well, and P.J.

"Elswet","9","1","3","14 September 2003"," Top Row Suspense.
","Introducing Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode. Wonderful. One of the best suspense/slasher flix ever made.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of veteran actress Janet Leigh and actor Tony Curtis (Bernard Schwartz), was a twenty-year old, unseasoned actress with only a two episodes of Operation Petticoat and a bit part in a ""Colombo"" movie under her belt when she was cast in this, her first leading role. (As usual, 20 year olds playing high schoolers) While her acting is still a trifle fresh, she convincingly portrays her role as well as she would today, as a seasoned actress. She makes you smile, and later, makes you scream, squirm up into your chair and pull the blanket up to your chin.<br/><br/>Laurie and her friends comprise a small group of ""teen-aged"" girls who baby sit for weed money, and spend most of their time like many teen aged girls do; screwing their boyfriends and otherwise scheming on how to get out of the house in order to perpetrate their other plans...screwing their boyfriends. I won't outline the plot here, as this movie was done in 1978, but I will say that Donald Pleasence is very convincing as the psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis, who first treats Michael Audrey Myers. He seems genuinely concerned that he is loose and makes you believe that he cares. As he outlines Michael's past history with the cop, you get all the information you need in order to just sit back, follow the movie and enjoy being scared out of your wits.<br/><br/>While the overuse of the word ""totally"" is somewhat annoying, it's classic late '70's, early '80's jargon which Nancy Kyes (Annie) can't seem to do without. She's good and believable as a complete and total air head you can't wait to see butchered. She's also done The Fog (John Carpenter, 1980), Halloween 2, Halloween 3 (a movie they could have just never made), Not in Front of the Children and Lady Boss...nothing really spectacular, but she's entertaining in this.<br/><br/>Wide screen had newly been introduced when Carpenter made this movie, and he excels in its use. View the wide screen edition of this movie to catch all the side action you missed in the full screen version. I understand it exhibits his abilities to give us excellent filmography and cinematography.<br/><br/>What's also excellent is Jamie Lee Curtis's ability to exude tension, fright, concern, happiness and horror all within the same scene. She really spreads her wings in this movie and exhibits those traits we've now come to expect from her.<br/><br/>Also I must comment on the story line/plot. I wasn't going to, but I simply must. I typically dislike ""slasher"" flicks...mindless killing, puerile acting, hollow and empty plots...but the Halloween movies aren't like that. They definitely give us something besides mindless entertainment.<br/><br/>As you may know, the endings of these movies are never really endings. They always come back. The ending of Halloween 1 is a classic in the field of Horror. Jamie is so natural here. I love this movie. It's one of my favorite horror flix.<br/><br/>It gets a solid 9.2/10 from...<br/><br/>the Fiend :."
"Maciste_Brother","Null","1","3","28 August 2003"," A classic that time hasn't been kind to
","I first saw HALLOWEEN when it was rereleased a couple of years after its original 1978 release. I was too young to see it in 1978 but I remembered the effective ad campaign which was spooky and made a big impression on me, and is the reason why I saw the film when it was rereleased. I thought the movie was extremely suspenseful and filled with great atmosphere. The audience reaction was and still one of the best I've ever experienced. Flash forward 20 years and even though I still consider HALLOWEEN to be a classic, time hasn't been kind to it and the film has, imo, lost a lot of its former glory. 20 years ago, I would have given HALLOWEEN a solid 10. Today, I would give a an 8, edging towards the 7.5 mark. There are several factors that have made me reevaluate HALLOWEEN.<br/><br/>First and foremost, the endless number of stupid sequels. What was so great about HALLOWEEN was the mystery surrounding Michael. Who was he? A boogeyman or just a psycho serial killer? There was an aura of creepiness about him that gave the film an extra punch. When I saw the film for the first time, what made it so startling was the randomness of Michael's killing spree. He just happens to follow Laurie and her friends because she was at the wrong place and at the wrong time. That's it. But then the sequels were made, and everything that was so great in the original film was flushed down the toilet in an instant. They've turned the whole thing into a silly soap opera of sorts, with Michael being Laurie's brother, etc. Why, oh, why? But even worse, after 20 years or so after the original film, they're still churning out sequels. Like James Bond, STAR TREK, STAR WARS, FRIDAY THE 13TH, Freddy Kruger or even Godzilla series, the HALLOWEEN series is a tired series of movies that should have stopped decades ago. HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION?!?! HALLOWEEN H2O?!?! How about HALLOWEEN RIP! The terrible sequels have done more to diminish the greatness of HALLOWEEN than anything else.<br/><br/>Second factor: John Carpenter, filmmaker. After I saw HALLOWEEN, I went to see every John Carpenter movie, that is, until I figured out how limited Carpenter was as a filmmaker. I've stopped seeing his films at the movies after THEY LIVE and only rented his other recent films. Carpenter is not a good filmmaker. I know this is blasphemy in the ears of ""fan boys"" but after making movies for 30 years, Carpenter hasn't evolved one bit as a filmmaker. In fact, his earlier films show more intelligence and originality  than the really stupid films he's been doing for the past 15 years, like VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED, or PRINCE OF DARKNESS or ESCAPE FROM L.A., which is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Looking back at HALLOWEEN, I have to say that its greatness was due more to happenstance than genius.<br/><br/>
Third factor, HALLOWEEN is not as original as I thought it was. The music, which is a big part of HALLOWEEN, is excellent and memorable. I thought then that it was original, that is, until I saw Dario Argento's DEEP RED. Though both scores are different, it's quite obvious Carpenter was ""inspired"" by the Goblin score. Then there's the whole ""slasher"" concept. Well, there were other slashers made before HALLOWEEN, like, hmmm, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE or BLACK CHRISTMAS. So the whole slasher concept didn't start with HALLOWEEN.<br/><br/>The fourth and final factor is the film itself. When I watched it recently, I have to admit that the film was quite boring and not very well structured. The beginning is great and the ending is suspenseful but the whole middle part is pretty dull. Nothing happens for almost an entire hour. Before, I would have said that it was all about atmosphere and creating characters and such, but now, knowing more about movies and having formed an opinion on what's makes a film good or bad, I have to say that a lot of the middle part of HALLOWEEN feels like filler or padding, such as the many fun but useless scenes with the kids watching old movies on TV. Structurally, Carpenter could have made the story more tight. When Michael starts killing, before you know it, the movie ends. There are more dull moments than suspenseful ones in HALLOWEEN. And the couple of lapses of logic or plot-holes in the story-line are more apparent to me now than they were 20 years ago. And the film is very tame. Edit out the nude scenes and a couple of violent moments, and HALLOWEEN would be a PG-13 or even a PG-rated movie. I'm not a gorehound. For me, showing gore or violence is not important but after watching decades worth of action movies like the over-the-top TOTAL RECALL, which are 1000 times more violent than the 1978  Carpenter flick, the lack of violence in HALLOWEEN actually hinders it. There's almost no edge to it.<br/><br/>Like I've said before, I consider HALLOWEEN to be a classic of 1970s independent filmmaking but the greatness it used to have in my mind has slowly, with time, diminished and now I consider HALLOWEEN to be just another slasher that's slightly above average. Today, I prefer THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. Now that's a horror movie to reckon with."

","Without much money to work with John Carpenter directs, writes and produces original music for this stalk, rip, slash, stab, psycho thriller.

Very well made with plenty of scares, tension and sex driven teenagers.<br/><br/>Tony Moran plays the bumbling, stumbling slasher Michael Myers. Donald Pleasence is Michael's doctor and leaves the institution to find his psycho runaway patient and bring him back before he does more harm. The alluring Jamie Lee Curtis plays Michael's sister and next intended victim. Also in the cast are Charles Cyphers, Nancy Kyes and Kyle Richards.

"Analog_Devotee","10","1","4","6 December 2019"," The best horror film ever made. Period.
","I first saw Halloween on cable as a twelve-year old kid. Halloween night fell on a Saturday that year, and I spent the entire weekend binging horror films. Though many were memorable; Nightmare on Elm Street; The Ring; Final Destination 1 - 3; Jeepers Creepers; The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) and others, none stuck with me on quite the same magnitude that Halloween did. I instantly became a lifelong fan of the entire franchise. My allowance no longer went towards burgers and milkshakes from the Hardees down the street - I was now determined to track down all the Halloween films on DVD. And I did.<br/><br/>It wasn't my first horror film-I saw The Grudge about two years prior at a sleepover-but it was the first to truly change my life. My office, where I'm currently writing this review, is encased with horror books, movies and memorabilia; most of which is Halloween and Michael Myers related. I own all the films on VHS, DVD and Blu Ray, along with a slew of action figures and promotional material.<br/><br/>I can't say anything about this film that hasn't already been said. I just wanted to share my experience. If, somehow, you haven't sat down and given this film a fair shake, it's time to change that, because this film, quite literally, could be life changing. It certainly was for me."

","Ok, so this one starts out with Michael killing his family. It's literally the first thing that happens in the movie, aside from his sister making out with her boyfriend. Anyway. The point is it gives zero history or background for Michael, which would make it easier for me to grasp him. I have the vague idea that most of the movies in the franchise are all the same. Michael going around killing. No plot, no depth, no nothing. So I'm not going to bother watching them. Except for Rob Zombie's version which seems a tad better."
"utgard14","9","1","4","2 November 2013"," A Horror Classic
","The best of an often unsavory genre, Halloween stands as the godfather of all slasher flicks. Imitated dozens of times over the last 35 years, it still hasn't been surpassed in terms of sheer creativity or originality. It set up tropes that have become constants in the horror genre, particularly in slasher films or their related ilk. It's also one of the very few slashers that can be called scary with a straight face.<br/><br/>It made John Carpenter and Jamie Lee Curtis' careers. As a Carpenter fan who enjoys most of his films, I find it hard to argue against the idea that this is his best. Curtis has never escaped being Laurie Strode, despite a career spanning decades with many other hit roles. It's just such a seminal film whose importance can't be overstated I think. Not to mention it's highly enjoyable from start to finish. The classic score, the amazing direction, the great cast -- it's all just perfect. Oh and speaking of great cast -- how can I forget Donald Pleasence, who steals every scene he's in. Through his performance he makes Dr. Loomis into a modern day Van Helsing for the slasher generation(s).<br/><br/>If you've been living under a rock and haven't seen this film, please do immediately."
"ajs-10","8","1","4","6 November 2011"," The original and still the best
","I got a little behind on my Halloween film watching and so I had to put this one back a bit. Not to worry, it's still a great horror film even if you don't watch it on its' title night. It has been a long time since I last saw it and I had forgotten just how good it was. Yes, it's dated, but that doesn't detract from the way Carpenter draws the audience in to the horrors to come. I'll give you more of my thoughts after this brief summary.<br/><br/>We first witness the 6 year old Michael Myers murder his older sister on Halloween night 1963. Flashing forwards 15 years, October 30th, we see him escape the mental institution he has been kept in since then. We are also introduced to Dr. Sam Loomis, who firmly believes Myers to be pure evil. The next day, back in Michael Myers' home town we meet Laurie Strode and her friends Annie Brackett and Lynda van der Klok who are planning their Halloween night. Two of them are babysitting, but there are plans, for two of them at least, to get together with their boyfriends later. Laurie has the feeling someone is watching them though and she's right. Dr. Loomis has also arrived in town, he has a feeling also that an old resident may be returning home. I'll leave it there so as not to upset the Spoiler Police (Horror Movie Division).<br/><br/>A really well made film with some iconic scenes and a film that is genuinely scary. One of the things that strikes you about it is the music, also written by John Carpenter. It's atmospheric and it has a refrain that everyone knows and associates with this film. All the performances were excellent; Jamie Lee Curtis in her first starring role did a great job as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasence was great (as ever) as Dr. Sam Loomis. Also worthy of note were; Nancy Kyes as Annie Brackett, P.J. Soles as Lynda van der Klok and Charles Cyphers as Sheriff Leigh Brackett.<br/><br/>Of course all the usual horror movie clichés are here, including my pet favourite; walking into a dark room and NOT turning the lights on. Despite this I still very much enjoyed the way Carpenter slowly builds up the tension. The horror is in what he doesn't show on the screen and that is what makes this a properly scary movie. The best pictures, I find, are those you make up in your own imagination and Carpenter allows us room to do that. As I've already said, it's quite dated, but that doesn't detract from it, it's still a great horror film and one I have no problem in deeming Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.9/10 IMDb Score: 7.9/10 (based on 76,702 votes at the time of going to press)."

","I first watched this film around 10 years a go and i was impressed, now i can't go a month without watching it.<br/><br/>Some people don't rate it because of the lack of gore. Now a days all horror movies have to contain loads of gore which is not that scary. The modern generation find this poor because there ""isn't enough kills"" but older fans like suspense and that what this film gives<br/><br/>It starts of with Michael when he was 6 killing his older sister I liked the touch where the view is Michael's. Good thinking from John Carpenter<br/><br/>15 years later he escapes and rages terror on Haddonfield. The film then builds on suspense. Michael watches and waits for the right time to claim his victims. His victims are 3 teenage girls. Laurie Strode, played well by Jamie Lee Curtis. Annie Bracket (the Sheriffs daughter)and Lynda (idon;t know her last name). Obviously other people fall victim to Michael Myers but they are the main 3. We don't see a kill for an hour or so, but the suspense is there. Then he claims the life of Annie, then Lynda's boyfriend, then Lynda herself. Unaware of the deaths, Laurie goes to see what is going on at the house across the road from the house she is baby sitting in,Thinking that her friends are joking. but she finds them dead and then is chased by Michael Myers which has you at the edge of your seat. All this time Michael has been pursued by his former Doctor Sam Loomis and Sheriff Bracket, while Michael struggles with Laurie, Dr Loomis shoots Michael six times, Michael then falls of the balcony, but then when he looks, Michael is gone,End of film. Great ending to a great film.<br/><br/>The Music in this film is brilliantly done, especially the theme, all are quite scary.<br/><br/>This film is brilliantly done, and is one of my favourite films.<br/><br/>Overall i give it 9/10"

"RickHarvey","9","1","4","4 November 2009"," Just another gem from the 70's
","This use to be my favourite film of all time when I was only 11 . But as time progresses , I have lost huge interest in Halloween, in fact it been years since I thought of watching it again. After watching it again, it still clear that Halloween is still one of my favourites and one of the greats of the horror genre. The whole film is based hugely on voyeurism, not in an perverted way, but from the eyes of an evil man ( if you can call him man) who is obsessed of killing an specific type of person. In this case, the killer in this film only has one thing in mind, to kill his sister.<br/><br/>The film mainly takes place in an small town. Once the film takes you to this town, there no escaping . The horror takes place on one street, between two houses. This is what Carpenter does best, trapping the audience within this small space. What makes the film terrifying is the thought of being watched . Throughout the film , Laurie ( Lee Curtis) is being freaked out by an figure which she keeps seeing. At the first , she suspicious but as the Halloween night progresses , she gets one scare to many . This is not one of those films which the killer just jumps out and kill, giving the audience an slight shock. In Halloween, each death is built up with tension . Often the killer is seen in the background, signifying that he hunting his prey.<br/><br/>There are many things that make Halloween memorable. One of them is Donald Pleasance as Dr Loomis. The one who only knows the true terror of the killer. His Description of Myers in the Myers house is one of the biggest highlight of the film. Then there the opening sequence which consists of an POV shot from an Six year old boy's eyes. For the first time, the audience is put in the killers shoes. There's also the last twenty minutes which in my opinion is one of the greatest finale in horror history. Then to put the icing on the cake, to add a little more terror is the chilling soundtrack which today is highly recognisable.<br/><br/>Halloween is an complete package. It was the biggest horror film since Psycho. It reinvented the horror genre and also invented the slasher genre. Halloween remains one of the greatest horrors of all time and is a must see"
"jattunit","10","1","4","1 November 2009"," The scariest day - for us...
","October sky looms in every year and there is no other month like it, November gets too cold and October lives on a scale of just chilly. October marks a day at the very end which we know is the devil's day, Halloween. The scariest day in the year. For me Halloween has always been interesting and a fun time right since my childhood but this film changed my opinion on it altogether.<br/><br/>Early this month it was my mother's day and I began to chose a gift for her, I found the gift and then I had a evil thought that why don't I buy a scary movie for myself and I actually got away with buying a '18' movie (as I was 17 during the time). So the night I got to see the movie it was late and I just switched it on as my Dad was working late and I had to open the door for him, it was the strike of 12. I saw the whole movie before his arrival. Before his arrival I looked out of my bedroom window, it was pitch dark and I thought, I know where John got his idea.<br/><br/>John has made a movie about the darker side of Halloween, taking away the trick or treating or the fun partying, just a crazy masked killer killing people on one street during this night. The boy only 21 years old who was caught murdering his sister at the age of 6. A boy who knows no the difference between right or wrong, evil or good just pure evil in the back of his mind. The characters are kept alive, because the characters could be you or me, but Micheal Myers in no one. This is where John aces. In a small package, the film is suppose to be a slasher but this was more of that. This built the atmosphere of Halloween. Some scenes really do make your hair stand up, and some scenes need to be noted like:<br/><br/>When Doctor Loomis explains his account on Myers. Micheal's sister's body is missing from the graveyard. Little boy Tommy is teased at school that the bogeyman is out for you<br/><br/>But just imagine, a cold night, the scariest day in year and a masked killer killing people on your street and this killer is still unknown. The good idea of keeping this doctor played by Donald Pleasence was there to explain this boy and why reason is he killing, wonderful!<br/><br/>Overall, the film does intend to scare you and for the people who don't get scared easily will get scared from the thought of Myers. John intended to make people feel Myers is human, but slowly into the film he is nothing but a bad spirit, inhuman even. At first I misunderstood this film but it later grew on me. The perfect film for the holiday and for the month of October. A big salute going to John who made this on the effort of such a small budget but it went down so well, only a proper film maker can do so.<br/><br/>4.5 out 5"
"lucianomarzo92","9","1","4","1 November 2009"," Halloween!
","I saw this movie for the first time last night: Halloween night. I had wanted to see it for a long time, and was very excited to finally get the chance to see it. It was just as great as I expected it to be. To me, Halloween has both the greatest atmosphere, and setting for a horror movie. It may not be the ""best"" horror movie ever, but its got to be the best slasher. Halloween is a true staple of horror. It takes what is already a great concept for a scary movie and makes it even better by making it take place on Halloween night. <br/><br/>Because of this, it is the most fitting, appropriate movie to watch on the night of Halloween. It is really the perfect setting, and works out very well for the movie. Halloween has a great script alone, but its transition to film is incredible. To call the movie engaging would be an understatement. Halloween is thrilling, from start to finish. It also has a haunting score. An edge-of-your seat suspenseful score, that is both creepy and foreboding. Its my personal favorite horror movie soundtrack. It is one that when accompanied with the stark face of Michael Myers, is sure to induce fear. As for the character of Michael Myers, we don't know much about him, other than his doctor's description of him, as a maniac.<br/><br/>We don't really know why he is set out on killing people. He doesn't seem to be filled with hatred, or wickedness. Its just what he does. He also seems to posses a supernatural quality. He is seemingly invincible: he is never defeated in the movie, despite being attacked several times. He also appears out of nowhere, and then disappears. And our protagonist, Laurie, is the only one to ever see him. Her friends don't see him, and think she's imagining him. Michael's plan of attack is slow but sure. He seems like he is in a trance while he is after his victims. It is a trademark of his: He doesn't even have to chase them, as any other slasher does. He walks.<br/><br/>And he is still able to get them! All of this is what makes Michael so scary. Michael Myers is an elusive villain. He's not in-your-face like a lot of horror villains. His appearances are subtle. We often see him in the dark, only a piece of him, or we see him from a distance (if we see him at all). We also never know when Michael Myers is about to pop up. There are certain times in the movie where Michael seems to have a golden opportunity to jump out from the bushes, but he doesn't. He normally appears when you're least expecting it.<br/><br/>The movie makes the holiday of Halloween even more fun. I believe that movies like Halloween are such a classic that you they are essential to watch for the full enjoyment of the holiday. Not just for horror fans, for everybody. Everybody who wants to enjoy Halloween to its fullest, that is. I think movies like this are every bit as crucial to Halloween, as is trick or treating, or candy corn. Honestly, what kind of Halloween would you have without trick-or-treating? A bland one. It would be just like thanksgiving with no turkey, or Easter with no chocolates. It would be just like any other day. Definitely watch this movie; watch it on Halloween night."
"Red_Identity","Null","1","4","3 August 2009"," The King of all Horror Films!
","Halloween is simply the King of Horror films. It is so suspenseful, has amazing long tracking shots that make it so scary and thrilling unlike any other film in history. The opening sequence, one that makes us see everything Michael Myers is seeing and we follow him through his point of view, it is so well done and one of my favorite scenes of film. What Can I say that has not already been said. Halloween (1978) is a classic, and no horror film ever will touch it's scare factor. There are a lot of other almost equally as great horror films, like The Evil Dead, but that in a milestone in horror/comedy, and ultimately different. One of my all-time faves, horror or not, Halloween proves a force to be reckoned with."

","""Halloween"", a movie a lot of people consider to be the most suspenseful and therefor best horror movie ever made, just didn't really do it for me. The premise is good enough, but the supposed tension that everybody keeps mentioning, I can't really find it or get into it. I'm really trying to like this horror classic, I'm genuinely trying to be interested but it just isn't working. Especially that scene where Laurie is stuck in the wardrobe, are we actually supposed to be believe she has any chance of getting killed? Perhaps that's the problem, you know exactly who lives and who dies. We see our main girl running, but I know she's never in any danger, because she's the main girl. I see some secondary player who I know won't make it until the end, and it's still not scary. And even though Myers has been in a mental institution for quite a while, he sure takes his sweet time for everything. He could have killed every character ten times during the course of this movie. Maybe it's just dated, but I can't really say that about any other John Carpenter movie. A mystery to me."
"falcon1111","7","1","4","24 October 2005"," Great for an indie movie of the 70's, but...
","I just watched this movie again after seeing it 20 years ago. I think it has good moments, good music and creates a good atmosphere, but I also think it has some really bad moments. For instance, the silly thing they do with Michael all the time, kind of NOW YOU SEE ME, NOW YOU DON'T, NOW YOU SEE ME, NOW YOU DON'T, after the 3rd or 4th time it REALLY gets irritating and predictable. Also there are lots of very illogical stuff (I'm not talking about the reactions of people in panic situations)like for instance: Where did Michael learned to drive ?? only God knows, and don't tell me they explain it in the next movies, that's a bad excuse for poor storytelling. You don't let your viewers guessing on things like that. But the most illogical and cheap NONSENSE in the whole movie is that Mr. Meyers simply refuses to die. And guess what ? nobody explains in the film why. Seems to me like a cheap resource to force you to see the next, and the next, and the next, to find (maybe) an answer. To me, IMHO, that is bad storytelling. Don't get me wrong. It is fun to watch, and worth the rent, but is no way near to a good terror film. My 2 cents, anyway."
"LebowskiT1000","6","1","4","1 December 2002"," Why is this film so popular?
","Before reading this review, you have to understand that I am really not a fan of the horror genre on the whole.  Most horror films are boring, plot-less, and just all around uninteresting.  So, that is probably why it has taken me 24 years of life to finally get around to watching the first of the Halloween films.  ...And on top of my dislike for horror films, I also have a strong dislike for John Carpenter.  He's had a few good ones here and there, but some of his films could have been great, but he screwed them up (in my opinion).  Anyhow on with the review.<br/><br/>I realize that this film as made in 1978, so it's somewhat hard to gauge the scary-ness of this film.  Personally, I didn't find the film to be very scary at all, creepy ok, but scary no.  I guess I can see how this would be scary back in the late 1970's or early 1980's, but not so much today.<br/><br/>The plot was just terrible in my opinion.  I was expecting more of a back-story for Michael Myers, but all I got was that he was a psycho little kid and he grew into a psycho adult.  Not terribly interesting.  I don't really know what I was expecting, but whatever it was, I didn't get it.  I was also expecting some sort of explanation as to why he wears the white mask.  But...all I got was that it was Halloween, so it was fitting for the killer to be wearing a mask.  Also, while I'm thinking of it.  Why did they credit the character of Michael Myers as ""The Shape""?  STUPID!!!  I'm sorry, but that is a retarded name for the killer, just call him what he is, Michael Myers.<br/><br/>I've read numerous reviews saying how much they loved John Carpenter's score.  I really feel like the minority here, but you have got to be kidding me?!?!  John Carpenter is a terrible composer!  I can't believe people actually like his so-called music.  There were actually a few times I wanted to mute the tv because the music was so awful.<br/><br/>The acting is this film was nothing spectacular.  Donald Pleasence was ok, but nothing great.  Just another horror movie actor to me, they're all pretty much the same.  Jamie Lee Curtis was pretty good in her role, but again, nothing great.  I've never heard of any of the other cast members, both good and bad acting.  Typical horror movie acting, what can I say?<br/><br/>I don't really think I'm in a position to recommend this film to anyone, but if you're a fan of horror movies that you probably ought to see this.  I only say that because obviously a lot of horror fans like this film, so perhaps you'll like it too.  There's also a huge number of allusions to this film in other films, so it's good to be able to spot them.  If you do end up seeing the film, I hope you enjoy it more than I did.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"

"The-Sarkologist","4","1","5","12 August 2012"," A rather silly slasher flick
","I find this an interesting movie because it is about the serial killer. From what I have noticed, there are three types of horror movies that seem to come out from Hollywood: the supernatural nasties, the serial killers, and Stephen King Horror movies. The supernatural nasty style are generally quite lame (The Gate, Ghoulies, Poltergeist), the serial killer is over done (Urban Legends, and I include Freddies Nightmares in here as well), and the Stephen King horror movies seem to fall into a category of their own. There are also disturbing movies, but these are far from being horror, and very few of them come from Hollywood.<br/><br/>In 1962 (or thereabouts) a young boy brutally murders his sister and is locked up. In 1979 the boy escapes from gaol. He has been basically locked up because he is seen as a threat to society, but somebody locked up simply because of that is liable to generate a deep resentment to society and become a threat to society. The film simply says that he is inherently evil and should be locked away. This is something I do not agree with because firstly everybody is inherently evil, and secondly such a nasty person will still have a redeemable side. To add to this, this character seems to be able to resist quite a lot to damage, including a knife in the neck and bullets in the chest.<br/><br/>Recently we were discussing the idea of my friend's shadow. He claims to have this shadow that tells him to do all these rather nasty things. Our opinion is that this is something that everybody experiences, and some (a very few number) actually listen to these sickening thoughts and perform them. Most of us are able to dismiss them as stupid, and some become disturbed because they believe that they have a mental disorder, and believe that they must be different from the rest of the world. Yes, they are different because the rest of the world generally ignores these thoughts.<br/><br/>Anyway, this is how I would view the bad guy in this movie. He is simply a perverse individual that thinks the sickening thoughts that run through his head are in fact a good idea, and follows him. We would like to deny that such thoughts exist, but it is part of our human nature. We are a fallen and nasty people who choose to ignore God, and by doing that, all sorts of perverse thoughts cross through our mind.<br/><br/>Another thing that strikes me with this movie is that it is in a small town. This may be stereotypical, but it is surprisingly real life. The reason I say that is because the most disturbing things seem to happen in small towns. It is not because country people are more perverse that city people, but because of the smaller population, the chances of something really bad happening is much smaller, so when it does, it seems doubly horrific. Thus comes the comment of: how could such a horrid thing happen in a place like this - and my answer is easily - some humans are sick and perverse individuals. Some of us are able to control our animal urges, others of us cannot, and a small number let them over come them and devour their sense of reason.<br/><br/>Finally there is the idea of the bogeyman. It sounds childish and stupid, but remember that when one is a child, the bogeyman is not at all stupid. In fact he is quite intimidating. This is the feeling that we have in us that something is just hiding around the corner ready to destroy us. There are two aspects to this that I wish to draw out, not that they are really connected with the movie. The first is that we are truly not safe. No matter where we go, there are perverse and stupid individuals that can and will harm us. Then there is the natural order, in its groans to call that Christ returns, rises up and destroys us. Those of us that believe that we are safe, truly live with a false sense of security.<br/><br/>Secondly, there is somebody waiting around the corner ready to confront us. This is not a sick or perverse individual, but God himself. God is not hiding from us though, we simply chose to pretend that he is not around. God knows everything that we have done and is preparing to judge us according to our sins. One must remember that pay off a sin with a good deed simply doesn't work, and even if it did, in general our sinful deeds far outweigh our good deeds. And omissions to act do count as sins in God's eyes, and even if we are the most perfect person in the world, if we do not acknowledge God as the supreme ruler of the universe, then that is sin because we have rejected God. The only way that our sins can be ignored, is if we allow Jesus to take our place. By doing that, we have no fear of judgment because when God goes to look at our sins, all he sees is the perfect life of Jesus Christ."

","What a classic this is. So low on everything just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre but still people believe to think that they saw gore and blood. But they were so wrong. It is the atmosphere and the way of filming that created this classic. Due the fact that there is a lot of talking in it still you are attracted to the screen because John Carpenter did an excellent job. But don't forget the cast in it who are all believable and giving the best of themselves. Halloween was low budget and started a new era in horror. The slasher genre. Friday the 13th was written soon after Halloween and they wanted to copy the story but on a location and look, another classic was born. Both had some kind of supernatural killer and a soundtrack that still sticks in your mind after all those years. Friday had K-K-K-Kill Ma-ma-ma-ma and Halloween had the well known riddle made by Carpenter. As I said before you also have to mention the way the camera was used. Extreme long shots and shots revealing things after a while. <br/><br/>Funny was to see that on television The Thing(1951)was playing. John remade it 4 years after Halloween. But naturally Halloween had it's problems with releasing it on DVD. That's a strange thing because there's no gore or blood in it as I said before so in Europe it was released at 87 minutes, the US version was 93 minutes and the NBC extended version was 104 minutes. I have seen all versions in one day just to see where they have added something or had made some cuts. <br/><br/>The difference between the US and European version lays in the fact that there were more cuts in the nudity. Okay, there wasn't that much nudity in it, only in the beginning and P.J.Soles making love with her friend. In the U.S; version there's more to see from her breasts then in the European version were they cut out the nipple shots. But it's the extended version that had a difference of 11 minutes. here in Europe it isn't that easy to find the extended version, it's available on a German limited release but it easy to get in the US. <br/><br/>NBC bought the rights for 4 million dollar of Halloween to show it on television. But the Standards and Practice Department made a cut in the original movie so NBC didn't had a full feature anymore to broadcast. John Carpenter was asked to shoot some extra scene's to beef up the running time. John agreed and 11 minutes were shot in conjunction with the production of Halloween 2. Debra Hill brought John back for a 3 day shoot with stars Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. It was edited to the original feature ready for a NBC broadcast. For many people the extended version isn't a need to see but for Halloween buffs it's a must see. <br/><br/>There were 4 separate scene's, the best being Loomis' talk with Michael when he was a child . The scene follows just after Michael has killed his sister, and it's the longest scene. We see Michael as a child, a part that was important in Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. Here you see Dr. Loomis talking to Michael at Smith's Grove but naturally he's not responding. Many had a problem with it stating it as taking the horror from Michael away because you can see his face and was wearing normal clothes. Another television scene involves Dr. Loomis discussing Michael's release with the hospital board. It didn't deliver an extra to the flick but it gets a bit deeper into the mind of Loomis. A third scene is of Loomis visiting Michael's room after his escape. The room is shattered and trashed with the word ""sister"" scratched into the back of the door. The final scene involves Laurie answering her door and finding her friend being followed by Michael via a station wagon. So in fact non of those scene's had any gore or red stuff in it.<br/><br/>I have said it before, it hasn't any red stuff but it's the score and the eerie atmosphere that gives the creeps. Some things just take too long before things happens but it is that waiting that works. Just look at Michael waiting disguised as a ghost at a door before doing his killing. A creepy shot, or the way he looked when he pinned a boy at a door. You can see that he had no feelings or whatsoever. <br/><br/>A must have in a horror collection just like Carpenter's other flick The Thing. It still works nowadays, a classic.<br/><br/>Gore 1/5 Nudity 2/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 0/5"

","The best way to describe Halloween is the phrase ""Evil Personified."" It's one of the first of its kind in terms of the slasher genre, and shows exactly what a movie of that genre should be like. Rather than having a melancholy feeling when all this violence is going on, we are fully immersed in the world of these characters and have fear for them. And this is because of one crucial element that is neglected in many horror films old and new.<br/><br/>Halloween has artistry, and is so much smarter than any other horror film of its kind. It knows how to hook you and pull you in. The cinematography, dare I say it, is some of the best ever used in film. Dean Cundey handles the setting and material extremely well as he loans his talents to give this film the eeriest appearance possible.<br/><br/>Cundey was also the cinematographer for two of the Halloween sequels, Escape from New York, all three Back to the Future films, and Carpenter's other film The Thing. He has the uncanny ability of putting the setting into the foreground. Some of my favorite scenes in Halloween are shots of the streets, the darkness of rooms, the first person shots through the window, etc. They are some of the most elegant shots ever seen in a horror film. I think the last time I saw such great camera/setting work was in Argento's Suspiria.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis gives an effective performance, and the film does an amazing job of not stepping on its feet and not depicting her as a helpless female in distress. Curtis brings life and independence in her character rather than the female who just stands there, looks pretty, swears, and screams. If more horror films used characters like the one Jamie Lee Curtis portrayed we'd probably have a smaller body count in some horror films.<br/><br/>The music compliments the film and the cinematography as well. The iconic piano tune from all the Halloween films has been firmly etched in our memory since our first viewing. What makes this song so fantastic is the fact that Carpenter himself wrote the music, and perfectly adds layers of different beats and tones to the song without getting thrown off. Listen to the song, and listen for every time a new synth or a new pitch is added. You'll see the song is handled professionally and exquisitely.<br/><br/>The killer, Michael Myers, would later become one of the most iconic killers in film history next to Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees, respectively. Some of the most effective uses of him is when one character peers out the window into the night to see Myers standing completely still or carrying a body around. Those scenes still to this day are gifted by their atmosphere and their cinematography.<br/><br/>Halloween is one of the best horror films of all time. The only reason it gets called ""not scary"" by people today is because not necessarily scarier things have come out, but films like Hostel and Saw have proved to be bloodier and more limitless. Those aren't bad films, but they're two totally different genre pieces. Halloween is so much smarter than any of the torture porn films because it knows how to scare the audience without splattering them with blood. It's a masterpiece in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, Will Sandin, P.J. Soles, and Nancy Loomis. Directed by: John Carpenter."

","The film is one of cinema's most perfectly engineered devices for saying Boo! In a small Illinois town, the psychopathic killer Michael Myers escapes from an asylum, and stalks teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends.<br/><br/>Halloween is a simple-minded shocker with virtually no plot, just a succession of bloody, slashing attacks in semi-darkness. It's efficiently scary, and so skillfully conceived that it reinvigorated the entire horror genre in late 1970s America. Several of the film's techniques and plot elements have become a standard slasher movie trope."

"cjevans","6","1","5","31 October 2007"," Pretty good, but a classic??????
","Still a pretty entertaining film in spots, with some nice buildup of tension, great music, some good cinematography, but it's overrated due to its unquestionable cinematic milestone status. There's so much silliness: Laurie's dumb, slutty friend, played by P. J. Soles, who was about thirty at this time, and looked it (it's easy to accept P. J. as a tramp--but as a high schooler?!!)--am I the only person thinking how tacky she was during the supposedly thrilling kill scene to have been over at these people's house (where her friend was supposed to be babysitting) having sex with her boyfriend, smoking in their bed and drinking their beer? The whole thing was just an excuse to show off her breasts, this being at heart a cheap 70s horror flick, but it lacks the thrills it should have. The scene where all the bodies pop out at Laurie is so over the top as the be hilarious, not horrifying, and how can Laurie keep killing this guy and then he comes to life again? It's dumb. Of course, this film set the pattern for all the horror film clichÃ©s over the next thirty years (sluts get killed after showing their breasts, good girl survives, killer inexplicably survives stabbing, shooting, explosions, etc.), so I guess people just accept this stuff without question as ""tradition."" Donald Pleasance is very good as the Van Helsing figure, but he remains too disconnected from the action of the film until the end. He did more to convince me of the evil of Michael than Michael did--he needed some more screen time. Jamie Lee is great--unlike her the actresses playing her two friends, she very much comes off like a high school senior. The monster chase of the fair damsel Jamie Lee at the end is good, but not exceptional.<br/><br/>In short, good buildup, poor finish. I know it's sacrilege, but in its own way, Halloween is as silly as those 40s monster films. A film like The Descent actually is better made and scarier, imo, as is Psycho, among older films. Still, Halloween is better than most of what it spawned over the next thirty years. It just doesn't compare with the nostalgia."
"Jonny_Numb","6","1","5","6 November 2006"," It'll leave you screaming for gore...
","It's hard for me to gush about ""Halloween"" like others do...even seeing it during its recent nationwide, two-night engagement in a tiny theater jam-packed with college-age couples didn't much change my opinion of the film. While hailed as a masterpiece by the likes of Siskel and Ebert (among others, circa 1978), I can't say I've ever really understood why. It's not a 'bad' film, but it ultimately isn't all that good, either. The reason, and perhaps this is just my 25-years-later, misinformed opinion, but ""Halloween"" is just too damn SUBTLE for its own good. While I am of the notion that subtlety and atmosphere can produce more scares than gore (check out ""Carnival of Souls""), director John Carpenter takes it to such a level that his shortcomings become painfully apparent. The chilly Midwestern setting sets an appropriate mood, and the scenes with the late Donald Pleasance possess an effective fearfulness; Carpenter knows how to frame a great shot (the scene of Michael Myers standing behind a tree watching his future prey is a fine example), and his score is minimalist and spooky. Unfortunately, the dialog is trite to the point of tedium (generic girl-talk from the girls; vague 'evil-speak' from Pleasance) and the characters are so ill-developed that it's hard to get excited, scared, or upset at their eventual demise. And it comes to a point where all the declamatory musical cues hinder the scares instead of heightening them; it's as if Carpenter had little confidence in his scares working on their own merits, and inserted the 'stingers' to make it blatantly obvious. Personally, I think Carpenter scored more successfully with ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and post-""Halloween"" efforts like ""Christine"" and ""Prince of Darkness."" <br/><br/>After that long laundry list of complaints, there are some tidbits of quality to be seen: a young Jamie Lee Curtis, well-cast as The Final Girl; the subtle menace of Myers, when shown, is effective; Carpenter's establishment of the 'indestructible killer' clichÃ©; and during its most suspenseful parts, the director does put us on the edge of our seats. The widescreen print I viewed recently presented information I'd never seen in any of the cropped VHS releases (including Michael Myers ascending the staircase at the very end), which was cool. And watching it in the theater allowed me the pleasure to imagine that great ending being the ABSOLUTE end, and that no other sequels ever came about (it's a pity reality dictates otherwise). ""Halloween"" is well-made and highly influential, but in all honestly, its imitators (""Friday the 13th"") and predecessors (""Psycho"") hold more entertainment value."
"Rosebud_Sled","8","1","6","3 November 2019"," ""Happy little accident""....
","...is what I've come realize this film is. The alignment of the stars; tight budgeting & schedule along with the overall zeitgeist of the time have as much (perhaps more) to do with the effectiveness of this modest production as much as John Carpenter does. It can be argued it's a small miracle it turned out the way it did given Carpenter's ambivalent attitude (smoke puffs, anyone) and his subsequent track record. As we're continually reminded, accidents cannot be repeated."

"colinjbooth","5","1","6","2 October 2018"," Is this a spoof?
","I acknowledge that Halloween contains so many familiar beats from modern 'horror' films, as well as being responsible for everything tired now about the genre. <br/><br/>Whilst recognising it's influence (a la Citizen Kane) I must also admit I can't really get on with it. At times it is hilariously bad. The acting is really bad. The ADR whimpers are comical, particularly from JLC in the closet. <br/><br/>It is without tension, isn't scary at all, and betrays its $300,000 budget at every turn. <br/><br/>John Carpenter does show his promise though, the compositions and photography by Dean Cundey is admirable, and the iconic music (also by Carpenter) is very good.
 It just made me laugh far too often, particularly the last ten minutes when JLC repeatedly injures Myers, only to immediately toss a weapon onto the floor near him, and turn her back, staring into space. Hilarious, and if the same actions were in a spoof film then we would've been laughing about the same as we did in this 'chiller'. <br/><br/>Amusingly average."
"Aaron1375","9","1","6","3 February 2004"," The original and still the best.
","This movie started off the wave of slasher movie copycats and was the beginning of an era.  Though some will argue TCM and ""Black Christmas"" were also partly responsible for the explosion of slasher flicks.  This was I believe Carpenter's second film the first being ""Assault on Precinct 13"". This movie has great atmosphere (a Carpenter trademark), music, and tension. This movie involves the super killer Michael Myers before he made to many movies and became increasingly annoying.  The plot was simple, no grandiose settings and bizarre situations were needed for this very good and suspenseful film.  This one simply has a maniac escaping from a mental hospital and returning to the town he grew up in, on Halloween and he isn't in the best of moods.  He ends up terrorizing a baby sitter played by Jamie Lee Curtis who is watching a young boy for the night.  This one has some good deaths and some very memorable scenes (I love it when Myers sits up). After this film a sequel would follow that would be rather good and then part 3 which was interesting, but did not really have anything to do with the first two.  The rest are just plain awful.  This movie also has the most Halloween feeling of the bunch.  You feel as if it is Halloween here and not just a few decorations scattered here and there.  The second one did it well too.  The rest of them starting with four though all feel kind of generic. They just don't seem like Halloween."

","This is a great example of classic horror at its best. When he was very young Michael Myers was a psychopathic child, he even murdered his own big sister. When he was older he was put in an asylum and being examined by Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). He saw that Michael had the blackest eyes and his mind was pure evil. Unfortunately, now 15 years older, Michael has managed to escape and is hiding in his home town. Living in this town are some babysitters, including (in her very first role) Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode, Michael's sister. The village is preparing for Halloween, and she soon becomes a target for the terrifying masked killer. He just will not die, I've heard of the sequels, and Michael has been stabbed, shot, fallen off a roof, even had his head chopped off. Unless he's being copied, he is just unstoppable. But anyway, this original genius film was brilliant. Jamie Lee Curtis was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 68 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 7 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments. Outstanding!"

"Ascendingsun","Null","0","1","10 January 2020"," The journey into the depth and purity of consciousness.
","The film can be very scary during and after the viewing experience. It is hard to listen to the score without an inkling to turn it off or go away, it is a terrifying experience on a purely vibrational level poenetrating our psyche, and that is what it can make it a dangerous film if we're not protected or grounded enough. The same like most Carpenter's scary films, one can not watch them often, that's how powerful this is.<br/><br/>Halloween contains an energy that helps us to jump straight into a more theta wave of brain activity, the realm of subconscious and that is the most attractive to a lot of viewers, who wish to abandon all the intellect and mind chatter inside for once, who consciously may not be aware of this happening subconsciously to them. It has very little to do with fear on screen, it is more the fear of unknown that we felt when we were little. The film is made almost as if we were inside Michael Myer's brain, we feel what it is like to be in some way mentally inhibited the same like many autistic children are often, it is a very innocent type of a vision through which Myers sees the world or we are guided to see the film.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has made the film called The Ward much later in life, that is to me a truer sequel to Halloween, showing me how the sequels could really be, completely unrelated except for theme, energy or atmosphere, which is where deep down it really matters more than the plot or characters. The Ward examines the Myers' world, on a much deeper level, as to what it feels like, the inability to escape from one's mind directed by a set of programs stemming from the childhood. That film does that more than any other Halloween sequel, that may be aimed largely for the public unable to face the change, who may be driven to be experiencing more of the same, even though desiring a change, perhaps sharing Myers' mind to some extent.<br/><br/>One doesn't have to say whether it is a great film or not, all films are great, if your senses are great enough."

","Great film that proves that for making a horror film, doesn't have to have a big budget, or in this case to not even afford fake blood, because this film, literally had no blood.<br/><br/>This film is about Michael Myers, a mentally unstable young man, stalking Laurie Strode, a young student and babysitter, for a reason that we don't learn until the sequel, and also he kills everyone in his way.<br/><br/>The music that Carpenter wrote make you chill even in todays standards. It's a classic music that some years ago if you would listen at it, you would find it very familiar but you wouldn't know where is it from, but now it think that almost everyone know its roots, so this fact makes me really happy.<br/><br/>Although it's not the first slasher film, I do consider it as the mother of the slashers, because it literally did rocked the subgenre. Without Halloween, we wouldn't have had all the rest slashers of the 80s and 90s, so I'm very grateful for this.<br/><br/>Carpenter was very influenced by gialli films and this is very obvious for a person that have watched many gialli. So definitely it's not the most authentic thing in the world (but what's authentic anyways?).<br/><br/>So as I've said. This film is not gory at all. It has nothing of blood. Although everything is onscreen, blood and gore are not visible.<br/><br/>The music and the general vibes are creepy though. You hear constantly of Michael's breath, which is really disturbing and you also have some first point of view scenes.<br/><br/>I didn't liked that much Jaimie Lee Curtis' acting. I didn't found her convincing enough. Nor the other characters except Pleasence, who was very professional and great at doing eccentric roles. I'm not saying that Curtis is a bad actress. She was kind of convincing in the screaming parts, but in the ""relaxed"" parts, not so much. Fair enough that she is the ultimate ""Scream Queen"".<br/><br/>It's kind of slow paced, but I think that it builds tension.<br/><br/>In general, nice idea, nice directing, not so good performances, but realistic enough. Creepy vibes and a classic slasher film that it influenced by gialli films, but it was influence and landmark for later ones horrors."

","Teenage girls in jeopardy is usually a good ingredient for horror, and director John Carpenter makes the most of the situation in Halloween, a tense and frightening film that is being released by Compass International Pictures. Carpenter obviously knows the genre well and he builds a properly terrifying atmosphere through his well-paced direction. It's an effective entry for its intended market.<br/><br/>The screenplay by Carpenter and producer Debra Hill concerns a boy who kills his babysitter on Halloween night and who, 15 years later, escapes from a mental institution to return to the scene of the crime to seek additional victims. The script offers little in terms of motivation or development, but it works strictly in terms of horror as several teenage babysitters are stalked by the masked psychomaniac.<br/><br/>Carpenter creates excellent tension throughout and he avoids excessive blood and gore in the murder sequences. The violent actions are mostly implied more than graphically depicted, which serves to heighten the effect.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasance stars as the doctor who has tried to keep the maniac locked up and who attempts to warn the town when he escapes. He creates a strong presence, but it's basically a one-dimensional role, designed to provide necessary plot information. Jamie Lee Curtis is excellent as the girl around whom the action revolves and she creates a natural, sympathetic character. Good support is provided by Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles as her two friends and by Charles Cyphers as the town's sheriff."

","Happy Halloween and welcome to my review of the movie that inspired all the slasher movies, the original Halloween movie, which came out in 1978 and it's still holding itself to this very day!<br/><br/>Halloween was directed by John Carpenter, and written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Starring Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis and Nick Castle as The Shape.<br/><br/>And it's about a young boy who kills his sister on Halloween of 1963, and is sent to a mental hospital. After 15 years he escapes and returns to his home town in order to wreak havoc.<br/><br/>There's no doubt that Halloween 1978 set the standard for modern horror films, no CGI, low budget.. but it had John Carpenter behind the camera to direct and build a scary -one of the scariest- slasher-horror atmosphere!<br/><br/>What makes this day holding up like this, are the true suspense and tension which were there throughout the whole movie, combined with the infamous OST, composed by Carpenter himself, and maybe that's another thing that made this movie so scary, because Carpenter knew what could go on with his scenes, so he composed it the way he directed it.. he was very clear about those stuff in his interviews.<br/><br/>And what makes this movie really scary is The Shape himself! His mask, which became iconic and nightmarish, his slow moving style, because actually, and that what most of the slasher-directors forgot nowadays, is that rushing wasn't scary, the suspense was never there when the killer ran or moved quickly, it was all about the slow-moving style, that what could build an intense atmosphere! But above all, his silence, nothing is scarier that a guy standing right there, not saying a word, no reaction.. nothing! Thinking about that only makes you scared, and that movie does use that tension pretty well to create its own atmosphere.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence as Loomis, who's my favorite character in this movie, alongside with The Shape, has an amazing scene describing how do The Shape's eyes look like, and how soulless is he, that scene is just simply scary, because it's just not words, you could see that in The Shape's actions, and that what makes him so special, and iconic!<br/><br/>What makes him also iconic is his backstory, which is shown briefly, and that what makes it good, that he's just a psycho, no other motive shown throughout the movie, not until the sequel, but him having no motive to kill, except being a psycho is just amazing, that what the sequel didn't understand, neither did the two remakes.<br/><br/>This movie is so amazing and catchy from start to finish, but unfortunately it's not flawless, my biggest issues with the movie is Annie, played by Nancy Kyes, sometimes she acted well, but most of the time she was terrible, there's a specific scene when she was talking to Laurie, played by Jamie Lee Curtis, by the telephone, and that scene bugged me so much, if you watched the movie you will know what I mean.
Also towards the end when The Shape started his attack on Laurie, she started screaming, and she wasn't good at that at all, it was one of worst screaming I ever heard, besides that she did a great job in this movie, but screams.. NO!<br/><br/>Halloween 1978 is a classic horror movie to watch each Halloween and get yourself a blanket, and get yourself some good scares.<br/><br/>Halloween is definitely a great horror movie, and the best of the franchise, and maybe the best Halloween-Special movie, the movie that inspired and influenced all slasher movies, if not all horror movies, it still has a couple of flaws, but still a great movie, and close to perfect!<br/><br/>I'm gonna give the 1978 Halloween an A!<br/><br/>Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review!

","Ah, Halloween. One of the best horror films of all time. It's a simple story about an escaped murderer going around and killing on Halloween. The atmosphere this film gives out is so realistic that it still manages to be scary to this day. The film decides that minimal to no gore is best and it works! The fact that we know very little about the killer (at least until the sequels) makes this film scary. The acting in this film is top notch. The film is slow at times (which is why this film has not been awarded a perfect score). Some scenes where it is slow, it adds tension but in some instances, it just feels not needed. But, what we get is a classic that is a must watch on Halloween every year."

","Evil swoops out of nowhere and settles into middle America in this granddaddy of American slasher films.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is nothing great, but it has several interesting elements in a terrain in which locks, doors, and windows can't protect.<br/><br/>There is a highly predictable story here -- extending all the way to the movie's sequel-guaranteeing final frame -- and one can see the attacks by mute monster Michael Myers from a mile away.<br/><br/>US slasher films were inspired by Hitchcock's 1960 classic ""Psycho,"" and the Giallo genre of Italy, led by the likes of director Dario Argento (""Suspiria, 1977). ""Halloween"" starts eerily with a flickering jack-o-lantern and a tinkling of piano keys highly reminiscent of the score from ""Suspiria.""<br/><br/>The action transpires in white-picket-fenced Haddonfield, Ill., a place you'd never expect the mayhem that plays out. Early on, we zoom in on an English class, where foreshadowing arises from a literary theme: ""No matter what course he took, he was destined to his own fate.""<br/><br/>Our protagonist is the real-life daughter of actress Janet Leigh of ""Psycho,"" Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first major film role. Dressed as a dowdy schoolgirl, she does well in a very limited role.<br/><br/>Tension does manage to mount as Laurie glimpses a boogeyman in such places as behind a flapping clothesline of wash -- or does she?<br/><br/>I wouldn't have chosen to view this film, but it was presented as part of a course I am taking in the horror film. What IS scary is that ""Halloween"" spawned so many sequels and imitators. What is it in audiences that prompts them to spend hard-earned dollars on such fare?"

I think I just realized, at some point, that this movie has flaws.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's directing is very dry and clean, here.

Just because it started a genre does not mean it aged well.<br/><br/>The cast is a great example of a major flaw in the film; the only person who can act is Donald Pleasance. He's good, but not great. Everyone from Jamie Lee Curtis to the girl who plays Annie are unbearable and whiney. I don't even think they can pull the humor off. Michael Myers, I believe, is only good because of Carpenter's directing skills and creativity. I think the film is more his baby than anyone else's, because his other films have proven his attention to extreme detail.<br/><br/>The film soares, though, with its atmosphere and score (also created by John Carpenter).<br/><br/>There's plenty of good about this film, but there's plenty of bad, too.

","Well, let me start off by saying that I only really watched this because I wanted to get some context for the 2018 sequel of 'Halloween'. Do I regret watching this movie in 2018? The short answer is no I don't. You can tell that movies nowadays and even TV Shows of the same genre have taken a lot of inspiration from the formula and story of this movie. Look at Friday the 13th, Stranger Things, Don't Breath and more. All of these in some way have taken a fair amount of inspiration from this movie. The problem in watching this movie in 2018 though is simply that it is out-dated. Whether it's the acting, scenery, music and basically anything else but that's to be expected. If you go into this movie thinking you're going to watch something similar to the movies nowadays, you'll be disappointed. This is a movie you watch and shouldn't take too seriously, watch with a few friends and you'll most likely get a laugh out of it.

"Marc_Horrickan","9","0","1","10 October 2018"," A Classic of the Horror Genre That May Finally be Dating
","John Carpenter has enjoyed a remarkable return to cult prominence in the last few years, with TV series like STRANGER THINGS and great recent horrors like IT FOLLOWS and DON'T BREATHE, very clearly paying their dues. HALLOWEEN was the breakthrough film that redefined US horror film and set Carpenter on his genre-heavy career as a cult horror helmer. <br/><br/>I have watched the film countless times since my early teens and it has long since ceased to terrify me. However, repeat viewings have only served to enhance the notion that Carpenter is a master of economy and framing. Look at shots like those where Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis looks one way, then the other as Michael Myers wheels by in the car he stole from the Dr, or the unsettling shot of Myers resurrected for the second time, as he sits bolt upright in the background of a shot that foregrounds Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie and her distraught anguish.<br/><br/>I finally saw the film on the big screen in its 4k reissue tonight, and, as ever, I loved going through the paces with Carpenter and his team, yet on the big screen, with a largely silent audience, I could understand why the likes of Kael originally panned the film. It is a ropy affair in terms of narrative, with Loomis seeming to quite literally just stand around waiting for the the bulk of the film's running time. There is also the infuriating trope of people turning lights off rather than on when walking in to palpably dangerous situations. Finally, there is a real sense of form forcing narrative at the film's end, with Laurie adopting tighter and tighter spaces of the house, as Myers corners her like a frightened rabbit. This latter point I have always thought of as a strength of the film, hinting at how the monstrous masculinity of Myers seeks to dominate and tyrannise the domestic spaces that he is exiled from (those car mechanic overalls are a neat little bit of production design). Yet watching upon the big screen I wonder if the ending isn't actually Carpenter choosing to showcase those incongruously claustrophobic Panavision shots over any reasonable narrative logic. A constant criticism of the film has been the lack of character development that Hill and Carpenter work in to their slender plotting. At least four of the five people who die on screen in the film, have literally no sense of character. Haddonfield also seems remarkably devoid of much activity on Halloween night, with the police presence being restricted to Charles Cyphers occasional doubting returns to doomy Dr Loomis. All in all there are major issues with this 'classic', yet it still gives you at least one good scare, and it is an undeniably succinct piece of low-budget genre filmmaking. I would suggest that STARMAN, THE THING and ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 are all better films in Carpenter's filmography."
"paulclaassen","5","0","2","7 October 2018"," And so a franchise starts...
","The score lends the film a constant foreboding atmosphere, without which the film might not have worked so well. 'Halloween' has a very simple plot with average dialogue, and not-so-good acting (note I didn't say bad). The only reason - I assume - it was such a huge success, is because of this simple premise and because the film bears the name of one of America's favorite holidays. And due to Jamie Lee's likability, off course.<br/><br/>It must have been scary at the time, but unfortunately no longer by today's standards. At times the characters do the stupidest things that people wouldn't normally do given the circumstances. Yet still, this is a classic horror that might have started the slasher genre (although this is not really a slasher film)."

","A soulless killer, Michael Myers, escapes from the asylum and returns to the Illinois town where he murdered his sister 15 years earlier to wreak havoc on Halloween night. Donald Pleasence is on hand as Myers' seriously concerned doctor.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" (1978) is hailed as the progenitor and blueprint for the slasher craze of the 80s with staples like the unstoppable masked killer, fake scares, the final girl and the undead dead. Of course, ""Halloween"" was influenced by earlier slashers or quasi-slashers, like ""Psycho"" (1960), ""Dementia 13"" (1963), ""A Bay of Blood"" (1971) ""Torso (1973), ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" (1974) and ""Black Christmas"" (1974). ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) and its sequels took the ""Halloween"" template and added other elements, like the summer camp setting and a devolving supernatural killer.<br/><br/>Whilst I prefer the ""Friday"" films, ""Halloween"" has more class than many slashers that followed, like the unimaginatively blunt ""The Slumber Party Massacre"" (1982). It also keeps the proceedings deadly serious unlike ones that added humor and campiness, such as ""Friday the 13th Part 3"" (1982). The film establishes some quality atmosphere with the raining sanitarium escape and the Halloween night sequences. The creepy ambiance is helped by the moody score composed and performed by Carpenter.<br/><br/>Although the story takes place in a fictional Illinois town, the film was shot in the Los Angeles area (South Pasadena and Hollywood, etc.), which is okay since the neighborhood scenes could be Anytown, USA. What's NOT okay is how the trees clearly reveal that it's not late October.<br/><br/>Other problems include a tedious lack of drive and some weak dialogue, like the girls' conversation walking home from school, which doesn't ring true. Speaking of the girls, they're decent, but not nearly as good as the ""Friday"" films. Nancy Kyes (Loomis) is arguably the best as Annie, followed by Jamie Lee Curtis as the main protagonist (whose mother, Janet, starred in ""Psycho""). Flighty, but likable PJ Soles is also on hand. Another dubious part is the doctor hiding in the bushes by the abandoned Myers' abode speaking portentously.<br/><br/>I appreciate ""Halloween"" because it's classy, atmospheric and it's a superb pick for the fall season; it also holds an eminent place in horror history. But, in light of the above flaws, it's a tad overrated by gushing fans.<br/><br/>GRADE: B"

","Of course EVERYONE knows John Carpenters HALLOWEEN is an absolute CLASSIC Horror/slasher/

This was one of the first Horror movies i ever saw when i was way too young to really watch it lol but hey i loved it & watched it on t.v every time it was on at Halloween!!! Also had it on video & watched it loads but also i loved The Fog as much & remember both being played alot in my house by my mum so got know the music & atmosphere & the same with the excellent Halloween 3:season of the witch another one i grew up with & loved the creepy music & atmosphere & like The Fog it introduced me to the legend TOM ATKINS!!! love those movies.
I think the fog is a horror CLASSIC too it's just as good but both absolute CLASSIC films!!!
Halloween also introduced me to the excellent Jamie lee curtis & Donald Pleasance!!!
Yes Halloween was a great introduction to Horror & one that is so rewatchable. A nostalgic CLASSIC & still one the greatest films ever MADE.
The Halloween franchise is abit of a mess,the only good films are of course the original classic,the excellent Halloween 2 (1981),the underrated Halloween 3:season of the witch,the fun Halloween 4:The return of Michael Myers,the excellent Halloween H20 & Rob zombies Reboot & sequel are both excellent films!!! But Halloween '78 is ""THE"" movie that properly introduced me to the Horror genre & i became a massive fan since & it was tradition to watch this classic on vhs every Halloween or if it was on t.v i would watch it so yeah like most fans this 70's CLASSIC means alot to alot of people & especially Horror fans.
My love for the Horror genre grew thanks to this 1978 CLASSIC & Jaws & The Fog & H3 season of the witch & Gremlins 1&2 & Ghostbusters 1&2 all these childhood greats helped shape my absolute love for Horror!!!"

","So it's always difficult for someone of the horror movies to watch Aurora classic because if you want to make movies yourself there are a few movies you have to watch to see how they work to understand what they mean by their time and technology Dara he is one and the work is back in it to be able to analyze. I basically like doing that, but not necessarily with horror movies because I really hate horror movies. I always watch the remake without informing about the films and then always a few weeks later I look at the original or the first part and so on. And I have to admit, people are right, the original is better but that does not have that much to say, it's like having a choice of stomach ache and genital pain, of course, the stomach ache is better, but actually just because of keeping your stomach down Crossing the road is a lot less embarrassing. I think the original by John Carpenter is a better movie but I would not say it's a good movie I did not find it boring at all I was invested and I was already worried about the characters especially Jamie Lee Curtis. But I really did not enjoy the movie and there are so few positive things I can say about this movie or even a lot of scenes I remember, now without a joke the biggest reaction I wanted to do was write the babysitter out the window and with the foot stuck in a loop and if that is the only other thing you remember or the only thing you react to in such a movie then that is a bad sign. So I liked the fact that Michael Myers does not even talk about that we know much about him or his motivation that makes me somehow dangerous to the development of which is very interesting and the music of the soundtrack is really exciting, but he repeats himself for my liking often. Still, I found the movie boring and uninteresting almost not saying I think it's good that this movie in contrast to you doing others will not bring any rage moments he did. And at no time did I have to think ""that can even make me better"". Still, my bottom line is that I did not have to see him, I do not want to see him again, and I did not get to look at him."

"andrewnmiller","10","0","1","18 October 2017"," A game changer for horror movies
","When it comes to the horror genre, Halloween was always a movie that seemed to pass me by, but I decided to give it a watch for the month of October and I absolutely loved it! From it's haunting score and brilliant lighting to it's genuinely frightening killer, Halloween is a true masterpiece of horror and without it, the slasher genre wound never have existed.<br/><br/>The movie opens in 1963 where a 6 year old boy named Michael Meyers murders his sister in cold blood. We then cut to 21 years later where Michael's doctor, Sam Loomis appears at the sanatarium where Meyers is been held to take him to court, but before he can do that, Michael nicks the car and speeds off towards Haddonfield while Loomis chases after him. Soon after arriving home, Meyers starts following high school student Laurie Strode and she starts to notch him following her, but her friends laugh at her worries while Loomis meets with the town sheriff and warns him about the danger the town is in. Now, Loomis must stop Meyers from killing again while at the same time Laurie is completely unaware of the danger that is approaching her.<br/><br/>Much like what Sam Raimi did with the first Evil Dead movie, John Carpenter was able to take a tiny budget of 320,000 dollars and frightened the living hell out of an entire generation of film-watchers and was able to demonstrate that a great horror film doesn't need a high budget or a lot of blood and gore in order to arouse a sense of dread in it's audience and sometimes the finest aspect of horror isn't what happens but what is going to happen like what is that shadow that passed by the window or what is that commotion coming from upstairs? Carpenter understands how to use these elements to scare the viewer and he uses every factor of classic horror that a director can use and he may have included some of his own ideas into the final product, something I wish more horror directors would use these days rather than just using the same clichéd horror tropes to provoke a frightening reaction from the audience and it just isn't scary. The viewer isn't going to be scared by jump-scares and a huge CGI monster that bounces out of a wall time after time, rather it's the occasions where the murderer is hiding somewhere, but the viewer just never knows where he'll pop up next that scares people and Halloween certainly accomplishes that in a way that few horror movies can even attempt to do while also being set in a suburban neighborhood rather in out in the woods makes for a much more accessible setting for a slasher movie implying that something like this could happen anywhere. What Carpenter also does with Halloween is he takes an incredibly eerie film score, misleading lighting tactics and yet was still able to create a truly masterful piece of horror film history.<br/><br/>One scene is a perfect representation of this and it's where one of the girls is on her way to get her boyfriend and she tries to unlock the car door only to recognize that she forgot her car keys in the house, she fetches them and returns to the car and unwittingly opens it on her own and while the viewer is able to understand what's happening but the character doesn't have a clue about what is happening so when she does sit down, she sees that the car windows are muddled up. She's confused by this and attempts to brush it off, then Meyers attacks like a pit viper from the back seat. This scene is absolutely fantastic simply because of how it pays close attention to detail as the audience knows what's going to take place but the victim is completely clueless which makes it all the more scary when Michael attacks, but it's also the insightful conclusions John Carpenter made with this movie that have scared film-goers since 1978.<br/><br/>To heighten the sense of dread and terror, Halloween makes use of fuzzy imagery of the murderer loitering in the background, the shadows darkly drift over a wall, rooms illuminated only in darkness, a disturbing story of a boy who killed his own sister and a dangerous and ruthless murderer. Any future horror filmmaker should make a point to watch and analyze Halloween as this movie is the archetype for horror films are all about, hell even Carpenter sought to emulate Alfred Hitchcock with this movie so there's no reason why future horror film directors won't look to Halloween for inspiration. John's camera work is nothing short of perfect but also remains incredibly creepy while continuing to remain erratic throughout the course of the movie and of course, the musical score to Halloween is perfect in every possible way with the central theme being identifiable right when the movie starts and is a memorably cinematic film score that crushes any other opposing horror movie score with it's foot.<br/><br/>Of course, a movie like Halloween would be nothing without great characters and the actors who bring them to life and it's got both. Nancy Keys and PJ Soles do a fine job as the everyday teenyboppers who quickly meet their doom at the hands of Meyers, Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are believable as the two kids, but It's Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis who are the stars. Jamie comes across as a hardy yet likable lead and as the movie progresses, you are behind her and don't want to see her get killed. Curtis was born to play this role and she pulls it off with zero difficulty while Donald Pleasance is outstanding as Dr. Loomis, bringing a cool and reserved but occasionally eerie feeling to this character.<br/><br/>Honestly, what else is there to say about Halloween that hasn't been said already. Go see it for yourself."

","Halloween night is a night of spooks, scares, and fun. It is also a great night to watch John Carpenter's masterpiece of terror. Interesting enough since it takes place on the same night adding atmosphere and suspense.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is probably one of the greatest horror films of all time and what makes it work so well is that it relies on suspense and atmosphere in order to scare the audience instead of blood and gore like most modern horror films do. In a way this could very be the spiritual successor to Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" since it takes many inspirations from that film. The classic story of a deranged mental patient escaping from a mental institution and then stalking teenagers on Halloween night has still managed to retain it's scares and tension even nearly four decades later. The film has been so influential that it popularized the slasher genre and gave rise to imitators throughout the 80s and beyond. While some of the imitators are mildly entertaining, none of them compare to Carpenter's classic film.<br/><br/>Carpenter's direction is superb as it creates an eerie mood. The usage of a piano melody is iconic since it is simple and very effective at generating scares especially whenever the killer is on screen. The usage of lighting rather than blood and gore is very effective at creating an unsettling atmosphere for the film which is something that few horror films duplicate nowadays. It does a great job at making a feeling of uncertainty as we never know when Michael Myers is going to pop up on screen and kill someone.<br/><br/>The acting is great across the board. Jamie Lee Curtis gives a good early performance as Laurie Strode. It is because of this performance that she is known as ""the"" scream queen. But it is Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis who steals the show whenever he is on screen. Loomis is probably one of the best characters in a horror film since he knows what Myers is capable of but few people take him seriously and he has to take matters into his own hands. The rest of the cast is serviceable at best especially the other teen characters which only serve to be victims of the killer. Nick Castle as Micheal Myers is excellent as he is a very imposing and intimidating figure. He never speaks and only breathes very heavily. He comes across as more of a supernatural figure than a person and that makes him all the more terrifying.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is a classic and a must see for horror fans. It created an iconic villain in the form of Micheal Myers and popularized an entire genre of film which has since become cliché. But the original film still remains terrifying thanks to Carpenter's excellent direction and usage of atmosphere. Its a great film to watch on Halloween night."

","I'm not into slasher movies much and this is probably the only one I'll ever see in my entire life that I'll give a rating higher than an 8/10 or ***. What makes this movie so great is of course the atmosphere. I could have sworn that I heard this music being credited to ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"". Well, maybe that person was wrong. My favorite scene is probably at the very beginning where Michael commits his first kill. It's taken from his perspective and then it goes out and shows him as a kid without his mask. You'd think that would be something they'd work hard to hide.<br/><br/>In fact, there are many glimpses of him without his mask and a rather clear one at the end. This might sound funny, but I'm really impressed at how Michael drives a car. In so many of these movies, the killer just randomly appears everywhere and seems to be able to teleport. They actually give a justification for this and make the killer intelligent. The fact that he just exists in the background in many scenes works out great too. They don't just focus on him and instead try to give real development to the side characters, always admirable. ***1/2"

","Halloween certainly does not give you the gore of a modern day horror, but one cannot deny that for a horror film made in the 70's it does compete with the best of today in the genre. A great story with great character development, a unique villain for the time and a ton of suspense. Its's also always fun to see how some great actors today first started out. I feel that you can always watch this movie once a year and still get some enjoyment from it. In the all time great's of horror movies this one definitely deserves a spot. I must say that watching it almost 40 years later, it does not provide the same scare as it once did, but after watching it you just get that sense of feeling that you just saw a classic movie."
"ofpsmith","9","0","1","23 July 2017"," One of the best independent movies ever made.
","Halloween has a simple premise. Fifteen years after murdering his sister, Michael Myers (Nick Castle) escapes from Smith's Grove Sanitarium and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. His psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasance) follows suit to stop him from killing again. As soon as Myers arrives in Haddonfield he begins stalking teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) as she babysits two young kids on Halloween night. As the night progresses most of Laurie's friends are axed off as she tries to escape the seemingly unstoppable Myers. At the end of the movie Loomis shoots Myers off the balcony where he disappears. Made in 1978, Halloween is one of the earliest examples of the modern slasher movie as they've come to be known. An important aspect to note however is the film itself has very little gore or blood. It's more of a suspense thriller, in the vein of something like Jaws or The Shining. It's also easily one of the most effective horror films ever and a prime example of how a film on such a small budget can make such a large impact on movie making. Everything I wrote has probable already been said countless times before so I'll just conclude by recommending it to any movie buff."
"brianberta","9","0","1","25 June 2017"," My favorite slasher film
","The slasher genre is probably the most controversial sub-genre of horror movies. Many people instantly dismiss all modern slashers as garbage while other people find a few of them to be enjoyable. Most slasher films I've seen don't impress me that much. However, some of the earlier slasher films I've seen have blown me away. Before I watched ""Halloween"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" was my favorite slasher film of all time. However, this film has rightfully stolen its throne.<br/><br/>After a boy named Michael Myers is put in a Sanitarium for stabbing his sister to death on Halloween night, he escapes 15 years later to his hometown where he plans to murder people again.<br/><br/>As much as I loved it, it isn't for everyone as it takes a while to pick up. Normally, I would criticize its pacing and give it a 7/10. In the case of this film, however, I wouldn't say that its pacing was flawed, because the first half unnerved me just as much as its latter half did (this is extremely hard to accomplish). There were numerous moments where Myers would follow the protagonists around in broad daylight either on foot or while driving. These moments were well-executed, especially since I wasn't aware of what Myers' intentions were. I wasn't sure if he was going to wait until nighttime to kill people or lure people to uninhabited places and kill them during daytime. This uncertainty made its opening work as well as it did. Many of these moments were also well-edited as Myers would often disappear from view when a character would look away from him briefly, heightening the tension.<br/><br/>The 2nd half is equally intense. The reason it works so well is because Carpenter constantly teases us numerous times by putting the characters in several claustrophobic situations. There were several moments where a character would be in an uninhabited area, making it easy for Myers to kill that character off. Despite what I suspected, however, Myers didn't strike right away. It was almost like the movie was teasing me. These brilliant moments were so suspenseful that the film didn't feel predictable at all give or take 1 or 2 minor scenes at the most (however, even though I was able to predict Lynda's death, that scene didn't feel flawed, because since it went on for a while, it seemed to tease me like the earlier moments did). So, with that being said, I wouldn't say that predictability is a flaw with this movie at all as the few uncommon moments where I was able to predict the end result still felt unnerving to a great degree.<br/><br/>The movie also contained many memorable scenes. The best of which was the opening scene. It was both eerie and disturbing both in the way it was shot and the thought of what went on in it. The movie started off vague, and it left me asking questions about what was going on in the film. As the scene continued on, however, more and more information was revealed. The first person perspective was also a great addition to the scene as it made it more unnerving. Then, the disturbing final shot of the intro stuck with me long into the film. It's one of the most memorable openings to any horror movie I can think of.<br/><br/>There were also a few other aspects I liked about it. The first of which was with its soundtrack. Even though it was minimalistic, it was still a catchy and unnerving tune which sent chills down my spine (it was just as good, if not better, than the minimalistic soundtrack of one of Carpenter's later efforts, ""The Thing""). I also liked that the 2 child protagonists weren't annoying (I often get this feeling with other horror movies for some odd reason). I was also glad that the movie never felt over-the-top with its violence. Finally, the ending was immensely chilling.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is the best slasher film I've ever seen. It's likely going to keep this title for a long time as I doubt that any other horror movie director will top this film (or, at least, not for a long time). Carpenter used different techniques to build suspense to make this film a truly unsettling experience. With fantastic buildup and execution, this film left an enormous impact on me. I liked ""The Thing"" a bit more, but I'd say that both films are about the same in terms of quality."

This film achieves its scares solely based on the story and the way its told on screen, and for that it is fully deserving of the recognition is has earned.

","Going to start this review off with a little note. This might be a biased review. Halloween is one of my favorite movies, if not my favorite. When I first saw this movie, I was about 14. Just looking for something to watch on Halloween night. Flickering through all of the channels on the TV. Seeing shows like The Thing, Peanuts Halloween, and various other Halloween oriented shows. I eventually just stopped on one of them. That show was ""Halloween"". The show just came on, so I did not miss any of it. Anyways into the actual review. When I watched the movie it seemed to me that it inspired a lot of the Jason's and slasher films to come after. And I see why, its very good. My favorite moments in the movie is just the little creepy things it adds to it. Like him killing on Halloween night, the music, the bad acting, and Dr. Samuel Loomis. Honestly the only good acting besides Donald Pleasence, is Jamie Lee Curtis and that's a stretch. From the beginning to the end, it is a must see. 10 out of 10."

","Director John Carpenter brings to life the inhuman, murderous Michael Myers in the film Halloween. Released October 25, 1978, Carpenter takes the idea of an innocent child and turns him into a cold-blooded serial killer. Halloween draws the fear from its audience, grasping their attention, making them want more. Being a horror film, the suspense and anxiety fills the viewers, like myself with anticipation. Halloween is an all-around good horror film that provides its audience with a good scare; from the sinister music, the pale white mask, and the dead silence he provides in every scene. This will always and forever be on of my favorite movies!"

Although he was limited With just 300,000$ he was able to make a legendary film that stands with time and gross 70,000,000$ at the box office. The way he moves his camera the way he builds suspense throughout the whole movie and finishing it is truly fascinating. I consider it one of the best horrors if not even the best.

"rjkjklose","Null","0","2","7 November 2016"," A Classic Horror Flick is Still Terrifying
","John Carpenter is without a doubt one of the most influential horror and science fiction directors of all time. In 1978 he directed and scored ""Halloween"" a simple horror movie that would revolutionize the horror genre forever. Its antagonist Michael Myers has become one of the most iconic movie villains of all time. The painted and disfigured William Shatner mask that was used in the movie is immediately recognizable to anyone who has ever lived through the Halloween season. Though it was filmed for a mediocre budget of 300,000 dollars it managed to rake in nearly 47 million at the United States box office. This makes it one of the most profitable films ever made and in 2016 it was estimated to have earned around 267 million (not counting any of its seven sequels). Despite the influence that this movie made on the horror genre, does it still hold up today? The premise here is sinfully simple: A man escapes an insane asylum on Halloween night and returns to his hometown to cause mayhem on a group of promiscuous teens and their friend. While its 2016 and this concept has been beaten to death by hundreds of horror movies over the last several decades this concept was original for its time. I can't in all honesty criticize the plot here because for its time it was unique. Halloween is well known for popularizing the slasher horror subgenre that would blow up in the 1980's. Many factors lead to the movie becoming such a success, and thankfully many of those same factors are as impactful as they were in 1978. One of the things that works best in this film is the pacing. This movie is intelligent and it never allows its viewers to have a moment of tranquility. The film takes its time building tension while at the same time never feels slow or lethargic. However, when Michael Myers does start down his killing rampage the movie never loses its sense of terror and fear. This is due to Carpenter's amazing direction. John Carpenters direction is easily what made this movie so good. Carpenter shows incredible control over all aspects of this movie from the creepy sound design to camera angles that make the viewer tremble. Overall Carpenter's direction is what carries this film past mediocrity and into horror film fame. A notoriously horrible aspect of this film when it first premiered was the atrocious acting. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) are the only likable and somewhat relatable characters in the film. The rest are awful. I mean it, almost every other character in this film is poorly acted and incredibly stupid. This is one of those cases where the acting is so poor that it gives the film an almost lighthearted nature. Since viewers can't relate to these characters they might end up cheering for their demise. I know that's harsh to say, but viewers of the film will completely understand. Thankfully, the rest of the movie balances out. The score (written by John Carpenter himself) is a classic. Every time the theme song plays, viewers know that Myers is near and ready to strike. The theme song is immediately recognizable while at the same time thrilling, even after nearly 40 years. Honestly, sound design here is remarkably impressive especially for a film with such a low budget. The most impressive feat that this film accomplished is without a doubt the fact that even after so many years this films is still scary. This film is nearly timeless and it evokes a sense of dread among its viewers that few movies can claim. Nearly every scene in this movie is wonderfully shot and its cinematography is terrifyingly beautiful. Ultimately, Halloween stands the test of time as one of the best horror films ever made and a film that still terrifies audiences today. Score: 9.5/10"

"MaximumMadness","10","0","2","30 October 2016"," ""Halloween""- One of the greatest experiences in horror ever crafted.
","""Black cats and goblins and broomsticks and ghosts... Covens of witches with all of their hosts... You may think they scare me, you're probably right... Black cats and goblins, on Halloween night... Trick or treat!""<br/><br/>Those words, a comparatively adorable and childish rhyme, usher in the beginning of one of the greatest experiences in horror ever crafted. Deliciously terrifying and capable of chilling you to the very core, John Carpenter's iconic classic of mayhem and murder still stands tall nearly forty years later as perhaps one of the greatest films ever made. I am of course referring to the legendary film known as ""Halloween""- a pioneering achievement that not only created virtually every trope and cliché of the slasher-film genre that we know today, but also showed how they could all be performed with craft and class.<br/><br/>Set 15 years after a six year old child named Michael Myers murders his older sister without reason on Halloween night, the film follows two relatively disconnected story lines. When the now 21-year-old Myers escapes his captivity in a mental institution, his obsessive Psyichiatrist Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) begins tracking him back to his home in Haddonfield, Illinois, sure that his former patient has only the most deadly of motivations in returning. At the same time, a group of teenage girls including the somewhat sheltered Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) are about to embark on a Halloween night of babysitting, unaware that they will become prime targets in the violent homecoming of the deranged and inhuman Myers.<br/><br/>While perhaps antiquated by today's standards, Carptenter's film is one that has continued to enthrall and thrill audiences even to this day. The script co-written by Carpenter and then-girlfriend Debra Hill is amongst the most finely-tuned in the slasher film genre. It is a carefully assembled machine where every single sequence is expertly written to contribute towards the furthering development of story, character or atmosphere, without the need for excessive filler or meandering diversion. It's a perfectly constructed puzzle, with all of the pieces fitting just into place, as it builds throughout a 90 minute runtime towards a heart-stopping climactic showdown.<br/><br/>I've always been a fan of Carpenter's visual direction. The man has a knack for storytelling and a grand, old-fashioned approach to his camera-work and composition. And here, he excels with perhaps the best work of his career. Combining his slow and methodical, flowing camera movements with the masterful lighting of cinematographer Dean Cundy, Carpenter is able to increase tension and drama with each passing moment, like a high tension wire ready to snap at any instant. Carpenter also perfectly compliments his beautiful imagery with a haunting and freakish musical score that he composed himself, with chilling piano compositions and some delightfully dated-but-eerie synthesizer riffs that just ooze of atmospheric thrills.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly magnificent and further aid in elevating the film to its highly-regarded standard as one of the greats. Donald Pleasence is just stunning as the troubled Psychiatrist Sam Loomis, giving him a great deal of pathos and depth in the role that went on to define his career. Pleasence solidifies himself as acting royalty here, and nothing will ever be able to top what he does with the character. Curtis is a revelation as Laurie Strode- her breakout role. Now considered one of the great ""Scream Queens"" of the big screen, Curtis does a fantastic job at creating a highly identifiable and relatable heroine that all can see themselves in. Nick Castle- the man behind the mask as Michael Myers- also is able to build such a menacing and devious presence in his role, despite having no dialog and having his face hidden by the iconic William-Shatner-mask-painted-white. Castle, who is a filmmaker in his own right and helmed the wonderful ""The Last Starfighter"", creates a grand character through only physical movement, which is highly commendable and exciting. Supporting roles by the likes of Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles, Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews also all similarly knock their material out of the part and are a great addition to the story.<br/><br/>The other really fascinating thing to mention is just how influential a film that ""Halloween"" was, and how big an inspiration it became to the numerous other copy-cat films to emerge after its release. This is the movie that essentially defined the slasher sub-genre of horror. Every cliché... every trope you can think of was started here. The idea that ""sex is danger""... the fact you never say ""I'll be right back""... the false scares proceeding the real jump... the fact you don't drink or do drugs if you're underage. ""Halloween"" is the movie that established all of these unwritten ""rules"" of horror. There is sort of a tragedy to this, however. As its style was continually emulated in film after film (including most notably ""Friday the 13th""), audiences became increasingly familiar with the ideas established, and they became the new clichés. And I do think it's sad... plenty of new audiences will not be able to experience them for the first time as audiences did back in the 70's, and a degree of impact may be lost as a result. Despite being a 90's child, this was one of the first horror films I was allowed to see uncut, and I am happy that this was the one that was chosen, as I could experience it in a ""pure"" sense without it being spoiled by other films.<br/><br/>At nearly forty years of age, ""Halloween"" still exists in a league of its own. Not only as one of the greatest horror movies ever made. But as one of the greatest films ever made, period. And it most certainly and easily earns a perfect 10 out of 10 from me. Worth seeing to all fans of cinema."

"ThomasDrufke","8","0","1","11 October 2016"," Slasher Masterpiece
","The slasher genre took off in the 70's and 80's, but perhaps none were as famous or impactful as John Carpenter's Halloween in 1978.<br/><br/>Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was an influential film for many reasons, but it specifically did things with its villain that transcended the horror genre. In many ways, Norman Bates and Hitchcock's vision are the reason we got so many slasher films a few decades later. With Halloween, it's easy to see the influence. Carpenter does a masterful job at hiding the villain, or strictly showing him in obscure places in the camera shot. These tactics, along with keeping the blood at a minimum, actually proved to make the film better in the long run. Even if some of those choices were made specifically based on a restrictive tiny budget.<br/><br/>The now infamous long-take when we first see Michael Myers kill is absolutely terrifying, and it helps set the tone for the rest of the movie. But these unique camera movements don't end there. I loved the way Carpenter chose to shoot Myers. Yes, some of the later shots of him masked up in the dark are scary, but I almost feel like seeing Myers standing in broad daylight by a bush or a car and stalking his future victims is equally as terrifying.<br/><br/>Some of the horror tropes this film falls into can be forgiven, because it was basically the first of its kind to do so. But I do wish they didn't depict all but one teenager as dumb promiscuous sex and drug addicts. It just seemed a bit far-fetched. It's also annoying how careless these characters seemed to be. I mean, how many times did someone blatantly leave a door or a window open in a house or a car? That's not realistic.<br/><br/>With that said, when the horror hits, it really hits. The simple premise of having a mentally unstable killer on the loose on a Halloween night is enough to keep me on the edge of my seat. Sure, we don't get a ton of reasoning behind the actions taken, but I never felt like the lack of that impacted the execution of Carpenter's story. To me, this is about as good as a slasher film can be.<br/><br/>+Looming presence of Myers<br/><br/>+Carpenter's directing choices<br/><br/>+Score<br/><br/>-Characters were pretty clumsy<br/><br/>8.5/10"

I think the score in this film speaks for itself. it has been engraved in the minds of countless viewers since the films release. not many scores can leave you with such an uneasy and creepy feeling, but this one certainly does. the actors all do an excellent job. nobody is by any means worthy of an Oscar but they definitely work well for this film. especially the two leads, Jamie lee Curtis and Donald pleasance.<br/><br/>now, on to what makes this story work so well. the antagonist Michael myers is nothing short of truly menacing and scary. the dark and mysterious nature of the character are what makes him work so well. his unexplained origin, the mask that leaves him seemingly without emotion, the fact that he is explained as a purely evil person and the lack of motivation makes the character unpredictable. therefore he becomes much more scary. we no longer look at him as a human being but a shape, a dark menace. the manner in which is kills the teenage babysitters in the film are also very effective without being to gratuitous and graphic.<br/><br/>in short the film is excellent. a 10/10 and a must see for every film fan out there."

","Halloween was revolutionary at the time for using different camera angles, hardly any blood and a lot of shadow. Michael stalking in the background, driving through neighborhoods and hiding in homes made it seem like he could be anywhere at any time.<br/><br/>John Carpenter was a film student at the time and created a low budget picture that frightened millions of people around the world. He didn't rely on fake outs or cheap scares. John showed a mask less shape through his vision as he slowly walked up the stairs with a butcher knife and carrying a body across the lawn. The tension rising with the Halloween theme playing.<br/><br/>Did the characters really see that masked man or are their eyes playing tricks and it may be a trick or treater. Is the figure under the sheet someone I know? Did the window open or was it the wind?<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence plays the maniac's doctor who tracks down his patient he failed to treat for fifteen years. Sheriff Brackett and Loomis search the neighborhood desperately before the body pile can stack up.<br/><br/>Laurie is an all American girl who lives a normal life and one of her past times is babysitting for the neighborhood kids.

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","7","0","1","16 June 2016"," After a very strong first 40 minutes, Halloween loses it's way a little with a repetitive final act but still provides a creepy atmosphere and fantastic villain.
","The first 40 minutes of Halloween are brilliant. It's tense, unnerving, atmospheric, unsettling and absolutely captivating. From the moment that Myers first steps into frame inside his child-hood home, every scene instills you with dread. These scenes are the best in the movie, with Myers' heavy breathing permeating stalking scenes that work extremely well. As he follows Jamie Lee Curtis' Laurie, John Carpenter frames him in interesting and unique ways. Every appearance is somewhat shocking, especially when Myers appears and disappears without seeming to move. It's all very creepy, and you are constantly guessing as to what is going to happen; none of the characters feel invulnerable, and Myers' motivation isn't at all clear - he may not even have one, though a partial explanation is given. Carpenter has said that he wanted the villain to somewhat transform throughout the picture; starting off as purely human - which is why he is briefly shown as a child, but progressing to become something inhuman - almost a force of nature. He just can't be stopped.<br/><br/>After the first 40 minutes though, the slow-paced stalking does start to wear a little thin. It's around this point that you feel as though something substantial should be happening, perhaps that the killing should begin. But it doesn't kick into gear for at least another 10 minutes, which seems a long time in terms of the overall pacing. When the film does finally switch and Myers makes his first kill, most of the atmosphere and creepiness goes out of the window. It doesn't help that the acting in these death scenes is sub-par, with the actress' especially struggling to appear as though they are really being strangled. There are also a couple of dodgy make-up effects towards the end, particularly a slit throat effect that doesn't blend with the skin at all. The finale basically breaks down to the same sequence of events played three or four times. It is effective the first time, perhaps even the second, but wears thin quickly and becomes very predicable. The ending is also very unsatisfying. Though it does create a sense of unease and partial shock, it ultimately feels like a cliff-hanger for a cliff-hanger's sake. Without the sequel film 'Halloween 2', the ending feels empty and not really like an ending at all - almost like the film just cuts out two-thirds of the way through.<br/><br/>The acting is generally good, though by no means exceptional; as I mentioned earlier, the acting in the death scenes is very unconvincing. Curtis gives by far the best performance, beating the more experienced actor Donald Pleasence in one of her first feature-film roles. The actor(s) portraying what is credited as 'The Shape' - which is what Myers is called when he is wearing his mask - are good at portraying the character's physically imposing, violent and generally creepy actions. As a whole, Myers is very convincing and compelling as a villain. The heavy-breathing is a nice little touch too, adding to his unnerving and sinister nature. Carpenter expertly directs the movie, framing the characters extremely well and using the limited budget to great effect. The low-budget doesn't detriment the film at all; the fact that they couldn't afford proper lighting actually helps the movie, as it allows for some interesting shot compositions that hide things in the darkness. The script is pretty good, although some of Pleasence's lines are extremely heavy handed. The musical score is interesting and atmospheric, but some of the ambient tracks are a little grating; the title theme is great though.<br/><br/>After a very strong first 40 minutes, Halloween loses it's way a little with a repetitive final act and some poor acting; nevertheless, the direction is expert and the film gave us one of the greatest villains of all time. 7/10"

","The original Halloween is one of the greatest horror movies of all time and my personal favorite. On Halloween night in 1963, six year old Michael Myers brutally murdered his sister in the small town of Haddonfield Illinois. Now, 15 years later, he has escaped from a mental institution to reek havoc among the trick or treat. Jaime Lee Curtis stars in her first role as Laurie Strode and is pursued by Michael Myers throughout the entire movie. Donald Pleasance plays Dr. Sam Loomis (Michael Myers doctor) and warns Haddonfield Police of Michael's return. Hesitant to believe the wild accusation Dr. Loomis must hunt Michael down before he can do anymore harm.<br/><br/>The realisticness of the film and characters lost some credibility in later films, but this one is what's out there in the real world. Scary to think. Curtis is wonderful as Laurie. She gets the shy, awkward, gawky thing down pat. She makes Laurie a real fleshed out person, instead of just another pretty face actress trying to seem innocent and pure when we know she isn't. Pleasence is terrific. Loomis is a classic screen character that gets even madder as the films go on. Carpenter knows how to scare us. What's so amazing about it is how easy it is to do it, and how easy it was for him to accomplish it. While other films try too hard and create ridiculous circumstances with gore and effects to try to scare you, this one just relies on what is real. Halloween will scare and delight you at the same time. The music score for Halloween is still creepy almost 25 years later and is synonymous with the movie.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

","Halloween (1978) starring Jamie Lee Curtis is obviously a huge hit and is beloved by horror movie fans around the globe. I really did want to like this movie, but I just didn't like it all that much. OK, my big problem with it, is it just kinda dragged along at the beginning, i felt like it took way too long to get going. So because of that, I became sort of bored at the beginning. Now, I did enjoy Jamie's strong performance as Laurie Strode, the main victim. And I liked the other actor's performances, pretty good acting in this movie. Once the killings started, it started getting better, and I became interested in the film. The movie had a good script and pretty well written dialogue. Was it scary?? Well...... Sort of/not really. Halloween had it's scares at times, but overall not all that scary. 6/10 for Halloween (1978). Now let's see how the rob zombie remake is. I will probably be seeing/reviewing that one next."

","Spoiler Alert! I loved the music for this film! It is the coolest theme in a slasher movie along with Psycho, Friday the 13th and many more. I will start by saying I really liked the atmosphere and suspense of the film. Although I didn't get how people said this is the best slasher of all time! I mean I like the 2nd one better because you're not just waiting the whole time for something to happen because in this film it takes quite a long time to get to the action, it just really doesn't stick out for having the most interesting murder sequences. Halloween II however had the suspense and the creative murder sequences! Even the original Psycho, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Friday the 13th had creative and intense death scenes. I mean I guess this film wasn't about the deaths but suspense and I understand that but I still didn't like it better than the original, sorry, but I give it an 8 out of 10. Let me end on a positive note, the music, atmosphere, and acting was excellent!"
"lil_mexx31","10","0","1","9 April 2015"," The epitome of Horror
","Halloween will always be my favourite horror movie. Don't know what it is that makes it so special, but everything just gel's together so perfectly from the plot to the haunting piano keys in the iconic theme to the emotionless mask of Michael Myers.<br/><br/>The story is pretty straightforward, which is what makes it so frightening because it's relatable and is not outside of the realm of possibility. I can see myself reading about this in an article online about a boy stabbing his family to death after a night out trick or treating, spending the majority of his life in a mental institution, escaping and going back to finish off the job.<br/><br/>The scene that haunted me when I first saw this film (8 Years Old) is where Michael obliterates the closet door and the light flickers on and off while Laurie screams for her life and tries to fight her brother off with whatever she could find, and why????? Because I had the exact same looking closet in my bedroom at the time and I could see myself in Lauries situation. And that's where the horror lies. It's being able to relate to the characters and putting yourself in their shoes. You feel for Laurie, and you want her to live, you care about what will happen to her because your invested in the character thats portrayed. So many horror films of today rely on cheap jump scares and gore, I wish horror directors/writers would look and study Carpenter's Halloween.<br/><br/>What tie's all the horror together is the music. When I first heard the Halloween theme, It stuck in my head for weeks and I slept with the light on with talk-back radio turned up. The key strokes are simple, its only 4 notes, but it does the job, and it sums up everything about this film. It's simplicity is what makes it a terrifying thrill ride. Halloween came out at the perfect time, 1978, it's 2015 and still stands the test of time."

","In 1963, Mike Myers stabbed his 15 year-old sister to death. He was institutionalised and according to his doctor, Sam Loomis, is the personification of evil. <br/><br/>On the day before Halloween 15 years later, Myers manages to escape and heads for his home town. <br/><br/>On Halloween night, he goes on a rampage while Loomis and the local sheriff search Myers' neighbourhood for him. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Laurie Strode, a serious student who rarely goes out on dates, is babysitting a neighbour's child. Little does she know the danger she is in.<br/><br/>It's the film that changed the face of horror movies for almost twenty years, and created the stalk and slash sub-genre. But take away all its legacy, and it's basically one of the most simples premises imaginable.<br/><br/>And this is why it works so well, it's simple, yet brilliantly inventive. The opening POV shot is amazing, and truly sets the films eerie feel, yet it's the build up to the killings that really makes the film groundbreaking.<br/><br/>Seeing patients in the middle of the night in the pouring rain, and then, once we are back in Haddonfiled, for almost an hour, we get treated to some of the most haunting shots in cinema. <br/><br/>It's the fact that Myers makes no qualms about being seen, outside the school staring at Laurie, isn't just scary, it's downright unnerving, and this does a great job of not preparing you for the final act.<br/><br/>Although by today's standards, the final act is tame, because film makers today think that more gore equals more scares, it detracts you away from the tension of the narrative, and the stalking through the house is tense, no matter how many times you've seen it.<br/><br/>And I feel this is due to the simple fact that he's wearing an emotionless mask, making the audience wonder what exactly is going on behind the mask.<br/><br/>But again, the more times you see this film, you realise just how bad the script can be at times. Pleasence is a wonderful screen presence, but he's here for Basil Exposition, and some of his monologues are a little laughable now.<br/><br/>But it's a groundbreaking movie, bad script or not, the sequels are not worth bothering with, but this would be worth watching with Zombies remake, just to see how horror changed in thirty years."
"Lucabrasisleeps","7","0","1","21 January 2015"," Good horror movie
","This movie is markedly different from the rest of the slasher movies inspired by it. You can't really expect much of the cheesiness, violence, body count or the bad acting that accompanied many of the imitators. <br/><br/>Obviously the intent of Carpenter is to create a slow paced atmospheric horror. You could actually say there are not many events till 50 minutes or so. There is a slow building of atmosphere with both Laurie and Tommy spotting Michael at various times, at the least expected moments. One of the best scenes is the figure behind the bush. <br/><br/>One thing I didn't understand very much though is the lack of violence. Apparently earlier movies like Bay of blood (which influenced this movie) have had vicious violent scenes. This is an independent movie which came later in the same period as heavily violent exploitation movies. So this is a pure stylistic choice of the director I think, to avoid showing blood and gore. This makes it more similar to earlier atmospheric horrors. <br/><br/>The body count is also another point. Most of the deaths happen in the last 30 minutes or so and they are relatively much fewer compared to later slashers. There are not too many characters either in the movie, it is mostly focused on Jamie lee curtis and her small group of friends. It is nice to relate to the characters rather than it be just a numbers game. So the lesser body count works in its favour. This also gives time to create a creepy atmosphere before the murders as well. An example being when Annie goes to the washing machine. <br/><br/>I did think despite the classic status, I didn't feel it on a emotional level. Frankly I can't see any flaws, but it feels too perfect and dry. It is such a well done movie but for me it lacks passion somewhat. I love the style and it certainly deserves its praise. But maybe slasher movies need some cheesiness.<br/><br/>7/10"

","This movie is a brilliant work of art. It changed the world of the horror genre , as it also changed how the world saw Halloween (the Holiday). The way carpenter masters suspense and fear is amazing . The simplicity of ""the boogeyman"" stalking high schoolers was perfect. It was something no one had seen before. Not to mention the music, which is what truly made this film horrifying for viewers back in the day. The creepy, eerie, lurking score stays with you. All the characters are interesting . Pleasence as Loomis is an iconic figure as the doctor who will stop at nothing to stop the crazy killer who escaped the sanitarium. Jamie lee Curtis as Laurie Strode was fresh and new . She played a smart and not so cliché teenage girl who has what it takes to survive Halloween night . All in all it is a brilliant film. Although this film is dated, it still easily holds it own, and surpasses most horror films since (if not all horror films since). Also, this ""old"" movie avoids most horror movie clichés. It is a smart and clever movie. It may not seem as horrifying these days as it once was. However it can certainly still scare new viewers. I find people who may think it's not so ""terrifying"" still are made uncomfortable by the suspense. Great film!!"

"Robert_duder","10","0","3","11 November 2014"," A masterpiece.
","What else can I say? John Carpenter's Halloween is a piece of masterful art. It defined horror and slasher films. It defined and revolutionized low budget movie making. It is the patriarch to an entire genre and it is a film I love deeply. It literally kick started my love for the horror genre and it is THEE bar for which everything else is judged. What makes this film so brilliant? Outside of the fact that it is truly terrifying and gets under your skin...when you break down and analyze the film you will literally be floored by it. If you have not seen this movie, you need to sit down, pop some popcorn, turn out all your lights and watch what is easily one of the great films of its genre if not in film history. You have to put the movie into perspective too. John Carpenter was a nobody (if I'm not mistaken?) Jamie Lee Curtis was plucked at random because she was not a star, the film was made on a shoestring budget and yet every single piece falls into place. The haunting setting of Halloween and the small Illinois town that is a snapshot of Americana, the back story of the mysterious murderous young boy and his escape, the obsessed doctor in a Victor Von Frankenstein type role chasing down the monster he spent years trying to keep locked up. The dialogue works so well and even when its being cheesy, it works for those characters. Then you have John Carpenter's masterful brilliant direction. This film has at least three of my all time favourite movie scenes. I won't say what they are but they give me chills when I see them.<br/><br/>I have always enjoyed Jamie Lee Curtis as an actress, I think she's amazing and a legend in her own right but this is where it all began. She is absolute perfect as the virginal and innocent Laurie Strode. We have no real background on her character yet but as the ultimate (seemingly random) victim of an insane killer she defines scream queen. When I hear that term...I think of her. And she's not without fortitude. She is tough as nails while being absolutely terrified. She fights to the death when put in a survive or be killed situation. Donald Pleasance is already a legend but he adds such instant class and gravitas to the film as Dr. Loomis. He has two or three speeches that are stirring and literally tell the entire story whether setting up the scene or making you feel like you understand Michael Myers. Honestly, everyone else is sort of fodder for Myers. However, they each have very important roles to play and they do their roles well. They leave you with a lasting impression and the film wouldn't be the same without them period! Nancy Kyes, P.J. Soles and John Michael Graham (gets one of the great horror scenes ever...one of those aforementioned scenes that give me chills), all play the wild and crazy friends of Laurie's that are systematically picked off. Charles Cyphers has a small but very good role as Kyes' father and the local sheriff. His best scenes are opposite Pleasance. Kyle Richards and Brian Andrews are really terrific as the two little kids who are under Laurie's care when Myers attacks. They deliver their lines a little stiffly but for being who they are, they are great!! Nick Castle inadvertently I think creates one of the most powerful and formidable horror villains in history. His stoic and terrifyingly powerful portrayal of Michael Myers must be seen to be believed. Yes he is somewhat comparable to Jason Voorhees (or the other way around) but there is an implied intelligence, brute strength and most importantly unstoppable and unexplainable desire to kill in his simple performance. That mask will forever haunt me.<br/><br/>For whatever reason John Carpenter had this innate talent inside him to take a simple concept and what little money he had and make it a mountain. He made the most effective horror film to date using lighting and characters and back story. There are things hidden in this film (or maybe its total coincidence) but every time I watch it I wonder what it means in the bigger picture. To make a simple slasher picture and give it depth and meaning and make you think about it is an impressive feat and he will always be a horror god to me. The rest of the series ranged from terrible to almost as good as this one but that doesn't change the fact that how it all started is a reason to watch horror. It seems like all the right pieces fell into place for this classic and I will continue to watch it at least once every year to remind myself what amazing horror is truly about. 10/10"
"powermandan","10","0","1","11 November 2014"," The First Great Serial Killer Movie.
","I shouldn't say it was the first great ""horror"" movie. Before this was stuff like The Exorcist and Psycho. This wasn't much of a ""slasher"" but Michael is indeed a serial killer and this beats whatever serial killer movies there were before like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre movies. Although not as scary, this is still better. With fantastic filming techniques and uncanny storytelling, this first-rate psychological horror movie set the bar for horror movies to come that has barely been matched. <br/><br/>The movie starts off in a first person view as Michael Myers murders his older sister for no apparent reason. The way this is down is genius as there is one steady shot and the viewer gets a glimpse at Michael's perspective. Fifteen years later, 21-year-old Michael escapes the mental institution where he was sent and goes on a massive killing spree on Halloween night. The series protagonist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Pleasance) has known and observed Michael since his first kill and describes Michael as ""pure evil"" and ""without conscience."" Loomis may be the only one that knows what to do to prevent Michael from continuing his evil ways. Pleasance is awesome as Loomis and the way he describes Michael is chilling. Also, saying Michael has no motive makes everything that much scarier. It is always worse for people when there is no motive. After Michael dawns his trademark outfit and Captain Kirk mask, Carpenter does a genius move by showing either parts of Michael (like below the head) or Michael from a distance. That keeps the viewer intrigued as they don't really know what the killer looks like or what will be dealt with. We also get to learn about the other protagonist, high-school babysitter Laurie Strode (Curtis) where character development is built to root for her. At night, Michael goes on his killing spree, setting basic horror movie rules (don't have sex, don't ask ""who's there?"" etc) so there is some predictability. But everything is executed so well, there's no big deal. Laurie is the only survivor of Michael's victims, and this was also what put Jamie Lee Curtis on the map as the ""scream queen,"" and a hero. She was one of cinema's first female heroes as she takes on evil's human force. <br/><br/>The pacing of this movie is also genius. After Michael's first kill, we get to know Loomis, Laurie and Michael with occasionally seeing Michael himself. It takes its time, and is somewhat slow. At nightfall (just before the hour mark) is when things start getting faster and Michael's rampage at night causes the movie to get very fast and scare the viewer. There is little blood and a small- body-count, but the suspense created around each death makes the experience extra scary. The suspense this movie creates is unrepeatable. The movie raised the bar on film suspense, and general horror."

","One of the better slasher-horrors. Not that this says much. Good slasher-horrors are few and far-between. Mostly formulaic and made with the lowest common denominator in mind.<br/><br/>Halloween has some of those clichés and formulaic elements, but it largely invented them! <br/><br/>What sets this apart is the plot development and tension. John Carpenter builds the story slowly, drawing you in. You know something is going to happen, but you don't know when, and to whom.<br/><br/>Then, when it does happen, it becomes a roller-coaster ride of terror and action.<br/><br/>Ending is a bit disappointing, especially as now, 36 years later, you know it was set up for a sequel, and another, and another, and then a remake...

","Halloween is definitely a masterpiece. This set a new wave of horror. Halloween is by far one of if not the greatest horror movie ever made that has been imitated but never duplicated by many other films like Friday The 13th. But let's face it, F13 doesn't even compare to the greatness of John Carpenter's classic. With not a lot of blood and gore, almost none at all, Halloween is filled with suspense, eeriness, plot building, character setting and an all out thrill ride that left audiences terrified. So the film starts of with 6 year old Michael Myers walking into his house, grabbing a kitchen knife, creeping upstairs and brutally murdering his sister. We then skip 15 years later where Dr. Sam Loomis is on his way to the insane asylum to transfer Myers. However, when he gets there, all the patients are found roaming around outside the hospital, including Michael Myers. Michael then steals Loomis' assistant's car and drives off into the night. We then go to the next day and are introduced to Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis in her first ever movie role. She then begins to see a strange man, which we know is Michael of course, who is stalking her and watching her. Then after about half an hour of stalking and creepiness it skips to night, which is when the films really starts to pick up. Laurie is babysitting with a few friends. Little does she know, Michael has decided to crash the party and so he kills her friends off one by one, leaving her clueless as to what is going on. She then goes exploring to find out what has happened to her friends, only to discover, they have been killed by Michael. Michael then appears in a closet/doorway behind her, slashes her shoulder with his knife, she then falls down the stairs, and then the big chase is on and it leads to a huge adrenaline rushing, blood pumping thrill ride, with a fantastic ending of Michael somehow disappearing after been shot off the balcony by Dr. Loomis who had been chasing him all night and coming up short. The film then ends with audiences shocked and scared. Honestly, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? It is a classic, no doubt about it. It is simple, basic, scary, creepy and the setting is fantastic. The acting is perfect, the characters are perfect, and Michael Myers is creepy as can be. This film even spawned a huge franchise which many have come to love. Halloween is my all time favorite horror film or even my favorite film altogether. Halloween stands out as the godfather of horror and there is a good reason for it. It is of course, the one, the only, the classic, Halloween."

","This review for Halloween is nothing more than a drop in the ocean of praise for a timeless classic like this. A movie that kicked off a series of sequels and spin-offs and remakes of varying quality, and that has become one of the most famous slasher/horror flicks ever made. <br/><br/>When you think about it, Halloween is a very simple film. Michael Myers stalks and murders teenagers on Halloween after escaping from the high security facility that used to hold him. That's all there is too it, as the masked murderer goes on a spree in an otherwise very calm and silent town.<br/><br/>What makes this seemingly simple slasher into such an uncomfortable horror movie is, for me anyway, mostly in the way it's been shot, combined with the music and sound effects used. With long, steady shots instead of the jump cut-like shots that seem to be so much more popular in more modern horror films. Sure enough, there are a couple jump scares where Myers will pop up right next to someone or appear behind a door, but the scary scenes are where you see his shadow appear briefly behind one of the future victims. Or when you finally spot him in a steady shot of the street. Most of the scenes are shot in a rather dark setting, often accompanied with an eerie ambient music that really helps set the mood.<br/><br/>The acting is overall pretty good. The only actor I felt really did a particularly great job was the late Donald Pleasence in his portrayal of Dr. Sam Loomis, Myers' doctor for many years. This slightly unstable, desperate doctor's hunt for Myers, whom he firmly believes cannot possibly be human, really adds a whole lot to the movie. Jamie Lee Curtis' portrayal of the shy teenage girl Laurie Strode was at times a bit off, though she mostly really managed to pull it off.<br/><br/>Absolutely an easy recommendation to anyone remotely interested in horror, with a warning that the sequels are, for the most part, not worth the watch."

","I have never quite understood the hysteria which surrounds this film. Though it is a good film, and the soundtrack by director John Carpenter must rank as one of the most memorable ever composed, to suggest it is a movie which reinvented the horror genre rather begs the question as to exactly what people had been watching for horror prior to 1978.<br/><br/>The opening ten minutes are well-staged and the child's-eye view of a house at dusk and a girl changing upstairs is both eerie and full of anticipation. Fact is I can't fault the opening, and when Donald Pleasance enters the frame as Dr Loomis, desperately trying to find his most infamous patient before the madman strikes again then you sense you're in for something rather creepy.<br/><br/>But while the film certainly starts creepy, my suspension of disbelief started to evaporated as Michael Myers slowly took centre stage. For those who think this film is terrifying - and some reviewers really should look up the meaning of that word - I suggest you check out Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or the second half of Wolf Creek.<br/><br/>There are some genuine scares in Halloween, and Donald Pleasance is suitably sinister as Dr Loomis, insisting to the police of Haddonfield that they are looking for an incarnation of evil. The police don't seem all that convinced by his insistence, and neither was I in the end, but I did enjoy the film.<br/><br/>It reportedly cost less than $1million to produce, yet when re-released in the autumn of 1978 ended up raking in more than eighty million dollars. A staggering return, and perhaps one reason for its iconic standing today."

","This movie begins on October 31st, 1963 in Haddonfield, Illinois with a 6-year old boy fatally stabbing and killing his older sister. Because he is so young he is incarcerated in an insane asylum. Fifteen years later ""Michael Myers"" (Tony Moran) escapes and heads back to the same small town with the same psychotic mindset. Attempting to apprehend him is a psychiatrist by the name of ""Dr. Sam Loomis"" (Donald Pleasance) who treated him during those years and fully understands just how evil Michael really is. But in order to stop Michael he has to find him first. Now, as far as this movie is concerned I will just say that this particular film was a definite pioneer in its class in that it took over where movies like ""Psycho"" and ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"" left off and brought everything to the next level. I especially liked the way the music and atmosphere combined to heighten the suspense and sense of foreboding. Likewise, the fact that it was so financially successful led to a large number of clones and sequels over the course of the next decade (or two). At any rate, even though it isn't perfect, if you like horror movies then this is one that you definitely need to check out. Above average."

","This movie is just an amazing benchmark in horror movie ! Maybe i'm wrong as i'm not however a specialist, but as it has been released in 1978, it's thus the first movie involving a slasher ! In other words, Carpenter has invented a new kind of movie by himself and it's not everyday that a director can say the same thing ! It's really astounding to see that he designed all the gimmicks of the genre : subjective camera, oppressing music, the « is-it you – are you there ? » moment It's all the more remarkable that Carpenter is really talented as well and knows how to dose his tools to have the maximum effects ! Instead of today movies which rates terror with the liters of blood, Carpenter just choose the opposite way to show a minimum ! <br/><br/>I didn't expect the movie to be also this but it takes place in the famous small town USA that is essential to a lot of famous filmmakers, especially Lynch ! Now, this movie prefigures a lot what would be « twin peaks : fire walk with me » as both movies tell the same story : a country student stalked by evil forces ! I think that Jaimie is perfect here as she seems to be totally natural : a well educated daughter and a cool friend !<br/><br/>So, this movie has really written cinema history and with all legitimate reasons so it would be great that Hollywood pays its dues to this master !"

","I've always been a huge fan of the classic horror movies. Especially when it comes down to Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A nightmare on elm street. But this was a really awesome to kick things off for the Halloween Series of movies. Only thing I wish for was more gore but then again, back in 78, it probably wouldn't have been approved. But other than that small factor, it was an awesome movie and such a classic to watch!! If you are into horror movies then I'd suggest watching this one particular. Because it is such an amazing movie in my eyes.<br/><br/>One the other hand, the acting was done really well. It was the movie of the era that sparked and influenced Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween. (Which I also liked). That one specifically went into detail of Micheal's childhood while in the 78 version they just showed a 6 year old kid stabbing his 15 year old sister. It still showed her as a slut in the remake as it did in the original."

","Halloween (1978) is one of the best slasher movies ever made. It is not a modern day gore-fest with the notion of ""let's use all the fake blood we can find to put on a film and call it a horror movie."" because it is quite the contrary. Sure, Halloween (1978) does have it's moments of blood but it is not a gore-fest.<br/><br/>So what is Halloween (1978) if it is not a typical slasher gore-fest? The answer is that it is a thriller and it is the thrills that brings out the horrors of the movie. Things like Dr. Loomis in desperate search of Michael because he is the only one that really knows the seriousness of Michael loose on the streets - the chase is thrilling! Another scare factor is the idea of a murderer quietly lurking in the shadows watching someone's every move as they go on about their own business then suddenly on the run from the killer and trying to find a safe place to hide.<br/><br/>Michael Myers' life story is interesting - just as interesting as Norman Bates ""Psycho (1960)"" - and just as horrifying!<br/><br/>On a final note: It just goes to show you that you don't need multimillions to make a good quality horror movie - just some imagination and good writing skills.<br/><br/>10/10"
"dlmcfarland2-2","8","0","1","27 June 2014"," The Best Horror/Suspense Film I Have Seen
","The monster that was released on a worldwide audience still rings true to this day. John Carpenter's Halloween is that very rare motion picture that combines a very simple story, good acting and dialogue and suspense to make a film that has been copied, for better or much worse, since Fall 1978. <br/><br/>Everyone knows the story....Michael Myers murders his oldest sister, is sent to a hospital for the criminal insane, breaks out on Halloween Eve 1978 only to return home to Haddonfield to reboot his horrific rampage (which is continued in Halloween II). Once there, four innocent teenage babysitter meet evil on two legs. <br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis, P.J. Soles and Nancy Kyes do outstanding work as the trinity babysitters who have no clue that their entire lives are about to change forever. John Michael Graham plays Bob, the hapless boyfriend of Soles who really finds out what happens when one opens a door after hearing heavy breathing at night in the dark. But the entire film wraps around legendary actor/artist Donald Pleasance (who could not get another role playing a villain after this film). He is the Ying to Michael's Yang. His polar opposite, and the only person crazy enough to stand between Michael and the rest of his hometown. Of course he tries to get the sheriff to listen, and of course that doesn't happen until dead bodies start swinging from closets and Curtis is running across the street trying to save her own life from the knife-wielding maniac whose stalking after her. <br/><br/>There still to this day continues to be remakes and very poor rip-offs of this one film. And many have given it low marks for the same reason i love it to this day.....the lack of blood. It is the same reason why I haven't found other films in the genre to be scary because as far as those directors were concerned, the more blood and the more ways to mutilate the human body is supposed to equal horror. For me suspense is what makes movies like this enjoyable and memorable. That is what JC's Halloween is. The way this movie is filmed, even during the daytime, you have no idea where Michael is. Plus I did care for all the characters even though most of them didn't have allot of screen time. If you find yourself looking into dark doorways because you have no clue where Michael is, well, that's the point. <br/><br/>And of course you have your stupid stuff, like why did Curtis keep dropping the knife, or why did she walk across the street instead of calling the police,or how did Graham think Soles was in the kitchen (it would have required her to jump out the window and run around the side of the house and get into the kitchen through the locked door and hide in the closet all before he walked downstairs to the kitchen). <br/><br/>But the atmosphere and the wonderful music by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth will set the tone. This film won't let you go until the ending credits. John Carpenter's masterpiece that just may force you to sleep with the lights on."

","The original Halloween, directed by John Carpenter, produced by Debra Hill, music by John Carpenter, and starring Jamie Lee Curtis and many more is truly the best of the best as far as Halloween horror movies go. It may be the first too, I'm not sure, but there can be no question it is the scariest. It is also the most well done. It is highly stylized right from the opening shot which has Michael Myers killing his sister. The music is so good it's like its own character in the film. And the cinematography is outstanding. You also really feel like it's Halloween in Haddonfield even though they shot the movie in Los Angeles. This was the birth of Michael Myers, the true bogeyman of cinema, and he launched into many more sequels, but this one is still the best. The Rob Zombie remake was not very good. Too violent and not scary enough. But John Carpenter's masterpiece has it all. Watch it late at night with all the lights out, and preferably during October!"

"PartialMovieViewer","9","0","1","24 April 2014"," Very Fun
","John Carpenter's creation has slashed its way through audiences for past thirty-six years, spawning a family of successful sequels. In this first slasher-movie bearing the, 'Halloween,' moniker, Michael Myers is introduced as some wacked-out-crazy-mad-goofball, troubled by an evil, dank past. Those evil dank pastsare always ominous? The story begins on a dark and rainy night, when a 15 year-old Mikey decides to chop up his sister. Why? Not important – slasher movie – remember. The only thing that is important to remember is that what Mike did was not a very nice thing to do. The police agreed with my assessment and lock Mr. Myers up. He will never-ever do this again. Well – guess who escapes, and it's on the day just before Halloween? Yes – it's that young whippersnapper -that Myers kid. From that point on – all, 'Halloween' breaks loose. This is the consummate of slasher-movies. 'Halloween', is among the genre's earliest starter-set. 'Friday the 13th,' 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' 'Phantasm,' and a handful of others are members of that set as well. As long as the movie met the standard, ""The bloodier the better,"" it made the grade. It's a fun movie to sit through. With Donald Pleasence and a young Jamie Lee Curtis, the actor lineup is very impressive. Were they needed? Meh – talented actors.really? This is a slasher-movie – remember? Anyways, I liked itlots of fun."

","Michael Myers is a institutionalized psychotic murder who, when he was 6 years old, killed his 15 years old sister stabbing her. 15 years later he escapes the sanitarium and returns home (Haddonfield, Illinois). His psychiatrist is trying to catch him, before he kills again. Meanwhile high school students Laurie, Annie and Lynda have plans for baby-sitting on Halloween (and maybe carrying on a bit with their boyfriends...) but they're not ready for what's coming.<br/><br/>The movie starts with an excellent opening Point of View scene and the opening ""ends"" with us, the viewers, looking at a young kid with a big knife on his hand. This is where it all started.<br/><br/>When later he does come home, he starts spying the three high school students, he is the creep you never want to see. He lives in the shadows, in the entire movie, except for one or two times, you never really see his face, or a close shot of him. The lives of those students may be coming to an end.<br/><br/>Once I read somewhere people complain about him never really dying despite being dangerously harmed, I thought maybe, instead of thinking he is human (he does look like one), you can think of him as the very personification of evil itself, maybe he is inhuman, and that's what makes him even more terrifying.<br/><br/>This is a very suspenseful, intense movie that builds on a strong horror atmosphere, shot without much light, instead a strong presence of shadows. This is John Carpenter's masterpiece. The score goes like this: if you hear it for the first time, you will never forget it, it will echo in your mind and maybe haunt you. One of the best things you can do on Halloween is watching Halloween!<br/><br/>Fact 1: It had a $300000 budget and made worldwide around $60000000! Fact 2: Michael's mask was created from a Captain Kirk mask purchased for $1.98. The producers liked it because it had a blank, emotionless look. Obviously it was altered."

","The film starts, as IMDb plot synopsis says, with a jack-o-lantern and the now iconic theme composed by the director, John Carpenter. <br/><br/>A young man, responsible for the murder of his sister when he was six, has just escaped from the asylum where he was held. His doctor believes that he is heading back to his home town, Haddonfield, but he has a difficult convincing others of this. He thus travels to Haddonfield personally and alerts the sheriff but doesn't want to panic the town, so he advises against a man hunt. The doctor is able to find evidence of Michael's (the child killer) arrival in town by returning to the house of the his act. Meanwhile, Laurie Strode and friends are going about their business as high schoolers and baby sitters on Halloween night. She watches one child and eventually a second as her friend and fellow baby sitter has a date. Her friends are killed one by one (Lynda, Paul, & Annie). The killer continues to stalk, but is ultimately shot by his doctor who was hot on his trail. He saves Laurie and the two kids, but the killer appears to have gotten away. <br/><br/>This was a very well done slasher movie. It maintained suspense without becoming silly. The soundtrack did a good job of heightening tension, and I'm pleased by how the camera work never showed the killer until the end. Everything was POV, and we heard the breathing through the mask. <br/><br/>This seemed to me like a B movie when that word meant something, little special effects and pretty much the same song over and over again without the use of an entire orchestra. Also, except for the main actress and director, no other names seem well known.<br/><br/>I'd probably appreciate this more had I seen it a long time ago in theaters. As it stands, I've seen too many slashers and knew the basic plot. A definite recommend to those new to the genre, but I think anybody could enjoy it too."

","Halloween. The cult horror from 1978. It might have been one of revelation in its days because of its tone, background score and the idea of scare being personified so diligently but I think it had dated pretty fast because of absence of a puzzling screenplay. In a short run time of 91 minutes, nothing much happens in first 60 minutes apart from the first scary scene at the very start of the movie. You just anticipate that it is going to be chaos soon. It happens but then things get wrapped up pretty fast. At the end, you feel like movie has just started scaring you and this should have been the interval time rather the end itself. Nevertheless, it makes a nice watch because of its idea and relating the every scare to the day of scares i.e. Halloween."

","An escaped murderer stalks teens on Halloween while his doctor runs around looking for him. Halloween isn't the first to do that (Black Christmas? Scream Bloody Murder?) or the last (Offerings, which resembles this almost to a 'T') but what this film does is tick every box, as it includes one thing that's missing from most slasher films: the killer is almost always present in every scene.<br/><br/>It's like he's stalking the characters like a cat stalks a mouse. I'm sure it was deliberate that the only scenes he's not hanging around in are the ones that include Donald Pleasance, a clear indication of who's smart than who. <br/><br/>The constant appearances and stalking just lead to the build up of this one, and although it's hard to truly rate a film I first watched decades ago, and one that has so many imitators, I could still appreciate what Carpenter was doing here. It's full of suspense, some actually decent jump scares, and all round good acting. There are hints to the unstoppable killing machine Michael would become in the next film too. <br/><br/>However, also through the benefit of seeing the film so many times: Do you think it was deliberate in the portrayal of Dr Loomis being also some sort of lunatic. He keeps going on about how Michael is evil but Michael a) Hasn't spoken a word since he was six and b) Has barely moved...who was paying this guy to study him?<br/><br/>Nonetheless, it's a good un!"

","Halloween. The movie takes place in the fictional town of Haddonfeild Illinois this is a very convincing middle American town that almost becomes a character of its own. The movie is strong is so many aspects the big two being the music and the suspense. First the music is just plain creepy and haunting that is one of my favorite movie musical scores ever (but not as good as Dawn of the Dead's) and there's the suspense; it's built the whole movie everything you see is suspenseful, this is mostly due to the music and the fact that you can see know were the killer is but the characters don't, creating truly gripping tension. Now the characters/actors themselves; I'm going to be 100% honest on this, most of the acting sucks but there are two performances that really hold the movie together, the first being our protagonist Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode she gave a very convincible as a middle American teenager. And the other performances is Donald Pleasence as Dr. Loomis he delivers as brilliant performance of a doctor relentlessly searching for an escaped patient. The big draw for most people to this move is the movie's killer, Michael Myers. He's a personification of the boogeyman and is downright terrifying and it's easy to see how he became an icon of horror. A few other things I'd like to touch up on is the great directing from Director John Carpenter and also the movies last 15 minutes, the last 15 minutes are exhilarating. Halloween (1978) gets a 9 out of 10."

This film though graphic in nature is pretty tame for today's standards but none the less is a classic within the genre. One of Carpenter's first films he clearly shows his skill in the genre as the tension and pacing of this film grow to almost unbearable points and this is done deliberately to keep the viewer tense and on the edge of there seat. Though in some points this film may be considered a bit cheesy if one truly suspends belief you will find this to be an excellent film and one perfect for any time not just Halloween. Spawning countless sequels and a remake, Halloween is a pure example of a film that grows more tense and horrific with each passing moment."
"sunshinebeachcinema","8","0","1","3 December 2013"," Halloween is at heart an independent film, where Carpenter makes use of shadow and subtlety, rather than special effects.
","The build up to Halloween (the holiday, not the film) has inspired me to explore the old slasher 'classics' of the '70s and '80s, which until now has been something of a neglected pursuit. It transpires that they are often relentlessly formulaic and derivative, although this does serve to highlight the strengths of superior films in the genre.<br/><br/>Traditionally, we are introduced to a group of carefree and naive teenagers who are then systematically and sadistically dispatched with varying creativity by an unseen killer. The film usually concludes with a battle between the now revealed killer and the final (usually female) survivor, culminating in an often mind bogglingly ambiguous climax.<br/><br/>Artistic integrity aside, many of these killers have developed into iconic horror characters, and (sometimes in spite the original directors' wishes) have spawned persistent franchises. It is thus with a sense of genuine curiosity that I look towards the horizon at the undoubtedly heady delights of Friday the 13th, Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan (1989) and an answer as to why Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare (1991) is followed by yet another three Nightmare on Elm Street films.<br/><br/>Where better to start than with Halloween (the film, not the holiday)? Even if it didn't spawn the genre, its global success certainly solidified it in the public consciousness. It brought horror away from the supernatural and into the idyllic streets of suburban America.<br/><br/>Naturally, the film opens on Halloween night (purportedly chosen when director John Carpenter realised that nobody had yet made a film by that name) when a teenage girl is murdered by her own brother, the young Michael Myers. He bears a simple name that would come to represent evil incarnate, at least until it became irrevocably associated with a certain Canadian comic actor.<br/><br/>The tag line ""The night he came home!"" is enough to reveal that the rest of the film takes place on a Halloween some fifteen years later, when an adult Michael escapes from a psychiatric hospital with the single minded objective of returning to his hometown and indulging his psychopathic tendencies.<br/><br/>For reasons at yet unknown, his ultimate objective seems to be Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a role which would earn her the title of 'scream queen' and land her roles in the wave of slashers that appeared in Halloween's wake, including Prom Night (1980) and Terror Train (1980).<br/><br/>For all its commercial success, Halloween is at heart an independent film, one of Carpenter's earliest, brimming with evidence of budgetary constraints and notably fraught with continuity and production errors. The famous mask was in fact a painted William Shatner mask from Star Trek, and the film was shot during spring in Southern California (not autumn in Illinois) on a tight schedule: Donald Pleasence, who played Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis, filmed all his scenes in under a week.<br/><br/>Against this backdrop, Carpenter makes use of shadow and subtlety, rather than special effects. Those familiar with more modern films may be surprised by the low body count and lack of graphic violence. The slow pacing draws out the tension, and allows the character development that other such films lack. Much of the first half follows Laurie and her friends through their day, whilst Michael stalks them one step behind. He is the unsettling figure in the distance, always drifting in and out of sight. Only Laurie sees, and her distress falls on the deaf ears of her incredulous friends.<br/><br/>Not everything about Halloween is completely original. At one point, Michael evokes a traditional campfire tale by hiding in the back seat of a victim's car, a variant of which has appeared in everything from The Godfather (1972) to The Dark Knight (2008) and even in later slasher films.<br/><br/>Pleasence steals the show as Dr. Loomis, bringing gravitas to a film of otherwise fluctuating acting quality. It's faintly hammy, but the sinister British elocution provides a voice of reason and grim truth against the sea of American hysteria as he reveals the true depravity of his patient's soul in one of the best quotes in the film:<br/><br/>""I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realised that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply evil.""<br/><br/>We cannot deny that Loomis was right to be wary, but at its most cynical reading this paints a picture of a psychiatric system that has utterly failed Michael as a patient. Nevertheless, for a film which appears grounded in a real world interpretation of horror, there are undeniable echoes of the supernatural: Michael's nigh immortality to the grievous wounds inflicted upon him lend credence to the diagnosis that there may be something truly diabolic at work."

","I'm not knocking every other slasher movie. It's just that not a lot of slasher movies have any interesting ideas. Some are just around to show blood and gore. Halloween is a different type of movie where it didn't rely on special effects, blood and gore, etc. It relied more on suspense and a creepy atmosphere. There is a few problems. Some scenes are slow and the dialog in some parts is a bit weird, but by the last 45 to 50 Min's the movie picks up. We all know about the killer Michael Myers. I'm one of those people though who believed that he should have stayed dead at 2. That's what I like about Halloween. The movie leaves off with a cliffhanger and ends the story in Halloween II. Halloween 3 tried to take the series in a different direction. Which i liked that idea. But due to backlash with fans. They brought Michael back in IV, V and all the sequels onward. which I believed ruined the series. Maybe that's why I only own 1 2 and 3 on DVD. I will tell you about my opinions about the second movie in part 2 of this review."
"rucricket","8","0","1","1 November 2013"," A classic horror film
","I'm a big fan of John Carpenter, but not such a big fan of horror films. I watched this film with trepidation. I didn't regret it. I think I picked a good horror movie to start off with. Carpenter sustains a creepy, suspenseful a atmosphere all the way through the movie. His camera work is very simple, bringing you to the center of the action. The views he gives over Micheal's shoulder are very clever, giving us his point of view. But it's the empty shots that create the most tension as they leave you thinking 'What's going to happen next?' The score to this film is fairly minimal, but highly effective. Who could ever forget that famous theme tune? It helps build up this unbearable tension and you just know something is going to happen soon. Carpenter uses it cleverly though. He knows that silence can be just as effective as suspenseful music in creating an aura of expectation. Though the plot is fairly implausible, but it holds fairly well through the movie. One could attempt to tear holes in it, but it's a lot more difficult then you'd think. Donald Pleasance is as good as always, portraying the worried doctor very well, if not always believably. Jamie-Lee Curtis is solid, but not outstanding and her two friends are as stiff as a plank throughout most of the film. They're characters and the way they act are fairly believable though and, in my opinion, vacuous and annoying. But it's really the character of Micheal Myers that makes the movie. The William Shatner mask is very disturbing and his silence is far better then if he grunted or talked. The way he shows up and disappears works very well and makes him seem almost supernatural, an idea aided by how impossible it seems to kill him. The movie moves along reasonably slowly, but it's worth the wait. The ending is terrifying and finishes off the movie with a bang. A seminal film which, horror buff or not, you should make time to watch. 7.9 seems about right."

I of course believe that this is one of the scariest movies ever made and give it 10 stars. John Carpenter used many different tricks of lighting and shadow in order to create this masterpiece. He used many tricks of psychology in order to feed the movie goers fears of what might happen next. The tricks that Carpenter used are so simple.<br/><br/>As I said before I have seen Halloween many, many times. So yes, I know what happens. But, knowing something is going to happen and the anticipation of it happening is enough to make anybody jump even just a little.<br/><br/>I love Halloween from beginning to end. But I will describe my three favorite scenes from the movie.<br/><br/>The first scene I liked is when Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens) are driving up to Smith's Grove Sanitarium. They are talking as they drive up to the hospital and all of a sudden they see several patients wandering around in a storm. Dr. Loomis orders Chambers to drive up to the gate, he gets out of the car to inspect the gate house. As Loomis does this, one of the patients climbs on top of the car and then forces Chambers out. The patient, later determined to be Michael Myers (Tony Moran), drives off.<br/><br/>The second of my favorite scenes is one that has been talked about before on other reviews. It's the scene where Annie Brackett (Nancy Kyes) is going to pick up her boyfriend. She goes out to her car and tries to get in, but the door is locked. She runs back into the house to get her keys and comes back and gets into the car... without using the keys to unlock the door. She goes to put the key in the ignition and notices the windows are fogged up. As she tries to wipe off the condensation she is attacked by Michael Myers, wearing his now famous mask. Michael eventually cuts Annie's throat. Of course, the fact that her throat is cut is not why I like this scene. I like this scene because Annie doesn't even pay attention to what she is doing, but a real movie fan would have picked up on the fact that she couldn't get into the car and then about 30 seconds later she can.<br/><br/>Before I describe my third favorite scene I want to tell you about my favorite line. Dr. Loomis explains ""I met him, fifteen years ago; I was told there was nothing left; No reason, no conscience, no understanding; and even the most rudimentary sense of life or death, of good or evil, right or wrong. I met this six-year old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face, and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes. I spent eight years trying to reach him, and then another seven trying to keep him locked up because I realized that what was living behind that boy's eyes was purely and simply... evil.""<br/><br/>The third scene I liked is when Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) goes to the Wallace house to see what is keeping Annie. She walks in and searches the house, but doesn't find anyone until she gets to an upstairs bedroom. When she enters the bedroom she finds her friends Annie, Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Lynda's boyfriend, Bob Sims (John Michael Graham) have been killed. She runs from the Wallace house to the Doyle house, across the street, in an attempt to call the police. Laurie is pursued by Micheal and then the real fun begins. Michael pursues Laurie several times; I say ""several times"" because Laurie stabs him with knitting needles and a few other items, but he gets up after each. It is only after Dr. Loomis shoots Michael several times that he seems to be stopped.<br/><br/>Yes, I know, I gave away the ending of the movie. There aren't too many ways that someone could have never seen Halloween. Giving away the ending of a movie that is over 30 years old is not a bad thing. Like I said before it is the way the scenes are set up that make the movie anyway. The psychology of fear that John Carpenter used to scare everyone.<br/><br/>I already gave this movie 10 stars out of 10. What did you think?"
"AaronCapenBanner","9","0","3","12 September 2013"," Scary And Influential Horror Classic.
","John Carpenter directed this terrifying film about mysterious murderer Michael Myers, who kills his sister at the age of 6 in 1963, then 15 years later, escapes from the asylum to return to his hometown of Haddonfield Illinois to stalk and kill seemingly random teenagers. Donald Pleasance is excellent as his determined psychiatrist tracking him down, to either recapture or kill, and persuade local police that Myers is a real threat. Jamie Lee Curtis plays babysitter Laurie strode, who becomes the primary target of Michael, after dealing with her friends first....<br/><br/>Extremely well directed thriller builds a palpable sense of dread throughout, punctuated by the chilling, unforgettable, and relentless music score, all leading to a frightening, unforgettable ending.<br/><br/>First(and by far the best) of a long series comprising seven sequels, two remakes, and countless imitators."

","This is my favorite movie. I love everything about it. What it's about and how it was made. This will be an iconic movie forever and with it's low budget makes Halloween a stroke of genius. The way the movie was filmed and the Carpenter-created score makes this movie very creepy. It isn't in your face about it either. This movie is subtle, and leaves it up to your imagination. There is not much gore, but tons of suspense. Even Michael Myers mask is plain and low-keyed, but it's awesome. The POV filming was great and innovating for that time. Black Christmas did it a few years before Halloween, but Halloween was a bigger hit. The storyline is great and plays into the plot perfectly. The not-knowing is the key element to this film. The time of year to express this film was excellent. This film wouldn't be the same if it were in the summer or any of the other holidays. Halloween was the perfect time for Michael to flip his switch as a child. I wish people would watch Halloween to see a great film that was made on an extremely low budget. A movie that pioneered so many aspects to the horror genre. Halloween was written and then put on the screen to show that when all the pieces fall into place a masterpiece is born!"

","This movie defines the horror genre. It was one of the first slashers ever made, and it is great for its time. The coolest thing was when the camera went into Michael's view when he was getting the knife and stuff when he was six. I also liked the part where when he finds Laurie, he breaks open the closet door with his bare hands. It adds such a good scare factor, because you actually know how powerful Michael is. It had a great story line, and it bested all of the horror movies I seen. It is great in all its true 1978 glory, and the effects for that time are awesome! There's no extremely cheesy parts and the story actually goes. This movie is a true classic, and it is recognized as the first best-selling horror movie. Watch it."

","'Halloween' is that slasher flick we all initially heard of that has the killer in the white mask who stalks the babysitters on Halloween. It is the best slasher/horror film out there, because it mixes suspense and fear yet does so without so much blood. Gore is necessary in some horror movies, it can make up for lack of story/plot/excitement. Halloween didn't need any of that to be successful. The story goes that young Michael Myers killed his older sister as a child on Halloween, stabbing her to death. Fifteen years later to the day, he escapes the mental institution he was in (under the care of Dr. Loomis) and begins stalking Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). He follows her around at her school, follows her and her friends when they're walking home, all leading up to Halloween night when the murder and mayhem begin.<br/><br/>So many awesome things about this original Halloween, from the music to the big chase scene at the end between Michael and Laurie. I loved that it took place on Halloween, and we see the trick or treaters and the jack-o-lanterns. Great atmosphere. The body count is pretty low in this one, but when a murder happens John Carpenter makes it count. It's always dark and you never know when he's going to pop out at his victim. The white mask he wears works wonderfully as well. Acting was pretty good all around from PJ Soles to Nancy Loomis to Donald Pleasence to of course Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween should be seen by every movie fan, not just horror.<br/><br/>10/10 - A perfect horror film"
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","9","0","1","19 June 2013"," Uncomfortable to sit through (in a good way)
","If there is one film that director John Carpenter will be best known for, it'll be this slasher film. Taking his inspiration from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), John Carpenter creates a work that is quite honestly, one the most unsettling horror pictures any horror fan should see. And for the budget that it was made on, should amaze viewers even more. This is one of those rare gems that are hard to come by. There is one thing to pick on but it's not the most relevant of things.<br/><br/>The story starts out about a small boy who is convicted of murder in 1963. Skip 15 years later, he breaks out of the asylum and returns to his hometown on Halloween night to seek more victims. Coming straight into this madman's path is a high school girl who has no rhyme or reason to meet him. It just so happens that fate was behind it. Playing the high school girl, Laurie Strode is now famous actress, Jaime Lee Curtis. Boy does Curtis have some hair in this movie. I'm so used to her having short hair.<br/><br/>But besides that, Curtis does a great job displaying her fear on screen. I think many can agree that anyone would react in the same way if they ran into this killer. Along with her is veteran actor Donald Pleasence who plays the killer's doctor, Dr. Loomis. Pleasence also puts in a good performance because he portrays how serious the situation is. And although he is not credited as Michael Myers and is instead called ""The Shape"", Nick Castle as the killer is also great at his role. A towering 6-foot giant is not a happy sight if he's carrying a kitchen knife with him and is wearing a white expressionless mask.<br/><br/>However, one of the more surprising things about this movie is that for gore, it's rather tame. There's only a body count of 5, total, and even the killing scenes are not that gruesome. That's nothing to knock at though. The way John Carpenter really makes this character effective is by making the killer elusive and creepy. When the killer is on screen, he doesn't talk and just stands around like a scarecrow, watching menacingly. Even creepier is how a character will see him one minute and the next he's gone. It's almost like he wasn't there to begin with. That's what's difficult to stomach. Imagine if there was someone like that in your neighborhood? Yeeesh.<br/><br/>However here's where I have to knock the film though. I wanted a little back-story about this killer. Why did he kill at such a young age? Was it intended? Was it out of curiosity? Or is there really a demon inhabiting the boy's body? Why? And the audience will never have it answered. I wish that at least was explained. But that's it. Finally what topped off this work was John Carpenter's self composed score. There may have not been too many diverse tracks, but he did have a main theme for the franchise and the characters themselves, which made every scene memorable. In most tracks, a piano will play at either a quick or slow pace. But either way, it will get the chills going.<br/><br/>Thanks to John Carpenter's ingenuity, October 31rst will never quite feel the same again. The actors put in great performances, the music is tantalizingly cringe worthy and the killer himself is not to be reckoned with."
"seanmulgrew96","10","0","1","9 June 2013"," Sheer horror perfection!
","This film earns its reputation as arguably the best horror movie ever made.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's 1978 classic crafts the modern slasher genre, with an elusive killer stalking teenagers before swooping in for the kill. The character of Michael Myers is enough to strike fear to anyone, and Donald Pleasence's Dr Loomis provides an excellent match for the film's antagonist in an outstanding performance. Jamie Lee Curtis' character gives a likable protagonist for the audience to connect with.<br/><br/>The plot of the film may seem a little clichéd, but Carpenter produces magnificently, accompanied by an unforgettable soundtrack, provides the ultimate horror experience for any movie fan."

","I think that this is a great movie for anyone who wants to watch a suspenseful slasher film that isn't too gory. It is great because well it just is. It defines Michael as the boogeyman himself and this is one of if not the only movie that defines the true boogeyman we are all afraid of deep down. It mentions that he has a pale, emotionless face and that he doesn't know even basic rudimentary sense. I would recommend anyone who has seen this film to see Friday the 13th because they are both the boogeyman of they're own respectable franchises. I like this because it is almost in a sense one of the scariest films I have seen because it is realistic in a sense that all people have this type of evil build-up in them in their own different way."

","This little gem was made by director john carpenter and is a fine example of how an amazing film can be made with a little budget and not a lot of gore... the setting for this film is an American town - Haddonfield .. we can all identify with this as its a pretty normal neighbourhood and not the normal setting for a horror movie- which makes this film all the more creepy- murder and terrible things can happen in your street... the killer Michael myers is creepy and silent ..and really taps into your fears.. while he is a force to be reckoned with this isn't a monster from a swamp or a vampire this a little boy grown into a man who chooses to kill.. for no apparent reason and that is scary as hell!! The actors are sometimes wooden and yes some lines are cheesy but all in all a fantastic effort was made by everyone, Donald Pleasence was a welcome addition and really does bring it to nother level.. Jamie Lee Curtis brings a realism to the role of the Final Girl and grows from a timid bookworm to a scared girl finding the strength to fight the villain in the final scenes... Nancy Loomis and P.J Soles are none to shabby as the best friends who face a terrible fate. Fantastic film and was the springboard of many more slasher films. Great"

","Halloween is a classic slasher/horror film with a strong following even to this day. <br/><br/>The film is about a kid named Michael Myers who one day on Halloween of 1963 brutally murders his older sister. 15 years later he breaks out of the funny farm and has plans to go back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois to continue his murderous work, but he has his Dr and the police on his tale and for one girl Named Laurie Strode it is going to be a night she will wish had never happened. <br/><br/>Overview: Halloween is as a said at the beginning a classic horror film. The plot is easy to follow, the acting is strong and even though the budget for this film is little, the director sure knows what he is doing and how he wants this film to look. Michael Myers is a serial killer who doesn't just murder people within a quick of a heartbeat, he is a clever calculated killer with no motive to his actions what so ever. The film takes a slow build to get to the action but at the finale Michael really wants to kill Laurie and starks her basically right through the film. <br/><br/>Overall I give this film 5 star because it is a classic, it is a film that I would recommend to see at cinemas when this was out because it is just a classic masterpiece."

","While babysitting for her neighbors, a teen finds her friends being stalked and killed by a masked madman on Halloween night as his doctor begins rushing through town trying to halt his rampage.<br/><br/>This is a rather confusing and really tough film to talk about. One of the main issues is that of familiarity, in that this has been replicated and imitated so often that, the original loses its power and that indeed has happened here. Most of the different tactics and clichés apparent here have been done so often that it doesn't really feel special that we got those tactics started out here. From the preoccupied minds obsessed with sex and drinking to notice the killer, his usage of a mask to hide his identity, the butchery done on his victims and the heroine able to outlast his onslaught have all been done to death since this that there doesn't feel anything special about them being placed here. The lack of gore doesn't help either, as it tends to give this one such a dry feel that, due to the low body-count it really has a big problem here in actually being original, which when combined with it's slow pace makes for a rather problematic viewing. If you go in looking for a well-made film, it's actually really good in that regard with plenty of suspenseful moments, some innovative tricks and a great assortment of stalking scenes wrapped together, but as a whole it's not as great as it's been made out to be.<br/><br/>Rated R: Violence, Nudity, two sex scenes, some language and mild drug use."

Halloween is the improvement by Carpenter of how war films should be. he set war in your neighborhood. you can't kill the whole army by killing just one soldier. they'll keep attack you again and again. besides you don't know them. their name, and face. and where they came from. and .... why they are attacking you. no wonder boogie-man is immortal. he's a one whole army himself. in my opinion, Halloween is the masterpiece of anti-warfare."

He was the master of horror in the seventy's and the eighty's but his last films were a bit less good.

"beaulieu-sam","9","0","1","24 July 2012"," A classic horror movie
","I cannot even comprehend how this classic has only an overall 7.9 rating on IMDb. This is a disgrace. This movie dawned an onslaught of slasher movies to come, and still few of them are as suspenseful as this nearly 35 year old movie is.<br/><br/>Just the idea of a paranormal being like Michael Myers gives one the chills. And then imagine it chasing you until it kills you, and the mere idea is frightening.<br/><br/>The idea behind this film is that Michael Myers(Tony Moran), was a mentally disturbed child since he murdered his sister in cold blood when wearing a mask on Halloween as a child. He had been institutionalized ever since this incident, until he escaped one night and began terrorizing the population of one of the near small towns.<br/><br/>laurie Stroud(Jamie Lee Curtis) had started getting harassed by Michael when she and her friends had been walking home, and her friend shouts out an insult at michael for driving so slow. In this first suspenseful scene, Micheal simply stops the car. This leaves you wondering, on edge of your seat, what he will do...but he ends up driving off anyways. Eventually, Micheal ends up picking off Laurie's friends one by one. When Laurie goes to check it out.. she finds all the bodies of her friends. Quickly after that, she is acquainted with the killer, whom she runs away from. This is also one of my personal favourite parts. She runs home and wakes up one of the kids sleeping in the house, who takes quite a while to get downstairs and unlock the door for the poor laurie. During this scene, you watch the slow moving Michael walk closer and closer to the house, and by the time the little boy unlocks the door, michael is nearly on the porch. This scene is followed by many which must have petrified the observer. The closet scene, for example was quite a scary clip especially watching it for the first time.<br/><br/>All in all, I must say that if this does not crack the all time greatest horror movies, that i don't know what does. I'ts not the acting or the jump scares that make this movie a classic- it's the way that Michael is portrayed. The way this movie built suspense. It's soundtrack, it's use of lighting, and the way that Michael is there one moment and not the next- THAT is what made this movie. The way that you can never tell what he or it is... even though he appearers to be a mortal, human being."

","The black screen begins to roll the opening credits, and all we see is a sinister jack-o-lantern. This is the beginning of what is among the best of the horror genre and an indomitable classic. It's easy for people to forget that this film was the first in the overly long line of ""teen slashers"". This film gave birth to the sub-genre audiences have become so accustomed to it's become a formula. The Friday the 13th series ran it into the ground full-steam, Jason X anybody, with over ten sequels. Still, Michael Meyers lives on in this classic. Regardless of the sequels and rip-offs, this is still one of John Carpenter's finest.<br/><br/>Leading this off is a well-acted set of characters. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her debut quite excellently, and Donald Pleasance is simply iconic as Dr. Loomis. And no one can forget the music of John Carpenter. Most definitely the scariest piano you'll ever here. My favorite scene from this masterpiece? Probably when Annie (played by Nancy Loomis) yells,"" Hey jerk, speed kills!"" Somehow, despite being in complete daylight, the driver is in complete shadow and actually stops the car dead in the middle of the street. The character of Michael Meyers is one crazy guy, certainly not one I'd ever want to see outside my window."

"jjpurwitsky","10","0","1","6 July 2012"," The Halloween Saga: Halloween
","Horror movies have been around since the early days of cinema. Right from the beginnings of the silent era and effortlessly continuing through the many ensuing decades, horror cinema has left it's mark on audiences and always leaves with them wanting more. <br/><br/>Dracula, The Mummy and Frankenstein were the giants of the 30's and in the 50's monster movies were all the rage, but for the most part these movies, although scary at times, lacked a sense of sheer terror to them. The type of movies where you grip the person next to you or dig your nails into the seat just didn't exist. Cinema hadn't matured enough yet and these films relied heavily on the 'fantasy of cinema' rather than realism, or in the case of horror a sort of hyper-realism. <br/><br/>Then the 60's came along and things began to change. Films like Psycho and Rosemary's Baby brought that realism into the genre. The spectacular-ness of the previous era was over and the new filmmakers entering the industry were brining new and interesting ideas and changing the way things had been done. Case in point is George A. Romero. In 1968 he made and released Night of the Living Dead. This movie was terrifying, gory and a game changer for the industry. This movie single handedly cemented into the minds of the general public what a zombie is and what it looks like. Rarely had a horror movie shaped the genre as much as Night of the Living Dead had done. <br/><br/>By the 70's horror had become something completely different to the days of Legosi and Karloff. Movies like The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre were bringing in a sense of realism that suggested to the audience that these events could happen to you, out in the woods or even right there at home. Strong acting, methodical directors and innovate and gory effects took horror movies into a far darker place than ever before. <br/><br/>Then on October 25th, 1978 Halloween was unleashed on the public. Directed by John Carpenter and starring Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode and Donald Pleasance as Dr. Loomis, Halloween was unlike anything that had come before it. An unstoppable evil killer, Michael Myers, haunts a small town killing anyone he comes across as his doctor races to stop him. <br/><br/>Halloween is a tense, scary and exhilarating thrill ride from the opening scene to the last shot. It's got a dark and moody atmosphere, and beautifully composed shots by a very young Dean Cundey. The dark lighting has Myers popping in and out of the blackness that surrounds Laurie and her friends and helps set the mood of the film. <br/><br/>As does the music. composed by Carpenter himself. The haunting score is simple but effective and is used perfectly to emphasize the terror of Myers. His nightmare inducing theme is an instant classic. And there are plenty of music-less stretches too, where all you can here is Myers breathing and not knowing where he will pop up next. <br/><br/>It is fantastically directed by the young Carpenter who pulls great performances out of his leads. You feel for Laurie, you believe Dr. Loomis when he speaks and you fear Myers; a hulking large, brooding, masked killer who oozes evil in the way he walks and the way he moves. Unfortunately the acting of the kids in the film is poor and is really the only thing wrong with Halloween as a film. Everything else just works perfectly. There aren't that many kills, there is no gore and there is not much action until the last half hour but again, everything just gels perfectly. Watching the film will have you glued to the screen for every second of its 90 minute run time. <br/><br/>Halloween is a well made, original horror movie that is outright terrifying and downright unmissable. You can watch this movie over and over and never get bored and even though you know what's coming you'd still be scared and gripping your blanket tight.<br/><br/>Film Rating: 95%<br/><br/>Breakdown (How Halloween scored 95%):<br/><br/>Production Design: 9 out of 10 Cinematography: 10 out of 10 Re-playability: 10 out of 10 Originality: 9 out of 10 Costumes: 9 out of 10 Directing: 10 out of 10 Editing: 10 out of 10 Acting: 8 out of 10 Music: 10 out of 10 Script: 10 out of 10<br/><br/>view all my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com"

","John Carpenter's Halloween is a flawless horror classic from beginning to end and is one the films that defined modern horror and is one of the scariest movies of all time.<br/><br/>Halloween tells the tale of a young boy named Michael Myers at the age of six in 1963 in the small town of Haddenfield,Illinois on Halloween night stabbed and murder his sister and is sent to a Mental Hospital. Fifteen years later Michael Myers escapes from the hospital and is killing again on Halloween night while stalking three teenage girls that includes Laurie Strode(Jamie Lee Curtis). The only person that can stop Myers is his doctor Dr. Sam Loomis(Donald Pleasence).<br/><br/>Halloween is a timeless Horror classic that set the standard for the Horror/Slasher genre and spawned many imitators and it did for the Horror/Slasher genre like The Godfather did for Gangster films or 2001:A Space Odyssey did for the SCI-FI genre. Halloween and it's influence was imitated but never duplicated One of The main reasons Halloween is a classic that it is is because the storyline is so simple yet so terrifying. Director John Carpenter gives viewers a film that right from the beginning is a scary and frightening tale of terror that grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the very end. Where as later Slasher films depended on blood and gore to terrify audiences Carpenter and Halloween uses very simple techniques such as jump scares and suspense to great effect and truly frightens viewers. While I love blood and gore in Horror films I also love suspense and build-ups to scares and violence and that's one of the reasons Halloween works. What I also love about Halloween is the lighting and tone that Carpenter has in this film. The photography and lighting by Dean Cundey is brilliant giving the film an intense dark and claustrophobic nightmarish feel with natural during the day and frightening,surreal lighting at night using dark shadows where you feel that no character in the film is safe. Michael Myers is easily one of the greatest villains of the history of cinema and what makes Michael Myers so scary and frightening is that there are no answers,reasons,explanations or logic to why Michael Myers kills people. We all know why other Horror villains and cinema icons Freddy Kruger(A Nightmare On Elm Street series)and Jason Voorhees(Friday The 13th series)but we never know why Michael kills. Carpenter doesn't show Michael Myers as a human being but as a bogeyman,a shape,an unstoppable force of nature that can not be stopped,talked to or reasoned with and shows no feelings or emotions showing no pity,remorse or fear and will never stop what he's doing no matter what. Michael Myers is a classic villain and the true definition of evil. During the day scenes Carpenter smartly shows Michael Myers from a distance and from the points of view of the main characters with the points of view not showing Myers a lot but giving the viewer enough terror and dread. However,during the night scenes when Michael Myers is stalking his prey Carpenter gives us more close-ups of Michael Myers' face that is highly lightened in the shadows. You feel like Michael Myers is a character that is pretty much everywhere and all over the place and can strike anywhere,anytime whether it's day or night and that's very scary. Halloween also shows viewers that even in the environment of the suburbs no one is safe from the horrific wrath and destruction of Michael Myers. The film's two other main characters Dr. Sam Loomis and Laurie Strode are great characters who are heroic and have enough depth and sympathy to make you root for them when the bad things start to happen and work as memorable protagonists opposite Michael Myers. The ending of Halloween is brilliant and a classic John Carpenter ending that leaves viewers on the edge of their seats and makes viewers ask a lot questions and never gives viewers many answers. I think the ending tells viewers that you can try to stop evil,but evil never,ever fully goes away and that is one of the reasons Halloween is an amazing classic.<br/><br/>The cast does a great job in their roles. Donald Pleasence is excellent as Dr.Sam Loomis and brings a calm,quiet demeanor to the performance. Pleasence's monologue about Michael Myers is one of the film's great moments. Jamie Lee Curtis(in her film debut)is wonderful as Laurie Strode making Laurie sweet,likable and sympathetic. It's no wonder Curtis was a scream queen in the late 70s and early 80s. Nick Castle is excellent as Michael Myers,one of the greatest villains of all time. Castle walks slowly,stares at people,tilts his head and wears that frightening white masks that defines evil. Castle's performance set the standard for slasher movie villains. Nancy Kyes(Annie),P.J Soles(Linda),Charles Cyphers(Sheriff Brackett),Brian Andrews(Tommy)and Kyle Richards(Lindsey)also do well in their roles as well.<br/><br/>The direction by John Carpenter is brilliant,giving the film tension and creepiness,moving the camera and showing the small town and neighborhood during the day and night,while also doing great with the scary and suspenseful scenes and also does a great job with the Michael Myers point of view shots. Great direction.<br/><br/>The score by John Carpenter is one of the scariest,terrifying scores of all time and is so iconic. The opening theme is so effective and scary that it will be stuck in your head after you watch the film. The theme and score is classic and one of the things that makes the film.<br/><br/>Halloween is simply a Horror classic,one of the greatest films ever made and one of John Carpenter's best. If you love Horror films or films in general see this movie. Highly Recommended. 10/10."

","Halloween: a holiday of children trick-or-treating for candy, but what comes up in the year 1978? The film masterpiece Halloween! I am a big horror fan, and what horror fan would I be without seeing and owning the most classic chilling film out there. Halloween is a film about Michael Myers who killed his sister at a young age, several years later he escapes and returns to where he once lived. A the same time, Laurie Strode a high school student is going about her life, trying to find a date and babysitting. What she doesn't know is that the embodiment of evil: Michael Myers is about to wreck her plans.<br/><br/>That's about what the film is about, let me just say that I like this more than the newer horror films like SAW and the remakes. What Halloween offers is much more than what the newer films supposedly try to give, Halloween gives you chills with the daunting appearance of evil, suspense with the simple yet terrifying death scenes, and fear knowing at the end that the killer is still out there. I see myself as a person who judges characters, for example: Michael Myers. I like the other classic horror icons: Jason, Freddy, Chucky, and ghostface. Michael is the first Jason (if you will), silent, deadly, and unstoppable. But what I like about Michale more than Jason, is that John Carpenter tries to show Michael as pure evil, Jason however is shown as a victim. That reason could explain Jason's popularity with the modern people, but it should be said: Michael Myers is perhaps a better 'VILLAIN' than Jason Voorhees.<br/><br/>My final thoughts: This film deserves to be recognized for its simple yet scary scenes, and I recommend this film to anyone, if your one who wants to get into Horror, start with this one."

","""Warning"". May contain spoilers. ""Halloween"", the one and only, in which John Carpenter had directed, was and is the ultimate in slasher/horror storytelling. I myself am a big fan of John Carpenter's films e.g. The Fog, Escape from New York, The Thing and the list goes on. This director doesn't make movies to add pointless and unnecessary scenes that can drag on and confuse most moviegoers. He goes straight to the point and meaning by the written script. Halloween is probably the only slasher flick that surpasses all other imitators and sequels due to being the original idea. <br/><br/>The movie has the perfect setting to make a classic slasher. The autumnal leaves, the blue hues used in the night shots that set the creepiness and murky darkness and overshadowing Michael Myers. He especially is one evil, foreboding force of nature. For one moment appears behind his unsuspecting victims and next minute when the camera moves towards a different position then back again to where he was standing, he disappears. He also blends in with the pitch blackness and reveals only his pale bluish-white mask, just like a phantom. Orange jack-o-lanterns grinning and glowing, especially one serving as the fulcrum when the camera move in towards its left eye and until then the camera closes in and the light dims and goes out in the opening credits. That's a great way of delivering the message of the consequences we choose that often attend our usual manner of perception. <br/><br/>What makes the movie another big highlight is leaving aside the minimal gore and graphic violence. I don't mind it, but while many low-budget horror/slasher films thought gore was essential to startle audiences, Halloween had the guts to play out as the jack-in-the-box, where the killer lunges into our field of vision or moving slowly towards the victims' backs to trick or scare its viewers. Also, the first person camera viewing which represents the killer's point-of-view and heavy breathing is intensely creepy and claustrophobic. I wonder what his intentions are when walking around in such shadowy and murky areas. Who is his next victim? And, of course you can't forget the moody music that John Carpenter had composed for the introduction and then used to represent the killer's presence. It literally delves us into a dark corner.<br/><br/>The fear meters aren't as high as they used to be when Halloween and horror films before and mostly 80's horror films arrived. Although gore was introduced around the 80's, they still used the method of having something burst into our image. And because gore has been introduced, the jack-in-the-box technique has degraded. Gore and graphic violence has now stepped onto the line of horror films and is commonly used as a new way of shocking audiences by thrusting them into becoming squeamish and not coming to see it again. It's nothing new and is a bummer. It's not original and it's mainly carbon copies of one's previously used idea to eventually reach profitable box office results.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis is great as playing the helpless victim and finally to becoming a sole survivor, especially her screams are classic and high- pitched. Donald Pleasance as Michael's doctor was given the perfect script to behave scared witless and desperate when on the hunt for his patient (the killer). His narration on Michael's psyche is also suspiciously quoted. It eludes us into a very, very dark world where the secret lies at the heart of one's inside. Welcome to the world where true terror lies. 9.5/10"

","'Halloween' is a classic horror, not to mention more or less the creation of the slasher genre, the likes of which haven't been seen in many years. Unlike most modern horror films, there's not a lot of visible gore, whereas today, films seem to depend on a steady diet of blood and gore.<br/><br/>On the other hand, with creative lighting effects the film creates a great atmosphere. Some kills almost feel artistic, like when Michael pins a teen to the wall shown only in silhouette.<br/><br/>It's true that more could be explained on why Micheal felt the need to kill, but maybe he's better as a mindless killing machine. The sequels and remakes that try to give him reason usually end up making the plot more ridiculous.<br/><br/>Although there's not a lot of emphasis on character depth, the film does manage to make us care about the character enough to make us afraid. And it does so without fountains of blood. Parts come off a little cheesy sometimes, like Micheal with the bed sheet over him like a kid in a ghost costume, but there's a charm in this movie that most modern ones can't capture.<br/><br/>(This is a heavily altered version of a review I wrote for RottonTomatoes)"

","A masterpiece. For pure visceral scares, HALLOWEEN is the the scariest film ever made. John Carpenter's film is more than a slasher film, it's an experience. A recently escaped mental patient returns to his home town and sets his sights on local babysitter Jamie Lee Curtis. He's pursued by dour psychiatrist Donald Pleasence. There's no more plot than that but it's so well put together, with razor sharp editing, scary music, and a genuinely menacing villain. Both Pleasence & Curtis are great and the supporting cast features Nancy Loomis & the always entertaining PJ Soles, who solidified her status a one of the queens of cult-filmdom by appearing in ROCK-N-ROLL HIGH SCHOOL the following year."

This simple low budget slasher film was an industry defining moment for John Carpenter and Debra Hill. Having a little known cast apart from Donald Pleasance and on a small budget that most sports stars wages these days it delivered on everything for me. The title character of The Shape (Michael Myers) is one of the best known movie villains today and the original has spawned up to now 9 sequels. If you want to watch an actual horror film and not just big breasted teenagers on facebook and ipods then you must watch this film it defined a genre and forever will be a classic"

","When John Carpenter made Halloween in the late 70s he practically redefined modern horror. This seems strange now, when Hollywood can scarcely go a month without releasing yet another 'bad guy stalks pretty young girls' film.<br/><br/>It's easy to see how this film influenced others though, it is well made and boasts extremely patient pacing, which must've kept the audiences perpetually on edge.<br/><br/>It's harder to see how this was ever truly scary The film opens in Haddonfield, Illinois in 1963. It is Halloween and in one long unbroken – mostly dialogue free – scene we meet young Michael Myers for the very first time carrying out his very first kill. And by young I mean around 6 or 7.<br/><br/>The next time we meet Michael he is in the process of escaping from the psychiatric hospital which served as his home ever since that initial 'unpleasantness', in a bizarre scene indeed. Dr Loomis (more on him later) and a nurse are headed to the mental hospital that has served as Myer's home/prison since his youth. As they approach in the pitch black darkness and driving rain they can see several 'free range' patients roaming about in their whites.<br/><br/>After pausing to ponder if this is usual practise Myers commandeers the vehicle and drives off. As Loomis himself later wonders, it isn't a bad effort to be a skilled driver seeing as you've been locked up since you were 6<br/><br/>So where does a social menace go to savour his first taste of freedom in over a decade? Home of course. Back to Haddonfield. But things done changed just a little, the Myers' residence is a little run-down and something of a haunted house already to the local kids, which is only exacerbated by the fact that it is once again Halloween and tykes are scampering about collecting lollies and otherwise getting up to mischief.<br/><br/>The good Dr Loomis shows and heads immediately to the local police. He knows just what is coming having dealt with Myers for years, and he tells anyone who will listen, which is practically no-one. Even the police only show a passing concern at the potential psychotic killer in their midst on the night that practically every kid is roaming the streets at night<br/><br/>For some reason Myers headed all the way home to try to kill random strangers, in this case three young schoolgirls, one of whom is conscientious and sensible, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), and two who are, for lack of a better term, sluts.<br/><br/>This solid build up slows dramatically from here during the mid-section of the film. In short Myers dons a boiler coat and the admittedly eerie melted-Shatner mask and spends what seems like eternity lurking in the edge of every scene. He's practically everywhere! Standing. Watching. Looming silently. Always where those that he is observing will be or were just – but rarely where they are – looking.<br/><br/>Once Michael finally makes his presence felt things finally get to moving, the finale involves the (what has become) usual stumbling, screaming, sobbing and stabbing, with a slow shuffling Michael always a step or two behind the fast moving prey. Michael himself takes a licking but keeps right on ticking, something that he only got better at the further the unnecessary sequels went.<br/><br/>Halloween is rightfully renowned and still pretty effective – if not very scary – in the present day. The piano tinkling score is unnerving and like a video game seems to signify that Michael is in close proximity. Donald Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis add credibility to the film with sincere performances – in fact the entire film is far less campy than many of its peers from the 70s and 80s – and the film helped write the modern slasher rulebook, notably the sections that demand pretty teens who covet alcohol and sex must be killed, and the fact that a slow shuffling pursuer somehow always manages to catch the fast fleeing teens.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. Like fine food in expensive restaurants I can appreciate Halloween for its quality and better attributes, but like the flash meals it just isn't my bag and the scary portions are just too small to satiate me."

","This film is more or less an independent make, with that being said the production quality is fair for what the budget was and the resources that were available to the crew at the time. One of the aspects that I did find rather interesting was the fact that the majority of this was shot with a steady cam, a device that we would not normally associate with this ear of movie making. If it was not for this, the shots that were achieved in the film would other wise be nearly impossible to pull off by other convention methods at the time. The shots in the movie enable the viewer to be brought into the experience, such as in the opening sequence when the viewer is in the point of view of Michael Myers. We are engulfed into the madness that is going on within his head with that first opening sequence. As the film goes on the majority of the indoor and tracking shots were flawlessly . With the techniques that were employed in this film John Carpenter was able to build up the tension that was going to happen in the movie. This is a big contrast to modern movies in the same genre that tend to have many quick cuts and a more action rich environment. The slower pace pull in the viewer enabling them to fully take in the whole scene. The filmmaker creates Myers to be the embodiment of evil. With his very machine nature furthers his lack of humanity and builds up the viewers fear of him. The addition of his white mask furthers this separation from man to monster, a monster in which any man could become. No matter what actions anyone takes Myers rises up and continues in his attack. This fear of an unstoppable enemy is frightening to most people. Also the fact that the film tried to imply that the safety that suburban America thinks they have is a farce. All in all this movie was the first of it's kind and still scares audiences to this day."

","More than 30 years from it's release, ""Halloween"" still remains one of the finest and scariest horror movies of all time, and it deserves it because it's a near-perfect film with great acting, cinematography, and suspense, along with a chilling score and and an extremely claustrophobic and nerve-shattering feel. It's definitely a movie to see in the dark. It's actually one of the only horror movies that freak me out whenever I see it, and I don't really get freaked by horror movies easily. When 6 year old Michael Myers stabs his teenage sister, Judith, to death, he is put in a sanitarium for 15 years, but later on escapes and starts stalking a teenager named Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) on Halloween. Later on, he starts to kill her friends, until, in the heart- stopping climax which had me on the edge of my seat, tries to kill her. In the short 91 minutes of the film, it really packs a punch of terror and unnerve. It's like no other film when it comes to the terror, which borrows a lot from Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which is pretty ironic, since Jamie Lee Curtis is Janet Leigh's daughter. I think Halloween is the best slasher film ever made (if you don't count Psycho as a slasher). It really started the whole ""teenagers getting murdered by a killer wearing a mask"" thing. Most of the scenes that show Michael Myers's POV are seen through his creepy, emotionless mask, along with his muffled breathing sounds, which really gives a nice touch of suspense. The acting is amazing; especially from Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance. It's amazing what you can do on such a small budget (this film had a budget of only $325,000). ""Halloween"" is and always will be one of the greatest horror films ever made. It's a must see."

","In 1978, John Carpenter shocked film audiences around the world with his horror masterpiece ""Halloween,"" effectively creating a new sub-genre of horror film, the slasher, and spawning countless copycats and sequels throughout the 80's and 90's. But what was it about Carpenter's influential masterpiece that initiated the so-called slasher craze? Carpenter effectively crafted ""Halloween"" to instill suspense and fear into its viewers and influence filmmakers for decades.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" follows good-girl Laurie Strode, and her friends, Annie and Lynda, on a typical Halloween night. Little do they know, escaped murderer Michael Myers has been following them, and their Halloween night will not turn out as they had expected. ""Halloween"" begins shocking its audience right from the opening sequence. The unique point-of-view, behind the mask, continuous shot of the vicious murder of Judith Myers puts the audience right in the antagonists shoes. It is soon revealed that the point of view is from six year old Michael Myers, who blankly at the camera, holding a bloody butcher knife.<br/><br/>Carpenter shifts the focal point onto Laurie Strode and her friends, as well as Myers' doctor Sam Loomis, who is obsessively hunting him. Carpenter carefully paces this part of the film, creating ample suspense with shots of Myers standing in the background unnoticed, stalking our protagonist, until the final half hour of the film when Myers finally strikes and complete terror unfolds upon the audience.<br/><br/>The main quality of this film that denotes it as one of the greatest horror films of all time is its use of suspense and the unknown to scare viewers. Myers' motives for what he is doing are completely unknown. The only explanation, given by Dr. Loomis, is that he is ""pure evil."" This is characterized perfectly by the blank, white mask Myers wears throughout the film. Carpenter also uses film techniques to create suspense and instill fear into viewers. You have no clue where he is, and where he could strike next. One of the main things that sticks with audiences is the score of the film. From the eerie main theme, to the bone chilling zing that plays at the most surprising moments, the score perfectly reflects the events in the film and strengthens the emotions of the audience. Carpenter also selects the best shots to use, and is constantly reminding us the Michael Myers could be anywhere, stalking Laurie and her friends. With Halloween, Carpenter proved that you don't need a big budget and flashy effects to create a masterpiece. Produced independently with just $320,000, ""Halloween"" scared generations with its eerie score, dimly lit scenes, and precisely constructed shots. ""Halloween"" personifies fear and gives it a name: Michael Myers. Fans of horror films will surely love it, and it is a must see for anyone who enjoys getting spooked. Three decades later, John Carpenter's"" Halloween"" is still just as frightening as it was when it was released, and it doesn't rely on blood and gore or modern ""shock tactics"" to scare the pants off audiences."

","There is no horror film more sinister or more brilliant than that of John Carpenter's Halloween. Released October 25, 1978, Carpenter's film went on gross more than $47 million dollars, making it the eighth highest grossing film of the year. The film tells the haunting tale of Michael Myers, a 21 year old man who fifteen years earlier, murdered his 17 year old sister Judith on Halloween night after she finished having sex. At six years old, Michael was placed in a mental institution where Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) becomes his primary psychiatrist. Dr. Loomis however, sees a darkness in Michael that can't be explained. He spent a few years attempting to get through to him and the rest trying to keep him locked up. On Halloween 1978, Michael escapes and goes on a murder rampage through Haddonfield, Illinois attempting to get to his one last blood relative Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis). Forget Rob Zombie's version of the franchise and forget the mediocre sequels that followed the 1978 hit (actually, Halloween II is pretty awesome as well), Carpenter's original set the bar for all ""scary"" movies that would follow but never measure. Carpenter's handle of the film is smart, innovative, and pulse pounding. Prior to this film, Carpenter had only had two full length features under his belt, Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) and Dark Star (1974). Halloween put Carpenter on the map.<br/><br/>One of Jamie Lee Curtis' very first roles... While the screenplay by Carpenter and Debra Hill is the A-typical cheese-fest that horror films offers, the acting of Curtis and Pleasance are some of the best work seen in this genre. Granted, the bar hasn't been raised too high in this regards, but it's a notable mention. Nick Castle, who actually portrays Myers in his adult, jump suited, William Shatner mask wearing sociopath shape controls an aura that spits out of the screen and sets your fears ablaze. Michael Myers is hands down the creepiest, most terrifying film killer in my memory. Put Chucky in front of me, I'd kick him across the room. Put Freddy in my dreams, I'll laugh myself awake. Put Jason in front of me, I'd take him to Central Park ice skating rink and do a triple axle on his face. Put Michael Myers in front of me, give me a new diaper; I just went on myself. No question about it. The most famous aspect of the film, and nearly the franchise, is the outstanding score constructed by John Carpenter himself. Never has a score been so identifiable or synonymous with a character or genre. If you've lived under a rock all these years or haven't had the stomach to face the franchise, take a night, introduce yourself to Michael and see how the horror genre was meant to be done.

"DionysusEleuthereus","7","0","1","31 October 2011"," A horror classic marred only by poor acting and frustrating plot devices
","It goes without saying that this 1978 John Carpenter classic helped pioneer the stalker-horror sub-genre that has served as an inspiration to such films as the 'Friday the 13th' and 'Scream' franchises. Unfortunately, it also helped inspire a sleuth of unworthy sequels and a Rob Zombie remake that should probably never have happened.<br/><br/>The brilliance of John Carpenter really shines through in this movie as he creates an uncomfortable bond between Myers and the audience itself by making them FEEL that he is there alongside them, watching the protagonist and her friends just as they are in meta-theatrical genius. <br/><br/>In such a way, there is much to be praised in the film's execution as well as the portrayal of the silent killer archetype. However, the film contains two striking shortcomings, rendered even more astounding due to Carpenter's otherwise flawless record. The first is Jamie Lee Curtis' poor and sometimes irritating acting which almost makes you want to watch the film in mute during the second half of the film. The second shortcoming pertains to the very conveniently-placed plot devices which either defy logic or beg for an explanation. <br/><br/>As a whole, this is a 'must-see' for every horror and suspense fan, but prepare yourself for a few head-scratching moments along the way."

","Where to begin with Halloween, It's simply one of the best films / horror films ever made. I have seen it time after time since I was a kid and have always loved it. It's almost perfect.<br/><br/>Plot: <br/><br/>After Michael Myers murders his sister as a child he it incarcerated in an asylum until one stormy night when he escapes and returns to stalk Haddonfield. Once there, he dons a white mask a huge butcher knife and and stalks babysitter Laurie Strode (Curtis) can Myers doctor Sam Loomis (Pleasence) save the residents of Haddonfield.<br/><br/>Hot or Not: <br/><br/>Halloween has everything you want from a horror movie. It is perfectly directed, from the chilling opening credits with the pumpkin to the mysterious ending.<br/><br/>The first 10 minutes are amazing and show great direction and camera skills and set up the rest of the film it opens the film to atmospheric brilliance.<br/><br/>Carpenter manages to make a mundane town, desolate and terrifying the long location shots instantly make the viewer un easy even in the day time scenes. No matter when you watch the film Summer, Winter or Spring, it makes you feel Autumy, it makes it feel like Halloween. Another thing that makes this film creepy is the way the shape can move around in the day, it suggests that you are never safe day or night.<br/><br/>The music in the film is brilliant, the piano is brilliant a score written by Carpenter and builds the tension amazingly. It is a score only rivalled my the Exorcist (1973).<br/><br/>There isn't much gore here and it is not needed. Its good to see how horror films use to be made before the excessive gore of modern films. It is by far the best film in the franchise.<br/><br/>Birds and the Bees: <br/><br/>P.J. Soles shows us her boobs.<br/><br/>Acting: <br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie) is perfect for the role, she is unique and not an airhead like many of the leads today. She owns the title of top scream queen of all time. Shes also an excellent actress who has never down played her role in the film like many actresses who start of in horror films. Donald Pleasence (Loomis) gives a brilliant intense performance, his dialogue and one of lines are brilliant.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: <br/><br/>Halloween is a must for anyone who says they love the Horror genre. It is superb. Anyone who ignores this as just a slasher film is a fool. Yes it does have some faults but nothing to stop it getting a 10/10 rating. Brilliant film from one of the best horror directors out there."

","Halloween is a brilliantly, creepy thriller that is one of the best horror pictures and one of my favorite movies ever made.<br/><br/>The film starts in 1963. A 6 year old boy named Michael Myers brutally kills his sister on Halloween night. He gets put away into a mental institution and 15 years later he brakes out and goes back to his home town. There he stalks a baby sitter (Jamie Lee Curtis) and murders her two friends. While that happens his psychiatric Dr. Sam Loomis (the great Donald Pleasence) tries to track him down.<br/><br/>The plot is simple but works and is played out in a believable way. A lot of the credit goes to the cast. Donald Pleasence is great as Dr. Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis (in her first movie) is the main teenager while her friends are played by P.J. Soles and Nancy Loomis. Now these people aren't looking for Academy Awards, they just play there parts like normal people would do.<br/><br/>Now this plays out the deaths perfectly. They're not over the top or extremely gory. They're quick and bloodless. There's builds up that are very suspenseful. The suspense is what keeps this movie going not the kills. John Carpenter does this very well. There's shots of the killer that has him coming out of the darkness and we see him standing behind trees watching the people. They're very creepy moments that are well done.<br/><br/>John Carpenter does a great job of directing, but he also did the score. And that is probably the most memorable element of the movie. It plays during the opening credits while a Jack-O'-Lantern looms closer and closer to the camera. And right there you know that it's going to be good. Throughout the climax the music builds and builds and it' just scary.<br/><br/>Halloween is a horror movie. It's not a slasher movie but a thriller that keeps you interested the whole time and has you at the edge of your seat. It's just a great movie period.<br/><br/>4 stars (out of 4)"

","Halloween is possibly the greatest horror film ever made. There is not much gore, but the atmosphere is unbelievable. Carpenter has created a chilling musical score, that even today sends shivers up my spine. This is complemented by fantastic lighting and camera angles and lovely shots from the killers point of view, especially at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is also very credible, especially from Donald Pleasence as the dogmatic Dr Loomis. Jamie Lee Curtis also puts in a strong performance making the whole situation very believable.<br/><br/>The protagonist is Micheal Myers who has escaped from a sanitarium on Halloween night and heads back to his home town to wreak havoc, where 15 years earlier he murdered his sister.<br/><br/>The mask Micheal wears is super creepy and the fact that he doesn't speak lends an eerie unknown to his character.<br/><br/>This movie comes highly recommended to horror fans and indeed cinema enthusiasts in general.

","This film is... magnificent! It's the most successful independent film of all time and one of the most popular horror icons. It's been referenced, spoofed, parodied and payed tribute to in many, many movies and the internet. It's spawned six sequels, a reboot, a remake and a sequel to that remake. But enough on that.<br/><br/>On to the movie. It starts out in the Myers house. 6 year old Michael Myers murders her older sister Judith, for some reason, and even though this is poorly done you can still feel a little chilled.<br/><br/>The film's protagonist is Laurie Strode, played by Jamie Lee Curtis. (Yeah, you didn't know that.) Some people say she doesn't get enough development, but I think it's done perfectly. Laurie Strode, this spunky, smart teenager who also smokes weed. But then, she begins to get stalked by Michael Myers. From driving along the side of the road, to simply looking straight at her from ten meters away and then hiding behind a hedge.<br/><br/>But then night comes... and then Michael stops playing around.<br/><br/>Now, there are only four deaths in this, but Halloween says that horror films don't have to have many deaths to be scary, and there isn't much blood at all. Really, there is just suspense.<br/><br/>The music is brilliant, and basic too, but still pretty creepy. Especially in the chase scenes, when most of the time John Carpenter is just hitting the same note on the piano over and over in a pattern. It's beautifully directed too. It leaves us scared of the dark, always turning around to check what's behind you, always checking all the closets fully before using them, checking the back seats of cars, leaving us scared to go around corners, always locking our doors, always hiding...<br/><br/>And that is horror. That is Halloween.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10 Grade: A"

This low-budget classic is no stepping-stone-to-bigger-things, this is a horror film made by someone with a great deal of love for the genre.<br/><br/>The film works through sheer atmosphere, from the opening chilling sequence, to the slow-building tension, seemingly mundane scenes with the girls chatting turning into Hitchcockian suspense scenes with none of them noticing the silent harbinger of doom always hovering in the background, to a great climax, a great tour de force of 70s terror cinema. All of this is of course aided by a fantastic score from John Carpenter, which has easily become as iconic as both the movie, and its masked villain Michael Myers."

"Red-Barracuda","8","0","2","29 October 2010"," A technically proficient movie that started the slasher craze
","This is probably a film that requires no introduction. It not only spawned many sequels but it initiated a genre: the slasher. It certainly wasn't the first film of its kind – Bob Clark's Black Christmas has four years on it and the Italian gialli were in their prime even earlier, while Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho was truly the first film to introduce this idea. However, what Halloween did to formulate the genre was simply to make a huge amount of money on a tiny budget – for many years it was the most successful independent film of all time. This above all other considerations, led to the slasher craze in the 80's. Halloween is not, in my opinion, as good a movie as either Psycho, or Black Christmas; neither is it as good as many earlier gialli either. Having said all that, it's still a good film with many fine aspects.<br/><br/>Director John Carpenter does do a pretty good job with the cinematic aesthetics. The widescreen compositions are intelligently considered with many otherwise standard shots capturing the film's bogeyman, Michael Myers, in the background looking ominously on. These details definitely add much to the overall film, as does Carpenter's famous soundtrack which is an excellent minimalist score with pretty unforgettable main themes. Acting is average with the exception of Jamie Lee Curtis who is good – it's easy to see how she went on to forge a career in Hollywood, as she definitely is a cut above everybody else, Donald Pleasence included.<br/><br/>I've probably seen the movie too many times over the years for it to really affect me anymore. When I first saw it I was terrified but unfortunately no more, although it does build up a fair amount of tension in the final scenes. For the most part it is an exercise in creeping menace, with Myers hovering about the suburban neighbourhood like a supernatural being. In truth, he almost is supernatural, seeing as he does appear to be virtually indestructible, which I guess served him well as the star of a multitude of sequels. Despite what many people might think, Halloween is a pretty bloodless affair. There are a few murders of course but they are nowhere near as graphic as slashers typically are. What it does have that most of those films don't though is an attention to detail and a definite atmosphere – the soundtrack certainly helps here.<br/><br/>This is very much a template horror movie, one of the most influential of all time. I'm not necessarily sure I would include it in the top bracket but I do have considerable respect for the things it does right."
"jake-law123","7","0","2","27 October 2010"," Thrilling masterpiece!
","John Carpenter's classic horror thriller with one of the most iconic horror film villains of all, Michael Myers. An absolute masterpiece to say the least, with plenty of scares and shocks for everyone, without having to be too gory as well.<br/><br/>Starts out with a terrific music theme by John Carpenter himself, and begins on a perfect note. 8-year-old Michael Myers murders his older sister on Halloween night in Haddonfield, Illinois, and is sent to an institution. 15 years later, his doctor comes to take him to court to be executed. However, he escapes in a car and returns home, where he stalks a teenage babysitter named Laurie Strode, (Jamie Lee Curtis's first role). The doctor returns and teams up with the police sheriff to hunt him down.<br/><br/>It really starts getting good when he starts stalking Laurie and her friends. Not being too gory or graphic, this film will still without a doubt scare the hell out of you, that is if your a beginning horror film watcher. It mostly depends on shocks and edgy stalking scenes.<br/><br/>John Carpenter also devotes his love for horror films by having scenes of people watching such films as The Thing from Another World. The characters do get kind of stupid, pretending like nothing would happen and get themselves in easy to kill situations, like Laurie locking herself in a closet, hoping he's dumb enough not to check there. But with the seventies new slasher genre, you can't expect much. Its also eerie how Michael is referred to as the boogey man, which he kind of seems like.<br/><br/>Its only a matter of time before a few more directors get together to make a crap load of sequels, and mock the crap out of the freaking movie. Whether unneeded or not, it could've been find with just this one. But no, they just had to make more. f**k that s**t!<br/><br/>I recommend watching it. But don't waste your time watching the others like I made the mistake of doing. This is truly the only good one, so the others are just for nothing."
"ModKuraika","9","0","3","26 October 2010"," A true testament to the genre.
","Halloween is quite simply, a masterpiece in the realm of horror, right up there with Psycho. As Siskel and Ebert said years ago, Halloween doesn't hate women, and it loves filmmaking.<br/><br/>Halloween starts off with a young boy named Michael Myers who murders his older sister and is sent to a mental institution. When he is an adult, he escapes, much to the extreme dismay of Dr. Samuel Loomis, his doctor, who believes Michael to be pure evil. Michael returns to Haddonfield, Illinois, his former residence, and stalks Laurie Strode on Halloween.<br/><br/>First off, the greatest trait this film has to offer is total suspense and angst. Instead of turning it into a bloodbath (most horror films nowadays), we see Michael follow Laurie and frighten her more prominently over time, it puts us in the protagonist's shoes. We think something will happen, but it doesn't. One of my favorite scenes in the film is when a kid is running and is immediately halted by Michael, scaring the kid off, the music cues at precisely the right moment. As the movie progresses, Laurie's friends are slaughtered silently and discretely, more creative and chilling than just ""stab, stab, cut, blood, blood"". When the final confrontation ensues, every time you think Myers is down, he's up and at you again. The ending will have you on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>The film is well-made at a low budget, the music is frightful, the acting is top-notch. Halloween is horror movie magic. You will believe in the Boogeyman. And I don't mean the terrible 1980 film, either."
"reecegraham","10","0","3","26 October 2010"," The Slasher Masterpiece
","First off, I will say that I have loved the Halloween series since I was a young child. (Yes, my parents let me watch them) In my opinion, they are simply the most entertaining movies from the, ""Slasher"" category of horror films. Micheal Myers is a scary, but yet very comical character. Not only is he good at killing babysitters, he is entertaining because the viewer knows that no matter what his victims do, they will most likely end up dead. In this way, I find my self rooting for Micheal when I'm watching them. If you haven't seen the original 8 films of this series, I definitely recommend that you do. Even if they aren't really scary in comparison to today's horror films, they are classic. Warning! If you watch the newest versions of the first 2 movies, you will be confused when you go back to watch the original movies. So just be aware of what order you watch them in. For example, the first Halloween movie I ever saw was Halloween H20, the seventh in the original series. (Sixth in the Micheal-Laurie saga) Enjoy!"

","""Halloween"" scared the crap out of me the first time I saw it and having just viewed it again, for the first time in many years, I can honestly tell you that it retains its power.<br/><br/>Unlike the other films in this never-ending franchise, the original takes the time to flesh out its victims. It's not a film about a mindless killing machine, but about an escaped psychopath and the characters he's stalking.<br/><br/>That's one of the great things about ""Halloween."" It doesn't feel the need to make the killer a supernatural figure.<br/><br/>It helps to have such greats as Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance as leads. Donald Pleasance can utter the most ridiculous dialog and make it sound plausible. He's what really convinced me that there was evil operating in the film.<br/><br/>It's a pity that such a wonderful movie had to be stretched into such an endless series, because none of them, including Rob Zombie's gorier remakes, have anywhere near the power of this entry."

","Michael Myers has become an icon for horror films. John Carpenter's Halloween is still remembered as a great horror film classic and has had great success among slasher film fans.<br/><br/>There were many good things about this film. The thing I like about it the most is that it had a very eerie feel to it. The music certainly did it's role in giving this movie an eerie feel. Some people I know complained that it was a very slow movie and I think it suited this movie very well. When Laurie is walking around her neighborhood and it has creepy music playing at a slow tempo it makes a very creepy movie.<br/><br/>Dr. Loomis when describing Michael Myers gives great detail. Donald Pleasence does this role very well and portrays the ""pure evil"" theme in a very dark way.<br/><br/>I like how it is dark in a lot of the scenes. It gave off a great atmosphere and essence. During Bob's Death Scene, Michael Myers pops right out of nowhere grabs him by the neck and stabs him, it is very dark in this scene which gave this creative kill an element of darkness and pure evil.<br/><br/>Many of the kills in this film were creative particularly Lynda's death scene when Michael strangles her with a telephone chord.<br/><br/>I think the mask serves a great element of fear to the movie. Dr. Loomis in the film says ""I met this six-year-old child, with this blank, pale, emotionless face."" The mask certainly resembles what Dr. Loomis says, it's a white mask that looks completely emotionless. <br/><br/>I liked how Michael Myers is seen and then within seconds he is gone. Laurie Strode notices Michael outside a window when she is in class he's gone as soon as she looks back. This gives a very suspenseful essence to the film because you don't know where he went a lot of the time and he can pop out of nowhere.<br/><br/>This movie is a great slasher film. Not only did was this movie successful but many of the sequels were very successful as well. The Halloween franchise overall is simply great. If you haven't seen to many slasher films this would be a great movie to start with. This movie is a classic and always will be."

He is then committed to a Menatl Asylum and then 15 years later, he escapes his prison and plots on how he will kill his younger sister Laurie Strode who has been adopted by a new family for the past years.

Even if it came out back in 1978, it still has a huge impact as the film can still do it's job really well in the pointers of fear and creepiness.<br/><br/>I also love this film because it cuts off of blood. Now I'm not saying blood isn't good, but John Carpentar had that really good effect on Halloween not to show that much blood.<br/><br/>All in all, Halloween is a must-see Horror flick that should be watched over and over again. 10/10"

","Halloween is one of those movies that many people adore, and many dislike. It seems to have a solid fanbase, and interest in the film continues. I have heard many things about the film before I saw it. One person told me it isn't as good as it's hyped. Another told me it is the essence of brilliance. I went in open minded, and a as a lover of movies. The movie presents a wonderfully atmospheric universe. Nothing particularly special creates this sense. From the opening scene to when the main characters are walking home from school, all the images just feel like Halloween. The film also displays a wonderful feel of being observed. Throughout the movie, the stalker is seen several times creeping amidst the background. Sometimes it's kinda hard to notice. It jumps right into the story as if the camera was just turned on at this point in time in the created universe. The audience knows the main villain of the film is an escaped psychiatric patient. A patient with a sinister and mysterious past. The character of the Doctor is almost the narrator of the story, letting the audience know certain minute details about the escapee's past. From what little is garnered, he for some reason is hellbent on returning to his hometown, where he brutally committed murder man years prior. The Doctor knows him better than anyone, and quickly heads there. Then of course, there is Jamie Lee Curtis' character Laurie. The babysitter living in the same neighborhood that the crazed lunatic is from. A smart, strong young women who we hardly get to know. However, in the little time spent on developing her character, we learn just enough to know she is the survivor. Her friends are portrayed as well intended, but almost flaky in personality. Her close circle of friends are all different types of people which adds a sense of realism, as cliques are over used especially in 'teen' oriented plots. Laurie is the 'responsible' one of the group, and spends the evening of Halloween babysitting. All the while, being stalked by the illusive escapee. A running theme throughout the film is the essence of Halloween. Laurie explains to the young boy she is babysitting that there is nothing to fear about Halloween. It is a time when 'people play tricks on each other.' That the boogieman is not real, and that she will protect the child from him should he arrive.<br/><br/>The audience is watching the events unfold all the while wondering the motives of the stalker. It is never revealed(unless you like the sequels). The stalker is an unstoppable force, not through magic or mysticism, but through the inherent nature of deluded evil. You can kill one stalker, or stop them, but they will return, and if not, one like them will. To me that was the greatest part of the film next to the atmosphere. Ultimately, as a viewer, one won't be disappointed if they watch looking for the right things. Halloween is a movie that needs to be watched in the context of its time. It broke a lot of rules, and created many that shine through film making, especially the horror genre even today. If watched with the proper mindset, the film is a masterpiece in what it was trying to accomplish within the viewers mind. Creating an edgy Tick or Treat universe."

They are normal girls, Laurie is smart girl who on Halloween is going to babysit a local child. Michael Myers starts to hunt them down. Only Michael's psychiatrist Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence) can stop him.<br/><br/>With a budget of $320,000, Halloween was a massive financial success, making $60 Million in the US alone. It also had a good critical response, having 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. It was so successful that became a massive series and recently been remade by Rob Zombie. This was a film that also gave Jamie Lee Curtis her first film role. This film tells a basic story of a killer hunting the streets of a small town. A more realistic setting to say the Friday 13th series where the kids go to an abandon camp with electricity or phones, take drugs, have sex and end up getting killed by a killer with a knife. One of the best aspects of Halloween is that it doesn't try to explain why Michael Myers is a killer, he just does it because he is evil. That is a more interesting and scary then when a film tries to justify why the killer is the way he is. The other decent aspect is the film doesn't such too much violence, unlike modern films where they show everything. It's more effective when there is little violence. John Carpenter also does have some good shots and scenes during the film, particularly in the beginning when 6-year-old Michael kills his sister.<br/><br/>But there are sadly some problems. Except for the acting of Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence, most is weak. There is also weak characterisation, making out that of the girls is a sex-crazed cheerleader. There isn't much dept to the film. As well there is a leery nature to the film, with Michael spying on teenage girls being his targets. I also have to question did women just not wear bras in the 70s? Also if there was some real-world logic behind the film, surely wouldn't there be a bulletin to warn people that a there was a killer on the loose?<br/><br/>But it is possibly the best of it's genre."

"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","0","5","29 January 2010"," The concept is simple, and it is executed with impeccable skill
","In spite of this essentially starting the entire horror sub-genre of the slasher flick, one can't completely place this film in that category. It does not obey all of the infamous ""rules"", and this was done intentionally. This is, to quote the pun, a cut above the rest. The idea is not complex and takes no explaining to understand. This uses the voyeurism that lies within us all, much like Rear Window, albeit in a considerably creepier manner. Myers watches. Waits. Carpenter masterfully builds atmosphere, suspense and tension in this way; one cannot expect anything that comes out of the blue to intimidate audiences. At most, that provides a shock. This does contain jump-scares, but on the whole, the fear is generated by the fact that we *know* he's there. It comes from the inevitability of it, from how little we see him(he is not overexposed, so we never get used to him, and only gradually do we get to see more of him), and from how beautifully undefined his appearance is. We are afraid of what we don't know or understand, and the realization of that is put to magnificent and powerful use here. The plot is straightforward, and easy to follow. This has perfect pacing, there isn't a single dull, rushing or superfluous moment to the tight 90 minute running time. The acting is nearly flawless; seriously, even the kids are quite convincing, and not particularly annoying. All of the characters are credible, and you can relate to them. The dialog is well-written, and every word spoken by a teenager or child actually sounds like something someone of that age would say. This has excellent cinematography and editing. The music is really effective and well-composed(if minimalistic in its arrangement). This scores extra points for me personally because it's a successful indie, and I find that those are often far superior to studio pictures; however, frankly, if you didn't know that this was made on a shoestring budget, you wouldn't be able to tell. The camera-work and the rest of the production is professional. This has pretty good comedy, in that the material usually works, it doesn't detract from the otherwise unnerving tone, and the jokes, like nearly everything in this(save for maybe hair, some sayings and clothes), are not dated. I would not really suggest checking out any of the sequels(and while I have not seen the remake myself, I feel fairly confident that it goes for that, as well; I have no problem with Rob Zombie, I like songs of his, and though his brand of terror may be good(haven't caught any movie of his, not outright trying to avoid them), it certainly isn't right for this franchise); not unless you *need* a fix of Michael. None of them add(much less anything positive or interesting), and this in no way requires a follow-up. Thank god they could not force John to have anything to do with many of them, and that he could get out of directing any other entries in the series than this. There is a bit of moderate(not all that graphic) violence, a little blood and brief, arguably gratuitous, nudity and sexuality. The DVD contains informative trivia and the original trailer. I recommend this to all fans of frightening cinema. 10/10"

","Before Freddy, before Jason, before Hollywood ran out of ideas and made poorly conceived remakes of horror classics, there was Michael. This movie, produced on a shoestring by master filmmaker John Carpenter, really was the beginning of the true ""slasher"" film genre, and was the birth of the horror ""series"" films (you can decide for yourself whether that part was good or bad). Take the suspense of a Hitchcock film, and merge it with the most evil character imaginable, and you've got this film. Great music (simplicity was the key), awesome camera shots and angles, and tons of great scares make this a classic that never gets old. I still watch this movie every time I see it on television, because its just that good. This is how horror films should be made. Unfortunately the sequels to this were nowhere near as good, but this film is the best of the best when it comes to horror films........."
"skiop","10","0","3","16 January 2010"," The best slasher movie
","It's undeniable that this is the best slasher movie ever made, but that's not saying much. The story is fairly familiar: 6-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister and is put away in a mental hospital; 15 years later, the adult Michael (Nick Castle) escapes, stalks a couple babysitters, Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) and Annie (Nancy Loomis), while being pursued by his psychiatrist, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance).<br/><br/>What makes this movie a rarity among slasher movies is that no one knows anything is going on. They're just doing everyday things; the girls talk about boys and sex, do drugs, etc. There are no big chase scenes until the climax.<br/><br/>The film is very quiet. There is virtually no blood. Director John Carpenter (who also co-wrote the screenplay and wrote the iconic musical score) has some very clever devices to hide any graphic violence from us. As realistic as the dialog might be, some of the best moments are without dialog. One of my favorites is when Annie gets into her car and notices that the windows are fogged up, providing us with a good nervous chuckle.<br/><br/>Michael himself is an interesting character. He doesn't seem to have any motivation or even a plan. He stalks the girls, who don't realize they're being stalked. By the time the character turns around, Michael's already gone. Michael sometimes makes a noise, but it's always shrugged off by the characters (as it would be in real life).<br/><br/>On my first viewing, I didn't like the last 10 or so minutes of this movie. It seemed silly and far-fetched. On repeat viewings, I've really warmed up to it.<br/><br/>It was followed by 7 sequels, none of which lived up to the original. Donald Pleasance returned in 4 of the sequels, prior to his death. Jamie Lee Curtis, who doesn't understand this film's popularity and why she's known for this instead of her later and according to her better movies (like A Fish Called Wanda and True Lies), returned for a sequel and then gave thanks to what she considers an inexplicable classic for starting her career by returning for two more sequels 17 years later. Nancy Loomis would return for the often maligned, but not terrible, Halloween III: Season of the Witch as a different character, 4 years later. Rob Zombie remade it in 2007; I refuse to watch the remake."

","I've got nothing to prove here; I'm a total puss when it comes to horror movies. I just don't have the stomach for them. ""Halloween"" is the rare exception, and it fits naturally with this time of year. This is scary not because it's a guy in a mask with a chef's knife but because he's a stalker; and Carpenter plays that like a master violinist. The climactic scene with Jamie Lee Curtis in the closet is nerve-wracking enough, but the early scenes with Michael Myers following her through the suburban streets just bury the creepy needle. It's the way things are dragged out in this movie - the tracking shots, the breathing sounds under the mask, that damn score - all played to just that right length.<br/><br/>This is economical filmmaking, brutally effective and notorious for good reason.<br/><br/>8/10"

Jamie Lee Curtis does an impressive job for her first role, however, and the two carry the movie to the standard that it is held."
"Tweekums","8","0","5","1 November 2009"," A scary classic
","I must say that this isn't the type film of film I watch very often but when it was on television on Halloween I just had to watch it; after all it is a classic of the genre. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the film but I was frightened by it and if a horror film scares the viewer it is doing its job. I was impressed that it managed to be scary without showing vast amounts of gore, in fact I don't recall seeing much blood at all.<br/><br/>The film starts off showing us events many years before when a young boy murders his older sister on the night of Halloween. We then move the the present where the boy, Michael Myers, is still incarcerated in a facility for the criminally insane. He is due to have a parole hearing but his doctor, played by Donald Pleasence, is determined that he must never be released. Just as the doctor arrives at the facility Myers escapes and heads back to his former home town. He goes to his old house were he sees Laurie Strode, played by a young Jamie Lee Curtis, as she drops of the key for her estate agent father. He then starts following her around and she occasionally glimpses him but as soon as she looks away he has vanished. On Halloween night when she is babysitting he comes after her and her friends.<br/><br/>There is not a huge death toll, in fact after the prologue we have to wait a long time till any one else is killed. This isn't boring though as there is a constant feeling that something bad could happen at any moment, it is this that makes the film so frightening. The creepiness is increased by not showing the face of the adult Myers for most of the film; we either see him from the neck down or wearing a creepy Halloween mask.<br/><br/>The scariness is heightened by the use of creepy music and camera work that gives is Myers's view in several scenes, this shaky-cam work was done years before it became de rigour in just about every film. While the minor parts are fairly forgettable Jamie Lee Curtis does a decent job and screams well and Donald Pleasence is great as the doctor."

"mrbrock01","10","0","2","17 October 2009"," Best straight up horror film ever produced. Simple yet terrifying.
","This film, so simple in its approach and execution, still more than 30 years later stands tall among not only great horror films but in my mind as one of the greatest movies of all time. John Carpenter took what i believe was little more than a $100,000 budget and a 1 or 2month shoot schedule and produced a movie that still strikes a nerve with adults and children alike.<br/><br/>A picturesque neighborhood which could be in almost any city in America. A normal group of kids, a shy and book smart pretty girl baby-sitter, and moving amongst all of this in complete silence is the Shape(Michael Myers). A truly unique villain in that his evil runs so deep and is so profound that all human emotion is gone. Nothing is left but pure evil, killing only for the sake of killing. And of course Dr. Loomis trying in vain to convince the authorities of this in vain.<br/><br/>However when Carpenter originally presented the film to the studio heads they were less than impressed. In one night he composed the now famous theme music and score to the entire film on his keyboard and the rest is history. The music really does drive home the tension and fear and takes on a life of its own. <br/><br/>I could say so much more about Halloween, but i see no need, it speaks volumes for itself. A true masterpiece of horror and filmaking in general."
"christopher-underwood","8","0","2","11 October 2009"," He sees, he gets, he kills
","A very good movie. Economical on style, very few special affects, leaving aside the pioneering steady cam work and an inspiration for film makers for years. It may seem sluggish at first to those used to the breakneck speed of today's horror comedies. Little humour here though and little back story or any suggestion our killer has been forced to kill by some past traumatic event. He's just made that way - evil! So we don't get long build ups or chases through woods. He sees, he gets, he kills. Simple, and so in many ways it is but on what must have been a pretty slender budget, Carpenter gets us looking twice at the hedgerow and fearful of wardrobes. Also whilst we might not mourn the loss of the first few irritating kids (and can maybe just vicariously enjoy those kills) with Janet Leigh's daughter, we care and the final section becomes quite breathtaking."

","before I saw this film I had seen almost all of john Carpenter's films and heard a lot of great reviews about his film. And I must admit it was a good Halloween type film, but not as magnificent as everyone made it sound like. Sure it is a scary film with an incredible eerie atmosphere, but I felt very little happened at the same time. Many say it's Carpenters best, I disagree, yet it's far from his worst in my opinion. Also I remembered that it was among his first, so I took that in consideration too.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a young boy called Michael Meyers who murders his babysitter with a kitchen knife at Halloween. About 15 years later he escapes from the mental asylum and the doctor (Donald Pleasance) who had been in charge for him ever since the murder sets out to find him and kill him. He considers the boy pure evil, and won't let him live to commit any more murders. And of course the night Meyers return to his home town, it's no other night than Halloween. he takes an interest in three babysitters (Jamie lee Curtis as one of them) and sets out to kill them one by on at Halloween night. now I'll stop here and let you figure out the rest.<br/><br/>I liked Michael Meyers costume, a William Shatner Halloween mask painted white looked surprisingly soulless and evil. And Jamie Lee Curtis was truly amazing considering that this was her debut film. What I didn't like about the film was the cheesiness of it, I mean how hard can it be too stab a frightened college student. one time he jumps up behind her with his knife held up, and he misses her with like a whole meter while she sits perfectly still in the couch. not to mention the time when he comes up behind her , aims at her back, and only manages cut her blouse and give her a little cut in her arm. but then again, they needed to build up the suspense and let her escape all of his attacks. oh, and before I sum this up, the music score was very cool.<br/><br/>Now if your a horror fan this is a must see for all of you who likes suspense and fright (70's style of course)but if you you're a gore fan you won't find any in this movie. And if you're a john Carpenter fan this is definitely a must see film. I personally give this film a 7/10."
"coreymichaeljohnson","9","0","2","9 October 2009"," Class Review in 300 Words - Halloween
","John Carpenter's Halloween is a horror classic that set the definition for the popular ""slasher"" genre of films with it's unique mix of gruesome death scenes and Hitchcock inspired suspense. The film Halloween takes place on October 31st, 1978 in the small town of Haddonfield, Illinois which was the setting of a grisly murder exactly fifteen years earlier. The murderer Michael Myers, who had been in a psych ward since the tender age of six, has escaped from the psych ward while on the way to trial. Myers' psychiatrist Dr. Samuel Loomis fears that Michael has the urge to return to the scene of the crime, and begins an investigation to locate and track down his patient. Myers does indeed return ""home"" to Haddonfield where a young babysitter by the name of Laurie Strode captures his attention. Eerily obsessed, Myers stalks Laurie incessantly, hacking to bits anyone unlucky enough to come between him and his prey.<br/><br/>Carpenter's use of suspense heavily borrows from that of Alfred Hitchcock and purposely pays tribute to Hitchcock's Psycho in a vast amount of ways, including casting Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of Janet Leigh, as the lead role. In a strange sort of ""moral of the story"" way, Carpenter ""cursed"" promiscuous behavior, killing off nearly every character that engaged in sexual or illegal acts.<br/><br/>Halloween took the horror genre to the next level with the innovative and unique elements that the film established. The film's music is beautifully haunting and will stick with you for the rest of your life even after hearing it just once. Michael Myers' pure white mask can send chills down your spine with just one glimpse, thanks to it's emotionless, blank stare; it's so frightening that it's hard to even believe that the original prop was an just inside-out 'Captain Kirk' mask. The shaky, first-person camera that Carpenter used captures a grim, realistic touch that adds the viewer to truly feel like they are actually going through the hell that is happening in the film."

There was probably one too many scare scenes where he's staring at them from behind and when they turn around he's gone. But it is still extremely scary. The music sends chills down your spine. You will not want to walk around your own house at night. The part where Laurie sees him from her neighbor's yard always freaks me out. Michael Myers is just so freaking scary. I saw the six year old part when I was six and have been freaked out about it ever since. Everything from his heavy breathing to his mask to his calm, not-rushed way of chasing you is just plain eerie. He is a psycho, and he wants to kill this one girl and no one knows why. He is an unstoppable force. It's weird but effective the way she can never get away from him and he never dies, but it gets old after the original. This one's the limit.It doesn't go overboard with the sex or blood. I don't know why it's called a slasher, but I do know why it's called a classic. It's just so much fun to watch.

There were other films before it that had similar plots (""Black Christmas""), however ""Halloween"" was far more successful.<br/><br/>One of the good things about ""Halloween"" that was different from other slasher films was its pace. Some may complain the film is slow - the body count is low and the action doesn't start until halfway through the film. That's what I liked about it: the film took time to develop atmosphere, introduce characters, and creep us out with subtle scenes of Michael stalking his prey.<br/><br/>However, now that I have seen it a few times, there are some large plot holes and inconsistencies that I never noticed before. For example: - in the beginning, the POV camera is at the height of an adult, not a 5 year old child. - Michael's sister's boyfriend must have severe premature ejaculation issues. Their off-screen love scene was what - 30 seconds? - who taught Michael how to drive so well as an adult, when he just stared blankly at a wall in the mental institution? - when Laurie and Annie are driving to the babysitters, Haddonfield suddenly goes from broad daylight to pitch black. How big is Haddonfield, and why would they babysit so far from home?"

The movie was an instant independent success, with a low budget of $320,000 it then went on to make a staggering $47 million dollars at the box-office that year. It lives on as one of the most profitable independent movie successes in motion picture history. Halloween is suspenseful, scary and disturbing, Halloween night will never be the same.

Arguably one of the finest horror's of the 70s and perhaps of all time."

","From the moment the music starts playing in the opening credits, I was instantly hooked. Then, right after that, comes the superb opening scene, again with excellent music. Michael's escape from the sanitarium is also memorable. From then, the movie slows down a bit, as Myers returns to Haddonfield and begins stalking a student named Laurie. But the suspense is always present, thanks to a subtle atmosphere. You know something will happen. You just have to wait. And it does happen, in the last half hour of the movie, when all hell breaks loose...<br/><br/>This is John Carpenter's second best movie to date (only The Thing is superior). His direction is almost flawless. Each scene seems carefully planned, building up a tremendous atmosphere, rarely seen in slasher/horror movies. He decided well in not showing too much of The Shape, and also in the minimal amount of blood used. Unfortunately, the sequels completely abandoned this principles. They put gore over suspense. As I've mentioned, the atmosphere is great, and for that, the music, by the same Carpenter, is also truly essential, along with the cinematography by Dean Cundey, which is just stunning and beautiful. Two amazing technical achievements considering the very low budget this movie was made on.<br/><br/>As for the actors, while they are not required to do anything out of this world, they still play their parts very well. Obviously, Jamie Lee Curtis (with her screams), and Donald Pleasance (with his classic lines and charismatic presence) shine the most.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a very simple movie, as was the case with earlier Carpenter. However, it completely deserves to be called a masterpiece, which it is."

","There's not much to be said about this horror classic that hasn't already been said but what the heck I'll repeat what the millions of other people have said anyway ... it's not like anyone will notice :p I first saw the original Halloween when I was around 7 or 8 I honestly can't quite remember and I was so terrified that I never watched it again until I was about 14. This 1978 classic is a genuinely horrifying and beautifully crafted piece of material from one of the great and unique visionary directors John Carpenter whom I remain a dedicated fan of to this day.<br/><br/>It is common knowledge that Halloween is one of the many exploitative slasher films that invented many of the 'slasher film rules and clichés' but besides perhaps Black Christmas or Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween stands in my mind as the film that really perfected and took the whole slasher genre to a new level.<br/><br/>The film today I feel remains up there with the horror classic Psycho and Halloween respectfully pays a few homages to Psycho. What really keeps me terrified by Halloween is John Carpenter's malevolent and haunting score that sends chills down my spine each and every time I hear it, and it's the music in this film that makes the suspenseful stalkings and killings all the more effective.<br/><br/>The majority of scenes in the movie are filmed with a constantly moving Steadicam which does a terrific job of making the audience feel insecure, vulnerable and unsettled.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this horror classic and whether you are a horror fan or just a casual viewer, I recommend you give this title a try but don't watch it alone or the Boogeyman may just get you as well :P"
"gottschalkchris24","10","0","1","15 January 2009"," Truly The Definitive 70s Horror Film
","""Halloween"" has become notorious with every horror fan today, whether they know it or not. The film was made in 1978, at the end of a genre defining decade where Chainsaw-Wielding Maniacs, Switchblade-Slicing Giallos, and Alien eggs took over the big screen, Halloween defines it all.<br/><br/>Halloween wasn't the first slasher film, although it often takes the credit for being the creator of the slasher genre. What really inspired Halloween was the other low-budget cinema being shot in the 70s, such as the low-budget exploitation flicks and Itallian Giallos; as well as classic horror films from the 50s and 60s. Director: John Carpenter really dug the old 50s B-Movies as well as the works of Alfred Hitchcock and Dario Aregento. Halloween blends the attributes of a great thriller with a very strange hint of supernatural undertones.<br/><br/>Everybody reading this knows the story of Halloween: A boy named Michael Myers kills his sister. He then gets admitted into a mental institution where he would soon escape from 15 years later. Michael goes back to his hometown of Haddonfeild, Illinois where he would go on to continue his body count he started 15 years before hand. Not far in his path, his doctor (played by Donald Pleasense) is determined to stop Michael, no matter the cost.<br/><br/>Most of the movie focuses around a group of teenagers: Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in her first film), Linda (PJ Soles), and Annie (Nancy Keys).<br/><br/>The teenagers are developed in an amazing way. They are realistic characters that the audience could relate to everyday people just as themselves, yet they are interesting enough to keep the viewer interested. All three actresses did a fantastic job and have great character chemistry. Donald Pleasense, who played Michael's doctor did an absolutely fantastic job. Michael (also known as ""The Shape) himself was mainly played by Nick Castle, although there is one scene where he was played by Tony Moran for the unmasking scene.<br/><br/>The movie uses suspense rather than gore and loud noises to scare the audience. While I enjoy a good gory horror movie, it's still great to see a movie that builds up the audience for an amazing finale. The movie is tense and creepy all the way through, never slowing up the pace.<br/><br/>One of the most memorable things about the movie is the music, which commonly gives the movie reconition.<br/><br/>Halloween truly stands as one of the best horror movies ever made.<br/><br/>Highly Recommended 10/10"

","This is truly the ""lift off"" or ""start"" of all the cliché horror movies and slasher flicks we have today. ""Friday the 13th"" was a pretty bad rip-off but lets pass all that. This movie is so riveting and amazing, throwing suspense, terror, and bloody good fun at the viewer. Anyone watching will ask for more and surely see the rest of the series. (If you do avoid 5,6, and 8) It stars the beautiful ""Jamie Lee Curtis"" and her co-star ""Donald Pleasance"". With the new master of horror, John Carptenter directing, this movie is amazing. The music makes up most of the suspense and adds a lot of the build up to the climax. Very good acting and camera work, not so bloody: more suspenseful and terrorizing. I highly recommend it for anyone a fan of horror or not!"
"lenlarga","10","0","1","22 December 2008"," Much Better Film the Genre it Inspired
","John Carpenter's Halloween's reputation, unfortunately, will always be somewhat inspired by the less than stellar imitations it inspired, including most of its own sequels.<br/><br/>This is the perfect horror film, with the tension building with every moment of every scene, taking only a brief respite about halfway through for the only moment of comic relief. The plot is simple: escaped madman from the lunatic asylum stalks teenage babysitters, with eerie white masked donned. Only the madmen's psychiatrist truly understands how dangerous and evil He is, and it's a race against time to find him before this force of evil slaughters young innocents.<br/><br/>The main point of the film is simply to scare the audience. In that sense, I believe this may be the most effective movie of all time. Yet, it is not a movie about parading one cardboard character after another across the screen and slaughtering them. First, there is the stalking, which occurs while we get to know the characters. Then, at a time of his choosing, the madman strikes When he does, the audience jumps out of its seat. Actually, there are also several false alarms that also cause the audience to jump in anxiety.<br/><br/>Ratcheting up the level of fear is our lack of knowledge about the killer. We never really know him at all, simply that he committed a heinous act while only a boy. We never hear him speak a word, and only glimpse his face briefly at the very end of the film. In many ways, he is like a ghost gliding among the shadows. Later sequels would try to explain his motives, which made him less scary, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Besides a wonderful script and great directing, Halloween is blessed with a great soundtrack, including musical cues called 'stingers' that increase the level of fear in the audience. And of course, there is the acting performance of Jamie Lee Curtis, in her very first film, that truly makes this a classic.<br/><br/>The unfortunate thing about Halloween is that made many in Hollywood realize they could make an easy buck by following the slasher formula. Just make a film about a madman butchering a bunch of promiscuous teenagers. Some truly awful films were created, somewhat tarnishing the legacy of Halloween. However, the reputation of the director John Carpenter remains intact: he would make other horror films, but never another slasher."
"ice-tkolsby","8","0","1","9 December 2008"," As good as a slasher can get.
","Halloween, is one slasher I never grow tired of. A slasher film is thought of as a film with endless blood and gore and violence and all kinds of slashing. Halloween is however set apart from the group. Yes there is violence and death but it is shown in a much more subtle sense. The acting is shaky in parts and there are death scenes where it was obviously staged but it is all forgotten when your hear John Carpenters ominous music score. The famous theme that has haunted audiences for decades. There are many reasons why Halloween can be considered a ""classic"", but the main reason is the casting of Donald Pleasance as the half crazed doctor Sam Loomis. Pleasance without a doubt gave a stellar performance as Loomis. He is the perfect man for the part. He is able to seem completely passionate about his work and just did a brilliant job along with his incredibly real co-star Jamie-Lee Curtis. Curtis in this filmed completely escaped into the role of the young Laurie Strode and while watching her on screen, you forget completely you are watching a movie. She is so real, and so normal and has absolutely no real star quality, almost everyone can identify with her. Michael Myers is maybe the scariest slasher in film history, but why? There is nothing there. He isn't a deformed horrifying zombie, with demented features and rotting flesh but that's why it is so scary because there is absolutely nothing there. The Michael Myers mask is so terrifying because it is blank and emotionless, but it still looks like a human face. He is a human without the basic necessities of a human. No sense of right and wrong. He will kill and feel no remorse and it all comes through in the mask that has one emotion and that emotion, is no emotion at all."
"MaxBorg89","10","0","1","9 December 2008"," Purely and simply... excellent
","When John Carpenter first came up with the idea for Halloween, he probably didn't have a clue he was creating one of cinema's most indelible genre memories - he just thought it would be fun to make a movie about a serial killer striking on October 31. Then again, he had already made a name for himself with Assault on Precinct 13, and thanks to brilliant editing and camera work, great performances and that unforgettable score (which he wrote himself), even its tainted legacy of seven sequels can't tarnish Halloween's iconic status. In fact, it could easily be the best horror movie ever made.<br/><br/>The key to the film's genius is simplicity. This is obvious as early as in the opening shot, a nerve-cracking long take which references Psycho in depicting a gruesome murder without actually showing any blood - and it's all seen from the killer's point of view. The deranged individual in question, one Michael Myers, is subsequently locked up in an asylum, from which he escapes 15 years later (the film is set in its real year of release, 1978) to continue killing. The only one who can claim to even begin to understand him is a psychiatrist named Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), who follows Michael all the way back to his hometown, Haddonfield, where a bunch of teenage babysitters, including a certain Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, in her feature debut), might as well be celebrating the last Halloween of their lives.<br/><br/>A lot of things have been said about this movie: how the killer's mask was actually obtained from a Captain Kirk mask, how Michael's actions might be linked to sex (something Victor Miller admits to having expanded on when he wrote Friday 13th), how Carpenter used character names to reference some of his inspirations, like Rio Bravo (Sheriff Brackett is named after Howard Hawks' frequent writing partner Leigh Brackett) or Psycho (Loomis is the name of one of the victims in that film; in addition, Janet Leigh happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis' mother), yada yada yada. None of that really matters. The important thing is how Carpenter constructed a classic in the most basic way, filming everything on location is just three weeks, using friends and crew-members as extras (his collaborator Nick Castle plays the adult Myers) and instilling an everlasting sense of fear through a cunning use of long takes (that and the fact that Michael's face isn't seen for most of the movie).<br/><br/>Also, he obtained something most people wouldn't write home about when it comes to slasher films (a genre that was practically born with Halloween): really good acting. Curtis is impressive playing a role that is so far away from the ""Scream Queen"" cliché (which didn't exist at the time, but still...), and Pleasence is so outlandishly creepy (even though he's playing the good guy for a change) it's no surprise to learn Christopher Lee still regrets turning down the part. Of course, his remorse is most likely a reaction to the film as a whole, and that's just another piece of evidence regarding its untouchable status.<br/><br/>""One night, HE came home"", the tag-line said. That phrase could easily refer to the director as well as the character: Carpenter may not have known it when he first thought of the concept, but his decision to do something cheap (in the good sense of the word) and different from any other horror movie led to the birth of a milestone in the genre's history, arguably the finest of those made by the '70s-'80s ""New Wave"" (Carpenter, Romero, Hooper, Craven), an achievement that still hasn't met its match."

","I have recently got hold of the complete box set of Halloween, including the documentary ""Halloween: 25 Years of Terror"". I am a die-hard fan of the 80s horror movies and I must say that Halloween is The King of this genre, which holds its crown even today, when special effects and gore and blood contenders are walking its kingdom. The movie, as a whole, is a masterpiece, a low-budget masterpiece, a fact that makes it the more great! The shadows, the tension, the anticipation, the seat-grabbing scenes, the teenagers, The Shape, are all part of a skillfully created scenario which makes you glue your eyes to the screen until the very last second, when they are unglued by the last thing you hear, Michael's hard, profound breathing, a sound that, along with the BRILLIANT score will haunt us for the rest of our lives. And what is more terrifying about Halloween, about Michael Myers is that, in the movies, he may ""die"" a hundred times, but for us, the audience, he will live forever because he is each and everyone of us. He forever will be our deepest, darkest thoughts, our most brutal impulses to kill the neighbor who is always playing the music too loud, to wake up in the middle of the night and go on a killing spree, he is each and every shadow, every sound, every shape lurking in the darkness, he is every branch that moves in the night's wind, he is, most of all, the deepest corner of your psychic, where we know no boundaries and have no boundaries. And for me, that makes this movie a must-see, a number 1 on everybody's list and a 10 out of 10 horror!"

","A babysitter minding a strange house is suddenly attacked by a monster. It's possibly one of the oldest horror movie clichés there is. The type of legend you can imagine being passed along for centuries in one form or another, and the basis for what could well be the finest slasher movie ever made.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's Halloween is a stunning film, one that stands as a genuine masterpiece 30 years on. A claustrophobic setting, a fine script and wonderful direction make this a film which has lost little down the years.<br/><br/>From the very first scene it's easy to be sucked in as we see the world through the eyes of the young Micheal Myers as he brutally murders his sister while still a small child. From there he spends the next several years in a mental institute before breaking out and looking for his only living relative, his sister Laurie Strode. Dr Loomis, his psychiatrist at the mental hospital chases after Myers attempting to stop him in his quest.<br/><br/>But this is no normal rampage, Halloween allows us to get to know the characters before they are brutally put away by Myers. While in the case of PJ Soles character, an annoying bimbo, this may lead to cheers, on the whole we empathize with those who are murdered.<br/><br/>But most importantly we feel what Loomis feels, his desperation and despair so poignantly depicted by brilliant British actor Donald Pleasance. And Jamie Lee Curtis does a nice job of playing a character with a little more depth than your typical damsel in distress.<br/><br/>Micheals Myers is a terrifying character, a massive presence, fittingly nick named ""The Shape"" by fans. He is genuinely terrifying as he goes on a mindless, joyless mission of destruction. Hell bent on getting his sister. He is more human in this movie than monster and infinitely more terrifying for it.<br/><br/>So catch this movie if possible. There are sex scenes and a relatively low death count, so it's not for everyone, but it is a fine example of the slasher genre which holds up as well thirty years on."

","Critics may pooh-pooh and look down their noses and conservative types might cluck their tongues and shake their heads in disapproval, but like every other movie genre, horror films have contributed valid classics that have stood the test of time and continue to do so, as they will when most of my generation is just a fading memory.<br/><br/>Case in point: this year, HALLOWEEN is THIRTY YEARS OLD! Think about that, peeps. The movie that made John Carpenter and so many of the people connected with the film into household names...we are still talking about it, debating it, admiring it, and many, many other people will do so after us. That's not just the mark of a great horror film, but a great film, PERIOD.<br/><br/>If you fancy yourself a horror fan, then you are definitely worth your weight in severed heads if you already know the back-history of this movie. And assuming you do, I won't bore you with the trivia and go right to the deceptively simple story.<br/><br/>It all takes place on October 31st, 1978 in Haddonfield, Illinois. Three best friends: Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis), Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Loomis) will all be babysitting only a few doors away from each other. The usual tricks and treats including late night spook shows, boyfriends sneaking over, pumpkin-carving and popcorn will be expected.<br/><br/>What won't be expected is an uninvited guest to the festivities. Some years ago, on the very street where the girls live, a young boy named Michael Myers stabbed his sister Judith to death, only moments after she'd finished having sex with her boyfriend. He was taken away and placed in an asylum.<br/><br/>And now Michael has escaped...to come home and for some reason, is determined to finish what he started, killing his 'sister' over and over again. And guess who the replacements for poor Judith are? The girls' only hope for possibly surviving the night is Michael's former doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), who knows exactly what his patient is capable of and what he really is, and that stopping him at any cost is the only priority he has in life. <br/><br/>Yes, it's a slasher film and the plot defines it as such. But no other film of its kind looked, sounded or played quite like what the creative team of John Carpenter and Debra Hill managed to capture on film, thanks to a game and enthusiastic crew and a talented cast of then-unknowns, all working more for the thrill of making a movie than for the money, (which there was very little of at first .) <br/><br/>So much has already been written about this movie, that there's very little of value that I can add. Except to say that everything that we horror hounds hold dear owes a debt of thanks to HALLOWEEN. If PSYCHO was the door to the future of horror films, this was the key that unlocked it, and thanks to Carpenter and company, Friday THE 13TH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET and everything else that followed got to 'come inside.'<br/><br/>This should be the cornerstone of your DVD or VHS horror collection. It certainly is in mine."

","As this film reaches it's 30th anniversary, it doesn't cease to frighten. One of John Carpenter's crowning achievements, ""Halloween"" is a movie about how Michael Myers escapes from his mental institution to return home 15 years after killing his sister at age 6. It was amazing to see that the movie could frighten so much without relying on cheap gimmicks such as overuse of blood and gore. As for acting, the best performances come from Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Plesance, and Charles Cyphers. Donald Plesance is excellent in his first performance as the amazing Dr. Samuel Loomis, who has some of the best dialog in the movie, including the movie's most famous line. Jamie Lee Curtis makes her first on-screen performance in this movie, and it is still great and provides the number one reason as to why she has the title of ""The Scream Queen."" Overall, I loved this film except for the characters of Lynda and Bob, who were rather annoying. The soundtrack was one of the best in a horror film and it's one of the scariest aspects of the film. I absolutely loved this movie and it continues to scare the crap out of me after standing the test of time for 30 years. Halloween is definitely an amazing movie and is one of the best slasher movies ever made."
"barryrd","9","0","1","25 October 2008"," Halloween Horror in Haddonfield
","This movie must be the cinema's most memorable Halloween classic with a great story, haunting music, and chilling atmosphere from beginning to end.<br/><br/>It marks the beginning of Jamie Lee Curtis's career and it is a fine performance with Jamie Lee playing the strong and level-headed young woman who is stalked by the ""bogeyman"" - the phrase turns up on the lips of children and becomes a reality on this Halloween night. Donald Pleasance, as Dr.Loomis, the doctor for the psychopathic killer, is almost as chilling as the evil he is fighting. For him, the escaped killer is the essence of evil, who doesn't qualify as a human being. His eyes gleam with fear when he speaks in morbid and hushed tones. He is not someone you would want to meet in a dark alley but in this movie, he is the good guy, trying to prevent the inevitable slaughter that will follow in the trail of the convicted killer.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have a lot of blood and gore, as one might expect. It has murder and there is blood but the film is not particularly graphic. It doesn't depend on visual effects and sensational shots to achieve its goal, which is to frighten the audience. The suspense keeps us on edge until the killer and the target get to the final match-up. There were a few oversights that I noticed: there are never any parents at home--only kids or baby sitters; and while there are cutaways to children in costumes, we never see them trick or treating. Most of the time, the streets seem eerily quiet. <br/><br/>There are many characters in the movie but only three really count--Laurie, Dr. Lomis and the killer. We never see the killer's face, except as a seemingly-innocent child but his presence stalks the audience throughout the movie. A very good horror movie that has stood the test of time."

","If you separate John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" from it's many sequels, remake and the many copy-cat films from the 80's, you are left with one Hell of a suspenseful flick. And if anyone knew suspense back in the day, it was Carpenter. Like his other, older fare, ""Halloween"" is a slow-burning, tense little thriller that explodes at the very end, making it a movie worth repeating again and again. Thirty years later, despite the fact the film looks a bit old, it still holds up. Having seen it myself hundreds of times (really) I can say that there are still parts that remind me of why my first viewing of the film as a child was so memorable. Afterall, before Michael Myers was stalking his ""other"" sister or was driven by some mysterious cult, he was at his best stalking a group of babysitters and anyone who got in his path for no reason at all. We watch in an opening scene as Michael brutally slaughters his oldest sister and then looks completely emotionless when he is done. After fifteen years of being locked away in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, he escapes, steals his doctor's station wagon and heads to his hometown of Haddonfield to carry on his grisly killing spree. There is no motivation or reason at all as to why he stalks Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends. Keeping that in mind -- and forgetting the back-story that was created in the sequel -- the movie is much more chilling. Stalking the teenagers during the day with an altered William Shatner mask and a mechanic's jumpsuit, he slips into virtual anonymity, unrecognized even as he passes by his own doctor, Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence). Eventually darkness falls on Haddonfield and as the trick-or-treaters leave the streets and everyone settles into their homes, Michael begins the bloodshed. Despite not being an overly gory film, ""Halloween"" still has a mean streak. Not only are children put in danger, but a dog also meets his fate by Myers' hands. The death scenes were pretty grisly for their time and are built up by an un-matched amount of suspense. ""Halloween"" is the true predecessor to ""Psycho"" and part of the reason horror exists today. John Carpneter's film -- with the help of the late Debra Hill -- was and still remains an innovative landmark that is as timeless as it's concept. Granted, with today's audience and the glut of sequels that followed, it's original vision has become foggy, but viewed in the context of it's time, ""Halloween"" is, quite simply, the best of it's kind."

","Though Halloween can be said to be the grand-daddy of the modern teen-slasher, its actually its lack of gore and an emphasis on stylish, cinematic execution that makes it stand out. John Carpenter's cinematography and music make this movie just a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis stands out as young actress who really can act. Her character seems real and the sympathy for her character is only enhanced by the light-hearted comedy in her interaction with the film's two main child-actors. It's a cheap trick, but it works. Her line delivery definitely deserves credit as many old horror-films of the 70s are rather notorious for featuring young incapable actors which really just makes you want them to get killed even more.<br/><br/>Donald Pleasence, who has earned my interest for his performance in the George Lucas art-piece THX-1138, is the film's true male-lead and adds a gravitas to the film. Between him, Curtis and the masked Shape lies the dramatic core of the film which keeps you watching even when you can already begin to suspect the ending.<br/><br/>The only thing this movie lacks is a finishing touch with some profound meaning knitted into the film's slasher-formula.

But its a shame they continued the franchise, i guess you could say the first 4 are classics and perhaps Halloween H20. <br/><br/>When i think of Halloween now i cant help watching the rest after the first and thats a bad thing because the rest are crap! The only problem of the first is really the violence... as you don't expect, there's not enough!!!! hardly any compared to Friday the 13th <br/><br/>Its a shame too since the first was such a great movie, and still is!<br/><br/>Just make sure you watch the right Halloween."

","Halloween is a psychogical horror film. There is nowhere near an excess of gore. Rather, it plays like a novel. Allowing the viewer to scare itself on many an ocassion. The beauty of Haloween is it's suspense. Hitchcock said that the difference between terror and suspense is that with terror, the plane suddenly comes from the sky, but with suspense, we know that the plane will fall, but we don't know when it will fall. Halloween is the Grandfather of all modern day horror films. It set the mold. Sure, Psyscho is the Great Grand Dad, but we're talking about Halloween. There are 3 major contributions that Carpenter gave to the genre with this flick: 1) POV, 2) Music, 3) Long Lens view of action. Let me elaborate. The opening scene with the child killer is, in my opinion, the best horror shot of all time. What it does is put you in the eyes of the killer and shocks you with the killer being a kid...all in about 5 minutes. Secondly, the music is a classic. It set the tone throughout the movie, where mundane scenes become scary. You do not have any clue, when something is going to happen, because the music keeps you off kilter. Lastly, the long lens views of Michael Myers make you feel like, ""Did I just see that?""."

","Rare movies create sub-genres and this is one of them.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's Halloween created a new sub-genre of horror, later named slasher movies and regardless of the fact that dozens of films can today be cataloged under this genre, the original slasher is still the best. The sequels and imitators are mainly studio movies intended to extract as much money as possible from the formula for which this movie serves as model.<br/><br/>Carpenter's second best direction effort(the best being ""The Thing"") is an amazing horror movie from 1978 that will scare even the youngest audiences that have gone through many of the new slasher trends. The way many of the scenes are shot make the audience feel like a voyeur standing beside Meyers and alternates to the victims when they're about to be killed, trying to make the viewer as uncomfortable and out of balance as possible.<br/><br/>The acting is not brilliant, but competent; Jamie Lee Curtis begins her career in this movie and played Laurie Strode.<br/><br/>Halloween is one of the best horror movies of all time and remains groundbreaking despite the repetitive use of many parts of it's plot by other less good industry products.<br/><br/>I give this an 8/10 and second in my all time favorite horror list."
"cwarne_uk","9","0","1","26 July 2008"," Genuine Classic
","Not a film that invented a genre as some claim - numerous Italian films and Black Christmas got there first. What Halloween did do though was perfect a template still used today. The legacy is pretty mixed as all too often gore has substituted for tension. On a purely formal level this may be the best made US film of the 70's - predominately long steadycam takes with quicker cuts being used to raise tension - this is a style of film-making that seems largely lost as directors and editors seem to try to break records for the number of cuts in a film. The music is outstanding and adds rather than distracts. Acting is variable as it is in all low budget films but Jamie Lee Curtis is very good. Between 1976 and 1982 Carpenter was amongst the finest filmmakers in America, Halloween is not even his finest film - that honour belongs to The Thing - it is the one he will be remembered for though."

"sddavis63","8","0","1","6 July 2008"," The Slasher Film Against Which All Other Slasher Films Must Be Measured
","It's interesting to watch ""Halloween"" 30 years after it was made, and to realize just how influential this movie has been in the genre. Almost every ""slasher"" movie that followed seems to have found some of its inspiration from this. From Jason's mask, to villains who won't die, to terrified teens targeted for death, it all seems to have begun here, in a pretty straightforward and not particularly fancy movie that nevertheless managed to get almost everything right.<br/><br/>On Halloween night 1963, Michael Myers bludgeoned his sister to death. For some reason, exactly 15 years later he escapes from his maximum security prison and returns to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois to go on another killing spree. The power of this movie comes from two things - the atmosphere, which is appropriately suspenseful throughout, and the musical score, which fits perfectly and which cannot be forgotten once its heard. In all honesty I thought the acting was somewhat inconsistent, with the exception of Donald Pleasance. As Dr. Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist who is absolutely convinced that Michael is evil and should be locked up forever, Pleasance is superb. The rest of the cast - even including Jamie Lee Curtis to be honest - had its ups and downs, and some of the lines seemed spoken in a bit of a monotone which didn't suit the action. That's explained probably by the inexperience of a very young group of actors, none of whom (Curtis being the notable exception) really became significant players in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Given the way the genre progressed, it's surprising how little blood there is here. (Later makers of the slasher films should have taken this as inspiration too.) We see some murders, but they aren't the focal point, and they're not gruesomely depicted. I also found the ""relationship"" between Laurie (Curtis) and Michael strange (from the vantage point of the sequels.) Michael doesn't really seem to have targeted her in this movie. I know he keeps popping up in her life once he gets to Haddonfield, but she only ends up in danger because she goes to check out the house where he's doing the killing. (True, this is really only a problem in the sequels, where Laurie really is the target and there is this strange connection between them.) This short (90 minute) movie is the grand-daddy of movies of this type. It's not a classic Hollywood work, but as slasher films go it remains (in my opinion) the absolute best. 8/10"

","OK I wasn't going to review this film but after all the abuse I have read I feel I need to defend it so you can make an informed decision as to whether you're going to like this film.<br/><br/>Let's get one thing straight the original Halloween film was crap! It was low budget, the story line was typically plain and it has the classic late 70's cheesy vibe with plenty of topless girls (always a guarantee in these films)! It was however a classic because people back then were scared s**tless of that kind of stuff. The violence and nudity was so taboo at the time that it made for a fascinating watch, the story was almost believable and most of all it truly scared people. If you were to show that film to a group of modern day teenagers they wouldn't give it the time of day. I too enjoyed the original Halloween when I watched it at 14 years old, today it just bores me.<br/><br/>In comes Rob Zombies remake of a therefore classic. There was no way this film was ever going to surpass the reviews its original got, it was labelled a failure from the start and whether they like to admit it or not a true horror buff cannot go into this film without a tremendous amount of scepticism that will take a lot to overcome. I am not a fan of Rob Zombie's films. I agree that modern day horror films need to go to extraordinarily extreme and somewhat sickening lengths to achieve a shock value (Hostel/Devils Rejects), but unlike films such as SAW, Rob fails to back his films up with intensity and mind twisting story lines. I respect Rob for keeping a lot of the original things that made Halloween a classic, if he didn't he would not have been able to justify calling this film a remake. He understood though that simply sticking to the original would not have achieved the shock and aaawwww value of its predecessor with a modern audience. He had to delve deeper into the character in order to achieve a juicier storyline. A lot of people have criticised this but it was what had to be done to bring this film into the modern era of horror. I personally enjoyed the way this remake has done that and it gives whoever has seen the original a motive to watch this. Overall this film is not a classic; it was never going to be simply because this sort of film does not work with a modern day audience. Don't expected to be scared, just expect a slasher film that makes you reach for a bucket instead of cushion."
"dfle3","Null","0","1","19 June 2008"," A classic of the ""slasher"" genre
","""Halloween"" is one of those horror/slasher movies that parents of young children don't like them to watch. Surprisingly, however, this movie is not a gore-fest and for that reason may disappoint hardcore slasher fans.<br/><br/>What it does have going for it is a scary central character, Michael Myers (no, not the guy from ""Wayne's World""!) and a highly effective, creepy soundtrack composed by the director, John Carpenter. In fact, years ago, I had considered buying the soundtrack to this movie but thought it could wait as it would always be around...silly me! Hopefully the new Rob Zombie version will recycle the original score and be out on soundtrack too.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple-during Halloween, a young boy, wearing a mask, murders his sexually active sister. Years later, on the same day, that boy, Michael Myers (now an adult), has escaped a mental institution and returns home...with more of the same kind of mayhem in mind.<br/><br/>This movie was directed by John Carpenter and is perhaps his best movie. From memory, it's stated in media that this movie was once the most successful independent movie of all time (since surpassed by Michael Moore's ""Fahrenheit 9/11"", I think).<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis has her first, at least major role, in this movie I think, as a would be victim of Myers. She is an effective screamer, as was her mother, Janet Leigh, in perhaps the first slasher movie, Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"".<br/><br/>Not sure, but Halloween may have been the inspiration for the subsequent spate of horror/slasher films that followed, many of them having an impossibly difficult to kill psycho at their centre, as in ""Friday the 13th"" (parts I to xy).<br/><br/>Anyway, despite the dark, gloomy, murky chills this movie provides, there are moments of fun, as when Myers dons a rather bad Halloween outfit, which creates an absurd look for him.<br/><br/>You might want to check out this movie's first sequel, which I really liked, as well as other Carpenter films, including: ""The Thing"" and, for fans of the PS 2 game ""Metal Gear Solid"", check out Carpenter's ""Escape from New York"" for influence."
"zardoz-13","10","0","3","18 June 2008"," An Excellent Slasher Saga . . .
","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" qualifies as both a trick and a treat.<br/><br/>First, the unlikely notion that an independently-produced horror movie made for a miserly $320-thousand could amass $75-million dollars and remain popular twenty-two years afterward constitutes quite a trick. Incidentally, Carpenter took twenty days to shoot ""Halloween."" Not only did ""Halloween"" catapult newcomer Jamie Lee Curtis to stardom {she reigned as the 'Scream Queen' in a spate of ""Halloween"" knock-offs, like Paul Lynch's ""Prom Night"" (1980) and Roger Spottiswoode's ""Terror Train"" (1980)} but also it spawned six sequels of varying quality. Naturally, none surpasses the consummate skill and artistry of Carpenter's seminal slaughterhouse saga. Arguably, if Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" carved out a new sub-category for slashers among 1960s' horror movies, ""Halloween"" hacked out a niche in cinematic history when it revived the genre. According to producer Irwin Yablans, ""Halloween 2"" appeared primarily because scores of ""Halloween"" clones came out and coined considerable box-office success. Second, ""Halloween"" suffices as a treat because it focuses on far more than gratuitous blood & gore. Essentially, the film dwells on the cosmic issue of 'Evil' and Man's inability to combat both Evil and Fate as entities at work in our Universe.<br/><br/>Carpenter directs with commendable restraint considering the genre. Anybody who pans ""Halloween"" as tawdry and exploitative misses out on what elevates this minor chiller above its clones and makes it worth watching beyond the usual cursory viewings. Although it depicts savage violence, ""Halloween"" spills pints rather than buckets of blood. If you're counting, three females and two males perish. He doesn't rely on sophisticated special effects or ghastly prosthetic make-up appliances. He generates tension, suspense, and nerve-wracking horror by deliberately pacing the action and doling out shocks and surprises. ""Halloween's"" stark narrative simplicity propels it to its slang-bang ending. Carpenter and co-scenarist Debra Hill surgically pared down the plot to its absolute essentials. They relate a story with a beginning, middle, and an ending in straightforward fashion. Indeed, characterization remains deplorably one-dimensional, but the cast is convincing enough so it really doesn't matter. Moreover, they play roles that wouldn't experience radical growth over a 24 hour period, unless they wind up dying. Michael personifies Evil from start to finish. After he escapes from the Illinois State Hospital, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance of ""You Only Live Twice"") sounds the alarm: ""The evil has gone from here!"" Fate deploys Michael as an instrument, and Fate allows Michael to thrive with impunity in the end as the only truly phantasmagoric character. <br/><br/>Essentially, ""Halloween"" is a thriller with a monster for killer. The horrific elements of Michael's villainous appearance and his supernatural qualities make this a chiller. Visually, Carpenter links a classroom discussion of Fate to Michael as the killer sits parked outside Laurie's school in a station wagon. Furthermore, nothing superfluous clutters up the narrative, clocking in at a lean, mean 92 minutes. One scene depicts Dr. Loomis advocating Michael's prolonged incarceration in a mental institution. Of course, the squeamish should watch ""Halloween"" in the company of somebody responsible, since the film concerns some unsavory themes, such as a murderous juvenile, a lunatic on the rampage with a blood lust nothing except death can quench, and the security of hospitals charged with keeping these maniacs locked-up behind bars. The irony of a psychiatrist who totes around a revolver with a gun permit and acts like a vigilante who shoots first and ask questions afterward represents still another topic for discussion.<br/><br/>Carpenter and Hill confine the action to three acts. They set up the characters efficiently enough, introducing Michael first, then Dr. Sam Loomis, and finally Michael's victims. Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, and Lynda comprise the trio of high school girls/victims that Michael sets out to slaughter. While Annie and Lynda are sexually active sirens, Laurie is the ""Girl Scout"" of the group. She doesn't have a date for the school dance and is either shy or afraid to ask a guy out. She fits the classification of a sexually repressed girl, a character who typically survives the slasher because in a sense she reflects elements of his own repression. Once Michael makes the 150 mile drive to Haddonfield, the plot concerns when the characters converge on Lindsey Wallace's house where the murders transpire. Quotable dialogue reverberates throughout this slickly made white-knuckled thriller. During a telephone conversation, Laurie learns Annie has spoken to a guy the former has a crush on, and Laurie's responds: ""Are you fooling around again? Well, I'll kill you if this is a joke."" Despite a number of flaws and flubs, ""Halloween"" has managed to withstand the ravages of time. One big question the original left blank dealt with Michael's apparent obsession with Laurie Strode. ""Halloween 2"" accounts for this mystery in a way that ""The Empire Strikes Back"" would alter Luke Skywalker's destiny. Ultimately, Michael epitomizes Evil incarnate as the inexorable catalyst in horror movies, just as the Terminator evokes a similar quality in science fiction. <br/><br/>""Halloween"" adheres to several horror movie conventions. First, mankind can vanquish Evil with a capital E in battles but cannot altogether conqueror it. Generally, the best horror movies provide closure of the worst sort. The heroes may survive, but so too may the villains. Sure, the improbable ending with a villain recovering not only from a fall from a balcony but also six bullets weakens the credibility of ""Halloween."" Nevertheless, successful horror movies require larger-than-life monsters, and Michael attains a legendary status at fade-out by being able to waltz away with six slugs in him. Happily, Donald Pleasance's Dr. Loomis doesn't react with either surprise or alarm at Michael's resilience. Bullets cannot stop Michael because he possesses supernatural qualities. Little Tommy refers to Michael as the 'Bogeyman' and assures Laurie that nobody can kill the 'Bogeyman.' At fade-out, Laurie asks Loomis if Michael were the 'Bogeyman,' and he affirms that fact. No, you don't have to watch ""Halloween"" only during the actual holiday itself to appreciate this seasonal chiller."
"Witchfinder-General-666","8","0","1","18 June 2008"," THE Classic Slasher
","""Halloween"" of 1978 must be among the most popular and widely known Horror films ever brought to screen, and it also is a very good, scary and highly influential one. The film earned director John Carpenter the reputation of having single-handedly invented the Slasher-sub-genre. This is not quite entirely true. The (superior) Italian Giallo can be seen as the sub-genre that inspired the Slasher, especially films like Mario Bava's ""Reazione A Catena"" (aka. ""Bay Of Blood"", 1971) were inspiring for the genre, as even Carpenter himself has stated, and Canadian director Bob Clark's ""Black Christmas"" of 1974 can also be seen as a precursor of the slasher film. It is undeniable however, that ""Halloween"" is THE film that defined the Slasher-film, and furthermore one of the greatest and scariest films the sub-genre has ever brought forth. Generally speaking, Slashers are not among my favorite sub-genres in Horror (as stated above, when it comes to serial killer films, I prefer Gialli), but I have seen ""Halloween"" plenty of times (as probably most Horror-buffs have) and watching it is still an enormous delight. The simple and yet so ingenious and eerie theme tune composed by director Carpenter himself already marks the beginning of a Classic, and the ingenious score is certainly not the only thing recommendable about ""Halloween"". This film has an enormous cult-following, and it is understandable why. The film is suspenseful from the first minute onward, the yummy young Jamie Lee Curtis shines in her first leading role of Laurie Strode (still her most memorable role to date), the great Donald Pleasence (one of my favorite actors) is superb as Dr. Sam Loomis, and the film introduces one of cinema's most memorable psychos - Michael Myers.<br/><br/>Sadly, it is nowadays almost impossible not to know about the film's plot, which lessens the shock-effect of the ingenious first surprise in the beginning of the film. 6-year old Michael Myers slaughters his teenage sister for no apparent reason in the little town of Haddonfield, Illinois. Fifteen years later Michael escapes the psychological institution in which he has spent his life ever since, and heads to Haddonfield in order to pursue his only passion - the butchering of teenage girls. Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence), the psychiatrist concerned with Michael follows him, aware that his patient is pure evil. In the meanwhile, Haddonfield teenager Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and her friends are preparing to spend Halloween babysitting...<br/><br/>The unforgettable score, the great cinematography, the scary appearance of the masked Michael Myers - everything works together in ""Halloween"" and that makes it a true Classic of pure suspense. Young Jamie Lee Curtis is very beautiful and she delivers a stunning performance in her first leading role of Laurie Strode. Laurie is a very lovable character, which makes the viewer actually fear for her, and I couldn't imagine any other actress to fit the role as well as Curtis does. The great Donald Pleasance is brilliant in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Horror Icon Christopher Lee (another favorite actor of mine) turned the role down, which he later considered his biggest mistake in his career. As much as I am a fan of Christopher Lee, however, I think that Pleasence is outstanding in the role, and I could not imagine that anybody else could fit the role even nearly as well as Peasence does. Pleasence would play the role 4 more times before he passed away in 1995. Overall ""Halloween"" is a great, stunning film that delivers in all regards. The film is an absolute must-see for every Horror fan, and every lover of cinema should see it at least once. Not to be missed!"

","Last year I was in a Virgin Megastore in central London and there was Halloween DVD being offered in promotion . The picture with the knife and the Halloween mask on the front of the DVD didn't appeal to me as I thought that it was going to be another of those bloody meaningless slasher horror films. But the simple and little story line as a comment captivated my attention and made me curious about it,and also I had the strange feeling that the film but especially the music was going to be interesting. So I bought it and added it to my DVD collection. I watched it the first time three months ago and...how wrong I was about the impression over the cover picture on the DVD!! It turned out to be one of the best horror films I have ever watched! Tense from start to finish, with dense eerie atmosphere and creepy lighting and...obviously a suspenseful and captivating music! I watched again it last night with the thought that it would have probably been less tense or attractive following my first viewing only three months ago. How wrong I was again!! I had the same impact than the first time and find it perhaps more frightful than the first viewing!! The idea of Micheal never dying is purely evil! His terribly breathing still haunting the house and place at the end of the film very scary! I think John Carpenter has really made a great job here, considering I guess the low budget used and the ability to create a great horror slasher film with practically no blood (a part a little from the first scene when Micheal kills his sister) and no special effect. I'm not sure about the acting qualities of Donald Pleasence, but I think him and Jamie Lee Curtis to be perfectly cast in this film.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to any horror fan and not, but not to those who are easily disturbed or frightened. The music will be very likely lingering in your memory for a long time. My vote 8.5 out of 10!"
"Aomalle27","10","0","1","29 April 2008"," The definitive slasher movie...
","This is what all slasher movies should strive for; good writing, acting, a true feel for directing, and some creative retelling of common mythology. In the case of Halloween, giving an actual face to the Boogey-man of lore. If you don't know the general story you've been comatose for quite some time, please ask someone to check your pulse. A young boy named Michael Myers kills his teenage sister, subsequently he's sentenced to a lifetime of sanitarium care until the supervision of a brilliant psychologist named Dr. Loomis. This is another excellent performance in the long and illustrious career of character actor Donald Pleasance. Unfortunately for the actor this role would also define his career. Not that the performance was bad, quite the contrary, this role is one of the most exacting and nuanced an actor could attempt to tackle. But rather, Pleasance has had so many great performances, that it's a shame to sum up his whole career in this singular note. Imagine focusing on Jack Nickolson's role in Batman as his benchmark. Not bad, but think of all the other great roles he's had, from Jake Gettes in Chinatown, the devil in Witches of Eastwick, the crazy in One Flew over the cuckoos' nest, etc. Loomis is a man haunted by his work with the now adult Michael. A silent presence, but one that Loomis is certain will emotionally explode at some time. His estimations of Myers' state of being prove true, as Michael frees the inmates of the Sanitarium into the outer grounds of the institution, using this distraction to liberate himself entirely. This first meeting, we the audience, have with Michael is truly terrifying because this is our first glimpse into the being that is to become our modern day interpretation of the Boogey-man. A silent, unstoppable monster. He leaves a bloody path back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Why he's returning, we don't know, (and his motivations for this won't be revealed until the slightly less likable sequel) but to be sure, we take notice. Several clever false alarms, really maximize the true scares. The now clichéd inspecting a suspicious noise only to find a mischievous cat, is used to the ultimate effect here. Carpenter is a director that really uses all his creative juices to get the best out of everything at his disposal. Lighting is moody and perfect for a scary setting, his antagonist isn't silly and overused. This is a stalking, menacing silent hulk with one mission, death. This depiction of a killer is truly genius because it muddies the definition of man and beast. Sometimes man and beast are interchangeable. A scary thought, for to be beast, means not catering to the moral compass that is the domain of man alone. Another great portrayal is that of Jamie Lee Curtis, whose defenseless babysitter, is now a Slasher genre staple. But here, we get a heroine, rather than a strapping lad as hero. She uses all her grit an wile to overcome what all others could not. A refreshing take on what it means to be heroic. No longer were women to be merely damsel in distress, but sometimes could be the salvation of all others in the film. A standard setting film, which all horror films should strive for, Excellence in every aspect of the film making process will lead to an excellent film."

","No director since Alfred Hitchcock has managed to capture the voyeurism of horror as well as John Carpenter has with his classic Halloween, a film so entrenched with our primordial anxieties that it continues to define the genre more than twenty years later. Indeed the comparison between Hitchcock is no stretch; Halloween is saturated with Hitchcock tributes, namely Psycho and Rear Window, even down to the casting of a young Jamie Lee Curtis, daughter of the infamous shower victim of Psycho, Janet Leigh.<br/><br/>Halloween's plot is as old as the hills, but when it was released, was remarkably original. Because of its success, it spawned countless imitators. It concerns several teenagers being stalked by a masked psychopath who kills in especially gruesome ways, usually after an episode of sex. The pronounced societal anxieties of Halloween's good versus evil plot is left unresolved, a strategy repeated consistently in slasher films ranging from Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street and the most recent success, Scream. Halloween is genius with its camera work. Be it the predator or the prey, someone is always watching and lurking. The brilliant pacing and excruciatingly long takes manage to keep the adrenaline pumping as Michael slinks in the shadows rising from death again and again to chase the clever, bookish and virginal heroine Laurie Strode. In the end, we are left to confront the thread of separation between fact and fiction. Halloween is a merciless, unmissible horror film that reigns high above every other slasher flick."

This movie has a wonderfully nostalgic feel for me. I know it's not a perfect movie, but it comes pretty damn close. Worthy of noting, is a edited version floating around that takes out the nudity, profanity, and some of the violence. Beware of these release, as they seriously take away from Carpenter's vision.

","This is a perfect horror film. Everything about the film was perfect and it shows that guts and gore (despite being amazing) is not what makes a masterpiece horror. I am a huge fan of horror films and have been a huge fan of the Halloween series ever since watching this one. the suspense is exquisite. Where is he? Was that him? Questions that arose more and more as you being to feel Michael's character.<br/><br/>the film builds to a brilliant climax and constantly leaves you wanting more and more. I admittedly love Michael Myers as a character and he is by far the best movie serial killer.<br/><br/>If you are a horror fan and can appreciate horror for what it is then this is a must watch. If you watch horror for blood guts and gore then watch this to learn otherwise."

","This movie, Halloween is a great thriller and one of my all-time favorite series. It is about a killer named Michael Myers who kills people, mainly of the ages from 16+. He kills mostly at night and on the day, Halloween. When he was younger, like 6, he murdered his older sister because she wouldn't go trick-or-treating with him and is placed in jail. but he eventually escapes and returns to kill. <br/><br/>He attacks a city of Illinois named Haddonfield, where he stalks a few teenagers named Laurie Strode, Annie, and some other girls. Most of the friends are killed on that night, all in different ways. This movie is a thriller, and a horror movie and will have anybody on the edge of the seat wondering what will happen next. I recommend this movie for mainly ages 13+. I hope this review gave you a heads-up about the movie. Enjoy!"

","Halloween (1978, Dir. John Carpenter) <br/><br/>Laurie Strode and her friends, Annie and Lynda think they are safe in their neighbourhood, but they are wrong. Dead Wrong! 15 Years after brutally murdering his older sister, Michael Myers has escaped from a institute, just days before Halloween night. As, Myers sets off to take some more lives, his Doctor, Sam Loomis tries to find him, before it's too late.<br/><br/>Being such a big film fan, god only knows why i never saw this earlier. I had already seen 'A Nightmare On Elm Street' and 'Friday the 13th', and was trying to fit in time to see 'Halloween'. Eventually, in 2008, i managed to witness the experience of 'Halloween'. A good horror movie can be hard to create. It's all about getting the right delivery of scares. 'Halloween' does not disappoint. The movie doesn't rely on blood and gore. As a matter of fact, there's hardly any blood is this movie at all. The scare mainly focuses on the suspense factor. Thie numerous appearances of his shadows, causes you to wait for the moment *it* happens. All the young cast do very well, with Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence also creating two iconic characters. Including Michael Myers, these three iconic figures help keep 'Halloween' alive for a long, long time.<br/><br/>""I TOLD EVERYBODY!"" <br/><br/>""Nobody listened."" - Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence)"
"teacherlogan","6","0","1","12 February 2008"," Halloween. A great, terrifying film.
","Hollywood seems to be prancing out dozens of cookie-cutter horror films. These films are heavy on blood and guts, light on story. It seems more emphasis is placed on how often the filmmaker can shock the audience. Movies that scare an audience are much rarer. Tension and frightening anticipation are much harder to instill. Halloween is a film that permeates fear from the first scene to the last. It puts you on edge and keeps you there until the credits roll.<br/><br/>As the film opens, a teenage girl is brutally murdered on Halloween by her 6 year old brother, Michael Myers. Incarcerated for fifteen years, Myers escapes on Halloween Eve and returns to his home town to continue his killing spree. He quietly stalks Lori Stode and her friends as they babysit on his old street. Dr. Loomis, Myers long time psychiatrist, follows him home in an attempt to stop his latest rampage, before it's too late.<br/><br/>The excellence of John Carpenter's Halloween is demonstrated in the subtle ways he creates a multifaceted mood of terror. Overall, there are few moments of intense action. The entire movie is about building suspense. The audience is left expecting Myers to strike but left wondering when and how. Michael Myers has been patient. He has waited 15 years for this night. Carpenter, in turn, is asking the audience to be equally patient. This anticipation makes the climax that much better.<br/><br/>The theme music, written by Carpenter himself, is an anthem of impending doom. It moves as Myers moves, building as the suspense builds. The music is simply, yet powerful. It perfectly complements the anxious moments on screen. The theme music is always there, another representation of Myers' ominous presence. A soundtrack can instill emotion like no other medium in film. In Halloween, the music adds a constant layer of tension whether we see the killer or not. <br/><br/>Dr. Loomis paints us a clear picture of what type of monster Michael Myers is. He is pure evil. As such, we do not need to see him killing to understand the threat he represents. His very existence is enough. As a result, Halloween can add terror through the simplest tricks. Looking through Myers' eyes as he stalks his prey. Seeing him lurk in the bushes outside an unsuspecting babysitter's house. Hearing his ominous breathing as he patiently waits for his moment to strike. <br/><br/>The classic pale white mask, now a fixture of American horror, was a perfect choice for extracting maximum impact with minimum effort. The mask shows clearly in the darkness. Many scenes were enhanced simply by having the silhouette of Myer's face subtly placed in the scene. His presence is felt, even if his wrath has yet to be unleashed.<br/><br/>Today's generation of horror audiences have been desensitized to violence. There is so much graphic gore displayed on screen that it takes a lot to shock anyone anymore. Halloween has little of this. In a way, Halloween is aided by being an independent film. Without a massive budget for bloody scenes and ghastly killings, Halloween is 'forced' to terrorize its audience with the specter of death. Such necessity makes for a far better film. A film is created that can stand as not only a great horror movie, but simply a great movie. Halloween is a wonderful piece of American cinema. And it's scary too."
"elf_man-1","9","0","1","28 November 2007"," The best film in cinematic history!!
","This movie is one of my favorite horror movies of all time, if not my number 1 favorite. The idea of a babysitter getting stalked by the bogeyman was a classic idea by John Carpenter. Since then we have had some babysitter movies but nothing of Halloween's kind. Jamie Lee Curtis played an excellent role and could easily play the character of Laurie Strode, who as you find out in Halloween 2 is Michael Myer's sister. As you get through the Halloween series it does start to get a little bit stupid. WHY WON'T HE JUST FRIGGIN DIE! Now, in November 2007, a remake of Halloween came out but it is nothing like the original. No horror movie will ever beat the suspense, thrill ride and the tuneful film of Halloween and they will not even get close to the standard of Halloween.<br/><br/>I personally think that the only 2 good Halloween films were number 1 and 2, in which case states that 3, 4 and 5 were not as well put together and definitely not as scary. Number four and five were alright but number 3 was full on hunk of crap. I mean the idea of robots in a Halloween film and a Halloween film nothing to do with Michael Myers is not classified as a Halloween film in my book. Number four and five introduced young Jamie to the thrill ride of Halloween and she added a bit of spice into the films. I shall end this comment while saying that this movie Halloween is the best movie that anyone will ever see! :)"
"movieaddict07","Null","0","1","25 November 2007"," A horror classic, avoid the remake...see this
","When you watch films like all the horror remakes, Rob Zombie's 2007 take on Halloween is a good example, or the Saw trilogy, you think your watching a 'real' horror film. But your not, your watching a film that's shock and tension is built on cheap scares and an overload of gore and blood. The classic version of Halloween, produced on a budget far under one million dollars (see, kids of today, you don't need mega bucks to create a classic scare flick), changed the face of horror and re-launched the slasher genre in 1978. And the scares were genuine, there's little blood and very infrequent violence, yet it still succeeds in scaring the pants of viewers.<br/><br/>Halloween uses dark, rare images of a killer standing in the background, sometimes you don't even see him at all, but you can ""feel"" his near, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, well-crafted music, a sinister story told and a menacing, relentless villain. My advice to film makers in our day and age is to study Halloween. Horror directors of today don't know anything about the industry. Rob Zombie, who claims to be a devoted horror fan, knows nothing about the genre, he does not know what real scares are.<br/><br/>I give my highest regards to this film, and recommend it to anyone that can see today's generation of horror films are only excuses to make money."

","Two people are sitting in a room at a table with a bomb underneath it: it explodes  that is action. Two people sit in a room at a table with a bomb underneath it: it doesn't explode  that is suspense. Wise words from, I believe, Alfred Hitchcock who was a master at suspense and really moved the horror genre on as a whole from those pre-1960s monster movies that Hollywood churned out to a hungry, teenage drive-in audience. A couple of decades later and John Carpenter is using the same idea: there is a young female teenager alone in a house with a knife wielding maniac outside: he runs in a stabs her  that is horror. The girl is inside and the knife wielding maniac is watching her through the window: that is suspense.<br/><br/>That is the essence of Halloween, John Carpenter's 1978 fright filled horror film that absolutely drowns in suspense in a fantastic sort of a way. It's an easy thing to do, I suppose, to just get a load of horny teenagers on screen and have them picked off one by one: no brains, no suspense, no script and no fun from a theoretical point of view. Alas, modern horrors fall foul of this trap with recent efforts Freddy vs. Jason and from what I've heard; Jason X being two of many culprits. Halloween is a much more sophisticated horror in fact it rivals The Shining for the most suspense filled, un-nerving horror film of all time in my opinion at least. But where Kubrick had money, a location that was uncanny in its symmetry and eeriness and a real license to unleash the supernatural in his film; Halloween takes everything a level lower and uses camera work, setting and dialogue to build up its scares.<br/><br/>The first hour of Halloween is basically one long build up of 'is he, isn't he' (going to strike) and 'is she, isn't she' (going to die). The actual opening of Halloween is probably the best use of a long take in any film I've ever seen; funny how another Kubrick film pops into mind in the form of A Clockwork Orange but that was more one long shot than one long take since the camera was static as it zooms out. Halloween gets its priorities right: Michael Myers is talked about by Dr. Loomis (Pleasence), his psychiatrist for 15 years, in a way that makes him seem unnatural  Michael is off screen as Loomis goes on and on about how dangerous and insane he his creating a dangerous persona of a character who is miles and miles away from said actions. The certain events that follow such as the grave digging and the stealing of knifes from a general shop also creates a foreboding atmosphere centring on Myers without him even being there.<br/><br/>It's also worth saying that Laurie Strode (Lee Curtis) is a girl that doesn't seem to 'fit in' with the other girls: when they're having sex, she's babysitting; when they smoke they smoke properly but when Laurie does so, she chokes and just doesn't seem as outgoing as the rest of them in general  needless to say those that do conform to society meet grizzly ends: a horror genre convention we all know of by now. Halloween gets is characters and its delivery bang on but it also plays with its audience. There are enough phones ringing, foreboding compositions with Myers looming in the background and character going from one place to another and then back again to create suspense and some genuine jumps; this twinned with the fact the lights always seem to be off makes for great viewing.<br/><br/>Halloween is a film that is clever and taught but it suffers very sparsely from perhaps its look and the dated way it goes about having its character react. Loomis and his accomplice seem fine about getting out of a car despite the fact mental patients have escaped and are loose; Laurie also fails to finish off Myers on one occasion towards the end when she had a chance to. Laurie also decides that hiding in a wardrobe might be a good idea when Myers still looms and yet refuses to break a window in order to escape until he is literally feet away from her. Whatever Halloween has wrong with it can actually be covered up to look like more suspense and at least it doesn't become a mere gore-fest. The final shots of various locations after Myers has seemingly been beaten could be point of view shots of Myers as he does his thing; could be revisits to the locations of murder or maybe something else entirely. My guess is the point of view option since you hear him breathing. If you're looking for a suspenseful, violent at times film that delivers on jumps, chase and enough phallic stabbing to get any psychoanalytic fan in a flush then you will want to give Halloween a go."

","I buy one bag each of miniature Hershey's, Reese's, Kit Kat, Milky Way and Three Musketeers. On sale. To delight my neighbors' kids who will be knocking on my door on Wednesday night -- Halloween. This morning I open the cupboard where the candy was stashed.<br/><br/>A tragic tableau.<br/><br/>Scattered candy wrappers and empty bags mock me. I think of Ernest Hemingway's classic novel, ""The Old Man and the Sea."" You remember -- impoverished fisherman rides out to sea in a tiny skiff and bags a colossal marlin with a hook on the end of a rope. The fish is too big for the boat, so he lashes it to the side. Fifteen hundred pounds of bleeding fish in the water? Great. Shark dinner bell. The fisherman fights valiantly to protect his catch, but loses the battle one bite at a time. He returns home with a skeleton tied to his boat.<br/><br/>Suffice to say I fought hard to repel my kids' repeated predation on my Halloween stash, but I lost the battle. One bite at a time.<br/><br/>Ah, Halloween! Monsters, ghosts and things that go bump in the night! I was in the first grade when my grandmother gave me the Aurora model kit of Frankenstein, based on the 1931 classic film starring Boris Karloff as the monster. Never really grew out of my love for great horror stories and films. And I don't mean guys hacking up skinny-dipping teenagers. That's just stupid. I mean great ghost stories, haunted houses, vampires, werewolves and other well-crafted monsters.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's 1978 film ""Halloween"" is brilliant. Terrifying. Plays your imagination like a fiddle. Astonishingly little blood. I saw the film at the Student Union at Southern Methodist University and will never forget my friend Harry with his head between his knees, screaming. Great fun! Saw the remake. Really hated it. Wasn't scared once. Mostly just sickened. I left feeling like I'd done something wrong. And I have been asking myself why.<br/><br/>I know I'm not a prude. And it can't be the violence, per se. I think ""The Godfather"" is the greatest American film ever made, and it's replete with violence. It can't be that I felt manipulated, because I pay film studios to manipulate me.<br/><br/>John Carpenter's film was like a well-told story around a campfire. Rob Zombie's film was like someone breaking into my house and assaulting me. The violence in Carpenter's film was like an iceberg -- most of it occurred beneath the surface in my imagination. Zombie's film is too cool for anyone's imagination -- brutal, savage, bordering on the obscene.<br/><br/>Carpenter manipulates your mind and senses with cats yowling, branches scraping the side of a house, lighting, shadows and curtains wafting before an open window. Zombie manipulates me by turning up the soundtrack to a preposterous volume.<br/><br/>When Michael Myers, age 11, kills a schoolmate by beating him to death with a tree branch, Zombie interprets the sound with a noise like a snare drum hit pushed through an effects unit. The victim suffers and begs for minutes on end, surviving blows that would have killed a Cape buffalo.<br/><br/>Carpenter's film has one brief-if-obligatory flash of nubile breasts. Zombie's version shows me a man sitting on a truck-stop commode perusing a graphic porn magazine. But that's not enough. Zombie points the camera over the shoulder of Man Sitting on Commode so that I can see the graphic porn photo, too! OK. I get it, Rob. The man is looking at porn.<br/><br/>Art, by definition, is interpretation. Just 'cause you're angry, randy, a hedonist, sadist or anarchist -- well, none of these things makes you an artist. Alone, they pretty much make you an exhibitionist. A boy sticking pins in an insect just to see what happens.<br/><br/>I rowed out into the open ocean of my willing imagination and tied Rob Zombie's remake to my boat. But in this case, the sharks didn't come nearly soon enough.<br/><br/>Written by Steven Kalas, Las Vegas Nevada"

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>In 1963, as a young boy, Michael Myers is sent to a high security mental hospital for brutally butchering his older sister with a knife. Fifteen years later he's escaped and returned to the sleepy town of Haddonfield to re-live his evil crime. Dr Loomis (Donald Pleasance) the psychiatrist who assessed Myers as a boy, races to the rescue while pretty teenager Laurie (Jamie Lee Curtis) tries not to end up like her friends- dead...<br/><br/>In the late 70s, horror-meister John Carpenter took a shoestring budget and made a seemingly simple slasher film. But rather than end up long forgotten, Halloween went on to become and has remained a firm cult favourite in the field of the horror genre.<br/><br/>Put simply, Michael Myers is the scariest horror movie character ever. And all the more scarier because he's only human. No evil, supernatural powers, just a human monster without the slightest tinge of pity or mercy, who kills for seemingly no reason other than it's just something he wants to do. He doesn't even spare his victims a witty Freddy Krueger style one-liner or Pinhead style explanation, just stares at them coldly with that creepy mask of his and kills them ,no matter how much they struggle and beg.<br/><br/>The creepy score (""...duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh deh- duh duh duh duh duh duh duh duh deh..."") remains a high-point. Inevitably, though, the constraints at the time the film was made haven't lasted through. It was a low budget horror film made in the late 70s and as such, some things like the lighting, sound and production values sadly do look rather corny now.<br/><br/>On the performances front, Pleasance is a commanding lead, giving the role his all as a man who can't mess around. Curtis had a stroke of luck that she was remembered and went on to have quite a memorable career. The acting from all the supporting cast (i.e the horny teenagers) isn't up to much but then it didn't have to be, just act pretty obnoxious and wait to be slaughtered...<br/><br/>A film that's left an unswavering mark on the horror genre, sadly tarnished by all the awful sequels that became increasingly more sub-standard the more they went on, Halloween is a small film that's left a big legacy. *****"

For Jaime Lee, it is by far and away one of her best, which goes to prove once again that when you start out on top, the only way to go is down (Freaky Friday anyone?).<br/><br/>It is good though, especially since it ushers in the whole slasher phenom from the '80s.

","Genre-defining horror film, but it's neither underrated or overrated - it's just good. It's pretty much the definitive Halloween film, and the one that I think of whenever I think of the holiday. Carpenter's direction is terrific; his ability with a camera is never questioned, as some of the shots are very impressive and the film is that much scarier because of it. The Shape is a terrifying horror icon, and the character is never scarier than he is in this film. Furthermore, the music is one of the best horror scores ever. But the film is merely good; the main reason is the acting and the dialogue. Pleasance is unremarkable, but he's easily the best of the cast: everybody else are terribly wooden, and their lines are cringe-worthy because of it. I don't know if its the writing or the acting, but the dialogue is incredibly bad. The superb atmosphere manages to overcome it, but this is not one of the best horror films of all time."

Halloween is not only a fine piece of scarecraft, but it has a fresh, go-ahead-and-criticize-all-you-want look and feel. It was an inexpensive movie to make, but you don't get the feeling of cheapness.. There are people who have gone on to greatness and character actors and actresses who have quietly left the stage, but for 21 days in the spring of 1978, the cast and crew of Halloween were at the top of their creativity, and reaching a high point (if that's possible) in the ""You Screw, You Die"" genre.<br/><br/>Everything I can think of after Halloween was cheap-looking, slasher films that looked like Xerox copies without enough toner, except the red.<br/><br/>Bravo!"

He then walks down toward an old truck. A train zips by to his left, horn blaring, and I noticed that when we cut to the other angle, on the far side of the truck in front of Loomis, the train doesn't go by in the background as it should.

Small oversight in consistency.<br/><br/>One other thing, in Halloween II, when Michael falls off the balcony in the end, he steps back, right onto the rail as if he was walking on a plank, which I suspect the stunt man was.<br/><br/>Not a huge problem, but maybe he could have broken through the rail instead.

","Halloween is an instant classic. From the second the first sound bytes start ringing out (that being the haunting theme composed by John Carpenter) to signal the opening credits, down to the very end, Halloween has set many standards for the horror genre. A faceless killer that we hardly ever see creates a very tense and scary atmosphere for the viewer, and that is one of the things Halloween offers. The musical score, very primal, very simple, yet very deep at the same time also makes the tension level very high. By 1978, audiences were a little more sophisticated. They knew a killer was about in Halloween. They knew where he was, and that the main character, Laurie, as well as her friends were all in danger from this maniac. The filmmakers knew this would be the case so they made the scenes leading up to the climax very tense, long and drawn-out to make the audience get involved with the film. The use of the Panaglide camera also helped give the audience a feeling that they were along for the ride with Laurie Strode on that fateful Halloween night. The cast, while Carpenter went out on a limb (he had to because he only had $300,000 to spend on this film) with the cast. All were fresh, relatively young, and pretty much unknown, except for Donald Pleasence. The cast did a very good job of helping to bring the horror to the audience in this film. Halloween definitely belongs in the top 5 of horror movies. Without Michael Myers there would be no Jason Voorhees or, for that matter, Freddy Krueger. Nor would there have been a Ghostface from Scream. As stated above, Halloween really set the bar for the next generation of horror movies."

","""Halloween"" has become a classic of sorts over the years. Independently produced for $300,000, it has spawned several imitations and a series of inferior sequels. Made by the team of Debra Hill and John Carpenter it provides all the thrills and scares one could hope for. Although it is thought of as a slasher movie, there is nary a drop of blood to be seen. The violence although graphic is handled for the most part in the viewers imagination. You see the thrust of a knife but do not see the actual stabbing.<br/><br/>The film opens on Halloween, 1963 with a 6 year old Michael Myers stabbing his older sister to death following a romantic encounter with her boyfriend. Fast forward 15 years where we meet Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) on his way to the asylum where Michael Myers has been kept. We learn that Myers has not spoken in all that time and that he is the embodiment of evil with ""the eyes of the devil"".<br/><br/>On arriving at the asylum Loomis learns that Myers has escaped. He steals the very car in which Loomis had been travelings and flees. Loomis believes that Myers will return to his home town and alerts authorities there.<br/><br/>Myers surely does return to the scene of the crime (on Halloween night, wouldn't you know) and there begins to stalk three young girls, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis) and Lynda van der Klok (P.J. Soles). Laurie and Annie are to baby sit that night with Lynda and her boyfriend to join Annie and her boyfriend later. Loomis meanwhile stakes out the old Myers house awaiting Michael.<br/><br/>Myers lurks about the house where Annie is babysitting. When she leaves to pick up her boyfriend, she becomes Myers first victim. Later Lynda and her boyfriend Bob Simms (John Michael Graham) arrive at the now empty house. After some ""under cover"" work, Lynda sends Bob down to the fridge for a couple of beers and....... Lynda awaits Bob but....... Then Myers turns his attention to Laurie and (gasp!)...the children.<br/><br/>Carpenter builds the suspense slowly. No murders takes place in the first two thirds of the film. He slowly introduces the Myers character (called ""the Form"" in the credits), by having him stalk the girls. Only Laurie actually sees him briefly before he disappears. And of course the others do not see the menace and think Laurie is imagining it. The fun starts after dark as ""The Ultimate Boogeyman"" goes to work.<br/><br/>A word about Carpenter's haunting theme. Almost a character itself it is played over the entire film and anyone has heard it will never forget it. A better horror theme has yet to be written.<br/><br/>The character of Michael Myers is portrayed by Nick Castle a friend and co-worker of Carpenter who would go on to be a successful director himself. For Curtis, this was her first film and type cast her for a time as a horror icon.<br/><br/>The mask worn by the Myers character was actually a mask of William Shatner as Captain Kirk of ""Star Trek"" fame, modified for the Myers character."

And i hope there are many more Halloween's to come because nothing will ever beat it not saw, Friday the 13th, nightmare on elm street or even Steven kings IT."
"Boba_Fett1138","9","0","8","1 November 2006"," The mother of all slasher movies.
","What can be more traditional movie-wise, then watching ""Halloween"" on Halloween eve?<br/><br/>I'm probably the only horror fan on this planet who hadn't seen ""Halloween"" yet before (the same goes for ""Friday the 13th"" of which I've only seen the last halve hour or so. So perhaps I don't even have the right calling myself a horror-fan.). By todays standards the movie is definitely not scary enough and most certainly not gory enough. But you need to watch this movie in 1978 perspective. The movie-making is unique and mostly defined the slasher horror-movie genre. It's influence and bar raising movie techniques and new set standards are still notable in movies this present day.<br/><br/>The movie really takes its time to build up the tension. No killings (with the exception of the first scene) occur until we're more than halve way through the movie. Before that the mood is set and a creepy atmosphere is created. You know that something evil/bad is about to happen but you never know when and how this is going to occur. So the tension is really well build up, which does still makes this one of the scariest horror movies ever made, despite the lack of blood, gore and actual real scare moments. John Carpenter has always been a master with building up a maximum atmosphere with minimum resources. This movie was made on a shoestring budget and this movie proofs that with true creativity and the right talent involved you can still make a classic and certainly influential movie, despite of the budget.<br/><br/>This is not the first slasher movie ever created but yet it's the most influential and perhaps also best known one. I think this is due to a couple of reasons. One is most definitely the earlier mentioned brilliantly build up tension and atmosphere of the movie. Another reason is the approach of the story. We often see things from Michael Myers point-of-view, sometimes we even literately look at things through his eyes. This is a approach that works creepy and mysterious. We know that he can strike anytime but yet he does nothing but observing his future victims. It provides tension created from a different original viewpoint, which perhaps works even better and scarier than telling a story from the main person's (in this case the Jamie Lee Curtis role) point of view. Also the character of Michael Myers is a reason why this movie is such a classic. He never says a word and his emotions are blank (also due to his mask of course, that we by the way rarely get to see in this movie). The movie doesn't try to explain his motivations which makes the movie all the more mysterious and creepy. It makes sure that you never know what to expect next from the killer. It makes Micheal Myers truly a classic horror character.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely helped by it's techniques and wonderful directing. The camera positions are all highly effective and help to create the right atmosphere and to build up the tension in some of the sequences. Also the classic musical score from John Carpenter himself, works highly effective.<br/><br/>""Friday the 13th"" had Kevin Bacon, ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" had Johnny Depp and ""Halloween"" has Jamie Lee Curtis as a star to be. Unlike the previous mentioned actors, Curtis never really got rid of her image as the scream queen and it doesn't seem she minds. Who can blame her, this is the role that made her famous and got her bigger and much more interesting roles. She is a great main character in this movie who is likable and recognizable as well. She isn't anything special, not the prettiest girl in school, not the bravest, borderline dorky. Point is, she is no heroic superhero character but a realistic and recognizable person instead. It makes it easier to identify yourself with and also the situations she gets in to. This in a way also directly adds to the tension of the movie. The still very young Curtis, in one of her first roles, is perfect in her role. Donald Pleasence is also present in the movie, which certainly adds something to the atmosphere and professionalism of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie might come across as outdated and clichÃ© filled to some but please keep in mind that this is the movie that started it all. This is the movie that raised the bar and set the standards for all the slasher movies and perhaps even also horror movies in general.<br/><br/>9/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Arlis","7","0","1","1 November 2006"," Not the first, not the best, but very good and very important to the horror genre.
","I guess I take pride in being a horror movie geek. I am obsessed with the genre and find something good in almost all horror. I prefer slashers and zombie films above all and admire the writing style of Dardano Sacchetti, Stephen King,and Dario Argento.<br/><br/>As far as directors go so many stand out as being faves. Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci, Umberto Lenzi, Sergio Leoni, Lamberto Bava, Clive Barker and Sam Raimi are just a few of the ones I admire most.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has always stood out to me and remained very high on my list as well. Many of his movies are favorites, but I think the majority of the people will agree that Halloween is definitely his masterpiece.<br/><br/>I love slashers and as a kid was forbidden to watch horror and when I first got my taste of slashers in the form of Jason Vorhees I became obsessed with him and still to this day I think he is the greatest.<br/><br/>As I got older and started trying to get a hold of every horror I could it didn't take me long to stumble across Michael Myers. Part 4 and 5 were the first ones I watched and I absolutely loved them, bloody and lots of killings and just your average slasher - which to me is a recipe that will never taste bad.<br/><br/>I finally got to see part 1 and I liked it a whole lot less than 4 and 5 , but I was young and I wanted a killer and I wanted blood and part 1 was not anything like that. I have never been scared by slasher movies, its the psychological aspect that would get me, but Halloween even left much to be desired there for me.<br/><br/>As I got older I gained a lot of respect for the movie and see it in a different light now that I am 30 years old and tonight is Halloween 2006 and I just finished watching it for Im guessing about the 15th time and I wanted to express my opinion about it.<br/><br/>I have to say several things about it and the bottom line of it all will result in me basically saying I do in fact love the movie. I understand how so many people praise it for being the first of many, but I disagree by saying it wasn't the first slasher. It wasn't the first movie about a man in a mask. It wasn't the first movie about a babysitter being stalked. It wasn't the first movie that had teenage sluts getting killed. It wasn't the first movie involving a kid being a killer. It wasn't the first movie that had a mental patient escape and seek revenge. It wasn't the first movie about killings on Halloween, it wasn't even the first horror movie called Halloween.<br/><br/>It Was the first however to combine all of those things and make the world take notice in an overwhelming way. The one thing all other movies lacked was personality. Halloween has John Carpenter and no one else had that. The direction was amazing, the editing was great the lighting was PERFECT and the technical things that make a movie work all seemed to be as real and in your face as the characters themselves.<br/><br/>The great Donald Pleasence in my opinion was what sold the movie, he was the only one famous or with any credit really when the movie was being promoted. Moustapha Akkad was not known yet, John Carpenter had done a few things but nothing that had gained him much attention at all and all the other actors were either newbies or nobodies. Pleasence was a legend by the time Halloween was offered to him and I am glad he kept doing the sequels until he died.<br/><br/>I do not like Jamie Lee Curtis and I think the role could've been so much better with someone else playing it, she still to this day acts as if she is responsible for the fame of the series but she is way off.<br/><br/>Michael Myers - wow, what can one say about him? The mask, the stare, the knife, the determination, the shape, the shadow - the Boogey Man! He will be part of our movie legends guild forever. I really think 100 years from now that he will still be remembered and that this series will still be on cable or computer chips in out brain or whatever technology has in store for us in the future, that is if the series isn't still being continued in Halloween part 74.<br/><br/>This movie made a lot of people want to see these types of movies, many movies were made to copy it and it spawned several sequels. The first of the movie with its image of a child killer all the way to the mysterious rantings of Dr. Loomis about a kid who is pure evil with the blackest of eyes, all the way to the last shot of a man shot 6 times only to disappear and let us know the boogeyman is still there - the fear is not over - you can't stop being scared or locking your doors at night, cause evil has came to your little town.<br/><br/>Watch this movie and keep horror alive - real horror!"
"hereminton","9","0","1","31 October 2006"," A great, and life changing movie for me
","I saw Halloween for the first time on Friday night, October 30, 1981 on NBC. I saw it again the following Sunday night, October 31, 1982, on NBC, and ever since then I have loved it, as it is my favorite horror movie, fourth favorite movie of all time. And it is, from these two showings, the movie that began my huge love and interest of movies (still going strong 25 years later). I thought it made great use of the Halloween theme (a holiday I've always loved), and incorporated it in this, and had a very creative, engrossing plot. And I thought it was extremely scary, as by the last 30 minutes of these two showings my ribs were really hurting! The music, screenplay, and direction by John Carpenter were all very good, as were the performances by the entire cast. And it moves along very good and briskly, from the 1963 opening, to the escape, to the Halloween action in Haddonfield, and this day seamlessly becomes night and dives right into the main part of the movie. And the ending is very scary, as well as exciting, and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll. Thus, a great horror movie, and a great time for me to write this review on it."
"bgoble_1000","10","0","1","31 October 2006"," You're not a TRUE horror fan until you've seen Halloween...
","OK, some people say it's just another teenage slasher flick...but let's think. Wasn't this the FIRST teenage slasher flick? No matter how plain-Jane you may say that this movie is, you know you wouldn't have any Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, or any of our other beloved horror movie series without it. This is what started the whole horror explosion of the 80's, people. This is THE classic slasher movie, and if you're into that sub-genre, you will be SO into this movie.<br/><br/>This was one of the first real horror movies I ever saw, I was excited about watching it because I had watched the original Texas chainsaw Massacre just the night before. In my opinion, Halloween was creepier and had more mystique about it than the Massacre. Of course, when I watched TCSM I was sleep deprived and slap-happy and thought the whole thing was a chuckle-fest. But the point I'm trying to get to here is that the raw simplicity of the movie is what makes it so creepy. All you know about Michael Myers is that he's an escaped psycho who killed his sister when he was young. You don't know if he has a house where he stores his victim's bones. You don't know if he's a cannibal. You don't know much about his family. you don't even know if he comprehends the English language. All you know is that he is a COLD. BLOODED. KILLER.<br/><br/>Myers has to be my favorite horror villain. Why, you ask? It's because he GETS UP. Laurie Strode stabs him with a knitting needle, and you think she killed the killer and the movie is over, but he SITS UP and STARTS STALKING HER AGAIN. She stabs him with a coat hanger, right in the eye, and then stabs him with his own knife and HE GETS UP AGAIN. He gets shot six times and falls off a balcony and GUESS WHAT! He SUVIVES, GETS UP, and DISSAPPEARS! <br/><br/>I also love the way he moves, stiff, purposeful, and intimidating. He never moves more than is absolutely necessary. He never flails or flinches. He never runs. How does he ALWAYS catch up to his running, screaming victims without running himself? I have no clue on that one.<br/><br/>Anyway, You get the idea. Halloween is just a GREAT movie. It is the total epiphany of Slasher movies, in my humble opinion. Just see it goodness' sake!"
"Townefam","10","0","1","30 October 2006"," Classic
","At a time when the horror genre was turning to more blood and gore, Halloween concentrated on just being a good scary movie. I don't recall a single scene that contained blood. However, the fear that each character was constantly being watched combined with ominous music (excellent work by John Carpenter with an eerie piano/organ combination) was enough to keep me on the edge of my seat throughout.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this horror classic, you're really missing out. Granted, by today's standards it may seem like just another slasher. But for it's time, it stands alone as one of the greatest horror movies ever."
"janemason100","10","0","1","29 October 2006"," Best Horror Film Ever!!
","This is the best horror film you will see. FACT. it is that type of horror film that will set the standards for any other horror films.<br/><br/>In my opinion John Carpenter got the tension and suspense just right because in the process he has created one iconic character in the form of the malevolent and psychopathic serial killers known only as Michael Myers. This film should be in every Film lover's D.V.D or video collection because you will not find a better horror movie that features a serial killer. Throughout the film the tension is always built up. However, throughout the film there is always a brooding atmosphere that is continually built up towards the final and scariest scene. Donald Pleasance is outstanding as Dr Loomis and in my opinion is as sinister as Michael Myers even though he is there to help our heroine. However, he and Michael Myers are my favourite characters in the film because they have more of an impact on me. I like the whole ""Heroine in Danger"" routine but I just do not think that you will find a better Rivalry in Horror films compared to that of Dr Loomis and Michael Myers. The idyllic setting of this film is even the more terrifying because it looks safe and the sun is always shining and it looks like a friendly neighbourhood that in my opinion is more scary than the film always taking place at night. Jamie Leigh Curtis is the best heroine who has ever been on film. none can surpass her as the greatest scream queen(in my opinion)not even Marian Crane from ""Psycho"" Michael Myers is the best serial killer in film because he is a lot more sinister and scary than Jason Voorhees. And he is still scary in all the films he has done compared to Freddy Krueger who just became a shadow of his former self. In my opinion Michael Myers is the better character because he, unlike many serial killers is motiveless and is a lot more terrifying than any of the other serial killers in horror films. In conclusion, I believe that ""Halloween"" is the best horror film because it is scary and terrifying and it is one of the most enjoyable films I have seen and I am proud to have this film on D.V.D."

","When I started to watch this I thought great I'm watching a real classic, unfortunately the movie doesn't really get going till halfway, all though I guess if you've watched clips, countless trailers and the ending it isn't going to be that exciting. But I feel great to have watched a classic like Halloween with out being scared all though nothing scares me. Anyway back to the point the movie kind of drags and the kills aren't that interesting they sound more like there having sex than being killed, if you're a horror fanatic watch this if you're more interested in blood and gore stick to scream. overall I found this kind of Disappointing compared to other movies I've watched"

","Halloween is still my all time favorite horror film- even with the advances in special effects in recent years. Why? Because it's terrifying WITHOUT all the flash and gore! What young girl HASN'T given thought to knife wielding psychos once or twice while babysitting on a cold dark and windy fall night? You can pass by all the sequels.. most of them weren't worth the film they were printed on as far as I'm concerned.. but the original is and always will be a classic. The music alone is enough to produce chills- I look forward to watching it every October and would like to read the book again at some point. Freddy, Jason and Pinhead all have their merits, but it's only Michael Myers who can truly instill fear during a fall daydream."

He escaped around Halloween which is the anniversary of the murder. Anyway, Jamie is wonderful and shows that she has inherited her parents' acting ability enough to become a star in her own right as well. I love Donald Pleasance as the psychiatrist.

The sequels following this movie are worth a watch or two, but the original, and Halloween II which i would say is up to the same standard and is also written by John Carpenter, are the best.

","Halloween is good because of its autumnal atmosphere, its small town setting, its fascinating killer, and its infectious and constantly cloned musical score. An autumnal atmosphere is great for a horror film because summer is not scary. Summer is a hot, sunny time when everyone's out playing soccer. A small town setting is great for a horror film because a big city has so many people in it that no matter what happens, it's not scary because the character is not alone in a claustrophobic place. Michael Myers is a fascinating character because of Donald Pleasance's intermittent monologues about him, the chilling voyeuristic shots where we see what he sees but with a slice of his silhouette on the side of the screen, and everything about this character that we slowly learn. He is truly the most interesting and well-developed slasher movie killer. The musical score is a pulsing, as I said, infectious piano that can never be imitated. Even The Exorcist's equally effective score with its similar use of the piano is much different in the moods it sets and portrays.<br/><br/>Halloween was the start of the slasher subgenre of horror films. It has these good qualities. However, that does not make it so much better than the others. It happens to be very very very corny, at times very implausible, and no better at directorial technique than Friday the 13th, or slashers hardly anyone's seen or even heard of anymore like Black Christmas or When A Stranger Calls.<br/><br/>The reason it's so well-received is because of the tremendous following that it started. People were truly scared by this new approach to horror, and it started the subgenre of slasher. Black Christmas, however, only 4 years earlier, made for a very creepy and unusual slasher-oriented approach, and flew below the radar. Halloween is a decent enough horror film, especially considering how dated it is, but it's very overrated and hogs the slasher spotlight."

What helps that is the brilliant direction of John Carpentar setting the story during the autumn season and even though horror is amidst; it is still looking to crisp and clear. The score which has also become infamous, along with fresh performances give moviegoers a treat they will never forget. The story follows Dr. Loomis whose patient Michael Myers has escaped.

However, ALIEN and SILENCE were both great movies in their own right, and so is HALLOWEEN. I think they can be forgiven for (at least partially) lifting their stories and style from previous works.<br/><br/>Enough has been written about HALLOWEEN. No need to go into the brilliant direction, editing or photography. It's a solid chiller that plays like a carnival funhouse from Hell, with some of the screen's all-time greatest scares waiting around every dark corner.<br/><br/>What a lot of people don't seem to notice or take into account is just how much of the horror is built into Carpenter's and late, great producer Debra Hill's screenplay. The story is deceptively simple. Kid kills his sister one Halloween in 1963. Fifteen years later he escapes from a mental hospital and returns to his hometown to wreak havoc on Halloween night.<br/><br/>It's easy to forget that in Carpenter's original movie NO MOTIVE is ever given for why Michael Meyers kills his sister, or, more importantly, why he targets Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) for his Halloween night rampage. It could be as simple as her having dropped a key off at the Meyers house, and him targeting her from there.<br/><br/>As subsequent entries in the series would put forth, Laurie is Michael's sister, and he has come back to kill her on the fifteenth anniversary of his other sister's murder. Now, this is just my opinion, but this plot contrivance takes away all of the mystery as to why Michael is stalking Laurie, and therefore makes it less scary. Why do we need an explanation for his actions? Is his being crazy, or, even worse, evil not enough of a reason? <br/><br/>My personal interpretation of HALLOWEEN is the following: Six year old Michael Meyers decides to play the ultimate Halloween trick, not only on his sister, but the whole town. He will kill her, and allow himself to be locked up in an asylum where he will sit in a catatonic state for fifteen years. Then, on Halloween night, he will escape and find some random girl, around his sister's age at the time of her murder, and put her (and the town of Haddonfield) through a night of terror. So determined is he to scare the living Hell out of the town, that he simply refuses to die, until his night of terror is over (presumably at midnight).<br/><br/>Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) delivers some of horror cinema's greatest and most atmospheric exposition, as he explains to Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) that somehow he always knew that Michael was evil incarnate, and was waiting for this night to finish his little Halloween scare on the town.<br/><br/>And that is Michael's motive: to scare. To scare Laurie, to scare Dr. Loomis, to scare Haddonfield. There is no family secret. He simply wants to haunt the dreams of the people of his little town forever. Because, as Dr. Loomis suspected all along, Michael IS The Boogeyman. This is also the reason why Michael chooses his infamous ""Shape"" mask: it's featureless, ghost-like appearance allows his victims, or even people who happen to see him, to project their own fears and nightmares onto him. He becomes their deepest darkest fears.<br/><br/>That, to me, is much scarier than him having a vendetta against his sister."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>When I commented on the Shining I said that that was the scariest movie I have ever seen. The heck with the Shining, the scariest movie is Halloween!! I mean, just the music alone is terrifying. That creepy piano music. The director John Carpenter composed it himself. P.J Soles's role was oddly like her role in Carrie. It is about a man who has been in a mental institution since he was six, and he broke out on the day before Halloween night. Then he went on a killing spree on babysitters. This was the first teen slasher film! Black Christmas was slasher, but it was college. P.J and Jamie Lee are good.

","John Carpenter's Halloween, is one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I was only 4 years old when I saw it on TNT, and still gets me jumping when I watch it, on a cold night.....You should really try to watch it in the dark. It really shivers your bones when watching the movie, alone especially.<br/><br/>The movies' plot: On a cold night on Halloween, 1963 in the small town of Haddonfield, IL. 6 year old Michael Myers murdered his 17 year old Judith Myers, after having sex with her boyfriend. Afterwards, young Michael was placed in Smith's Grove Sanitarium, awaiting trail until his 21st birthday, but for now is under the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis. 15 years later, on the night of Halloween Eve, 1978. Michael Myers escaped the sanitarium witnessed by Dr. Loomis. Only he knows where he's going, to his hometown Haddonfield for another night of terror in his hometown as he struck 15 years ago, and only Loomis knows what Michael is and that is truly the soul of evil. But what Loomis does not know is that Michael has returned to Haddonfield, only to finish off what's left and that is to kill his 17 year old sister, Laurie Strode. And as her evil brother, of whom she don't remember gets closer to killing her every second. Her only hope is Dr. Loomis, who tracked down Michael Myers down. But little do they know is that nothing this sinister and evil can die that easily.<br/><br/>The success of Halloween has spawned over 7 sequels in the next three decades....<br/><br/>-Halloween II (1981) -Halloween III Season of the Witch (1982) -Halloween 4 The Return of Michael Myers (1988) -Halloween 5 The Revenge of Michael Myers (1989) -Halloween The Curse of Michael Myers (1995) -Halloween H20 Twenty Years Later (1998) -Halloween Resurrection (2002) -and hopefully not lastly an upcoming remake by Rob Zombie, to be released by Halloween 2007.<br/><br/>Although none of the sequels ever had the touching feeling what the original had, they are still fun and scary to watch anyway. Halloween is a true American horror classic, that is still carried on by fans of generations and will keep on coming."

","What is it that is so terrifying about Michael Myers? Is it the blank white mask, the black bottomless eyes, the relentless killings? Or is it something more...Pure Evil.<br/><br/>Considering myself a horror film aficionado, I always try to think of what makes a classic horror film like John Carpenter's Halloween Movie so mind bogglingly (think I just made up a word there...) scary. I think it is the simplicity of it all that does it for me.<br/><br/>There is not much in the way of blood, guts or gore in Halloween, but you are terrified of Michael none the less. The sight (or even the threat of the sight) of Michael brings chills down your spine. The musical score in and of itself was genius. Not to mention the opening scenes where you see the world through the eyes of a maniacal six year old killer on the night he begins his reign of terror.<br/><br/>For Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance), this night begins his lifelong obsession with Michael Myers. What was it he said? I'll paraphrase: "" I spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven trying to make sure that he never gets out, because what I saw behind those eyes was pure evil."" He should have tried harder...<br/><br/>And what about poor little Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) minding her own business just going to school and babysitting. She had no clue what she was in for. Her friends Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Kyes) thought they would have a fun night only to find that Michael has other plans for them.<br/><br/>It's easy to see why Michael is obsessed with the town of Haddonfield. After all, this is where he began all those years ago by killing his sister on Halloween night. But why is Michael so obsessed with Laurie? To find out, you may have to watch a sequel. Greatest Horror Film of All-Time in my eyes. And no other killer comes close too Michael Myers. (Jason Is a honorable Mention) All in all , This is One of the greatest Horror Films of this Century. Just pure Classic. Great camera angels , giving it a more scarier look. A Legend was born in Michael Myers. If you are a fan of horror and you don't own this Movie. You should be ashamed of yourself , And go GET IT."

","The first Halloween was by far the best ""slasher film"" ever made in my humble opinion. It terms of the acting and screen play, the movie was way ahead of it's time, regarding other horror flicks and 25 years later, still has the power to scare.<br/><br/>Unlike other ""slasher"" films, Halloween did not rely on ""cheap scares"" like gore and piles and piles of dismembered bodies.

"freaky_dave","10","0","1","23 July 2006"," The father of all slasher movies that include an unstoppable killer
","What else can I say about John Carpenter's Halloween that hasn't been said before. Let's give it a go. Halloween is perhaps the best of all the slasher horror films that gives us the unkillable menace. John Carpenter works his magic by using point of view shots, spooky locations, atmosphere, lighting and darkness, a fantastic musical score and panning camera shots to give us the scariest but not goriest of all films of this kind. Halloween is far superior to the Friday the 13th movies which imitated it. Sean Cunningham does not have Carpenter's skill and went the cheap route by using more gore with Friday the 13th instead. This brings me to the point that gore itself does not make a great horror movie but suspense included with the occasional gory scene does.<br/><br/>Back in 1963 on Halloween night a young six-year-old Michael Myers kills his sister after she has sex with her boyfriend. Cut to 15 years later on the night before Halloween 1978, Michael Myers escapes from the institution where he has been kept and returns to Haddonfield on Halloween to continue his murderous rampage on three unsuspecting teenagers who are babysitting for the night. One of the babysitters is of course Jamie Lee Curtis in her first role. Her name in the movie is Laurie Strode.<br/><br/>Hot on Michael Myers tail is his doctor Sam Loomis, (Donald Pleasance in his most famous role) who wants to find him and return him to the institution before he kills again. Containing some of Donald Pleasance's most famous lines of dialog, Sam Loomis explains to the police, who are working with him to find Michael Myers, why he has to be found and returned.<br/><br/>In this movie, Michael Myers is known as the shape. This of course is the perfect description for what Michael Myers really is, a specter of evil that is unable to be stopped because, as John Carpenter said in one conversation about the movie, you can't destroy evil. This is actually a great explanation because Michael Myers seems to appear out of nowhere like an evil phantom, kills, and then appears elsewhere to create more carnage. He does all of this while wearing a white William Shatner mask that is itself ghostly in appearance.<br/><br/>Now to explain some of the technique Carpenter used to make one of the best and most famous slasher movies of all time. Using washed out colors for daylight and deep in-penetrable blackness for night, this adds to the spooky atmosphere of Halloween, making it look like fall even though I believe this movie's setting was done in California in the summertime. Other things used include panning camera shots which have things loom up in front of you almost out of nowhere. Sometimes it is a tree or some other distraction, but than sometimes it is the killer himself, usually the point of view shot when the killer is involved is from the back of his head and over to the left or right. This all adds to making the viewer uncomfortable, and that is the idea. And if all that wasn't enough, who can forget the fantastic musical score which is one of the most famous horror musical scores of all time along with Psycho's.<br/><br/>Man I could go on and on about this movie. If anybody is ever a student of film and wants to do a paper on a slasher movie, Halloween would be a great movie to do it on. I'm surprised however that this movie is only rated a 7.8 on IMDP's score. It is a much better film than that. I know that the acting isn''t that great, but is is still better than the acting in the countless imitations that were spawned by it."

It will actually scare you, not gross you out with the vision of some guy getting his organs torn out and thrown about. <br/><br/>Jamie Lee is great in this movie, in fact all the actors are. The set up is more, believable. Its not that kind of movie were you say. ""Of course that was gonna happen.""<br/><br/>The only thing that is like that is when Jamie drops the knife...twice.

"theshadow908","8","0","1","16 May 2006"," The Greatest of It's Genre.
","Halloween is considered by most to be an insanely popular slasher flick that started the slasher craze. But can we really call this movie a slasher flick? To me, it's more of a psychological thriller. Halloween tells the story of a six year old boy named Michael Myers who, for no explainable reason, killed his 17 year old sister Judith. He is locked up in a mental institution for 15 years, and on the night of October 30th, 1978, he escapes to his home town with his psychiatrist on his trail. Halloween has been given the credit of starting many of the typical slasher movie devices, such as the drunken/promiscuous teens die first while the innocent virgin lives to tell the tale, point of view shots accompanied by heavy breathing, not-so-intelligent victims tripping and falling while trying to escape, etc. Of course, we must give credit where credit is due...Many of these techniques were taken from Bob Clarke's 1974 slasher Black Christmas.<br/><br/>The reason that I say Halloween isn't really a slasher flick is because there are only 5 murders in the movie, which isn't particularly high for a slasher movie. Halloween spends most of its time cleverly building the suspense until the climax. Michael Myers mostly appears throughout the film as a shadow in the distance, or we only see a shoulder or his hands. John Carpenter makes use of several interesting camera angles to effectively creep out the viewers. John Carpenter's chilling score is what makes the film. Without the music, the movie wouldn't be as good as it is.<br/><br/>What I really enjoy about Halloween is that it has a Halloweeny feel to it. When you watch it, no matter what time of year, you always get this feeling of fall weather and the Halloween season. Halloween is truly a classic in the horror genre, and anyone that favours the horror films of today over this movie don't know art at all.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","This has to be one of the best slasher films that exists. It is very simple yet effective, and doesn't need gore to make it worth watching. Everything seems flawless. The musical score has to be one of the best I've heard, and stands up to the music of many great Italian slasher films. The pacing is perfect and tension is built up at just the right pace. The creepiness of Michael Myers is unnerving and the suspense as he stalks Laurie will have you on the edge of your seat. There have been tons of slasher films made since this trying to cash-in on the ""Halloween phenomenon"", but very few have been so effective. Be sure to watch the very underrated Halloween 2 if you loved this, but skip the rest of the series as it spoils the integrity of the first two. <br/><br/>10/10."

Aside from Jason and Freddy, Michael Meyers is one of the most well-known horror icons in the world.

That would make a great topic of discussion for this film, John Carpenter's ""Halloween,"" because the viewer should know that in watching this film, you are really watching the birth of a sub-genre- something that doesn't happen every day.<br/><br/>True, prior to Halloween there were foray's into the depraved and violent. Films like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Black Christmas"" also introduced us to the concept of the psychopath, and how he can function so effectively in a malevolent fashion prior to ""Halloween."" However ""Halloween"" dons the role of father of the slasher sub-genre because it was Halloween, and not ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" ""Last House on the Left"" or ""Black Christmas"" that a myriad of filmmakers tried without success to duplicate.<br/><br/>The genius of Halloween is the simplicity of its story, and the intensity of its madman. The story is about three girlfriends who, during a night of babysitting, are ruthlessly attacked and dispatched by a masked maniac who seems to be driven to his impulse to kill without provocation or logic.<br/><br/>If people find modern movies like ""Hostel,"" ""High Tension"" or ""Wolf Creek"" to be tense and frightening, how then will they react to this film. One of the girls, Annie, has but to turn around whilst she's on the phone and she will come face to face with the masked monster- yet she doesn't in time to see him.<br/><br/>Linda does come face to face with the monster, but only when he's covered over with a sheet in a crude mocking imitation of her boyfriend, who the masked killer had dispatched earlier. In the course of the next few minutes, she too is dispatched in a cold and calculating way by the monster.<br/><br/>The monster of course is Michael Myers, however I prefer the logic of calling him ""The Shape"" because there is no emotion or urgency that surrounds him. He is like a zombie in his movements and expressions, yet violently efficient in his actions- so much so that we get the real sense of what it would feel like to be stalked, yet without the understanding of why the monster feels compelled to stalk.<br/><br/>Ultimately in the final scene, the virtuous and shy Laurie (played by Jamie Lee Curtis in a truly all-American girl next door kind of performance) squares off with the Shape, sacrificing herself so that her charges (the children she is babysitting) can escape and call for help.<br/><br/>Along the way, the movie is full of valid indictments about our vary lives which are still true right up to this day: the passive neighbors who refuse to help Laurie when she is pursued by the Shape; the expert who is ignored by the establishment that is committed to its procedures; the absolute need to scapegoat. Perhaps it is this relevance to our own lives that makes Halloween so terrifying.<br/><br/>Either way, if you're one of the few who has not seen this film yet, might I recommend you give it a peak. You won't be sorry...unless you have an aversion to very scary films!"
"Maidenmayhem23","10","0","1","11 February 2006"," Not only the scariest, but the best movie ever made...
","I was 9 years old the first time I saw John Carpenters masterpiece Halloween and at the time, I had NEVER heard of Michael Myers, I was a Jason Vorhees fan. Now fast forward, I am now 16 with about 4 Michael posters in my room and already have reserved tickets to see Halloween 9 when it comes out. And it all started with this movie. Halloween was a movie made in 1978, with a low budget, a slim $300,000, and a lot of heart. At the time, Tpbe Hooper had delivered Texas Chainsaw Massacre which had already terrified so many audiences across America, and no it was Carpenters turn. With little experience, and little money Carpenter used a creepy tune, a simple story-line, and a scary William Shatner mask to create the scariest film in history, This movie still scares me today and deserves much more than it is given. The scene where Michael puts the bedsheet over himself to fool PJ Soles's character and then strangled her with the phone wire was quite possibly the 3rd scariest moment in the history of movie cinema. Carpenter is very simple with this movie, with the amount of money he could not create the long chase scenes with a lot of gore that soon became famous. Instead he makes Michael seem more of a stalker than a killer, and then proceeds with the one-by-one approach as Michael slowly takes away all of Laurie Strode's(Jamie Lee Curtis) help and escape possibilities. Michaels old phyciatrist Dr. Loomis(Donald PLeasence) arrives in Haddonfeild to make sure Michael does not cause any carnage and tried to capture him. Michael successfully eludes Loomis and makes his way to Laurie. Michael attacks her not only physically, but also mentally as he plants the bodies of her dead friends and causes her to freak out. Laurie continuously hits Michael back but can never seem to permanently kill him. The closet scene where all seemed lost for our young heroin is, in my opinion, the most frightening movie moment ever. The last scene will make you r heart stop beating, I guarantee it.<br/><br/>All in all, Halloween is a classic, a legend at his best. This movie is yet to be topped and I doubt it will ever be topped. I will leave you with a few last words...<br/><br/>The Boogeyman is coming!"
"Bandit1974","10","0","1","29 January 2006"," The Original ""Slasher"" Flick That Isn't A ""Slasher"" Flick
","There are a few movies credited with starting the slasher flick genre. Some claim that it was Psycho. Others feel that The Texas Chainsaw Masacre was responsible for starting one of the most hated film genres of all time. Most would agree that it was the movie Halloween that started it all. Halloween became the template for all of the slasher crap of the 80's. Not until Scream came along in the mid 90's would you see a fresh take on this genre.<br/><br/>All that being said, Halloween really ISN'T a slasher flick. Slasher flicks tend to satisfy (or dissatisfy, depending on who you are) the same type of person that prefers a gross out comedy over a more intelligent comedy. Slasher flicks rely on making movie goers squirm in their seats by showing them blood, guts and gore. Something Halloween lacks completely. Director John Carpenter approached the film the same way Hitchcock would have. Less is more. The less you show an audience in a horror film the more scared they are bound to become. Peoples imaginations tend to run wild when they aren't spoon fed all the details. People will walk away from a movie like Halloween thinking they saw things that they really didn't see.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is as simple as it gets. An escaped mental patient (Michael Myers) returns to his home town to continue the killing spree that started with his sister when he was a young boy. Laurie Strode is his main target/obsession (watch Halloween II to find out why).<br/><br/>Carpenter succeeds in scaring the living hell out of viewers by dwelling on our most basic fears. Those things that lurk in the shadows. Things that go bump in the night. That house in every neighborhood across America that children warn each other to stay away from (usually because of some false urban legend). For the most part the movie is a ghost story told just as a master story teller would tell it to a group of people sitting around a camp fire.<br/><br/>This movie was made to be viewed in the dark and I encourage you to try doing so alone. All of the sudden your own home becomes a bit too spooky. That long dark hallway seems longer and darker. You will undoubtedly hear noises in your home you've never heard before.<br/><br/>In addition to top notch directing, John Carpenter also contributed an unforgettably chilling score. As the story goes the movie was originally tested without the score and tested poorly. It wasn't until the addition of Carpenter's basic, yet spooky piano work that audiences felt the full impact of this horror masterpiece.<br/><br/>Up until The Blair Witch Project Halloween was the most successful independent movie of all time. Studios didn't believe in it, but movie goers loved it. It's ironic how that works. Studios don't believe in something as powerful as Halloween, but after witnessing its enormous success begin churning out senseless copy cat versions that aren't anywhere near as good.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen Halloween, I highly recommend it. That is if you're ready to know what it really feels like to be scared."
"goochusa","10","0","1","4 January 2006"," A Classic
","One of the most memorable films of all time and a true example of how independent film making can sometimes breed something special. Halloween presents the story of one Michael Myers and his stalking of a trio of babysitters on Halloween night. Starring Donald Pleasance in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis (named after a John Carpenter favorite: Psycho) he gives a memorable performance which would carry on through an army of sequels that were all made better for his participation. John Capenter made this film just after the run of his first successful film, Assault on Precinct 13. Together, he and Irwin Yablanz coaxed Moustapha Akkad (God bless) into funding the $300,000 low budget thriller. Even at this early point in his career there are many camera tricks and shooting elements that he's carried with him throughout his entire career. Most notable may be his tribute to the classic Touch of Evil at the beginning of the film with his wide pullout camera shot as young Michael if unmasked (one of three times in the whole series) after stabbing his older sister. Also making her motion picture debut in this film is Jamie Lee Curtis. Originally, she was only cast in the film because her mother starred in one of Carpenter's favorite films, Psycho. But, not long after Carpenter and the rest of the world would see that Curtis could make a name for herself without having to rely on her family pedigree. Curtis would later go on to star in what some call a ""horror trio"" (Halloween, Terror Train, and Halloween 2) before moving on other projects. Many times we hear about a film being ""cursed"" and misfortune befalling the cast and crew, however this film seems to be the exact opposite. Everyone involved with Halloween benefited from it. John Carpenter went on to be one of the most famous directors of all time, Donald Pleasance revitalized his career here in America, Jamie Lee Curtis was given a career, and we were blessed with a classic film."

","I love all of the Halloweens but the first is my favorite. It is a classic! It is also one of the few that doesn't actually get too gory so even young teens can watch and get a good old fashioned scare. Michael Myers has to be one of THE SCARIEST figures around and to this day he still scares me to pieces! I have seen many horror movies but this one takes the cake as far as spooky goes. Jaime Lee Curtis stars and she is a gem! You couldn't ask for a more convincing role. I wish John Carpenter would go for remake though it would be hard to beat the original one. Every year I play the theme music at my parties to get everyone in a good frame of spooked mind!"
"ahrabak","10","0","1","21 November 2005"," one of the greatest horror movies of all time
","This movie is, in my opinion one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It's a psychological thriller that's as relevant today as it was the year it came out. Halloween was superbly acted and written. The plot line was well thought out and kept it's viewers interested. The characters were well developed and after viewing the film, one would think that they were in fact real people. Halloween is the horror film that all of the other horror films emulate and try to be like. Those that enjoy this movie, should definitely see Halloween 2 which picks up right where this movie left off. They should also see Halloween H20, which takes place thirty years after the original came out. Fans of the original should also see all of the movies that come in between except Halloween 3. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence give wonderful performances to be enjoyed by all. Halloween is definitely a must see for any horror movie enthusiast."

","I've seen Halloween several times and it is certainly better than any of the sequels that followed. This turned out to be a massive hit despite being made on a low budget.<br/><br/>It starts with 6 year Michael Myers stabbing his sister to death and then 15 years later, he escapes from the asylum where he was locked up and returns to Haddonfield to kill more people but his first victim is a mechanic, stabbed on the way. His Doctor, Sam Loomis is in pursuit. When Myers returns to Haddonfield, he first stalks possible victims and has a run in with a young boy at school. When darkness descends, he starts his killing spree, his first victim actually being a dog. He then stabs to death three people baby sitting, two girls and one of their boyfriends and tries to murder Laurie Strode, but Loomis shoots him in time, despite Laurie stabbing him with a knitting needle and a coat hanger. Despite having several bullets into him, Myers has gone... But we all know he will be back.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the best horror movies in recent times and is very spooky throughout, helped by that now famous music score.<br/><br/>The children who Laurie is baby sitting are watching two 1950's sci-fi's: The Thing From Another World and Forbbidon Planet which makes this even more spooky.<br/><br/>Now to the cast: this made Jamie Lee Curtis a star and she is joined by the excellent and creepy Donald Pleasence as Loomis and Charles Cyphers and P J Soles.<br/><br/>Horror movies don't come much better than this. Brilliant.<br/><br/>Rating: 5 stars out of 5."

","OMG!!! This has to be the most scariest movie I have ever seen in my whole entire life! In 1998 I went to see my first 'Halloween' movie which was Halloween h20 and it scared me pretty bad, and about a week later I brought the original Halloween in a Wal*Mart store and I was scared to death. The music in the film itself is terrifying the music helps set the mood for the film. I was scared to turn off the light to go to sleep b/c the only thing that ran through my mind was Michael Myers.<br/><br/>To anyone who wants to get to know the Halloween films, this is definitely the right one for you to see before any of the other 7.

","""Halloween,"" the classic bogeyman thriller directed by John Carpenter, still has the ability to play on the fears of babysitters and children 20 plus years since it was first released.<br/><br/>When the film starts, we see a young girl being stabbed to death by someone in a clown mask just after she had sex with her boyfriend on Halloween night. We soon learn that the murderer was 6 year old Michael Myers, her own brother. Years later, Michael escapes from the mental institution where he was being held and heads back to his hometown of Haddonfield, Illinois. Wearing a mask (Actually a altered William Shatner mask), Michael is on a new mission to kill and terrorize his hometown. On his maniacal radar is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), who is babysitting 2 kids that night while her 2 friends (Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles)have dates. Her two friends end up dead, and Michael is on the hunt for Laurie. But Michael's doctor, Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence)is on the hunt for him, knowing Michael for the monster he really is.<br/><br/>Everything in this film works. All the performances are spectacular, especially Curtis, whose portrayal of Laurie got the crown of ""Scream Queen"", and Pleasence as Loomis (A play on a character in ""Psycho,"" which starred her mother, Janet Leigh). But it is Michael in the William Shatner mask that makes the deeper impression."
"StanleyStrangelove","Null","0","2","9 August 2005"," Classic slasher film with cute Jamie Lee Curtis
","Halloween is the slasher movie that spawned a slew of sequels, imitators (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street) and their sequels. Tame by today's standards, it's still interesting and suspenseful. It was John Carpenter's first success and launched Jamie Lee Curtis's career. <br/><br/>A very young Jamie Lee Curtis (as Laurie Strode) in her first role. She screams and cowers a little too much, but in the end she makes a good heroine. Her girlfriends, Nancy Kyes and P.J.Soles are appealing. Donald Pleasance (Dr. Samuel Loomis) is always Donald Pleasance and he's a staple in Carpenter's films. <br/><br/>Ultra-low budget but Carpenter once again shows that be knows how to make his films look like they have a larger budget than they really do. <br/><br/>The music written by Carpenter is perfect and very effective. <br/><br/>The first scene is very interesting and tells you everything you need to know about young Michael Myers and what he will turn in to. The cat and mouse scenes as Michael Myers stalks Jamie Lee and her girlfriends are good. <br/><br/>A classic horror film that despite it's shortcomings is very effective. A must for fans of horror and John Carpenter."
"Noirdame79","10","0","1","31 July 2005"," A Roller-Coaster Ride of Scares
","I think the fact that this movie has 70 pages of user comments speaks volumes of the film's impact, which resonates today. It doesn't matter how many times you've seen it, it loses none of its power to make you scream, and keep you on the edge of your seat. While made on a relatively low budget, it really enhances the creepy quality of the production.<br/><br/>The story of a small town rocked by a young boy's crime of murdering his teenage sister, his subsequent placement in a psychiatric institution, and his escape fifteen years later, on Halloween, the anniversary of his crime. Only his psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis (the late Donald Pleasance) realizes how dangerous he is, and where he's headed, back to good old Haddonfield, Illinois.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis, as the teenage Laurie Strode, seemingly always dateless compared to her more sexually aggressive friends, Annie Brackett (Nancy Loomis), the daughter of the local sheriff, and Lynda (P.J. Soles), is prototype of the strong, good girl heroines that would later dominate the horror film genre. She ends up doing her usual babysitting, unaware that the psychotic killer is lurking in the neighborhood, voyeuristically peeking at her and her friends. He stalks the girls one by one, with Laurie as his last target. <br/><br/>The musical score adds to the atmosphere considerably, subtly creepy, as the infamous Michael Myers closes in on his prey. The fact that it is a small, isolated community with an ill-equipped police force only increases the viewer's dread, as the effect is almost claustrophobic.<br/><br/>And I loved hearing the classic 70s song, ""Don't Fear The Reaper"" by Blue Oyster Cult as Annie and Laurie head off to their babysitting jobs. <br/><br/>Everything about this film is excellent: the acting, direction, sets, music, choreography, costumes, hairstyles, architecture, dialogue, pace . . . . .<br/><br/>And it's nowhere near as violent and bloody as its reputation. Bar the windows, lock the doors, turn off the lights, and keep someone to cuddle with nearby - you'll need that."

In movies previous, and since, usually the female victim of the mindless killer just screams and lies there, waiting to be killed. Laurie did not. She ran. She poked the Myers character in the neck with a knitting needle. She poked him in the eye with the hanger (especially good ""thinking on your feet"" action). I.E., she DIDN'T GIVE UP!

Unlike today where filmmakers choose to make slasher films gory, unwatchable and containing actors(usually hot bodies actors whose faces appear on the daily soaps or on the cover of teen magazines) who just CAN'T act. Halloween is a totally other story containing almost no blood, and mostly no name actors it makes you think and imagine, ""is this really happening?""! I sware like many, after watching this movie that I have turned around once or twice in shock that Michael Myers was stalking me and ready to attack! And unlike many horror movies today, Halloween uses it's sounds and musics to let out its emotions and let us feel the emotions of the characters. Who could ever forget the moment Laurie first encounters Michael and is sent plummeting over an upstairs balcony of spindles only to start the beat....the music that got everyone's heart racing as she tries to run across the street to safety as Michel slowly chased after her. Watch and you'll see, Halloween is not only a movie it's an experience. An experience that will let out all your fears and make you want to think twice before turning off the lights! Enjoy!"

His choice in actors and actresses was brilliant most of them no namers and they did an excellent job. The storyline was excellent i love this movie it is my favorite of all time. The theme is infamous to all of the movies even though they messed with it some. The 25th anniversary edition has a lot of great information. The Myers house was good when Dr. Loomis and the Sheriff gets there it's good. Does anybody out there like this movie as much as me.

"autumntwilight78","10","0","1","15 June 2005"," The perfect horror movie
","John Carpenter's 1978 classic is quite possibly the most perfectly crafted horror movie of all time. An evolutionary eating machine, this movie glides along like the shark from Jaws. The plot is simple: An escaped mental patient who murdered his sister when he was six years old returns to his hometown and stalks a teen babysitter and her friends on Halloween night. Mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>The film relies on a sense of creeping dread to disturb and unnerve the audience in a for the first three quarters of the film before embarking on a sudden and thrilling descent into terror. The slow burn tempo of most of the film may seem a bit too wordy for todays MTV audience, accustomed to quick-cut editing and pyrotechnic special effects. But the contrast in flow is exactly what makes the sudden attacks of the killer so much more jarring.<br/><br/>On a specific level, the movie works because of John Carpenter's total mastery of suspense concepts. Alfred Hitchcock was obviously a big influence, as well as some Italian directors like Dario Argento I believe. Dean Cundey's cinematography is fantastic. His use of shadows, and ability to make you focus on one part of the screen while subliminal action takes place in another, is key to the movies effectiveness. And John Carpenter's immortal score goes almost without mentioning, it's influence is engrained in our very pop culture. <br/><br/>The film also works in large part because of it's vague nature. It takes place in any-town USA, basically. The protagonist is meant to be as vulnerable and normal a girl as you can imagine. Even the killer's mask was meant to look like dime-store cheap-o, that theoretically hundreds of people could be wearing; and especially on Halloween (which, incidentally used to be a holiday of some importance..). It's the kind of situation, that with the stars aligned just right, could conceivably happen.<br/><br/>The film taps into our inner fears about reality, fate, and our own mortality. It can hit a nerve with anyone, of any age, living anywhere in the world. And it is still unmatched in it's ability to give you that uneasy feeling of seemingly irrational fear, as you watch it all alone, on a dark and stormy night."

","This movie is a horror masterpiece. I liked watching it very much. The really nice thing about this movie is that it depends to a great extent on suspense rather than gore especially in the first 60 minutes. The theme is perfect and has been imitated many times. The screenplay is good and is in fact one of the few horror screenplays that respects the viewer in the sense that it's tight and follows logical sequences into a climax. It's one of the few horror movies that can really bring about some chills across one's spine. The music is fantastic and adds even more suspense to the movie. In my opinion, this is the best part in all of the Halloween sequels. It isn't an ordinary horror flick, it's a must see for any horror movies fan ."

","Director:John Carpenter, Script: John Carpenter and Debra Hill, Cast: Donald Pleasence, Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Kyes(Loomis), P.J. Soles.<br/><br/>There isn't much I can say about this film that hasn't already been said. It's influence on the horror and slasher genre had been overwhelming. This is a little off the subject but I will get to the point soon. I am a record collector and rock collectors often use the term ""pre"" or ""post"" Beetle to distinguish between groups that came before or after the Beetles. While, the same can be said about the film Psycho. I use the term pre-Psycho and post-Psycho to categorize horror movies because the horror genre changed so much after Psycho. OK to get to the point, Halloween is my favorite post-Psycho horror movie. It is one of the giants of the post-Psycho movies. The others are The Haunting(probably the best horror movie of all time), the ground breaking Night of the Living Dead by George Romero, Polanski's Rosemary's Baby, Bob Clark's Black Christmas and Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. <br/><br/>Like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween has a reputation for being worse than it actually is in terms of gore and graphic violence. Like all great horror movies, it is the atmosphere and sense of doom that makes it so dam scary! They went over budget on this film to pay Donald Pleasence and he almost didn't take the part of Dr. Sam Loomis (it was already turned down by Christopher Lee). Irronically, of all the movies Pleasence was involved with this was probably the one he was most known for and he ended up doing all the sequels up until his death. Come on people can you really imagine another Sam Loomis besides Pleasence-I think not!<br/><br/>John Carpenter is a director with a very big following. Some of his other great movies are Escape from New York, The Thing(The thing from another World)remake and a great one at that and The Fog. Before Halloween he did Assault on Precint 13, which was recently remade, and Dark Star."

","This is and forever shall be the greatest horror movie ever. The greatest part about it is that it doesn't try to use a whole bunch of blood and gore to make it a scary movie. Instead, it relies on chilling music and suspense.<br/><br/>The movie is about a 5 year-old Michael Meyers who was put in an insane asylum for killing his sister on Halloween night in the little town of Haddonfield Illinois. 15 years later, he escapes, heads to Haddonfield, and starts stalking teenager Laurie Strode and her two friends. Dr. Sam Loomis is on Michaels trail because he seems to be the only one to believe that ""what's behind that boys eyes is simply and purely evil."" I first saw this movie when I was 8 and it scared the hell out of me. I had watched this movie one night and Friday the 13th the next night and Halloween was without a doubt the better one. Don't get me wrong, Friday the 13th was a great movie but this one was better. John Carpenter did a brilliant job directing it and writing the music for the movie. The acting by Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasance and the rest of the cast was also great. After the original, the Halloween movies started going downhill and started joining the clichÃ©d horror movies of the eighties, which felt they had to rely on blood and gore to have a good horror movie. Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 are the only sequels to be somewhat as good as the original but even they are nearly close to being as good as the first one. This is, and probably always will be my the greatest horror movie ever"

","As one person said before and that was ""This is the grandaddy of horror movies"" and that person was right on!! John Carpenters Halloween has always been a favorite of mine and every time I watch it it scares the hell out of me.<br/><br/>In this movie Micheal Myers is just not another slasher out for blood like Jason or Freddy or the countless other imitators. No he has a purpose and that purpose is to iradicate his entire family and anyone who associates with them. And the only one who can stop him? Dr. Loomis but even the great doctor fails at this at times.<br/><br/>The Movie: What can be said about this classic that already hasn't been said. This horror classic has stood the test of time and its popularity continues to grow even though the sequels are at times down right awful. John Carpenter made this movie to scare the crap out of you, not for gore and endless blood. He achieved this without question. The imitators that have followed don't have the same feel or originality like Halloween even though they have tried.<br/><br/>In closing: You want to see a good scary movie? Look no further then Halloween which is THE classic to which all other horror movies should be judged and they have not even come close. I have yet to see a horror movie match it and probably never will.<br/><br/>Steve"
"milleenbogger","10","0","1","19 May 2005"," Classic example of a really scary horror movie
","PLEASE DON'T AGNORE THIS COS ITS LONG - IF YOU ARE PASSIONATE ABOUT HALLOWEEN YOU WILL FIND IT WORTHWHILE. When i first saw this film i was about 12 and was absolutely terrified of it. I mean, for months i kept imagining being following while walking in the dark (also cos i live in the country)and other things would freak me out also. But since i have seen it about 9 times (i'm 15 by the way) and it is still my favorite horror film. Why? Because mainly its a more believable story than most horror movie stories e.g Nightmare on Elm St. (though i think thats great too) Because it makes you think ""this is actually realistic and could actually happen in real life"". Because (and this is talking bout Halloween 1 now) it didn't try those cheap attempts at humor like other horror movies. Also i have to mention the classic soundtrack - so simple, so spooky so brilliant. And staying with the sounds, there was also great sound effects (the sudden ones that make you jump. The actors are great too. Jamie Lee Curtis and all the rest. And we respect them more because we didn't know them before this film and we got to see them in their best roles. Unlike Halloween Resurrection which stars Busta Rhymes - who i hate with a passion, but i wont go into that now (maybe i'll comment on it) And Halloween H:20 with Josh Hartnett and that one form Dawson's creek. Also the movies great storyline (it makes full sense when you see as far a Halloween 6) Me + my friends even had a Halloween Marathon (including Halloween 3-which i enjoyed), which took 10 hours and we watched every single one, now matter how painful watching Resurrection was, no matter how long the 4th one seemed, no matter how crappy the quality and hard to watch the 6th one was at 7 o' clock in the morning.<br/><br/>In conclusion this is THE BEST HORROR MOVIE - EVER (despite the bad sequels - Halloween 2, Resurrection) Michael Myers rocks too and is the best movie killer ever."
"neon47","10","0","1","16 May 2005"," Michael Meyers is the greatest slasher.
","I don't rate this one according to today's standards, if that were so then this would be just barley above Jeepers Creepers. Halloween was original for its time, before the 10 million Halloween rip offs like Friday the 13th. As said the first 10mins of a movie are the most important and Halloween lets us know that from the very beginning. Michael kills his older sister and shortly after is caught by his parents and sent off to a psycho-ward. Fifteen years later he returns on the night of Halloween. I almost saw H20 first but decided to wait on that. Instead I rented this to see the roots of the then long line of Halloween movies. I was intoxicated after the first view and immediately had to see the second Halloween. Michael Meyers is the greatest slasher of all time. In my book he was the first, although it could be argued that Norman Bates was the first. Halloween has a very original feel right from the beginning all the way to the end. See it if you're a fan of horror and slasher films. The mystery behind it is well thought out and played out."

Michael Myers is the killer who is out to kill Jamie Lee Curtis who plays Laurie Strode, Michaels sister. The thing that really got to me in this movie is Michaels character, he is so stealthy and creepy its brilliant, and he wears a pale white mask, which is deeply creepy. Donald Pleasence is great at playing Dr. Loomis Michael's doctor, and i loved the part where Dr. Loomis refers Michael to something else rather than a human, totally blew me away. this is a must see slasher!!"
"webnutt","10","0","1","31 March 2005"," A true example of horror
","Horror isn't defined by gore and body counts but by simple thematic elements that effectively creates the sense of suspense and terror. ""The Shape"" aka Michael Myers does exactly that. Filmed for pennies by todays standards, this film shocked countless movies goers and for those who understand what horror is, it continues to do so. Halloween, using a bleached ghostly white mask of William Shatner's face, overalls, a butcher knife and a simple combination of piano keys to make a musical theme gave a new definition to what it meant to be terrified. Instead of going for outright shock in ferocity, the viewer is constantly tortured by subtle flashes of the killer standing in the foreground and background as if he is staring right through the movie or TV screen at you. You here his menacing breathing. You look through his eyes as he commits his first murder which was his own sister. By the time Michael Myers is fully exposed you find yourself in the place of the victim running for your own life. What makes the movie all the more terrifying is the fact that your imagination carries your fear. As you imagine a killer who's undoubtedly human but whose evil acts makes him seem almost supernatural, you find yourself to be in a panic. Countless movies have tried to copy the formula but none hold a candle to this original. Holloween is a true classic, with outstandingly beautiful performances from Jamie Lee Curtis, Donald Pleasence, and Nick Castle aka Michael Myers."
"Stone_Cold","10","0","1","29 March 2005"," The night he came home...
","One cold night, he picked up a knife and he never put it down.......<br/><br/>Halloween, a decent film that was made in 1978 has been the benchmark for many horror films that has followed since its release. A decent storyline with great, chilling music and superb acting make Halloween a must see. <br/><br/>One night, Michael Myers escapes the hospital he was staying at and decides to return home to wreak havoc and issue fatal consequences for anyone who gets in his way. <br/><br/>Firstly the atmosphere is spot on here. The mood is perfectly set from the start of the film and it works well right until the end. From the first scene there is intrigue, suspense and murder. The producers do a wonderful job of making sure that this film has the perfect ""scary movie"" feel to it. Most of the scenes are set in the hours of darkness, which goes perfectly with the dark, chilling storyline. The producers do a wonderful job of using this to the films advantage  the use of shadows and reflections in the darkness work wonders to add to the scare factor.<br/><br/>The way that Michael Myers is built up to be an unstoppable, completely scary psychopathic killer is superb. The thing that I found really scary about the Michael Myers character was throughout the film you never knew where he was or could be  he could be in one place one minute, and another place the next. It gave the feeling that nobody in the film was safe.<br/><br/>I firmly believe that one of the most convincing reasons for this film being so successful was that Donald Pleasance gave the performance of a lifetime. His acting was spot on  he is so convincing in his efforts to try and convince people that Myers is pure evil. He lived and breathed this role, and really brought to life the characters of both Dr Loomis and Michael Myers. Not one actor could have done a better job in the role of Dr Loomis, and I for one will always remember Donald Pleasance for what he did for the Halloween series. The acting as a whole was good in the film, and Jamie Lee Curtis also does a good job of playing the helpless, un-deserving victim.<br/><br/>Another reason for the success of this film I would have to say has to be the music. The music in this film is very chilling, and does a cracking job of building up the tension and anxiety in the now infamous chase scenes the occur during the film. <br/><br/>There are so many factors that can be credited for the success of this film. These range from the great performances, the fantastic atmosphere created in the film, the use of shadows and lighting to the great music score.<br/><br/>I would strongly suggest to anyone to watch this film, as it is one of the best horror films ever. It is a subtle, yet very scary masterpiece.<br/><br/>They don't make films like this anymore!"

","I saw this film for the first time when I was 6 years old. I spent the next three weeks dreading going to bed because I was frightened out of my mind. From the very beginning of this film, it lulls you into a dreamlike state, where everything is propelling you toward an inevitable final confrontation of sheer terror. Dean Cundey, films the entire first three plus minutes of the film from the perspective of Michael Myers, age 6, as he murders his sister, as one continuous panaglide shot. As Michael comes out of the house his parents are there to meet him. We see for the first time that this is a 6 year old. As he holds the knife, and is unmasked by his Father, the camera cranes back on the composition, and cuts to black. This is the perfect set-up for all the action that follows. Michael escapes from the mental hospital on the night before Halloween. He returns to his home town of Haddonfield, IL. This is ""The Night He Came Home."" The whole film unravels in a steady and deliberate pace, and there is very little on screen violence, compared with todays horror films. It features one of the most memorable scores in movie history. With it's percussive 5/4 time main theme, and it's minimalist stalking music, it hypnotizes you. This film will scare anyone who enjoys a good horror movie, and it will really scare those who don't."

","John Carpenter is without a doubt the best horror director of all time. And here he has directed a film that is on up there with my favorite film of all time, 'Psycho'. Also, Carpenter come up with the ultimate icon of horror, Michael Myers. What is scarier than a man in a jumper suit, a butcher knife, white expressionless mask, and the blackest eyes... the devil's eyes? Jamie Lee Curtis' debut role is terrific. She's a true actress, and seems so real. There's a fantastic fall atmosphere in the film and it's enhanced by the awesome John Carpenter score. The theme is the most memorable of horror music themes. The fact that the film remains so scary without the use of blood, is a testimony to the fact that gore is not a crucial element to a good horror film.<br/><br/>If you were to check out any sequels, I'd highly recommend HalloweeN II, HalloweeN H20 and HalloweeN Resurrection. 4,5 and 6 tried to explain way too much. Part III has nothing to do with Michael Myers, although it's quite a bit better than 4,5 and 6.<br/><br/>HalloweeN... The Night HE Came Home."
"MovieFreak4702","10","0","1","18 January 2005"," You can't kill the boogeyman...
","This movie is probably one of the most underrated masterpieces of our time. There are a few movies that are so undeniably original and perfect in terms of composition that they are either too much to handle for some people or too simplistic for others. This movie could go either way in my opinion. The really amazing aspect of this movie is the extremely low budget that created this masterpiece of 70's cinema. I am only 16, so I just saw this the whole way through this past Halloween night. Unfortunately, I wasn't scared by this movie at all, but man do I love it. It works on so many levels. First, there's the story of repression coming back to haunt people that were the re-pressers. Also, there's the basic slasher plot of damsels in distress, except for this time we care about the characters and their ordeals. Still another subplot is the one of the Boogeyman, and that you can't kill him. The way Michael Myers moves is also something to be commended on behalf of Nick Castle. Myers chooses to walk and move slowly, not run after his enemies. This adds to a bit of the creepiness. It makes you wonder why he doesn't get the killing over with. The scene where he knifes up PJ Soles boyfriend and looks at him as if it were his butterfly collection kind of explains this. He obviously enjoys murdering and the thrill of the kill. Myers subtle movements are also extraordinarily good. This movie has many nods to Psycho as well. The idea of Janet Leigh's daughter playing the main protagonist was one. Another was the knife that Myers uses to kill. Still another is a shot where Myers knife just brushes the side of Laurie's arm but still cuts it. In the shower scene in Psycho, a similar thing happens when the knifer tries to stab Marion. The knife just brushes the side of her stomach rather than actually going in on camera, but it's implied that the knife made a cut. One other similarity is Dr. Sam Loomis. In Psycho, Marion's boyfriend is named Sam Loomis. If there is one thing that I really love about this movie then it is John Carpenter's direction. He manages to keep his Boogeyman on the screen right from the beginning of the movie so that we always know that we're not safe for long. There is one truly genius shot in the movie right before Laurie's encounter with Michael. She is crying, leaning up against the wall, when Myers' head slowly becomes visible in the shadow, as if our eyes are getting used to the dark and we're beginning to see Myers, even though he's been watching ""us"" since we got in the house. The acting in this movie isn't great on all parts, but Donald Pleasance is remarkable. The last shot of the movie, when he looks out is one of my favorite looks from an actor in any movie. It's pure genius. People pass off this movie as a slasher movie, and it is. But this is a slasher with a brain. The idea was truly original as well, so this is highly recommended to any film aficionado.<br/><br/>Rating: 11/10 Yes, it goes to 11"

","John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is one of the best horror films of all time. By far. You can't call yourself a horror fan and not have seen ""Halloween"". Among all of the past horror films, ""Halloween"" is among the classics that still stand out to this day and are as good as they were when they were first released.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" is about a man named Michael Myers, who in 1963 murdered his sister with a butcher knife at the tender age of 6 years old. He was then locked up in a high-security asylum and watched over by Dr. Loomis, and now, 15 years later, he has returned to the quiet community of Haddonfield, Illinois. Laurie Strode and her friends Lynda and Annie plan on having a low-key evening, Annie and Laurie are both babysitting and Lynda plans on a romantic evening with her boyfriend. But what they don't know is that Michael is stalking them - following them down the streets, watching them through the windows, prowling around the houses at night. And he plans on turning an otherwise ordinary Halloween evening into a night of pure terror.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" builds up suspense and displays true, classic horror at it's best. The score is the most remarkable thing about the film. It's perfect, the theme is eerie and creepy, and is now what the film is best known for. Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasence give excellent performances, and PJ Soles ""totally"" brings life to the Lynda character. The film has some great scenes, including the infamous closet scene which is scary as hell, and Lynda's death particularly. The feeling that Michael could be creeping around any corner, lurking in the dark shadows of the streets is very creepy. The entire setting of the movie is authentic to begin with, Haddonfield could be your town or my town. With minimal violence and gore, this movie manages to be insanely better than the sequels which mostly were gorefests, and is much more effective in doing so.<br/><br/>If you have yet to see this movie, see it. I've made it a bit of a ritual to watch this every time October 31st rolls around, and I'm sure many other horror fans do also. I do the same with ""Black Christmas"", another horror classic that I'd strongly recommend if you like this film, plus, it did come first. Anyways, ""Halloween"" goes to show you what can be done with such a low budget. I have seen all of the ""Halloween"" films and let me tell you, this one is still the best. 10/10."
"Vancity_Film_Fanatic","10","0","1","9 December 2004"," A highly effective horror classic!
","Definitely one of the top ten best horror films ever made, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" stands as a landmark in film-making. It has defined an entire genre (with some help from Bob Clark's lesser known ""Black Christmas""), inspiring scores of imitations and cheap knock off's over the years -- none of which have been able to re capture the genius behind the original film. John Carpenter knows what scares audiences. By tapping into the common childhood fear of the boogeyman he created the character of Michael Myers -- an inhuman human completely devoid of sympathy or sense of conscience. AND, without any clear motive for his brutality he becomes all the more menacing. Considering the extremely low budget for the film - a modest $300,000, it's clearly evident that Carpenter was/is a talented and visionary director (most evident in his earlier works). With his commanding use of cinemascope carefully framing each scene, and the stark yet atmospheric cinematography, he creates a brilliant and thrilling visual experience. Add in the unnerving score (brilliantly composed by Carpenter himself) and believable performances from Jamie Lee Curtis, Nancy Loomis, and Donald Pleasance - and the result is a genuine horror classic. Not to be missed, a definite 10/10! **Halloween was originally planned as a loosely based sequel to Black Christmas. If you haven't seen it, check it out -- it's recommended viewing to those interested in early 70's slasher flicks. OR, anyone in general looking for a good fright**"

So begins the legacy of Michael Myers. The film follows Laurie, dateless and forced to babysit on Halloween night, as she tries to escape Myers.<br/><br/>While the plot is hardly outstanding, it is Carpenter's direction which makes this a classic. he knows how to create and build tension, and get the most from his cast, and for any wannabe directors this is essential viewing, as it was all done on a low budget. original camera angles, effective use of the hand-held, the score all help create the atmosphere that most modern horror movies cannot reach. Everything in this movie is designed around ensuring that the tension is unrelenting. this was also one of the first 'modern' movies that showed youth that the world was not as safe as they had been led to believe, that our parents are not as reliable or trustworthy as we thought. the scene where Laurie is turned away from a neighbors house by a simple flick of a light switch underlines this. 9 out of 10."

","I rent this movie on Halloween every couple years and it never disappoints. Your attention is hooked from the opening scene to the last frame of the movie. The entire cast is well chosen. Jamie Lee Curtis is fantastic as studious babysitter Laurie Strode. Her ability to fend off psycho Michael Myers is believable. Also, I can't imagine anybody else but Donald Pleasance in the role of Dr. Sam Loomis. Pleasance's delivery of his lines sends chills up your spine. Truly, director John Carpenter understands what it takes to develop a scary story. There isn't one scene in the movie that I would delete. The actors who are Laurie's girl friends in the movie also act very well in the movie (Nancy Kyes and PJ Soles). They deliver their lines so naturally they remind you of your own high school classmates. I like the little boy in the film also, actor Brian Andrews, who plays Tommy Doyle. I enjoyed his sweet and shy character and he and Jamie Lee Curtis interact great. Lastly, I like that John Carpenter doesn't fill up the film with gore. He briefly shows Mike Myers stabbing his victims and quickly moves to the next scene. Carpenter lets us imagine the worst by not showing everything. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a classic film worth watching."

","I first saw John Carpenter's Halloween on television as a ten-year old.

I did what every ten-year old would; I sat there and watched every last bit of it.<br/><br/>Scared, terrified, afraid, etc. Those were my feelings as I sat there watching a seemingly supernatural madman slash teenagers.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't gory, really, but my mind, racing, supplied many gallons of blood and numerous flesh wounds.<br/><br/>Watching Halloween now, I'm so very impressed that it still has the ability to prickle my skin and give me enough heebies that I have to run from the living room to my bedroom after watching it.<br/><br/>But why is Halloween so frightening? Certainly part of its horror derives from the hulking, evil Michael Myers, but other movies, like Nightmare on Elm Street or Friday the 13th, have similar monsters and lack Halloween's ability to terrify absolutely. What truly makes Halloween scary is it's appearance. It looks real. The cinematography and direction feel more like cinema verite than most horror movies (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre has a similar feel). The ""realistic feel"" does not seem contrived (as it did in Blair Witch) nor does it feel forced (as it did in Night of the Living Dead (an excellent movie, but please let's be honest - that movie's realism felt like the result of fiduciary limitations.) It feels like the director wanted to shoot the movie in exactly that way.<br/><br/>John Carpenter has not topped himself, but he should still be remembered for making one of the finest and one of the few perfect horror movies."
"enddust","Null","0","1","29 October 2004"," Classic horror flick is more sexy and suspenseful than scary
","John Carpenter's Halloween may not be the actual first slasher flick, but it was, given its initial cost, the most successful and inspired a flood of inferior copycats (Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street, etc.). From the very first time I saw it at age 15--lying about my age w/a bunch of friends in order to get admitted--to the present day I have felt that Halloween is more suspenseful and even sexy than it was scary. That being said, the film is nonetheless very tightly made and quite entertaining, even bearing repeated viewings, but it works perhaps as much because it speaks to our secret desires and fears as because it scares us.<br/><br/>A little needs to be said about the slasher sub-genre, of which Halloween is the defining archetype. Slasher films are as much about teenage sexuality as they are about killing. Much has since been written about the type of character, the ""final girl,"" who usually survives the encounter with the slasher. She is the innocent virginal outsider, the good girl who doesn't get the guy and is not the party animal her friends are. In Halloween, Jamie Lee Curtis' character is sweet and bookish, even commenting early on in the movie about the meaning of fate. One by one, the slasher stalks and kills her sexually active teenage friends until he meets her. Unlike the other victims, she fights back, using her brains and her courage to stay alive and even strike blows against her attacker. Like the final girl, the slasher is also an outsider, but his only means of connecting with others is via his knife (an obvious phallic symbol). He is unable to participate in the normal sexual congress that he sees, envies, and then hates enough to kill.<br/><br/>The movie Halloween itself, whether by design or by accident, has seductive elements to it. The score by Carpenter himself is both haunting and scary but also has a seductive, almost dance-like cadence to it. The languid pace at the beginning of the movie and the cinematography lovingly set up the perverse ""romance"" that is to come later between the slasher and his virginal prey. And let's not forget the teenage sexual banter and actual fooling around of Laurie's friends that occurs before the killing starts.<br/><br/>Halloween is a classic because it works, perhaps unintentionally, on more than one level. We all seek pleasure and even sometimes find more joy in illicit pleasure than in wholesome fun, but we also feel more guilt in it as well. Halloween ponders our fear and fascination with death, sex, pleasure, and the teenage coming of age years. There is a Christian, even Puritanical, subtext to this genre and film: go ahead and fool around and live it up as a teenager but someday, maybe soon, you will pay some sort of price, because there is no pleasure in life without pain and even death. This message is as old as the Garden of Eden. The final girl derives her power, by reason of her virtue and purity, while the slasher represents an avenging angel (as well as demon) of sorts, punishing humans for their thoughtless sensuality.<br/><br/>And finally, there is the holiday from which the movie draws its name. Halloween the holiday has its beginnings in pagan harvest and fertility celebrations that both honored the bounty of the harvest season as well as the obvious demise and death of living things around us. Halloween, both the holiday and the movie, work because they tap deep roots within all of us."
"mentalcritic","8","0","1","25 October 2004"," Slow pace, haunting atmosphere, well developed characters... I thought this was a horror film
","With the idea of home video still being over the horizon, films were expected to deliver quality results for a low overall cost. Halloween, in its original form, delivered a box-office performance totalling many multiples of its production budget. And unlike certain other pieces that claim to have delivered the same result, Halloween did not do this by cutting corners to the extent that it mostly looked like the home video of a drunk. In fact, Halloween looks so professional in spite of having been made for (reportedly) less than half a million dollars, it should come as no surprise that it grossed more than two hundred times its production budget.<br/><br/>As in any John Carpenter film, the cinematography is the true star. Wide, rolling vistas give the location as much development as the characters or the story. According to the stories, the decision to use Panavision cost around half of the production budget. It was money well-spent, as while the 2.35:1 frame is often sparsely populated, it is used with great effect. Like all of Carpenter's films, Halloween becomes a different film entirely when it is chopped to fit the obsolete shape of analogue television.<br/><br/>Another Carpenter trademark is to create musical themes that capture the memory and imagination all on their own. The main Halloween theme follows a strange sort of conga or bossa nova feel, following an odd sort of 5/4 timing. Like many themes from Carpenter films, it stays in the mind of the listener long after other aspects have been forgotten. Regardless of whether one views the film as a classic horror story or a cookie-cutter slasher, the score music is one of the great classics of its artform.<br/><br/>This is the film that brought Jamie Lee Curtis into the public consciousness, and introduced Donald Pleasance to a lot of young cinema-goers who might otherwise have no idea who he is. Unlike the sequels, however, the support cast is fairly strong, too. While few of them appeared in anything substantive after the fact, they at least give the impression that they weren't recruited right out of their first year of drama school. Given that this screenplay is heavy on exposition, there is no way that the ultra-trendy cast of Halloween 8 could have possibly made this work.<br/><br/>Like many a Carpenter film, Halloween ends in a manner that seems to wrap most of the story up quite neatly, but leaves enough open for the viewer to start speculating on the characters' future. This is an ending style that I wish more directors would use, as it gives the viewer's imagination something to do. We also get to listen to a monologue about fate that, mainly through its delivery, is surprisingly haunting. The care and effort that went into setting a mood really paid off here, in a total contrast to the sequels.<br/><br/>I gave Halloween an eight out of ten. It is showing its age, but it works wonderfully in spite of that. It is a good example of how Hollywood used to have new ideas."

","Halloween is the movie that sent you home with fear. John Carpenter's use of suspense, pacing, lighting, and musical score places this film in league with Hitchcock. The acting is top notch and Michael Myers is the embodiment of pure evil. His smooth, graceful motion and penchant for ""trick or treating"" is of legend. Dr. Loomis shows sign of fright of what this night has in store. ""Death has come to your little town sheriff, you can either ignore it or help me to stop it"", is one of the best lines by Pleasence knowing full well what Michael is capable of. This film made you believe in the ""boogeyman"" long before Jason or Freddy ever came to screen. First rate acting by Jamie Lee Curtis, P.J. Soles and Nancy Loomis with expert camera work by Dean Cundey. Suspense is built when Michael appears in and out of the shadows and plays with his victims like a cat with a mouse, making his own macabre Halloween ""pranks"". The ending is perfect with the expression on Loomis' face as he looks on the grass and Michael is gone. The Friday The 13th and Nightmare On Elm Street movies are great horror flicks but this film moves into cinematic masterpiece. It is too bad Carpenter couldn't do the sequels this film so richly deserves."

","This film was pure luck. The chemistry in this film was amazing. You don't achieve this type of chemistry between actors by good casting alone. If that was the case, then Debra Hill would have gone on to bigger and better things with higher budgets. As it is, Debra Hill is primarily known for her involvement in John Carpenters Halloween. I was 8 yrs old when I firt saw this film and now my own child has seen it and loves it. That is what I call a tried and tested film. Time does not age the creativity of this film. Made on a budget of 300K and shot in 12 days on location with no dolly shots, 1 crane shot, tons of steady cam shots and the use of a tri-pod made this film. How? In a word...LUCK. It was all chemistry between crew and actor that made this film because if you actually read the screen play, it is not what you would expect the film to look like. John made a few good movies since, but he will never re-live the glory days of Halloween. Well, actually, he will always have the glory days of Halloween but he will never make another movie like it again. It is a once in a life time masterpiece. This is PROOF beyond any doubt that budget has nothing to do with how good a movie is. If budget had anything to do with how good a movie is, then why didn't the other Halloweens made come even close to the original with a budget of 10 times the original budget? I am convinced that chemistry is the key to a movie success and not budget. The two are not even related. With out chemistry you have no movie. I don't care if you spend 50 million or even 250 million, with out chemistry a movie will not work. There is no substitute for chemistry and all the money in the world can not buy the kind of chemistry that John and Debra had on the set of Halloween!"

","Just bought the DVD after renting it every year around this time. This movie is an all time classic must see horror flick. Although done on a tight budget, this movie dosen't need the high tech special effects of todays horror movies. Its a suspense filled movie, from Michael Myers standing between the sheets on the clothesline...to following Jamie Lee across the street to the house. Even though the character Michael Myers doesn't speak, he made the movie with his famous ""sit up"" scene. The way he sat up...turned his head toward an unaware Jamie Lee...spooky stuff. Not to mention the music score for this flick, is another reason why this movie is so good. Highly recommended around the trick or treating time of year."
"hallowd2000","Null","0","1","3 October 2004"," Too smart for audiences today
","This movie truly is a classic and much too smart for audiences today.Kids today are use to tongue and cheek copycat movies like Scream or I know what you did last summer, these movies who have no depth or characters and not even really any true actors but rather pretty boy and girl models from the hip nauseating WB channel.Also what these audiences don't realize is movies like Scream etc are<br/><br/>not independent films but sadly made by Hollywood studios for an obscene<br/><br/>amount of money.Halloween which was Independent and really made for<br/><br/>pennies in comparison was the original of this genre and is so much more<br/><br/>creative,smart and sophisticated.It does not rely on bad jokes or blood and gore or cheap scare tactics,Halloween is beautifully shot,really creates a mood and style to it ,through its use of camera angles lighting and art direction. The simple Hitchcock approach here is very creepy and stylistic through the whole movie. The acting is quite good, especially for a horror movie.Nancy Loomis who plays Jaime lee curtisis best friend (Annie),is probably the strongest here,in in my opinion shes underrated,she does a wonderful job of really creating a<br/><br/>character,shes the girl we all knew in highschool,very funny at times and loves to stir the pot,so when its time for Nancy Loomis to die your almost feel kind of sad because you've come to care about her.In fact you care about all the<br/><br/>characters in this movie and thats why your scared for them . Unlike todays<br/><br/>horror films where there is no character development and such a high body<br/><br/>count that in a way you want to see these one dimensional characters die.Also the music of Halloween is brilliant again simple is the key here,todays films don't even have originally composed music but rely on really bad rap or head banger music for its soundtrack which does nothing to set the style or mood to the<br/><br/>movie. Carpenter was brilliant to keep our villain quiet,just good verses evil,and Michael Meyers then becomes more of a force than a farce.The white<br/><br/>expressionless mask against a dark background says it all. This film really is a filmmakers dream to sit down and study all the smart elements of true film<br/><br/>making.Todays villains are too cute and try to be funny (ie Scream)and the<br/><br/>audiences that it plays for unfortunately know nothing about film and do not<br/><br/>have the attention span or imagination for a movie like Halloween.A lot of these kids today need things quick and easy for them,they don't want to use their<br/><br/>brains they want quick editing,a lot of gore and tongue and cheek,so chances<br/><br/>are when they watch Halloween they wont get it ,they will be bored by it,and my answer to that is that ITS OVER THEIR HEADS,ITS TO SMART FOR THEM<br/><br/>SADLY. So I leave you with this, if you want a classic see Halloween,if you want a true well made independent film see Halloween,if you want a classy ,timeless horror film see Halloween,if you want mindless crap see anything that<br/><br/>Hollywood puts out today ,because let me tell ya movies aren't what they use to be,but in the 60s, 70s and even early 80s it was much more about ability!"

I am not kidding when I say I have seen this film a hundred times. Most horror flicks these days don't give the viewer any credit. We are much more intelligent that they assume.

"WDD","Null","0","1","16 August 2004"," Still Carpenter's Finest...
","Although John Carpenter was doubtless in his prime during this era (from Assault on Precinct 13 to The Fog to The Thing to Escape New York), it is still this film, Halloween, which is his strongest effort. <br/><br/>Working from a narrative standpoint of minimalism (in story, atmosphere, performance and perhaps most effectively, the music), Carpenter creates a feeling of dread and foreboding that perfectly encapsulates the theme of Halloween. Check out those beautiful long and languid steadicam takes while the simplest of melodic motifs plays in the background. The opening act whereby Myers (as a boy) murders his older sister is all shot in one seamless take. It's beautiful and a classic example of why this movie is a product of a bygone era. The modern take on Hollywood horror would never stand for this. We would've been subjected to a thousand edits, loud alternative rock music and whatever passes for the latest in big-boobed talent these days... What a shame... <br/><br/>Anyway, having originally seen this film in about 1980 on television when I was nine, this film short-circuited my mind in much the same manner that it still does today. No small feat considering it's about twenty-five years later and I've catalogued countless movies since that fateful eve. <br/><br/>I applaud John Carpenter for his superb efforts here. If you are in the mood for a ghost story wrapped around a slasher theme then Halloween is the film. A definite classic. <br/><br/>Rating: Thumbs Up"

I think this is Carpenter's best, before he started putting his name before all his film titles, he uses many good camera techniques and actually makes the character of Michael Meyers someone to be afraid of. Despite its very low budget it still holds up today, despite the acting isn't the best(except for Donald Pleasance) and everything has sort of the 70's feel.

I do think that if I were the girl who got strangled in the car, I would be scrambling out in a moments time. If I were the girl who had sex with the guy who got stabbed in the closet, I would not be thinking it was to funny, him dressing up as a ghost on Halloween night.

You see, the reason it is distinguished from most other slashers is because like black Christmas, it relies on atmosphere and suspense, rather than blood and fake intestines getting ripped out(just for the record, I am a fan of zombie flicks, especially ones from the infamous Romero, but intestines is good for zombie flicks, not so much slashers), you do see knives going into people but it is in the dark and shadows, which makes the movie that much more scary and Michael Myers much more threatening, unlike in the crappy sequels, where he just walks around in the light and kill people, tons of blood and gore, typical slasher, which i have no problem with, i love sleepawa camp and Friday the 13th and silent night, deadly night, but halloween is one movie that should not have blood in it. Avoid the sequels at all costs. Trust me, if you watch the first one and stop there, you will not want to leave your room and you will want to carry a weapon everywhere you go, and be looking into all of the shadows, but if you watch the sequels, its like, the scare factor, even for the first one, goes down(which is why the sh** sequels should all be avoided. If you are the type of person like I used to be who thinks you have to have every movie in the series to have the best collection, trust me, you get a much better effect if you just watch the first one. John Carpenter is the only person who has any business directing halloween, and halloween is such a perfect, flawless masterpiece that it needs no sequels, so yeah, that's right, all you talentless directors who tried to ruin halloween(dwight little, rick rosenthal, that french dude, and more)please do everyone a favor a f**k off. You are doing the series more harm than anything else. Also, Moustapha Akkad, please, just stop. Please. Just ignore the sequels, please, I cannot stress this enough, just please, if you love halloween as much as I do, avoid the crappy sequels. Please, you will be a better horror adict(which I am definitely one) if you just watch the first. The sequels are not even scary, Myers just walks around and stabs people with scissors, no suspense, just him walking around, you can always see him. There is no shadow, suspense, atmosphere, or POV that makes the original a masterpiece of horror. If you are thinking about watching the sequels, just don't. It makes every character in the movie seem less likable and, just go watch Black Christmas or The Funhouse, two other great slashers. Here is a list of directors and some movies that will help guide you to create a great horror collection. Tobe Hooper: Eaten Alive The Texas Chainsaw Massacre The Funhouse<br/><br/>John Carpenter: Halloween(of course) Christine The Fog<br/><br/>Wes Craven: The Hills Have Eyes A Nightmare on Elm street(avoid most sequels, the first 3 are great, though Wes had no part in 2) Last House on the Left<br/><br/>Bob Clarke: Black Christmas<br/><br/>There are many other great movies out there, such as Happy Birthday to Me, Terror Train, etc., that are worth checking out. You just have to look, read a lot of reviews to get a good sense of a movie, so you know if it is a repeater, like halloween. There are some movies that are pretty scary, but not enough to have nightmares and stuff. They are mostly just fun to watch. Some are Uncle Sam, Jack Frost(please avoid part 2), Friday the 13th, pretty much all of those 80's slasher gems. Oh yeah, one last note, Carrie is VERY scary, and is definitely worth picking up, or at least renting. Okay, away with me, have fun watching 70's, 80's gold. Later"

A horror/thriller uses mood, music and lighting instead of<br/><br/>relying on buckets of red paint and cheap scares.  This movie also was the<br/><br/>start of a movie franchise and has spawned hundreds of knock-offs and<br/><br/>rip-offs.  Halloween is also responsible for the ""teenage girl"" in peril films. It's also responsible for the called ""slasher"" films that become the staple of 80's horror flicks and a tired cliche in latter day movies.<br/><br/>The film spans a twenty year period.  A young boy has whacked his sister<br/><br/>and is placed in the funny farm.  His shrink (Donald Pleasence) is afraid of<br/><br/>the boy and it seems he didn't do a very good job of treating him for his<br/><br/>psychosis. Now he doesn't want him to ever see the light of day, and for<br/><br/>good reason.  The man is a bonafide monster.  One day he escapse...<br/><br/>Highly recommended!<br/><br/>A+<br/><br/>The start of something big or the beginning of the end of horror films?"
"Messiahknot","10","0","1","7 June 2004"," A Benchmark Classic
","A textbook example of horror at its finest. A genuine classic from a director who deserves a lot more respect then he currently has.<br/><br/>The story revolves around the character of The Shape, better known as Michael Myers. You see Michael is a psychotic killer, favouring the night of October the 31, better known as Halloween, to exact his murderous rampages. The story is very dark and begins in the small town of Haddonfield on Halloween night 1963. It starts with young Michael killing his older sister Judith, supposedly for sleeping with her boyfriend. There is a feeling of depravity and incest that helps shape his character. The first scene consists of one continuous shot shown through the POV of six year old Michael. It's in my mind, among one of the films best sequences and sets the scene for what's to come. The climax where Michaels mask is removed by his father and his pale emotionless face is revealed will linger in my mind forever. <br/><br/>Fast-forward and we find out that Michaels been sent to a mental institution and has remained there for the last 15 years. The sleepy town of Haddonfield has long forgotten the horror of years past. <br/><br/>We are introduced to one of the series most endearing characters, Dr Sam Loomis, played by Donald Pleasence, who accompanied by nurse Marion Chambers, Nancy Stephens, drive towards the institution where Michael is being held with the intention of transporting him to Harden County for his case to be reviewed to decide whether or not he should be tried as an adult for murdering Judith. Pleasence is great and has become a favourite of Halloween enthusiasts. Upon arrival they find out that there has been a breakout and the patients wander the lawns in the rain. Circumstances lead to Michael eventually stealing their car and heading of back to his hometown, with the intention of arriving on Halloween night.<br/><br/>Here we are introduced to the films main character, 17 year old Laurie Strode, played by wonderfully by Jamie Lee Curtis. A smart intelligent student who would prefer to be babysitting rather then partying. Curtis is mesmerising and does a stellar job at portraying Laurie. She is social but at the same time keeps to herself. Through a series of events Michael slowly lets himself be known by Laurie. Loomis arrives with the intention of warning the local police of the killers arrival, but to what end? This is basically where the movie begins. I wont spoil the story but will simply state that your in for one helluva ride!!<br/><br/>The darkly intriguing story is complimented throughout by an unsettling atmosphere. Carpenter crafted a wonderful mood that helps propel the title above its peers, not to mention the movies theme which is accredited as being of the most chilling aspects of the movie. The character of The Shape has now become a trademark figure of horror.<br/><br/>Was a revelation in its time and still is today."

","John Carpenter's Halloween is the greatest slasher movie of all time. Although it may not be the first of its kind (Black Christmas is another almost perfect slasher flick), Halloween stands out in front of all the rest. This truly is Carpenter's masterpiece. It has everything: atmospheric horror, slash and scream scares, and to top it all off the storyline itself is great. For those few out there that haven't seen this movie (for whatever strange reason it may be) buy it, don't rent it, just buy. Skip the middle man. Everyone should own this horror classic.

"LondonOnMyMind","10","0","1","12 March 2004"," One of the classics
","Halloween is one of classic horror films, and a film that inspired countless other slashers. The main reason for its status as a classic is the way it creates a sense of dread using the atmosphere. The story revolves around a maniac killing people, yet there is barely a drop of blood to be found. It is all in the camera work, the eerie score, and the beautifully shot locales.<br/><br/>Personally, I love horror movies that are big on atmosphere. Gore just does not frighten me, and I do not see it as effective in generating scares. Halloween and Rosemary's Baby are two of my favorite movies, simply because they rely on the art of filmmaking, rather than gross-out techniques - in very different ways, of course - to provoke fear in the audience."

"departed07","10","0","1","15 March 2004"," A Fright from Start to Finish
","Halloween is one of my favorite days of the year. Sure, it's not a holiday where people take a day off from work, but I loved the atmosphere where kids and adults alike dress up in scary costumes and get candy or scare people for that matter. In John Carpenter's Halloween, this is more of a treat than a trick.<br/><br/>The film's prologue begins on Haddonfield, Illinois 1963 where it's just an ordinary Halloween night like no other. Except for little Michael Myers who happens to be coming home when he catches his sister Judith making out on the couch with her boyfriend and then goes upstairs to have sex for which Michael goes into the house and takes a butcher knife and waits for the boyfriend to leave to make his kill on his older sister. His parents come home and see little Michael dressed in a clown suit with a butcher knife with blood on it. With the ominous music of John Carpenter, the suspense has just begun.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasance) has pleaded with the courts to take a catatonic Myers to a maximum-security prison where he feels that the staff will at least try to watch over him. During the entrance of the minimum prison, an adult Myers attacks the nurse and escapes in the car leaving Loomis more in a panic than ever in his life as ""The Evil"" has gone.<br/><br/>It's Halloween 1978, and everything is pitch perfect in Haddonfield where not a murder has occurred since 1963. The neighborhood kids called the old Myers house ""The Spook house"" where many people (even adults) feel the presence of Michael Myers hiding somewhere in the house. The new character in the movie is Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis), an average American girl who has ambitions of going to college, but at the same time baby-sits in order to make cash for herself, as her father is a realtor, he even asks her to put the key under the old Myers house. Laurie's friends are Lynda (P.J. Soles) and Annie (Nancy Loomis) who are partygoers than she is, and want to hook Laurie with a boyfriend for the school homecoming after Halloween. At the same time, a man dressed in a William Shatner mask is stalking all three girls with Laurie trying to figure out who could it be.<br/><br/>Loomis is on the run looking for Michael Myers as it becomes hopeless that nobody will ever listen to him, except for Sheriff Brackett (Charles Cyphers) who decides to help Loomis look for him.<br/><br/>The night of terror is about to beginÂ… as Myers has found the neighborhood where Laurie and Annie are babysitting two different kids. He haunts them and kills a dog to cover his distraction.<br/><br/>I've given away so much of the plot, that I can't go on any further. One thing about Halloween that most critics (Gene Siskel, Richard Corliss) talked about was how the villain stalked their victims during premarital sex, which is now common for a lot of horror flicks (Freddy Krugger, Jason, Pinhead) where the virgin lives and the sluts' die. Are these psychopathic men working for the pope and God? Overall, Halloween is a masterpiece that once again resurrected the pleasures of going to see a horror film; I wouldn't recommend watching this film alone or in the dark."
"dkilsha1","Null","0","1","28 February 2004"," Good but not the best or the first.
","Don't get me wrong, Halloween is a classic horror film and stands up very well to repeated viewings. But it still annoys me when people describe it as the original 'slasher' film. It was preceded by a few years by the TRUE classic and original 'Black Christmas'. Bob Clarke's masterpiece of suspense and tension laid down the groundwork for nearly every stalk and slash picture that followed... including Halloween. The original premise of Halloween wasn't even John Carpenter's idea, it was the premise that Bob Clarke had for a potential sequel to Black Christmas that never got used. John Carpenter just asked if he could use it. Halloween is still a classic in it's own right, and a very scary film but I do feel that it should be more well known that it wasn't the first and that a lot more credit should be given to Bob Clarke and his intensely creepy classic."
"slayrrr666","10","0","2","19 February 2004"," The first, the best, the inspiration for the rest.
","`Halloween' is, without any doubt in my mind, one of the classics of the genre and perhaps the most influential horror movie of all time.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Young Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) has a rather bizarre family history. His younger brother Michael Myers killed his older sister on Halloween night when he was six years old and she was sixteen. He has been in the care of Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasence) for the past 15 years, and has developed a cold, murderous personality. He escapes on the 15-year anniversary of the crime and returns to his hometown, Haddonfield, Ill. At first, he stalks Laurie, keeping his distance from her and her friends, Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Linda, (P.J. Soles) never fully showing himself. Then, that night, he strikes, killing Annie, Linda, and her boyfriend in the neighboring house. Laurie herself is babysitting in the house across the street, which unbeknownst to her is Michael's house. Finally tired of the lies that her two children are telling her, Laurie goes across the street to see if the boogeyman really is there. She finds all of her friends murdered and a madman, Michael, after her. She manages to escape and flee back to her house. Meanwhile, Dr. Loomis is valiantly trying to find Michael with the Chief of Police, Sheriff Brackett. (Charles Cyphers) Combing the streets, they are unable to find Michael. After Laurie makes it back home, she sends the two children out to get help, and run into the Sheriff and Loomis, who direct them back to Laurie, who is having a hard time trying to kill Michael, as he relentlessly tries to kill her as well. Loomis arrives at the nick of time, putting several bullets into Michael and sending him over a balcony. After checking on Laurie, he goes outside to find Michael has survived the bullets and the fall.<br/><br/>The good News: Where do I start? First of all, the music. Those notes have become one of the spookiest sounds in all of horror movie history. Add those notes to any other movie, (drama, action, porno, etc.) and that movie instantly becomes creepy. Like `Jaws' and `Friday the 13th' they will forever live on in the hearts and fears of movie lovers as horrors greatest signatures. The suspense in the movie is almost as effective as the score. The way the scenes build up to a monumental moment is staggering. The beginning, for instance, is one of the most original and shocking openings ever, as a young child, apparently, selects a clown mask, then a giant butcher knife, then walks up a flight of stairs. We hear music playing, and we enter the room of some teenage girl getting dressed up for a date. She spots the person in the room and alerts him, then he convienently stabs her. We then see that whoever did that was a young boy, but the whole scene transpires without us knowing who it is, or without a word of dialogue spoken. It comes as a giant shock to those who have never seen it, as we expect that the transaction was done by a man. The film does have some fantastic action scenes, including the whole last half-hour in the house. From one scare to the next, we are treated to a series of logical and well executed scenes that build up to a nerve-wracking climax. For the time, the acting is passable, and there is no hard gore, but there are a few scenes of blood-letting. Also, Michael has a small sense of humor in this film, as in the scene where he wanders upstairs to find Annie in bed after having dispatched her boyfriend covered in a towel. Her remark is pretty funny, but Michael steals it by simply standing there, then finally moving when he knows he might be caught. The strangling over the phone has become a scene that has shown in numerous horror films since.<br/><br/>The Bad News: Unfortunately, like my review for `Phantasm,' this is a film of its time. The clothes, the coloring, and the conversations are very distinctly 70s. Also, ever other film in the series has had more gore than this movie, which is a disappointment for those seeking to see a ton of blood from Michael's killings. However, Carpenter was working on a small budget, so he can be forgiven.<br/><br/>The Final Verdict: With knock-out scene after knock-out scene, `Halloween' is recommended viewing for horror fans of all ages, audiences, and tastes. No one should miss out on the chance to see the film that has launched more than 80 sequels, imitators, and homage's. Perfect for all occasions, but best scene with the lights off at night.<br/><br/>Rated R: Violence, Nudity, two sex scenes, some language and mild drug use."

","this is it ,no not the greatest slasher because it is not a slasher it is simply a scary movie from beginning to end .you are thrown off your easy chair and thrown into a creepy atmosphere by both film and the music . I would even say that this is more terrifying than the great Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho because it is more modern and i think it's more identifiable to most people today. If you have not seen this movie and you are a horror fan don't be expecting all the blood you see on the screen today in films, because it's not in this one,Carpenter sets mood and atmosphere instead blood and guts or if you have been holding off on seeing this movie because you think this a friday the 13th movie or a nightmare on elm st. movie you are dead wrong . this done with class, this is basically a drama with scares.

"hausrathman","Null","0","1","3 February 2004"," The Real Deal
","Jamie Lee Curtis is stalked by a silent, seemingly indestructible masked killer who escaped from a mental asylum in this highly-suspenseful horror flick directed with style by John Carpenter.  With this much-imitated blockbuster hit, and its killer POV angles, Carpenter practically invented a new horror subgenre single-handedly, and its easy to see why.  Films like this are easy to make on a low-budget.  All you need is a group of young actors willing to show a little flesh and a good make-up guy for the splatter effects.  Not that this film itself was especially gory.  It was until later that the imitators began giving us gore in lieu of genuine suspense.  Still, don't hold all of the awful movies inspired by this film against it.  This is the real deal.  One of the best horror films ever made."

","But then again not really, because you know who's going to get it right? P.J. Soles never comes out of these movies in one piece.  Well anyway, this is one of the best of the ""unlucky saps get hunted down by random psycho"" movies of seventies like the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Bob Clark's(of Porky's fame) Black Christmas. The sequels gave Michael Myers a motivation, something to do with a Druid cult or whatever, but in the original he was just some guy taking a stand against Women's Lib (okay bad joke, but y'know what I mean...).  See, most of the bad guys in Carpenter movies are facless, amorphous, impersonal ""Alien"" things...y'know, like ""The Thing."" Or ""The Fog"". He once said that in the Sixties what really scared him wasn't The Bomb, but the idea that there was this invisible thing carried on the wind called radiation, and you couldn't hide from it. In other words he was as scared of faceless impersonal amorphous things as Wes Craven was scared of older threatening males named Freddy. Stephen King wrote in ""Danse Macabre"" that this movie was kind of like ""The Tale of The Hook Handed Killer Prowling Lover's Lane"" but stretched out to feature length. That's about right.<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for its respective genre   Trivia: *This movie previewed horribly for awhile, until Carpenter decided to add the score and ""save it with the music"". Subsequent test scores shot up dramatically. Pretty nifty for five or six twelve year olds out there who've never heard it (imagine Tubular Bells but creepier and at a faster tempo).<br/><br/>*This movie was also written off as a turkey when it premiered until an article in the Village Voice praised it and started to change critics's minds. They really stepped into it didn't they? This was one of the few slice'em up movies that Ebert praised before he and Siskel started a campaign against them in the eighties in response to what he saw as a ""morally depraved"" trend and that should ""outrage"" us. Now he'll give three star reviews to anything. I mean he liked ""The Hunted""."

","In my opinion, ""Halloween"" is the best horror film of all-time.  It is definitely Carpenter's best film.  Unlike many other movies of this genre -- It was more of a psychological thriller and not a ""slasher"" film. I believe ""Halloween"" was so successful because the overall atmosphere of the film was on suspense, rather than blood and guts.<br/><br/>Suspense makes a scary movie scary.  Blood and guts do not.  It's as simple as that.  It's the anticipation of waiting for something to happen that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The Michael Myers in this film was so different than that of any other ""Halloween"" film.  He was truly frightening.  Nick Castle had a certain ""presence"" that brought about strong feelings of trepidation to those who watched the film.<br/><br/>""Halloween"" has universal appeal.  It's a relatively simple story, but nevertheless a great one!  I don't think a great story has to be complex in order to be great.

My two favourite scenes are when Michael kills Bob then tilts his head to the side admiring his work and when Laurie is standing in front of the bannister and you slowly see Michael's mask appear out of nowhere. That shot was creative brilliance. It is a timeless horror classic."

","Halloween is a movie that is not aging well with me but it is a great movie and a classic because it mixes deeply disturbing elements in a great technical package.  The style is tremendous, with Michael Myers sandblasting an imprint in the heads of many viewers (including me.)  The pace seems dead but the ominous presence of Myers, mixed with the moody music, fills the screen even when he is not in it.  Jaime Lee stumbles around and the supporting victims include people like PJ Soles.  The killings are brutal but not gory, thus increasing the appreciation and they are tremendously well spaced.  The elements of the chase are also manipulated brilliantly. Donald Pleasance acts like Myer's alter ego, a boogeyman who stalks the object of his obsession.  Stalk, slash and kill?  Yes.  But with a heart."

","Given 25 years of hindsight, Halloween doesn't look like all that good of a movie.

Whether through camera technique or use of music, this movie continues to scare the bejesus out of my wife.  I can't recall much blood and guts in this movie, which is fine, because I don't find that kind of thing scary.

"DarkReflection","10","0","1","14 August 2003"," The epitome of horror cinema.
","The story is simple. Three babysitters are stalked by a madman who has escaped from a mental hospital. The plot is the stuff of cliche nowadays, but in 1978, the concept was still fresh, and even today, the simple plot is the thread which holds some of the most frightening horror setpieces commited to film, using little to no graphic violence or gore. Comparable to Alfred Hitchcock's classic, PSYCHO in many respects, the film also borrows the cinematic style of Italian suspense guru Dario Argento (even the unforgettable score borrows from some of his films) with the anamorphic wide shots that tighten throughout, killer POV camerawork, and lush cinematography. All style aside, the film truly does scare, not only with the suprises, but the feeling of dread and anticipation (as Hitchcock said, is the scariest part of horror cinema). The setting which is familiar to many and all-too-perfect (the quiet suburb of Haddonfield, Illinois) adds to the scares, as this could happen anywhere, and even to you! The film is not without it's problems, though. Although character development of Laurie Strode and Sam Loomis are excellent, some characters (Laurie's friends) seem pretty one-dimensional and annoyingly typical. Simply put, they're knife fodder. However, the acting is top-notch for such a low-budget production, especially first-time lead Jamie Lee Curtis (Laurie Strode) and seasoned vet Donald Pleasance (Sam Loomis). To give away any of the scares or plot developments would be unfair to Halloween virgins. A truly scary movie, with tons of style and not a single dull moment. A perfect 10."

","HALLOWEEN was a well done, low budget horror movie. It had one of, if not the greatest  influence on its genre. Donald Pleasence did an excellent job as the paranoid Dr. Loomis, portrayed through his elaboration of the dialogue and use of body language, and other animators. Pleasence definitely had the best performance, but Jamie Lee Curtis put in a good one as well playing the meek high schooler, Laurie Strode. Her charismatic personality of her character was well-portrayed by Curtis, and in turn, you felt that she was more real than a movie character. Nick Castle, who didn't have any lines, still delivered a solid performance as the villain, The Shape, otherwise known as Michael Myers. His movement and actions fit the role of the smooth psychotic serial killer perfectly, and added to the level of fear portrayed in the movie. The majority of the acting was good, especially considering the low-budget and independent status of the film, but other elements were the highlights of this film. The plot was original and cleverly thought, yet was even better on screen than on paper, due to good direction and fine cinematography.<br/><br/>Writer/director John Carpenter took the characters he had and helped develop them to their full extent possible in the 90-minute time frame.  While this development isn't necessarily Oscar-worthy, it was excellent considering the minimal amount of dialogue or screen time for some characters. The style he brought to HALLOWEEN was excellent, portrayed through his creative direction and writing, and without Carpenter, HALLOWEEN would not be HALLOWEEN.<br/><br/>The lighting, which is some of the best night-time lighting I've seen, fitted the movie perfectly, and added to the horror effect in the film. Camera work was good as well. It was quite simple for the most part, but accompanied by good lighting and proper usage, it was very good. The main highlight of the camera work was the opening scene, a one-shot, multiple-minute, first person angle. Definitely done well, and use appropriately.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Halloween was a well-made film as well as an influential horror film. It shined mainly through its cinematography and plot, but direction and acting were good as well. No doubt enjoyable and eerie, HALLOWEEN is a must-see for any movie-goer.<br/><br/>3 and 1/2 out of 4 stars"
"mesmorizedmind","Null","0","1","16 April 2003"," Michael Myers is a pervert!
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>I expected a lot from this film. I've known of the legend surrounding this movie for a long time. I was disappointed. For a low-budget film of 1978, the cinematography, sound effects, and suspense elements are pretty good. I imagine this movie was the first of it's kind, and very influential. However, classics don't get dated like this movie did. I may be over-exaggerating how dated this movie is. I think young viewers might still get frightened by this, and the movie is still watchable. The only thing about this movie that didn't get dated is the theme music. The theme music is excellent and definitely a keeper.<br/><br/>I found the movie boring. The real action doesn't start until halfway through the movie. There isn't much gore, and the casualty rate is at a minimum. The dialogue is too ordinary and rudimentary, and there isn't much of it. The suspense isn't bad, but predictable (I suppose it wouldn't be predictable when it was first released, but given all the imitations it spawned, there aren't any surprises). Michael Myers seems retarded. In one scene he is grunting and mumbling incoherently when going in for the kill. In another scene he has trouble breaking the closet doors. Ever heard of just opening it with your hands? The movie never explains why he killed his older sister, or why he is on a rampage now, fifteen years later.<br/><br/>Even though I don't think the movie is great, Michael Myers is still a nice villain. His cheap five dollar mask does wonders on him. He can look pretty scary just walking around the neighborhood with his butcher knife and his expressionless eyes.<br/><br/>I don't think the movie is bad, but it is not a classic. The only sense the movie is a classic is in the context of the time period when it was made. I'd recommend Halloween to young viewers, or people inexperienced with the horror genre.<br/><br/>Now to my theory about why Michael Myers is a pervert. When he was six, little Mikey had a defected form of the Oedipus Complex. Instead of lusting for his mother, he desired his sister. Sadly for him, an older boy was coveting her. His frustrations caused him to kill his sister. While in prison, he did nothing but jerk off. He was sex depraved. So the first thing he does when he escapes is to try to get some. Young Laurie comes by his house and Michael sees nothing but flowers and wedding bells. He must have her. So he stalks her to find out how he can impress her. Mikey can't get any because her friends are in the way. Watch the movie to see how this love affair turns out."

"Infofreak","Null","0","2","3 February 2003"," Maybe not the first slasher movie, but still one of the best, and most influential.
","I'll leave it to horror historians to debate what is the first real slasher movie as we know it. Many people give Mario Bava credit for inventing the genre with 'Bay Of Blood' (a.k.a. 'Twitch Of The Death Nerve'). Certainly the giallo genre as a whole must be mentioned that is a fact, but whether or not 'Halloween' was the first slasher movie it is undoubtedly one of the best, and definitely one of the most influential. John Carpenter was on one hell of a roll at this time, having made the amusing sci fi spoof 'Dark Star', and the underrated siege classic 'Assault On Precinct 13'. 'Halloween' is another goodie from Carpenter, a director who sadly seems to have his best work behind him. Like his previous two features Carpenter also composed the score, and his simple but effective music (influenced greatly I'd say by Goblin) really helps increase the tension. British horror favourite Donald Pleasence ('Fantastic Voyage') is given top billing as Dr Sam Loomis (a 'Psycho' in-joke), but the real star of the movie is Jamie Lee Curtis, in a breakout role that made her a much loved figure for horror buffs. Curtis' teenage pals, played by P.J. Soles ('Rock'n'Roll High School') and Nancy Loomis (who had a bit part in 'Assault On Precinct 13'), are also impressive, and the chemistry between them is convincing and realistic. Also keep an eye out for Charles Cyphers, an early Carpenter regular who unfortunately is little seen in movies these days. 'Halloween' is a very tight and creepy thriller full of atmosphere and suspense. Forget the many inferior sequels, and the dozens of crappy slasher movies that subsequently imitated it, it is still a brilliant horror movie that every fan should cherish. If for some strange reason you haven't seen this one, do so immediately!"

"alternatetitle","Null","0","1","20 January 2003"," They don't make 'em like this anymore
","Movies today are not what they used to be.  Moreover, most Hollywood product is quickly written, badly made and people flock like sheep to see them, especially if there is a multi-million dollar ad campaign supporting them. When I think of movies from the seventies (like Jaws for instance), I am reminded that you can tell a story, a good one, and truly draw the audience in without relying solely on effects and action but by developing characters and telling a good story.  Halloween is a perfect example.<br/><br/>
Carpenter spends most of the movie creating suspense.  There is no gore, nothing is ""in-your-face"", instead there is simply a classic build up. The audience knows what will happen, but it doesn't matter.  The eeriness of this film is it's look, the look of it's villain and the atmosphere created through suspense.  Like Jaws, we don't fully see the villain until three quarters of the movie has passed.  The effects of the villain are there, the shape is there (full use of the 2.35:1 aspect ratio in this one) but we are teased when it comes to his face.  Until we finally see it close up and realize that it is a mask, all we know is that this shape has an eerie white face.  In order for this suspense and eeriness to work, the audience must identify with the characters.  We identify with Laurie when she sees the white face staring at her from the back yard.  This is after she has already seen him during school and on her way home.  She could have been mistaken before but she now knows that this man is indeed stalking her and is terrified but has no idea what to do about it.  Who can she tell, who will believe her - hopefully he'll just go away.  Carpenter uses her character to draw the audience in.  We will empathize and sympathize with every situation she encounters throughout the story.  What would we do?  Her friends think nothing of it.  Our friends would be the same.  We don't identify with them, in fact, we expect the shape to get them and when he does we aren't surprised or even upset.  But for Laurie, the audience is more protective. She doesn't deserve it because, well, we don't.  When a horror movie can draw the audience in by identification, that is when the suspense will work. Hitchcock taught us that.  This is the reason sequels to these types of movies are not as good.  You can't create the suspense twice."

"grolt","10","0","1","13 January 2003"," The best
","Right from the film's notorious panaglide shot, ""Halloween"" promises the best.  This is a film of meticulous composition and total brilliance.  John Carpenter uses every facet of his 2.35:1 frame with perception, constantly keeping the viewer in suspense.  Is Michael lurking in the foreground, the left, the right, or perhaps the background?  The viewer is never safe in this film, Michael Myers has been set free to invade the frame.  Not only that, but with Carpenter's first person shots, the viewer is thus forced to identify with this personification of evil.<br/><br/>Forget ol' Alfred, this is a work of a genious who was in his own element. This is a John Carpenter film, not a Hitchcock or Hawks film, and in this writers eyes, it is better than any film Hitchock or Hawks has ever done. For more proof compare Carpenter's ""The Thing"" with Hawks'; there is no comparison.<br/><br/>As the heroin, Jamie Lee Curtis, in her big screen debut, exudes an innocence and charisma unseen in most films.  She works as the true opposite to Michael; a heaven to his hell.  Had Laurie Strode been played with someone less radiant, then that dichotomy between good and evil would not have been as effective as it is in this film.<br/><br/>Turn out the lights and sit back and prepare to be horrified.  Don't cop out and watch this with a friend either, a movie like this is only good when seen alone.  With someone else in the room the viewer can laugh at the clothes, the dialogue, etc.  But when alone, there is nothing to do but be affraid.  This is the best horror film ever made, and arguably the best film ever made.  John Carpenter has truly created a horrific masterpiece that should be seen by all respecting film fans.  Carving a pumpkin will never be the same again!"

Back in Anglo-Saxon times, there was a moderately deformed/retarded villager who everyone revered as an obvious outcast. He was in love with one of the women in the village. She took advantage of his weakness, and accused him of assault. Some of the other villagers decided to punish him, so they dismembered him. Tragic story, but this is where Mike comes in. The murdered man's spirit became tormented and tortured, and wandered limbo searching for vengeance. Now, thousands of years later, this Celtic spirit decides to take complete control of young six year old Michael. Suddenly, Michael knifes his sister Judith and a movie legend is born. If only the other seven sequels could have cashed in on this prelude! Maybe HALLOWEEN 9 could be a prequel, since we are all prequel happy in the films at this time."

Are you an intelligent person?<br/><br/>All these variables have relevance to your appreciation, understanding, and interpretive skills of this landmark film. Actually made on a remarkably low-budget, Carpenter really hit the jackpot with this one. It WAS eerie....it WAS frightening and almost ALL of this was achieved with suggestion...rather than graphic violence. The evil and malignant INTENT of Michael Myers filled the theater. Loomis' brave, almost unhinged pursuit of his nemesis was tangible and horror would never be the same again. Both FRIDAY THE THIRTEENTH's Jason Voorhees and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET's Freddy Krueger were the willing and predictable descendents of Michael Myers.<br/><br/>
As integral as anything else here was John Carpenter's own musical score which he re-arranged for both sequels, and other self-directed films of the 80's including ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK and THE THING.

Because it uses classic terror to frighten the audience, not blood and gore like today's horror movies. All the classics; Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Psycho. They all had almost no blood and gore, but they are all still terrifying because of the psychological horror. John Carpenter does an excellent job at doing that.

It had a budget of $300,000, only one real name actor, and it only had a filming time of, I believe, 21 days. To say the least it is cheap, in fact there was a single bag of leaves used to make it look like the Fall season. That doesn't mean it's bad. The acting by Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasance is wonderful, while the supporting cast has its questionable moments. The story depends on small, creepy moments, and not on gore, unlike much of this Genre. I love some of the recent teen horror films, such as Scream, Scream 2, and I Know What You Did Last Summer, but if you're a teenager of today, I'm guessing the possibility may be slim that you'll enjoy it. The direction is fantastic by John Carpenter and the killer himself, Michael Myers is more terrifying than any other, that is in eerie factor. The only other one that is really gasp worthy is Leatherface ( because it really happened ). Still, no other Horror film is more classic than this. Not Psycho, and not the Exorcist. If you enjoy this: Halloween 2= A, Halloween 3= F, Halloween 4= F, Halloween 5= F, Halloween 6>F, Halloween 7 (H20)= A+"

","Almost every suspense film (not just slashers) has imitated or has outright stolen the techniques used by Carpenter in this film. Some of it seem cliche? It wasn't when the film was made! Hard to believe that, like the Exorcist, the sequels were so truly, truly awful."
"Hypercentury","10","0","1","14 May 1999"," In one word - Excellent
","This is the best movie (not just horror movie) I have EVER seen. It doesn't have any gore scenes but it surely shows the terror scenes very truly and convincingly. It had everything a horror movie consists of and some great acting and a persuasive direction too. It wasn't that scary but the climate was fantastic since it was showing reality facts in a very nice way. The music is great and it can make you be scared even more. You should watch Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 ommitting the other sequels (the ones without Jamie Lee Curties were awful) even though Halloween 2 and Halloween H20 weren't as good as the the first one. I put 10/10 because it was a nice try that achieved to really scare people and give a whole new dimension to scary movies."

True, all of its sequels were true pieces of crap, but what does it matter. At least we've got this one. The next Halloween I wore a Michael Myers mask, and none of my friends knew what it was.

","Halloween is without a doubt the best horror film ever made. No movie before or since has captured the sheer terror of the dark and the unknown. The fact that the movie is so terrifying is made even more incredible because it was made on a shoestring budget over 20 years ago. The image of Michael Myers clad in deep blue with a bone-white mask still haunts an entire generation who saw the film when it first debuted. The entire film works on every level: the music, the lighting, and the slowly building tension until the most memorable showdown in horror film history. Halloween redefined the genre, paving the way for many inferior ripoffs. Years after people have seen the film, though, they still glance over their shoulders on Halloween night..."

","There isn't enough that can be said about John Carpenter's masterpiece. Halloween is the personification of horror.  John Carpenter clairvoyantly expounds on our darkest fears in the form of a menacing shape, Michael Myers.  The reality of this character dispels the notions of monsters, ghosts and goblins, but gives us something much more terrifying, an unstoppable human force.  Michael's emotionless demeanor, casual cat and mouse pursuit, and determination coupled with Carpenter's deliberate lack of lighting all serve to create an ominous atmosphere that uneases, and forces the viewer to delve inward and  question their own surroundings and safety. Halloween has stood the test of time to become the most watched and loved horror movie of it's time.  Halloween is a must see, a staple for any horror fan, and serves as the standard for other horror films to achieve.<br/><br/>I highly recommend Halloween to everyone!!"

I was staying at my grandma's house. There is a mall close and being the movie buff that I am, I bought a movie. I thought about what to get. I was going to get Halloween or Speed 2. I thought of Halloween because I was looking for something to really make me jump. I remember seeing it for my 11th birthday. I didn't understand why it was scary. I didn't know how to be scared. I thought it was about paranoia. I was wrong. It's all about the jump you get when something jumps out of somewhere that you wouldn't expect. So I bought this movie. Thank God I didn't get Speed 2. This movie scares you so much. I watched it right when I got home. It was the REAL first time. If I was a 70 year old, I think I might have had a heart-attack. That's how much this scares you. The performances were pretty good. That was another shock I didn't expect. This is like Oscar winning performances when compared to other horror movies like A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th. I also like the suburb-type feeling it has. It's like it could happen to you. Friday the 13th is just a dumb camp movie, and I don't mean the summer camp. This was like a blue-print for Scream. They are both very similar. Well, this movie will scare you so much and it plays off reality. A Nightmare on Elm Street is a lie. That can't happen. Give me something that can happen so it feels scarier. So much suspense. So much screams. So much reality. I love this kind of thing. Why can't horror movies be as good as this???? The world may never know."

"Keith-78","Null","0","1","12 April 1999"," A True Classic
","""Halloween"" is my favorite film of all time, not just horror, but any type of film. It was released back in 1978 and starred an unknown actress named Jamie Lee Curtis. It focuses on a disturbed mental patient named Michael Myers, who, when he was six years old, killed his 17 year old sister with a butcher knife. Fifteen years later, he escapes and sets his eyes on three teenage girls who are out babysitting for the night. This is definitely John Carpenter's best film to date. It has all the elements of a SCARY movie: the dark atmosphere, the music, the unstoppable killer, NO blood, the frightened but smart heroine and likeable characters. The other six movies (with the exception of Halloween: H20) replace all of the original's suspense with huge amounts of blood and gore. Watch this one with the lights out."

"Schmeez","10","0","1","13 February 1999"," A trend-setting triumph of atmosphere and suspense
","John Carpenter's trend-setting masterpiece, more than anything else, is a triumph of visual style and simple, effective, classic camera work.  The gore, if any, is minimal.  The movie relies more on atmosphere and suspense to build scares from the viewer.<br/><br/>Watching ""Halloween"" now may sometimes seem like it is a formulaic, cliched horror movie in the same genre of ""Friday the 13th"" and a myriad of other cheap imitators.  The knowledgeable viewer would realize that this was the movie that started all the scare tactics that are now over-used by many wannabes.<br/><br/>The female leads, in the hands of any other film maker, would be clueless bimbos without the slightest hint of intelligence.  Here, they are classy, fun, smart and not merely sex objects.  This, of course, was the screen debut of Jamie Lee Curtis, who effectively plays the naive, awkward heroine and would return for two sequels - 1981's excessively gory ""Halloween II"" and 1998's not so bad ""Halloween: H20.""<br/><br/>The most effective part of the film is the filmmakers' use of foreground and background.  There is always something lurking in the background while the action occurs in the foreground.  There are no quick cut, flashy action sequences that distract the viewing.  Simple hand-held shots and inter-cut sequences relay the story to the viewer in a simple, ageless style.  Parts of the movie may seem dated (particularly some of the dialogue and the cheesy clothing), but the movie itself holds up surprisingly well.<br/><br/>All this in mind, let's not forget that above all, this movie is scary! Michael Myers appears out of shadows, from behind bushes, and does his best to frighten you.  This movie loses a lot in the standard ""altered to fit your screen"" transfer, so if possible watch the widescreen version."

I love the horror genre but even as a fan I have to admit many of its family members a laughable.<br/><br/>The trick with Halloween is that it was almost believable, the key to being scared by something is its invincibility and the Michael Myers character had this factor in huge amounts. The character of Dr Loomis is another component of the movie which makes it so much more frightening. His view of Myers as pure evil gives you an idea of what to expect.

","Who would've thought that a movie made for less than $300,000 dollars could amount to anything. Yet ""Halloween"" did much more than that; it cultivated modern horror. Even though it was made in 1978, it much resembles the thrillers of the 90s (f.e. ""Scream"", ""Urban Legend"", ""I Know""), which is why I say ""modern"". There aren't a great many people worldwide who haven't seen this movie, which is a major accomplishment. It also features a very young, busty, BLONDE Jamie Lee Curtis, whose acting went beyond impressive; she truly earned her title ""scream queen"". The movie itself was enough to scare the living crap out of you. With the erie background music (and that theme song is the bomb!) and scenes such as the one where Curtis has just found the mother-load of dead bodies and the killer emerges from the darkness right behind her, this film will guarantee some serious chills. What always amazed me was that they actually paid Donald Pleasence for his work on these films. His acting was so absurd, I was hoping that Michael Myers would get him and leave Curtis alone. Still, it is a horror masterpiece. Not to be missed. A+"

","*****Warning!*******<br/><br/>*Some plot giveaways will be revealed in this review, but nothing too crucial. You've been warned!*<br/><br/>As a little boy, Michael Myers one Halloween night snaps in his thinking and knifes his babysitter to death.  Not wanting to introduce the young psychopath to potential influential killers in prison, he is wisked away instead to the local looney farm to work out his anger issues.  Dr. Loomis takes the task of changing the young lad around only to prove fruitless as Mikey grows into adulthood. In fact, he's nuttier than ever.<br/><br/>Several days before another Halloween evening, Mikey somehow escapes from his padded white room.  Perhaps a a drunken guard jingling keys to his cell in his face taunting ""Nyah Nyah!""?  Was the Grasshopper indeed to quick for the Master?  Either way, he's out.  Sucks for his older sister Laurie whom Michael seems hell bent on murdering for no damn good reason.<br/><br/>Michael decides it would be nifty to wear a stylish authentic ""William Shatner"" mask, quite popular with the local girls on Halloween whom can live out their secret desire to be in his presense (kinda anyway). He then decides to take full advantage of the absence of any ""No Stalking"" laws and follow his sister and her pals around town without fear of possible arrest. Feeling every bit of the rebel he in famous for, he decides despite never haven driven a car in his life, he will cruise on wheels and not on foot in a ""Chick Box"" (or van, popular shag wagon in the 70's, kids).  Fully aware he holds no driver's license, Mikey cares not for a task is at hand, ""Me kill, you die"".<br/><br/>His sister suspects some kook is following her and opposed to informing a policeman she does the next best thing, babysits a young boy all alone in a dark house on Halloween night. During his time of perfecting Stalking 101, Dr. Loomis is hot on his trail in his zany paranoid itchy trigger sorta way.  The local cops assisting him in the manhunt appear to often wonder if they should arrest the Doctor himself who appears to be deprived of sleep and logical thinking.  The settle instead for Mikey.<br/><br/>Mikey, although clueless to the outside world, seems pretty hip to things you'd think an insane killer whose been locked in one room for nearly all his life wouldn't even know.  Again, I mentioned the instant ability to drive a car.  Then there's the fact he's not forgotten how to get around his town and navigate to and fro with ease.  He also possesses the amazing ability to catch up quickly with others running at top speed despite walking as if he has a touch of Frankenstienitis.<br/><br/>I like the film.  Sure it leaves me guessing at times and filling in a few holes on my own, but ya gotta admire a guy who can take a screwdriver in the eye and not even so much as whimper!"

"Anonymous_Maxine","10","0","2","2 April 2001"," John Carpenter's classic film that set the standard for the slasher genre.
","The story of the original Halloween takes advantage of the general public's stereotypical fear of mental patients. They are quite often seen as faceless `crazies,' which, more often than not, are assumed to be dangerous to other people. <br/><br/>Halloween is one of the earlier slasher films, and it was a true role model for countless other mediocre films that would later try to reproduce the suspense that it created, but it has never been equaled. There was very little focus on special effects in Halloween (the film is pretty much void of them), instead, the emphasis was placed heavily on suspense.<br/><br/>The threat of Michael Myers, the relentless killer in this film, is even more real because the movie starts off with Michael as an eight-year-old boy, and he murders his older sister with a carving knife. The fact that Michael does not speak a single word in the entire film, or ANY of the Halloween films for that matter, gives the feeling that he is not only relentless, but also completely uncaring, which is one of the ways that his monstrous and menacing character was created. <br/><br/>Laurie Strode, the other main character, is a slightly introverted high school student who doesn't really get out much, and she turns out to be Michael Myers' sister. They have in common the fact that they are both antisocial (Laurie is slightly, and Michael is completely), and Michael has escaped the mental hospital and returned to Haddonfield, IL, his hometown, to kill Laurie, the same way he killed his other sister 15 years earlier.<br/><br/>
Dr. Loomis, Michael's psychiatrist, demonstrates the other theme of Halloween, which deals with the equal relentlessness of the law. He is absolutely determined to bring Michael back to captivity, completely convinced that he will kill again despite having spent 15 years in a mental hospital, and not speaking a single word the entire time. Dr. Loomis is determined to go to any lengths possible to capture Michael Myers, and will not rest until he is captured.<br/><br/>The mask that Michael wears in the film is very important to the atmosphere that surrounds him. It adds to the theme about faceless mental patients. The mask not only has a dull, expressionless look to it, but it is also completely colorless, and this makes it even scarier because it gives Michael a very uncaring and monotonous look without actually showing his real face. While it is unnerving to see a killer's face, the terror created by a faceless and emotionless and relentless killer is by far much more frightening. Also, there are several scenes in the beginning of the movie, before he has obtained his mask from a local store, that show Michael from the neck down, or with just his shoulder in the foreground, or one of his hands, etc. The point is that they do not show his face or even his head until he has his mask on.<br/><br/>Another thing that added to the suspense of the movie was the sound. The sound played a huge role in Halloween, because there was almost no gore at all and virtually no special effects whatsoever. The music was relatively simple, yet provided a very suspenseful atmosphere. John Carpenter, the writer and director of Halloween, said about the sound, `There is a point in making a movie where you experience the final result. For me, it's when I see an interlock of the picture with the music. All of a sudden a new voice is added to the raw, naked-without-effects-or-music footage.' This is clearly achieved in this film, because not only is the theme music very effective in creating atmosphere, but it has also become one of the most famous musical scores in a film in cinematic history.<br/><br/>There is a lot of foreshadowing in this film, such as the scene where Laurie is in a car with a friend, whose father happens to be the town sheriff. He tells the girls that someone broke into the hardware store, and he assumed it was kids because all they stole was a Halloween mask and a few knives. Another small point here that sets Halloween apart from other horror movies is that the person who makes a mistake of this magnitude is usually the first to get killed. This is where the dramatic suspense really starts because even though the characters on screen are totally oblivious, we as the audience know that it was Michael that broke into the store.<br/><br/>
When Dr. Loomis and a young nurse go to pick Michael up at the mental hospital to take him to a court hearing, they arrive to find the patients wandering around aimlessly in the pouring rain. It's nighttime, so basically all the viewer sees are several white hospital gowns moving around. The viewer does not see any faces at all, and this shows how Michael has lived for 15 years and he is seen as an insane person, just like all the others. However, he is able to steal the car from Loomis and the nurse, which shows that he is a capable enemy. It is also noteworthy that Loomis acknowledged the unusualness of the mental patients wandering around in the rain at night. That is exactly the kind of thing that a lesser horror film would not bother to address.<br/><br/>The pace of the story is also fairly constant. Once Michael gets to Haddonfield and begins to pursue his sister, the suspense is almost non-stop. John Carpenter ingeniously sets up the film so that the audience is never able to relax. The suspense is constant, and when the real scares come, they are that much more effective. This is a true classic horror film, and once you've seen it, all of these cheesy rip-offs (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legends, even Scream, to a certain extent) will never be the same."

"A-Ron-2","7","0","1","12 July 2000"," The founder of the 'Slasher' genre
","As a Gen-Xer (whatever the hell that means) I spent most of my summers from age 10 to age 19 watching slasher films, as this was the only genre of movie that directly targeted people of my demographic.  As I the genre moved on (I do not say 'evolved') I wearied of it, and as an adult I can see some real problems with the core conventions of it.  However, being stubborn, I cannot bring myself to simply dismiss the films out of hand (well, definitely some of them).  I refuse to believe that I wasted all those hours doing something that is inherently stupid, or wrong-headed.  Thus, as an academic, I decided to 'study' them... now I can legitimate my vices by using big words like 'semiotics' and 'cultural signifiers.'  This makes me happy, and allows me to conveniently sidestep hypocrisy. ;)<br/><br/>With that introduction, I would like to point out that John Carpenter's Halloween is actually a pretty decent movie.  It brought together several disparate genres and conventions and melded them into one interesting (and highly marketable) genre.  The original Halloween is much like the original Jaws and should be viewed independently of its many, sub-par sequels (although, of all the sequential horror films, this one was probably the best... not particularly high praise).<br/><br/>The wonderful thing about Carpenter, is that he can do things that would make another director look foolish, and pull them off.  His soundtrack is LAME...  but for some odd reason it works really, really well and has become the cornerstone for horror movie soundtracks.<br/><br/>Carpenter's rampant homages to other directors and other films throughout Halloween are both fun and give us a certain insight into the character of his film-making.<br/><br/>However, the most interesting thing that he does, the most innovative and groundbreaking thing, is his use of the 'killer's eye camera', Carpenter claimed that this was simply a device to mask the identity of the killer, but that is patently stupid.  This camera perspective identifies the audience with the killer and creates a wierd sort of relationship between audience and action.  I find this to be at once disconcerting and again brilliant.  Carpenter really creates a mood and an attitude for this film that would be copied again and again.<br/><br/>Although the film is relatively shallow in the characterization/story department, it does manage to establish (or re-establish) the conventions of the horror genre, but also lays out the essential archetype of the slasher film.  I love this stuff.  Carpenter was either lucky or a visionary, or perhaps a bit of both.<br/><br/>Even 20 years after this film was originally made, and after countless viewings, there are still scenes that are surprisingly frightening: the scene in the laundry room, Myers rising from the floor behind Laurie, the confrontation in the closet with the weird lighting through slats.<br/><br/>The one thing that Carpenter really accomplishes is the feeling of isolation.  He manages to make you feel completely isolated while living in a suburban neighborhood.  You realize that even though these characters cannot be more than a few hundred feet from another person, and have phones and radios and TVs, they are still completely vulnerable to the killer. Halloween did for suburbia what Jaws did for the ocean, made you realize that you were vulnerable in a place that you wouldn't have believed. Truly an astounding feat.<br/><br/>This film is quite simply brilliant.  now I am not praising it too highly. Let's face facts, it was a low-budget monster movie, with lousy special effects, a relatively lame story, a terrible soundtrack (synthesized keyboards, come on ;) and some truly bad acting (although Pleasance and Jamie Lee Curtis did quite well for themselves).  However, with all this going against it, you really can't take your eyes of the movie.  It has become a cultural icon (and rightly so) and has generated countless rip-offs.  I can only say that Carpenter possesses a kind of magic that is impressive (well, usually).  This film is a must-see for any aspiring, low-budget film-maker, anyone who likes to be scared, and anyone that has a real passion for interesting cinema."
"dave-893","10","0","1","6 July 2000"," It might be an old film, but its horror at its best!
","I am a great fan of the horror film, and Halloween was the one that started me off.  Unlike the current lot of horror pics, Halloween focus' on suspense.  The two characters Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode are extremely likeable. Set in Haddonfield we see a former resident of the area return to his family home- Michael Myers.  Years ago he had murdered his sister then sent to a mental institute.  Now he has broken out and is on the rampage.  We follow the life of a local student Laurie and her friends. The death scenes are amazing, and Carpenter knows how to scare.  This film simply shows Myers as the murderer, which is the way it should be.  Later films go into his background- Druid cults etc. The build up, though slightly long, explodes at the end.  A must see for all.  However, the sequels are meagre compared to this."
"Blockhead","Null","0","1","30 June 2000"," The original slasher film
","Halloween.  What else can I say?   One of the most significant films ever made, John Carpenter's 1978 chiller classic brought a new wave of terror. Time alone has not destroyed any of its power to shock, but what sadly has is the endless number of cheap spin-offs, turning plot twists into cliches.<br/><br/>However, the piano score is excellent, and the complete lack of blood makes a more suspenseful film.  Gore - hounds will be disappointed, but what has to be remembered is that this is actually a study of surburban terror, rather than horror.  There are many tense moments in the film, the lurking presence of Michael Myers to the backdrop of the haunting piano score do the film fine justice. Sadly, this film gave birth to the much reviled genre, totally inventing ""the babysitter in peril"" movie, so many people give this film no credit at all, rarely seeing the film before making this opinion.<br/><br/>SO - when you watch this film, just remember that this was the original slasher, and try to blot ""The Burning"" and ""The Mutilator"" (or any other low budget gore-fest) from your memory.  You will actually be quite surprised at the quality of the film, and you will slowly succumb to the tension that dramatically pours from this movie. SUMMARY - Top movie.  Highly recommended."

"jamie-81","10","0","1","18 June 2000"," A CLASSIC!
","With the exception of PSYCHO, no other horror flick ever came close to the impact Halloween had on it's audience, or box office sales. John Carpenter's direction of this film made it what it is today. A classic, scary, and simple film of teenagers being stalked (by evil itself) on Halloween night. Carpenter did not have to resort to blood or gore to scare the hell out of his audience. This film was simple and to the point! And has a musical score, that to this day still gives me the creeps. There are only a handful of directors (DePalma, Hitchcock, and Donner) that can pull off scares legitimately. A few great examples: Blake Edwards' Experiment in Terror, Richard Donner's The Omen, and John Badham's Reflections of Murder. On a personal note: These directors will always reign supreme."
"jhaggardjr","10","0","2","6 June 2000"," The best slasher film ever made
","Here is the ultimate slasher movie. ""Halloween"" is argubly the best slasher picture ever made. It's also the scariest movie I've ever seen. This film sends chills down my spine every time I see it. John Carpenter's first big hit is about a troubled little boy named Michael Myers who kills his sister in a small Illinois town on Halloween night in 1963. 15 years later, he escapes the mental institution that he'd been staying at and returns home to pick up where he left off. Jamie Lee Curtis shot to stardom after this film, and she would become known as the ""scream queen"". She's terrific as Laurie Strode. Donald Pleasence is also effective as the doctor who treated the killer when he was in the insane asylum, and now tries to stop him before he starts killing again. Nancy Loomis and P.J. Soles provide most of the comic relief as Curtis' best friends. You get to know these characters and you hope they survive the nightmare. That's aspect makes the film even more effective. Also on the plus side: the camera work by cinematographer Dean Cundey is scary especially when the camera comes from the point of view of the killer (Cundey would go on to do the cinematography for big blockbuster hits such as ""Jurassic Park"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy). This technique comes in the opening shot of the film, and it's very effective. The film score by Carpenter is one of the most chilling music scores I've ever heard for a motion picture. Even the mask that Michael Myers wears freaks me out. As far as the sequels go in this series, the second and seventh movies in the ""Halloween"" series (which feature Jamie Lee) are good, the third (which had nothing to do with Michael Myers), fourth, fifth, and sixth movies (which do not feature Jamie Lee) are bad. But none of the six sequels top this one. This is a definite must-see for people who love horror movies. Don't miss it!<br/><br/>**** (out of four)"
"stephengward","6","0","1","19 March 2000"," Anyone for pumpkin?
","A classic film, genuinely full of suspense and with more then its fair share of brown trouser moments! The first and by far the best of the series it catapulted Jamie Lee Curtis' career into the limelight. John Carpenter provides a memorable and haunting score that complements the on screen action. Perhaps the only down side to the film is the super human status afforded to killer 'Michael Myers'. This factor sometimes detracts from certain atmospheric moments that the film contains. This guy has every thing done to him as his victims try to escape; yet bullets seem to simply bounce off him. The film actually benefits from not having a copious budget. Script is relied upon to good effect. There is a look to the movie that may have been absent had a big money budget been available. Though most of this can be attributed to John Carpenter's masterful directing."

","The original slasher film by John Carpenter is also the best of the best. It initiated an entire genre of teen horror films, and psycho killer thrillers.

It still has the capacity to get under the skin, even if you keep telling yourself it's only a movie."

","Some might dismiss this as weak storytelling and pretensious moviemaking. But no, the by the book textbook horror techniques employed by John Carpenter in HALLOWEEN are worth being studied for the aspiring moviemaker who would like to study the essence of what suspense really is and what defines SCARY and what distinquishes SCARY from just merely being GRISLY. This is a number of cliches packed into one brilliantly directed 90 minute horror film and its only originality comes in the simplicity of the story. There are some scenes that are predictable, but it was meant to be that way. We dont want PJ Soles to go back into the car. We wanna scream at Laurie for going to the house across the street. Horror is also about misdirection as Carpenter says in his commentary. Letting us know where he think he's gonna go but surprising us really effectively. This will forever be a classic in my book and my guiltypleasure favorite in the genre. Grade A-"

","The movie that started the slasher craze is probably the best of them all. Halloween is what every kind of slasher film should be; suspense, character development, story, etc. I have seen other slasher films (like New Nightmare) but none of them have surpassed this movie in any way. The plot is so realistic. A little boy commits murder and seems so innocent, so no one considers him to be very dangerous, except for Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who goes after Micheal Myers when he escapes from a sanitarium and goes home. One of the best qualities of this film is how Micheal is always hiding in the shadows, until he goes after someone of course. Also, how there is no gore. When a movie has a lot of gore, you can tell there is no story and the gore is just a distraction. The best horror film ever!"

","Halloween is one of those horror movies that you must see.  From the chilling opening sequence POV shot through the film's climax, this film is great.  Michael Myers appears out of nowhere and disappears even faster, and the fact that he is a living human (?) makes it brilliant.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks are the fact that he just doesn't seem to die which makes him seem more of a supernatural being than a human psycho (which is scarier).  The other detraction is the sequence in which all of Laurie Strobe's friends get killed.  It just seems out of place for such a smart horror film.  Not that it shouldn't be there, but it almost seems like an interlude where the audience gets their cheap scares.<br/><br/>All in all, classic horror film that loses its realism by the end and becomes a parody of itself.  Nevertheless, it still has some brilliant sequences that make up for it."

","This is one I've been meaning to comment on for awhile, but with all the new releases out there, I just havent had a chance. Let me start with this:  ""Halloween"" is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough.....15 years ago, young Michael Myers murdered his sister in cold blood on Halloween night.  Now he's back to complete his gruesome work.<br/><br/>Jamie Lee Curtis, in her first starring role, plays Laurie Strode, a high school student unaware of her past (as are we all....it is revealed to us in ""Halloween 2"" and expanded on in 4 and ""H20"")  She is the intended victim of Michael's murderous plan.  She delivers a top notch performance and plays the strong willed survivor with great ease and skill.<br/><br/>Most of the other roles are cliched, PJ Soles' trampy Linda, and Nancy Loomis' somewhat self-absorbed Annie.  The late Donald Pleasance as Dr. Sam Loomis (Michaels psychiatrist, who is determined to never let him loose) delivers a solid acting job, and is belivable in his determination to stop the evil that has descended on the small town of Haddonfield.<br/><br/>One of the best roles in the movie is surprisingly never mentioned.  Dick Warlock as ""the Shape"", which is what adult Michael is referred to in the closing credits.  His methodical stalking and mechanical movements made the unstoppable Michael that much more terrifying.  Even his walk was scary, when he's pursuing Laurie across the street to the Doyle residence.<br/><br/>This movie broke new ground in 1978, and was even honored in homage by Kevin Williamson (oh come on...""Scream"" was almost entirely influenced by ""Halloween"").  This is a horror and film classic, and retains its punch to this day, unlike the majority of horror films today (including the aforementioned ""Scream"").<br/><br/>5 out of 5"

Watching this and then watching Scream, u can see the similarities and differences of the two. However more differences, which could be good or bad. Scream doesn't know how to chill you or scare you like Halloween. But what made scream good was the fact that it knows the genre and therefore knows how to satirize it and still remain entertaining. Halloween, on the other hand, is almost pure terror, erieness, and it SCARES you, thanks to a solid direction under Carpenter and production under Debrah Hill and Moustafa Akkad, and the music by Carpentar also helps a WHOLE LOT. Oh, and don't forget Jamie Lee Curtis and Donald Pleasnce performances, which are really good.
