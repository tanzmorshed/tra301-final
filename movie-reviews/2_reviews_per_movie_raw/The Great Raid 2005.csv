","My name is Cecilia and being from Manila this film is very personal to me because my grandfather sacrificed his life during WWII. According to eyewitness accounts, he was tied to a post, doused with kerosene and set on fire. I am watching this film to somehow pay tribute to him and those who selflessly gave up their lives to ensure a free and humane future for all of us. I felt though that the film underestimated what we Filipinos really went through during the war. It would have been just to include the other atrocities perpetuated by the Japanese: babies thrown in the air and caught with bayonets, women brutally raped and breasts carved out, or the massacre of approximately 100,000 unarmed and innocent civilians during the battle for the liberation of Manila on the first days of February 1945. Nevertheless, I am grateful for director John Dahl for shedding light on a chapter in our history that many people hardly know about , specially the present generation, The Bataan Death March."
"eckmanmj-1","10","121","146","18 August 2005"," Pleasantly surprised...
","I knew almost nothing of this film before I saw it but based on a couple comments I had heard, I went with my dad to see it tonight.<br/><br/>Some people commented on how slow the movie is during the beginning, and although that is true, it is there to give you time to develop a story and actual care about the characters. This is definitely not a movie for people with near zero attention spans from the MTV Generation.<br/><br/>This movie also doesn't rely on gimmicks such as CGI or what I call ""shaky camera syndrome"" where the filmmakers insist on making the audience nauseous by running around with handy-cams (ala Bourne Supremacy).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the story and thought all the roles were well acted. The final raid scene is amazing. They did a really good job of explaining exactly what they wanted to do beforehand and when it actually happened, you understood where everyone was running to and what they were trying to accomplish.<br/><br/>Excellent movie, and highly recommended. Definitely one of the best movies so far of the year, I'm just sad that almost no one has heard about it and the movie has received so little promotion. I doubt this picture will even make $20 million here.<br/><br/>And one more thing, I thought it was a very tasteful and respectful thing to do at the end during the credits where they showed archival footage of the real soldiers being rescued."
"eichelbergersports","8","156","211","3 August 2005"," Small tale told in a big way
","While Hollywood has gone after the Nazis and the European campaign in World War II over and over again, ad nauseam, little has been produced depicting the Pacific Theatre or the thousands of Americans and others who perished there.<br/><br/>In fact, only a handful of motion pictures have touched on the subject over the last two decades, namely Steven Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun,"" Terrance Malik's ""The Thin Red Line,"" and the Nicolas Cage bomb, ""Windtalkers."" The best film in this genre was probably 1957's ""Bridge On The River Kwai,"" which won Oscars for David Lean and Alex Guinness, among others, but that was almost 50 years ago.<br/><br/>Now John Dahl (""Rounders,"" ""Joyride,"" the TV series ""Tilt"") has shed some light on a little-known rescue attempt in the waning days of the conflict in the Philippine Islands. ""The Great Raid"" is a fine little film, smart, patriotic and fairly historically accurate.<br/><br/>The film begins with a crisp narration (accompanied by actual film footage) of the quick successes of the Imperial Japanese Army in the days following Pearl Harbor. Gen. Douglas MacArthur - thanks to Roosevelt's decision to devote more to the European effort through the Lend-Lease to Churchill program - is forced to evacuate the Philippines and retreat to Australia.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, thousands of American troops are trapped by the swift-moving Japanese forces on the islands of Bataan and Corrigidor and are compelled to surrender. While WWII German brutality is everywhere in motion picture, few have addressed the stark horrors of the Bataan Death March. Even this movie skirts the terror with a simple voice-over in filling in the background story of a group of surviving prisoners held for over three years.<br/><br/>Receiving word of mass killing of American POWs by the Japanese, top brass in the Pacific orders a raid on a camp still behind enemy lines, led by Army Ranger Lt. Col. Mucci (Benjamin Bratt, ""Law & Order) and Capt. Prince (James Franco, ""Spiderman,"" ""Spiderman 2"").<br/><br/>Military minutia abounds with the planning and execution of the assault, which pits a handful of rangers against over 200 battle-hardened Japanese troops, led by sadistic Maj. Nagai (Motoki Kobiyashi).<br/><br/>The movie also shows the strong relationship between the Americans and Filipinos which was not the greatest in the years after the Spanish-American War, but was cemented against the common Nipponese enemy. Nice composition between rangers, prison camp and the occupied capital of Manilla, where civilian nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielson, ""Gladiator,"" ""One Hour Photo"")is working with the Filipino underground resistance.<br/><br/>This is no ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and the acting sometimes leaves a bit to be desired, but the strength of the story, the fact it was inspired by true events, and the historical importance of the film, make this one a must-see, even for casual fans of the genre. It will not make much money, but it was very important that it was made."
"jackov","9","109","148","13 August 2005"," Good movie, good ensemble cast
","Old fashioned movie with an ensemble cast instead of A list powered star who uses the movie as a vehicle to command top dollar is rare these days in Hollywood. That's why this movie worked. They assembled a great cast of fine, top notched actors together from the USA and the Philippines but no ""superstar"". They all portrayed their characters and meshed out the story without any modern day politicking and criticism. I don't know about you but that is truly refreshing in this day and age of movies.<br/><br/>I'd recommend this movie to anyone. Major criticisms seem to be that there's no deep complex characters and no protagonist. I think that is a positive for this movie because the POWs are the main characters themselves. The men and women just did what needed to be done for their countrymen and their country. There was deep motivation because someone had been scarred when they were 15 and thus acts this way. Most of the characters are real life people and you can't focus on one or two characters like in a fictional story that someone wrote.<br/><br/>It's too bad this movie won't do well at the office because it doesn't cater to the teens and their expendable income. The limited wide release also won't help it but I know for those who watch it they'll be touched. They'll know that there were and are sacrifices being made to ensure that the country they live in are safe and protected."
"mercybell","10","68","91","12 August 2005"," Very well done and educated snapshot of a country at war
","This was a great film, and a nice escape to reality from all the superhero, fantastical, and over-hyped movie star fare we've gotten this summer.<br/><br/>The biggest accolade I can offer this flick is that it sticks to history in ways rarely seen in Hollywood films, and even then it's not dry or boring, not inaccessible to those not particularly versed in history. It shows beautifully how exciting and thrilling real history can be. The liberties it takes aren't too offensive (I can't say much without spoiling the story, but although the ""romance"" in this film didn't exist, it's not particularly gratuitous or hard to believe, and there were many wartime romances between people who met in the occupied Philippines), but on a whole they valiantly stuck to the stories. It doesn't revel in clich√©s or surrender to the cheap thrill of pyrotechnics, which so many war films do. Since it looks to true events for inspiration, there's a happy lack of predictibility and ""been there, done that"". Not to say that there are any talk-of-the-summer plot twists, but it keeps you on your toes because you're dealing with life, and is often surprising. The film brings you down to the level of its characters, and it doesn't treat you like an outsider.<br/><br/>As a Filipino American and history buff, I was thrilled and proud to see so many Filipino actors in the film (particularly the wonderful -- and gorgeous -- Cesar Montano) and to finally see this little known but mammoth part of WWII recalled on such a public scale. The film takes place over 5 days in January, as the Rangers prepare to take the camp. Its three interconnected story lines -- the prisoners in Cabanatuan, the Rangers, and the underground movement in Manila (including a nurse played by Nielsen who smuggles in Quinine to prisoners) -- give a fairly accurate and well rounded portrait of the landscape of war in the Philippines, although by the end of the film you do feel as if you've only seen the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>The acting is lovely. There aren't any ""Oscar"" scenes or the like, just solid ensemble acting, and the leads, Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Cesar Montano, and Connie Nielsen, are excellent for what they're given. The writing doesn't try to over-dramatise or ""soapify"" anything, it stays level headed and just plays. It felt a lot like a less ridiculous ""Gettysburg"" or a much tamer ""Black Hawk Down"" or a much MUCH shorter ""The Longest Day"". Surprisingly, for a war film, there are relatively few ""what I'm here for"" speeches, which is refreshing. The ones it does have aren't particularly irksome or obnoxious. It's not particularly violent (except for the unnerving opening scene -- a recreation of the Palawan massacre -- and one scene in the camp, I'd have given it a PG-13 rating), but it IS disturbing. And although they hardly began to show the full extent of the atrocities committed, the point is made clear, heartrendingly I might add. Two scenes, involving Filipino underground workers and another at the camp, had me in tears.<br/><br/>Honestly, this is NOT for people looking for a testosterone fueled action flick. The action is strictly historical (except for a hand to hand fight at the end which I doubt happened). At times it feels like a documentary, and other times it's like watching a memoir. Neither is this film the ""rah rah"" flag waving fest the advertising makes it out to be (thank goodness). In fact it pays great homage to the work of the Philippine people, underground resistance (a portion of the film which seemed a bit out of place in the film but which had me enamored and on edge), and guerilla fighters, all of which touched me deeply. As a Hollywood studio film goes, it's an academic, nearly blow by blow accounting of the events surrounding the raid on the Cabanatuan prison camp, but because of the nature of the story and not because of empty manipulation, it is intense, inspiring, and exciting. Don't expect the next ""Paths of Glory"" or ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" or that calibre of film-making, but I hope that this does well because in its own way it's different from so much of the mindnumbing junk that is out there, it attempts to portray a war story smartly, chose to tell a story that doesn't spell out big money, and without being overbearingly in-your-face patriotic, it pays homage to and shares the experiences of the American and Filipino men and women who endured the hell that was World War II in the Philippines."
"sddavis63","6","7","7","2 December 2013"," A Rare Movie Look At A Japanese POW Camp
","After the American evacuation of the Philippines following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, thousands of American servicemen were abandoned to the Japanese enemy, finding themselves facing brutal conditions in Japanese POW camps, and feeling forgotten by their country. ""The Great Raid"" is the portrayal of a rescue mission to save five hundred of those POWs at the Cabanatuan camp before they're killed by their captors, as the Americans begin to close in during the closing days of the war.<br/><br/>As far as I can recall there haven't been very many movies depicting conditions in Japanese POW camps. ""Bridge On The River Kwai"" springs to mind, but this is the only other one I think I've come across. It's always hard to judge the accuracy of how the enemy is portrayed in a movie like this. In this case, though, we do know that the Japanese were in fact brutal captors. Surrender was the ultimate dishonour, and prisoners, therefore, were seen as deserving of neither honour nor respect. The conditions portrayed in the camp, therefore, were believable and probably historically accurate.<br/><br/>The portrayal of camp conditions is one of the highlights of the movie. The other is the actual raid carried out. It was portrayed in great detail and, again, in a very believable way. The basic problem with this movie, though, is that it repeatedly seems to get bogged down. Frankly, when the movie strays from those two subjects it just isn't that interesting, and all the various sidebars end up making this longer than it needed to be. The character of Margaret Utinski (played by Connie Nielsen) was especially problematic. Utinski was a real person - and a winner of the Medal of Honour - but there are historical questions about her life, and there was certainly no romance involved in her actions, as is suggested throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Aside from Nielsen, the cast were fine, but in all honesty no one stood out to me as outstanding. As I've suggested, there are certainly aspects of this movie that make it worthwhile viewing, but it certainly can't be mistaken for a masterpiece. (6/10)"
"tcbautista","10","77","105","16 August 2005"," Filipinos Fight Side by Side for Freedom and U.S. Democracy
","The Great Raid ----- August 12, 2005, a review by Teresita ""Terry"" Bautista<br/><br/>Berkeley, CA ¬ñ In the near-empty Shattuck Cinema, I gave myself the birthday gift of watching The Great Raid on opening night. This film, a chronicle of early 1945 events in The Philippines, has been highly anticipated in the U.S. Filipino Community, mostly by those of us who are fighting to achieve full equity for our Veteranos. <br/><br/>My mom, aunt and uncle joined me, as the initial documentary footage validated the historical scenes of war and resistance, as if you were there over 60 years ago. As expected, my mom made constant commentary throughout the film, as the scenes brought back, often frightening, memories. Anxiously, she recounted in soft whispers of her bout with malaria, which meant sure death, until her father decided she would not be left behind, as they ran every day to escape the Japanese. Like the film's prisoner of war, quinine was the saving prescription for my mom's malaria-stricken body.<br/><br/>The Great Raid is an army flick, similar to the scores I've seen in the past 50 years. Less melodramatic, though powerful in its interpretation of the human condition during war, the movie takes you into a POW camp where 500 detainees eke out survival under the Japanese flag. The acting was understated and reflected deep agony and despair without the flair of cinema-edged bravado. No John Waynes or Anthony Quinns in this version. The casting was done with a sense of nuance for each of the heroic personas.<br/><br/>The subplots were gripping. The valiant efforts of the underground that smuggled medicine to the ill and dying prisoners; the array of authority figures in the military who made heart-rending decisions about strategy and tactics; the rescue mission that galvanized a unit of 120 special rangers who had yet to see the extreme fires of combat; the unlikely relationships that bound survivors in their fate.<br/><br/>Some high points of the painful, two and a half- hour mendacity tensed you to the edge of your seat ----- the brutality of the Japanese, not withstanding the execution of ten prisoners for one escapee; the burning funeral of a hundred Filipinos, many of them women and children villagers, near the Cabanatuan Prison; the spectacular, surprise invasion of the Japanese camp; the courage of the Filipino Guerrilas and their exemplary warrior spirits led by Captain Pajota, as their steeled defense of a bridge held the Japanese and their tanks captive and effectively severed an avenue of retaliations to the explosions and attack in their war camp. <br/><br/>The sacrifices of the fighting forces to liberate the Philippines were stark and many. The younger generations, especially those of Filipino descent, are urged to see what their homeland heroes were made of. This long war was waged in face-to-face, hand-to-hand combat with bravery for duty and beyond.<br/><br/>I went to see this as a way of honoring my dad, a U.S. Army private, who survived WWII, found his war bride, and fathered his first-born. I have deep respect and admiration for those like my Pop, who still live to tell their stories, who today are still struggling for full recognition of shed blood, sweat, and tears, at a time where their homeland joined the world's battlefields. <br/><br/>WWII Filipino Veterans soldiers deserve Full Equity Now!<br/><br/>####"
"elsewhere9000","10","136","194","5 August 2005"," The Great Raid proves that history is always more compelling than fiction
","This film expertly balances the need for authenticity with the need for compelling drama. It starts out great, slows slightly in the middle, and finishes off with the best filmed action sequence I have ever seen. The raid itself is choreographed and paced perfectly, so that the viewer understands exactly what is happening, why it is happening and who is doing it. Many aspects of this film have never been done before in a war movie. The craft is also expertly balanced - the film looks, sounds and feels accurate and not bounded by Hollywood conventions. Simply put, it will go down as one of the very best modern war films, among those who can tell when a film is exceptional."
"ybeafool","9","85","123","6 August 2005"," True account of Historical WWII Rescue
","I feel that this is an important film for people to see regarding the little known but most impressive rescue attempt made during WWII. I went with some friends who enjoyed it very much also and considering that we were women going to see a war movie, we did not know what to expect. We were treated to a satisfying and moving entertainment experience and also learned new things about what the previous generation had to go through. We already know about the horrors of war and it was moving to see the heroic exploits undertaken by some very brave men to save their comrades from Japanese annihilation. There were good character developments as well as action sequences. THe newsreel and actual footage that bookends the film add to its impact as one can compare the actual characters with their counterparts in the film. History classes in schools should be taken to see the film."
"odinz9","Null","86","133","6 August 2005"," Superb War Movie Done Right
","THE GREAT RAID does everything right, on all levels, especially by framing itself with real footage from those times which, in some cases, features the actual events and participants. The acting is uniformly excellent, the pacing is flawless, and the historical context does not short-change any aspect of the story, be it cruelty and horror in war or bravery and nobility in suffering or even dignity and honor in combat. This is in many ways a movie made the way they used to make movies, but without the rah-rah patriotism or sneering social commentary. What it brings home simply by presenting the story in a straightforward manner is what we used to be capable of, what we once were and stood for, and what we fought against, and why. To be reminded of this is sobering, if not harrowing. Definitely one of the best movies my family and I have seen in a long time, it's recommended whole- heartedly for everyone. And Benjamin Bratt turns in a mature, restrained performance that marks him for great things on the big screen."
"mstomaso","8","10","12","21 August 2005"," Solid traditional semi-historical war film
","In terms of lasting value, I believe The Great Raid is one of the best films to have graced the screen this year. It's a straightforward war movie about unsung heroes. The story involves the basic facts of a Japanese POW camp which was liberated near the end of the Japanese occupation of the Phillipines. American soldiers and Phillipino resistance fighters teamed up to chance a daring raid on the heavily guarded camp. Fictional elements are added to the story, such as a surprisingly compelling love story, and believable explorations of friendships among both prisoners and fighters.<br/><br/>The script is good, the acting and editing superb, and the photography is very good. The film is violent, but does not wallow in flying guts and body parts as has been the recent fashion. Nothing flashy, nothing overwhelming, just solid craftsmanship. This is a film which is less concerned with making an impression than it is with telling a story, and I found that very refreshing. In my opinion, the film succeeds completely in telling its simple story and will likely be recognized for years to come as one of the better war films of recent times. All of the acting in this film is excellent, but watch for the standout performances from Marton Csokas, Joseph Fiennes, James Franco and Connie Nielsen."

","I saw a preview in Michigan, last Monday. I liked the love story. As mentioned in the former comment, the graphics, scenery, etc. were excellent. I thought the actors were great. I especially liked the music; I thought it matched the movie well. The movie was realistic, profound and inspiring; I was impressed. Additionally, my fianc√© (who has a degree in history), his sister, and my brother, also thought the movie was exceptional. The director was there after the showing I went to as well, and one thing that stands out that he said was that war veterans, in general, are reluctant to tell about themselves and their heroics, as they felt that they were simply doing their duty. Especially after seeing the movie, I think it is even more important for war veterans and heroes alike, to come forward with their extraordinary stories, to inspire us all, and to remind us that there are honorable people out there.

","I am Don, a Filipino. It is not every time that you see a movie where we Filipinos fight with Americans and at the same time play an important role. I just hope this film will clear our country of being called ""The sick man of Asia"". I just hope that after you watch this movie, you will see how we fought the Japanese with just our own ingenuity. Australia and New Zealand has banned Philippines from their tourist spots thereby contributing to the already ailing Filipino economy-which gets most of its dollar income from tourists. I guess this is how their ""great"" countries repay us for delaying the Japanese invasion-which could have reached them if the Philippines just caved in to the Japanese. Have they forgotten that it was because of our raped Filipino women, impaled children, and beheaded and/or butchered men were the reasons why they are so ""great"" now? Foreigners ask us why can't we rise from our past like the Japanese. We Filipinos usually just bow down and think solemnly of the past and say to ourselves ""How can we?! When all of our gold were taken by Japan?!"". How unjust it is that the world just treats our country with such disgust when it is the Philippines who endured the most for them so that they can have the liberty and abundance that they are enjoying now.<br/><br/>I just want to add a spoiler here. I was so filled with emotion when Capatain Pajota faced the tank with just the submachine gun - knowing the bomb might not work and that he could have been ripped or blown away by the tank rounds. I applaud the people behind this movie for not cutting that part for it is a revelation of the bravery of the Filipino. I could just remember the time when our troops were pulled out of Iraq because two of our fellowmen were hostages. Our president pulled them out. It would create political instability if she did not do so. We are not cowards. We can fight anyone carrying a laser gun with just our fists. We can find Bin Laden and hunt him down with our rangers for days,months even carrying only a tin can for water supply and just using a rusted Enfield or a worn down M1Garand. Our rangers in Mindanao battle the terrorists knowing they will die on that day because of insufficient armor and bullets. The Filipino rangers' only defense is their superb knowledge of the terrain. Our rangers count the trees and even know their location thereby making them immune to traps or landmines. We Filipinos are not cowards. I hope when you watch this film you will have a different view of us. That we deserve the proper respect and acknowledgment. We are the proud Filipino - and we have been fighting foreigners off our land for five hundred years now...and you know what-- we are still fighting foreigners off our land.<br/><br/>It is not because Philippines was backward that's why it was colonized and invaded... it is because the Philippines was colonized and invaded over and over again that's why the Philippines is backward."

Unfortunately, war is brutal and dangerous. It's important to educate young people of the true aspects of combat. This movie shows the realities of life both within a group of elite Army rangers given a daring, overwhelming rescue assignment and life within a Japanese POW camp in the Phillipines, survivors of the atrocities of the Bataan Death March who've felt both abandoned by their country and hopeful of rescue. Also depicted is the courage and faithfulness of the Phillipine underground. This film leaves you with an understanding of the quest for glory that has nothing to do with fame."
"fact275-1","9","15","23","8 August 2005"," A tear in my eye as I sat watching, proud to be an American
","I am a former US military historian and had the opportunity on Saturday evening to view an advanced screening of The Great Raid. The screenplay was based on two books: William Breuer's ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan"" and Hampton Sides' ""Ghost Soldiers.""<br/><br/>It is January 1945. The U.S. Sixth Army has landed in Luzon in the Philippines and is advancing upon Manila. The retreating Japanese Army are under orders from Tokyo to kill all the prisoners of war they hold. The Japanese do not respect those who surrender and also do not want the POWs to testify to the many Japanese war crimes committed from the invasion onward. Early on the movie, we are shown the real life war atrocity at an island POW camp where Americans are forced into air raid shelters and then immolated.<br/><br/>The Sixth Army's commanding officer, General Kreuger (Vietnam veteran Dale Dye, Captain, USMC (Ret), who was the film's military adviser) has intelligence from ""stay behinds"" (Americans who fled into the hills after the surrender) and Philippine guerrillas that the Cabanatuan POWs are in grave jeopardy as the Sixth Army closes in.<br/><br/>Kreuger turns to Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt, commander of the 6th Ranger Battalion. Unlike other Ranger battalions, Mucci's Rangers are untested, comprised primarily of soldiers who came to the Pacific Theater of Operations as animal handlers. Mucci has trained his men well though and yearns for a mission where they can prove themselves.<br/><br/>Mucci selects Captain Bob Prince (James Franco), a young Stanford graduate, to plan and lead the raid on Cabantuan. Though Mucci tells Prince that the Captain will lead the raid, Mucci is to accompany Prince and his 120 volunteers on the mission, causing frictions along the way.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, at Cabantuan, the remaining 500+ POWs are in the worst state, the healthier ones having been moved to work forced labor elsewhere in Japanese territory. The POWs are led by Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) who is racked with malaria. He does his best to keep his men disciplined and away from the wrath of their sadistic Japanese captors. Gibson's best friend is Captain Redding (Marton Csokas), a man who admits to no friends except the Major and who plans of escaping despite the Japanese threat to kill ten POWs for every man who tries to escape.<br/><br/>In Manila, Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) is an American nurse with a forged Lithuanian passport working with the Filipino underground. She is part of a smuggling ring that is getting needed medicines into Cabantuan. She was married to a friend of Gibson who later died. Gibson and Utinsky carry the torch for each other and wonder if they will ever be reunited.<br/><br/>Thus, the movie moves on three fronts: Mucci and Prince and the 120 Rangers who must cross 30 miles of enemy held territory to Cabantuan amidst thousands of Japanese soldiers; Gibson and the POWs at the camp; and Utinsky and the Filipino underground.<br/><br/>Some critics have complained that the movie is a bit slow and talky. This is true in the early going but it is absolutely necessary to establish the conditions the POWs were living under and the acts of brutality and torture that occurred not only to the POWs but the Filipino resistance. You cannot understand just how important the raid is until you understand what is happening to the POWs and what horror is to come. That said, the unrequited love story between Gibson and Utinsky was unnecessary and tacked on 30 minutes to the movie.<br/><br/>The Filipino and Filipino-American community should love this movie as it portrays their people in a very positive light. Prince's Rangers are dependent upon Captain Juan Pajota, a skilled guerrilla leader who scouts and leads the Rangers into enemy territory, and then is tasked with holding off several thousand Japanese troops while the Americans raid the camp.<br/><br/>The desire for historical accuracy is also very impressive in this film. For example, Cabantuan curiously featured a few British POWs, gathered in from British possessions in Southeast Asia. One minor character is shown with an accent. There is the ""stay behind"" American officer. Most impressive is the inclusion of the Alamo Scouts, a little known Army long-range reconnaissance unit that helped scout the camp in preparation for the raid. Weapons appear to be accurate--the Filipinos with older M1928 Thompsons and water-cooled .30 caliber machine guns and the Japanese even carrying Japanese arms (rare for Hollywood). We are even shown a Japanese Banzai Charge--a suicidal rush of soldiers with bayonets, successful against a poor Chinese Army in the 1930s, but not so successful against the American forces.<br/><br/>I read Sides' book and the plot hews very closely to the real-life events. In reality, this is a 3 1/2 star movie but the detail to historical accuracy is worth another 1/2 star. It is the best movie I have seen in what is an admittedly poor year for Hollywood. It should do very well in Red State America. Maybe even in Blue States: at the end of the film, newsreel footage of the actual Rangers and POWs is shown as the credits roll. Only one person that I could see got up to leave. Almost the entire audience stayed until this segment was over.<br/><br/>This movie is patriotic and not politically correct. The Japanese military police are portrayed as they were: sadistic, brutal, and cold. <br/><br/>If you watch this entirety of this movie, with the Rangers storming the camp and carrying the emaciated POWs on their shoulders and don't feel proud to be an American, then you're just a Communist.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"
"HotToastyRag","10","3","3","16 February 2020"," Authentic, patriotic, and incredibly moving
","It's very rare to make a modern movie about WWII and truly capture the feeling of the time period. Many post-1945 war movies couldn't get away from the ""We won!"" relief and glossed over the intense fear and uncertainty that everyone around the world felt during the war. When you watch a movie that was made during the war years, you can smell the desperation from the actors and filmmakers. The Great Raid feels like it was made in the early '40s, but that the studio splurged on the budget and filmed it in Technicolor. The actors don't throw in any modern mannerisms, the camera doesn't use fancy tricks that remind the audience they're watching a movie, and the suspense is real. When the dangerous rescue mission is announced to the battalion, you fully expect several of the soldiers, if not everyone, to be killed. This is a war movie that doesn't gloat about the outcome but instead manages to instill the audience-who do know that the Allies eventually triumph-with enough uncertainty that it seems possible the war will not be won. With exception to the spurting blood when bullets were fired, I felt that I was watching a movie from 75 years ago.<br/><br/>Given the title, and my lengthy introduction, I'm sure you can tell that the main plot of this movie is a rescue mission. In an incredibly moving opening sequence, James Franco narrates a bit of history to immerse the audience in the events leading up to the movie's exact timing, while real black-and-white footage of the war and POW camps is shown. When the modern actors take over, there's a very slow saturation of color into the film, and it perfectly slides the audience into the transition. We're introduced to an American training camp in the Pacific, led by Lt. Col. Benjamin Bratt, as well as some of the sickly prisoners in the camp to be raided, Joseph Fiennes and Martin Csokas. From my perspective, I was far more interested in the logistics of the raid, but I'm sure there are many audience members far more interested in the personal stories of the prisoners; the balance of screen time will please every viewer. As the film progresses, there's also a third subplot introduced and tied in: Connie Nielson is a nurse who risks her life to smuggle medicine into POW camps.<br/><br/>John Dahl's direction is intense and subtle. He doesn't rely on handheld camera to build up tension, but instead lets the actors show how frightened they are without any added tricks. Rent any war movie from the first half of the 1940s-Gung Ho!, Wake Island, They Were Expendable, Objective, Burma!-and you'll understand that a camera can sit on a tripod and show the audience more tension than any spinning, shaking modern technique ever can. There's a great scene in which the battalion approaches a road through the tall weeds. Japanese tanks make for heavy traffic, and the soldiers are crouching in the weeds hoping they won't be seen. In another straightforward scene, the action speaks for itself: the Americans are advancing and waiting at night by a river at the bottom of a hill. Japanese troops are marching above them, and one soldier trots down the hill to refill his water canteen. Everything is still and quiet, letting the audience feel that they're hiding alongside the actors. I've seen too many modern movies that try to jazz things up for their viewers, but it's unnecessary.<br/><br/>If you scan the cast list and aren't very impressed, rent this movie and get ready to change your mind. I was enormously impressed with everyone's performance. Joseph Fiennes isn't given much to do besides lay in his bed sick with malaria, but his illness is very convincing. Connie Nielson shows that even the tough risktakers can get terribly frightened. If you think James Franco is just pretty to look at, you'll be very surprised by this different role for him. He's the director of the raid, and in the buildup to his explanation, you can see the wheels turning in his head as he worries about his men and the likelihood that they'll be successful. When he finally does explain the plan and draws a diagram in the dirt, he's extremely clear and thorough. It's a wonderful scene. He outlines timing, platoon advances, backup squads in case of failure, and coordination of the entire battalion working off each other. The way he explains it is so vivid, the audience knows exactly what to expect and can follow along without any confusion when the time comes.<br/><br/>And finally, there's the most impressive cast member of all, Benjamin Bratt. In silver screen films, many times the leading actors had fought in the war-Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Brian Donlevy, etc. Their experience not only drew audiences to the theaters, but it also showed on their faces that they'd seen the horrors of the battlefield. While there are less actors who are also veterans in modern cinema, many actors in military movies pretend to be tough rather than experienced. Benjamin Bratt was tough and experienced; it seemed like he'd been to war. He was constantly tired but didn't allow his energy to lag for the sake of the mission and his men. He may not have experienced that particular raid, but he'd lived through so many missions he knew he wouldn't run into anything he hadn't seen before. He'd said goodbye to his friends, he'd seen death come slowly and quickly, he'd killed, he'd seen plans go terribly wrong, he'd had to improvise, he'd been successful and regretful-and he was never given a monologue to tell the audience about his background. His eyes said it all.<br/><br/>It's shameful that this movie was not only a box office bomb but panned by most critics. This is one of the great war movies of the modern era. I've read the criticism, and it was not only ridiculous but heartbreaking. Describing this movie as ""boring"" and ""a noble failure"" makes me wonder what movie these critics actually watched. The Great Raid is exciting and incredibly moving. It makes you proud that America fought in World War II."

","Problems with this film: <br/><br/>1) Joseph Fiennes is supposed to be a great leader of men, the last bastion of American authority in a Japanese POW camp. But he's always sick, and the only guy he interacts with is his buddy. He writes his girlfriend that ""my love for you is all that makes me strong, and that strength makes the men strong..."", but he ignores everyone, and hardly ever gets out of bed! <br/><br/>2) The journey to the camp by the rescue team is drummed up as a glorious, seat-of-your-pants epic. And then suddenly they're just there, no problem. Actually, they set up a base half a mile from the camp and pore leisurely over maps, discussing their plan of attack.<br/><br/>3) The Japanese camp commandant becomes the Terminator at the end, darting out from underneath huts, smirking maniacally.<br/><br/>4) You keep hoping and praying you won't have to hear the letter Joseph Fiennes' girlfriend writes him. Then, at the end, the voice-over of the extraordinarily long, clich√©d letter begins---and you realize that God doesn't exist.<br/><br/>5) Benjaminn Bratt as the hard-as-nails platoon leader. You wouldn't follow this man into a Baskin Robbins, let alone a Japanese POW camp.<br/><br/>6) Complete, entire lack of suspense.<br/><br/>Want a good war movie you may not have seen?

","Just returned from an early screening.<br/><br/>I read ""Ghost Soldiers"", and I think that the producers of this movie did a very good job of keeping the film as close to the actual story as is possible under the limitations of cinematic limitations.<br/><br/>As a New Mexican with family and friends who were at Batann and in the Death March (some survived, some didn't), and a former NM National Guardsman, I have always had a keen interest in this and any WWII Pacific Theater story.<br/><br/>There were many New Mexicans at Bataan, and they still honor them to this day there. I drove down Bataan Blvd. outside of Santa Fe to drill for years.<br/><br/>The father of my mother's best childhood friend was a Colonel in the NM National Guard (200th Coastal Artillery) who died in a camp there, and the father of my own best friend, who had never had a cavity in his life, lost all his teeth in a Japanese camp, and my uncle escaped capture and fought with the Filipino guerrillas for years.<br/><br/>In today's poly-cultural, politically correct world, Hollywood types don't usually like these kinds of stories, because they shine the light on another culture's brutality, so bravo to Ben Bratt. He does an admirable job of portraying Ltc. Mucci. I'm not familiar with the other actors, but they all did a great job. I'm surprised this movie was ever even made, let alone released (even if it was released late).<br/><br/>All in all, I think it's a great movie. I'm going to buy it as soon as possible and make my 19-year old daughter watch it. If kids her age could fight, she can certainly watch a movie about it."

","This word today about the JAPS sounds very cruel and offensive to the Japanese people, but during the War Years during WW II in the Pacific this word was used in most American Newspapers and spoken about during this horrible war with a nation that killed and raped many people in Nanking, China. In this film many of U.S. Service Men are trapped in a Japanese Concentration Camp who inflicted horrible tortures and slaughter hundreds of American Soldiers and women who are treated worse than animals. America makes every effort to find these lost prisoners of war and is horrified how the Japanese soldiers treated our people and make a great effort to free all these prisoners. However, it took many men and women lives in order to accomplish this mission. This is a great picture which still remembers all the men and women who gave their lives to fight back at the mistreatment of American soldiers. GREAT FILM."

","This is a movie which fails on all levels: Directing, Actors, Storyboard, Music, Camera What a waste of money to produce such a movie.<br/><br/>Directing: this is the worst directing I have seen for years; a good story wasted with bad directing, the people whether in the POW camp or in the camp of the ranger supposedly to free the Prisoners of War (POW) are all depressive; as director you show the clash between the two parties, one who are the heroes rescuing others, full of motivation, vs those in the prison - but no, this main theme is wasted.<br/><br/>Actors: James Franco from Spiderman 1+2, bad actor, unclear speaking, uninspired, other actors are either 2nd or 3rd class actors, just bad. With a bad director those figures never deliver anything convincing, those who made the movies have no clue of human behavior in such circumstances they tried to portray. Captains or Ltl, all are portrays with hollow personalities. The prisoners look sad, depressed, but it never touches me, why, because I don't believe them - good actors convince me.<br/><br/>Storyboard: good moments are wasted for nothing, the whole happens at sunset, and then during the dark night - near sunset they rub on the ground toward the POW camp, after the sun has set (not showing the slowness of the actual sunset), all of the sudden it's dark, and people watch of their watches for the start of the raid, the entire suspense of getting closer to the POW camp during sunset is not used to show the challenge in that, neither we are shown really how the troops actually reach the fences, because we just see darkness . . . I rarely have seen such a bad storyboard, where moments to portray depth is wasted, instead banalities are captured on celluloid or digital hard-disk.<br/><br/>Music: it's nice, but it's way too dramatic for the bad performance of the movie, and the music is completely out of sync of what's happening on the screen; heroic music meanwhile the raid is over, but all the prisoners still have to walk to the next village, instead of a sunrise, it's still dark, and the whole situation anything but clear, we hear fanfare - man, I can't believe how misplaced music can be.<br/><br/>Camera: this cameraman I would have fired after 10 mins, this is a blunt beginner, there are no closeups, none, people are seen like from distance, no emotion, no intimacy, that's what the entire movie is lacking, it is not convincing. The camera shows and hovers around where nothing is to be shown, great moments (from the storyboard) are not capture, missed, wasted.<br/><br/>To summarize: this is a bad movie in disguise - and those soldiers whose story should be told are ashamed of such a bad movie supposedly glorify their ""raid"". This story is worth to be told, but NOT THIS WAY."

","Having read ""Ghost Soldiers"" I was interested in seeing this movie but on opening day not a single theater in my county was running it. Eventually a Regal theater in the next town had it and I went to a matin√©e where every other moviegoer (all 15 of them) was over the age of 75. No, this isn't a moneymaker, but it is a salute the greatest generation....<br/><br/>Of course that's why the professional reviews were so poor. Professional reviewers today are not of the greatest generation, they're of the 60s generation. The 60s generation condemns the film as ""propoganda"" with ""negative Japanese stereotypes"", when the reality is Japanese brutality was much more horrific than shown in this film. I'm sure the use of the word ""Jap"" in the film also made them cringe. (As an aside, it's Japanese-Americans who are on a crusade to rid the world of the term, not Japanese.) In my opinion, this film is better than Saving Private Ryan and Thin Red Line. It's the best American made Pacific War film I have scene since Empire of the Sun. Read one of the books on which the film is based and then go see it. The differences are minimal.<br/><br/>This movie should be required viewing in all high school classrooms."

","Maybe nobody commenting on this movie has read the book ""Ghost Soldiers"", so they really don't know the TRUE story behind this raid, but this movie was pretty dreadful. Some facts left out or barely addressed: 1)There were several P.O.W. camps liquidated and there was a real urgency to get to this camp quickly. 2) The march to the camp was a great ordeal with Japanese reinforcements growing in the surrounding areas almost hourly. 3)They had no recon of the camp itself and it was the ALAMO SCOUTS who reconned the camp at the last minute with great risks to all of those involved. 4)The raid was postponed 1 day because of said recon (causing great consternation to all involved) 5)There was a turf war brewing among the 2 philipino resistance leaders (both wanted in on the raid) and Musci showed great diplomatic skills in solving this last second problem. 5)The raid itself was a 100 times more harrowing and exciting then what the movie showed, they had to low crawl in daylight up to the wires and was nearly detected by the Japanese several times. 6)The ordeal back after the raid was barely mentioned, few of these prisoners could walk and the enemy was on their tails the whole way back, causing the raiders to doubt their chance even returning. 7)The tears and gratitude of the rescued was so poorly portrayed in the movie. 8)To a man, the Rangers wanted so badly to go and complete this mission, the debt they felt they owed to these prisoners and the emotions they showed at being a part of this great mission was not shown properly. I urge everyone to read the book."
"loydmooney","5","10","16","15 August 2005"," very strange war film
","There are some strange things about this film that nobody seems to have noticed. But before delving into them probably this should be said: to a certain extent it is a throwback to way films used to be made, separating itself from the host of films done the last few years. <br/><br/>First of all it is a rah rah picture, not so different from the host of world war two propaganda pictures. It seems to me a more realistic picture, although also nodding towards the rah rah a little was something like Objective Burma. Errol Flynn's captain under the direction of Walsh was the more enjoyable performance.<br/><br/>Somebody mentioned the music as being fine. Not to me. Actually for years now music in films has been so over-hyped and pounding it is bothersome, this film could have been done with a lot less of that. And as for realism, well to have not one soldier use the F word, to anybody in the service, is fantasyland. <br/><br/>Not that I missed it. Glad I didn't have to listen to a lot of swearing, but I had the feeling that Dahl was doing it out of some strange respect to the actual very brave men who made the raid.<br/><br/>Even so, the Raid was fairly well done, but for me the most gripping scenes were with the nurse. And Manila had a very nice feel to it.<br/><br/>All in all no more than a five for this, but I am glad it was made as a reminder of just how price was paid by the men of world war two. And compared to the junk that is made anymore, its a classic."
"espenshade55","9","25","48","6 August 2005"," One of the best films of the Year
","John Dahl has done his share of good films over the years but none of them came close to this film about American POW's being held in Japan and the soldier's that risked everything to get them out.<br/><br/>Knowing the history of what these men went through, you go into the film expecting to see images that will be hard to watch. You do see these but they don't go over the top, they show you the hardships that these men faced and the intensity of the battle sequences put you right in the middle of everything.<br/><br/>The cinematography is worth mentioning. It was interesting how they kept the image slightly over exposed in the background to focus you in more and more on the actor's. It made this film about the people and not the spectacle, which is obviously how this film was intended.<br/><br/>The performances were good all around. Franco and Brat are both talented performers that fit well into there perspective parts. The stand out in this film for me was Joseph Fiennes as a POW who kept command of his troops and did his best to help them through while he fought his own battle with malaria. His physical performance was superb and he made you feel what his character was feeling.<br/><br/>When I was waiting to get into this film, I talked to an elderly man who showed up a little after me. I learned that he was a POW in Germany for a year in WW2. After the film, all they had to say was how powerful it was, and what an affect it had. The film showed these men as just that, men. Great men that were willing to sacrifice everything for there fellow soldier's, for there brother's in arm's. As they said in the trailer, ""there is a price for freedom, a price that some are willing to pay."" All of these men were willing to pay that price."
"BeneCumb","6","4","5","15 December 2013"," Decent, but many imitating references to prior related movies
","The main strength of this movie is being based on real events and names. The plot, however, is uneven, with a few intertwined story-lines with unequal weight and smoothness: preparation for liberation, life in POW camp, resistance activities, liberation itself. Following all this, we see many similarities with approaches from e.g. The Bridge on the River Kwai, The Thin Red Line, Pearl Harbor - and without upgrade or distinctive twists... There are some protracted and arid scenes, tensions tend to decrease at times. The cast is even, both no prevailing performances; Marton Csokas as Capt. Redding and Connie Nielsen as Margaret Utinsky seemed most interesting to me.<br/><br/>All in all, an okay war movie, but no great experience. I would recommend the ones named above instead."

Including one of the survivors of the Death March of Batann. <br/><br/>Mostly Vets and their families attended but the consensus was that the movie was exactly as it happened in WWII. Anyone that cant see past the minimal love connection parts, has blinders on. While there might have been a small romantic assumption, the reality was that those soldiers didn't have much else to hope for, other than their loved ones.<br/><br/>The recreation of the battle at the Camp was well directed and easy to follow as the commanders drew plans in the dirt with sticks. Even folks over 90 years old felt the movie portrayed everything they had recalled and heard from others that had served there. <br/><br/>Most viewers felt this movie should be mandatory for every high school senior to view to graduate as it tells the truth about the Bataan marchers.

","Lawrence Bender Productions did quite well with this film. It portrays the heroics of the Phillipino People as well as the Americans, and reflects on a time when America was looked upon as the hope of the world. Americans came through and made good on that hope with the death of hundreds of thousands of young American men. Many people alive today question why we are in Iraq. I think they should see this movie to gain an understanding that this is what happens if we don't go in harm's way. I'm sure all of those American soldiers in the Second World War would have rather stayed at home with their families safe and sound, instead of dying on fogging soil. Where would we be today if they had stayed home. Would we have had the good lives that we enjoyed. See the movie and think!"

","I found this movie totally unwatchable and carelessly produced, directed, and acted. It struck me as being completely, almost laughably inauthentic as to time and place, and bordering on farce in its presentation of Americans and other nationalities who lived and fought during that time.<br/><br/>If any American soldier as depicted in this film were somehow transported back to Mucci's unit in 1945, he would be seen to be an alien from another planet. American soldiers in 1945 did not look, speak, dress or interact the way the actors in this movie do. Maybe this is some comfort to American audiences with short attention spans and even less education (or exposure, even to recent American history), but it left me wondering if the story of this raid will ever be made into a movie for grown-ups.<br/><br/>No American soldiers looked or talked or interacted in 1945 the way these actors portrayed them; they did not line up and sound off like soldiers in a 21st century Army recruiting ad, and they did not have perfect teeth, perfect hair, and perfect Los Angeles non-accented diction or speech patterns straight out of this year's crop of war films and television dramas.<br/><br/>Those islands were hot and dirty and crawling with bugs, and as far as I know there were no dry-cleaning facilities nearby to keep everyone's uniforms so clean and squared away. Chow was not sufficient to build up and maintain the body types we see in the movie, and I'll bet there weren't any gyms or circuit training equipment nearby either - or ""juice"" to keep these athlete-soldiers so cut-looking. There was lousy food, worse coffee, lots of heat, lots of bugs and plenty of cigarettes.<br/><br/>Soldiers were scrawny, dirty, and scared most of the time, and to say so takes nothing away from their courage and bravery under fire. But it was simply impossible to suspend belief at any time during this movie because elements (or all) of every scene I was able to watch looked and sounded false and forced. <br/><br/>There've been plenty of very good books about this raid and those Rangers, any one of which is a better investment of time and money than The Great Raid."

They apparently would do baseball make believe etc. to make the time pass and avoid Reality. Benjamin Bratt was amazing as the LTC. Benjamin Bratt did not act that much in this movie. However, Benjamin Bratt did deliver the goods. Joe Fienes was good also as Gibson. I was sad at how he suffered on the day of the rescue. Those darn Japs were so cruel!!

Even now I am completely overtaken by the sheer ability of the men involved in the raid on the POW camp. It must stand as on of the greatest war stories ever told. The dedication along with the discipline necessary to carry out this effort to extract a forgotten and enslaved group of Americans must go down as one of the most heroic and gallant actions of the war.

My f.i.l. raised his hand and was awarded the book on which the film is based (Ghost Soldiers). As he is visually impaired, he gave me the book to read. And read I did! I finished it off by the next day. As I said, it is a good movie, but it is indeed based on a great book and shows the terrible horror the POW's were subjected to. I do recommend to any to go see this film and then after get the book and read the truth about how and what really happened.

","The best World War II movie dealing with the Pacific Theather of the war. I saw a sneak peek of the movie on Saturday. The movie is a stirring tribute to the 6th Ranger Regiment and the prisoners of wars in the Cabanatuan camp. In American military history never had so many Americans surrendered at one time then surrendered in 1942 in the Philippines. After the surrender of the American soldiers on Philippines, they were put through three years of hell. From the Japanese mistreatment and murder of prisoners and the lack of food and water the prisoners had almost lost hope.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie there was a very sad and moving scene showing Japanese soldiers butchering and burning alive 150 American POWS at Palawan. The whole rest of the movie shows the 6th Ranger Regiment moving towards their objective to free 513 American and Allied prisoners of war at Cabanatuan, and the inside of the camp.<br/><br/>The last 30 minutes of the movie probably was the best ending in any movie I've seen in a while. The Raid was well shoot and was moving. By the end of the movie, nearly everyone in the movie theater was crying or at least shedding a few tears. The movie was probably one the best of 2005."

","Although the film stands by itself perfectly well you may want to read the books ""The Great Raid"" by William Breuer as well as the critically acclaimed ""Ghost Soldiers"" by Hampton Sides. Both books put into context the feats of heroism and valor depicted in this stunning picture. How easy it is to forget the people that helped shape our history and the human sacrifice associated with war. It is difficult to convey perfectly in 90 minutes the scope of this event but the film does an excellent job of doing justice to a True story of a daring rescue mission.

","This movie is one of the best I've recently seen. When I first sat down and the movie started, I thought ""this is no Saving Private Ryan"". And it isn't. But, it is not far from it. The action is very good, the acting believable, and the sense of truth is definitely there. Unfortunately (at least here in Boca Raton, Fl), the movie theatres downplayed it, the critics barely reviewed it and gave it not-so-good reviews and it was barely in the theater. If you saw it you were one of the lucky ones. My wife who doesn't really like this kind of film, came out of the theater and stated,""That was a wonderful movie"". Boy, was I shocked. To hell with these over-paid ""professional"" critics and do yourself a favor. Judge a film by your standards. GO see this film. You won't be sorry. I can't wait to see it on DVD."

","i love this movie, forget about what the heartless, bad commentaries of movie critics were saying. i admit the movie is not that quiet of ""saving private Ryan"" but set aside our amusement of gigantic, overly loaded actions, lets consider the wonderful details this film is offering us. not too many people know what had happen to those American and Filipino POW's under the hand of the Japanese. not even many, know where Cabanatuan is and if there's such place and such great stories to tell about heroism and military tactics US military ever known. lets just give the maker's a hand of approval by a SALUTE. i maybe one sided since this film is about the Philippine's, my native land and features the Philippine's premiere actor's and actresses in the which i never would have thought be part of a Hollywood film. but Americans should also be proud of this, because this tells one of the many brave stories ever told about the Americans. with this movie i regain somewhat of my nationalistic side of me, which was losing a bit due to political chaos and a shameful lost of integrity of our leaders in the country, not only speaking of the president but everyone on both sides. i can say this really brought back the love of my country."

","Filmed in a style reminiscent of war films from the 40s and 50s, ""The Great Raid"" is a moving tale that reminds us of the terrible costs of war. Based on a true story, it depicts the mission to save 511 men in a Japanese POW camp.<br/><br/>Though no one actor rises very far above the overall cast, which is substantial, the acting is convincing. The pace of the film varies, depending upon the part of the story--just as it would in real life. From the prisoners' points of view, the length of their ordeal was interminable. From the point of view of their rescuers, there was a countdown to tragic failure always pushing the action.<br/><br/>The addition of a romantic story is a poignant reminder that each and every soul at risk was connected to others. This adds emotional depth. The montage of historical footage during the end credits is a wonderful aspect of this film, stirring feelings of both triumph and sadness.<br/><br/>The scope of the tragedy of war lies in the fact that the losses depicted in this film were actually multiplied a thousand fold, on battlefields around the world and in prison camps across the Pacific and in Europe. And also in the hearts of millions of survivors spanning the globe."

"TheFilmProf","5","8","14","6 June 2006"," A well-meaning but watered-down war epic
","The war film, like its cousin, the western, has been a staple of American cinema almost from its beginning. Both genres share common character underpinnings of determination, confidence, and, relatively anyway, moral certainty. Westerns, of course, are generally fictional, as the old west that's depicted in the movies never really existed. War films, on the other hand, while often fictionalized, are generally based on real events.<br/><br/>""The Great Raid"" is one such film. Based on the details of an actual rescue, as presented in William Breuer's comprehensive book ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan"", and Hampton Sides' ""Ghost Soldiers"", ""The Great Raid"" is director John Dahl's portrayal of those events, executed in very broad strokes. While the film was 'inspired' by the true story, as noted in the opening credits, some unnecessary creative license is taken in detailing an event, which on its own, is compelling, and needs no embellishment.<br/><br/>In January, 1945, a battalion of U.S. Army rangers plotted a raid on a POW camp at Cabanatuan in the Philippines. Most of the prisoners there were survivors--and just barely--of the Bataan Death March. The able-bodied had been sent to the work camps in Japan and only the sick and near-dead remained at Cabanatuan. Essentially useless liabilities to the Japanese, the POWs would likely have been killed as had others, so this mission was a desperate, last-ditch effort to save them. With little time and minimal intelligence information, the U.S. Army's 6th Ranger Battalion, led by Lt. Colonel Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt), planned one of the most audacious and dangerous missions of the war.<br/><br/>Occurring over five days, three intertwined stories tell of the plight of the POWs, the related efforts of the Philippine underground in Manila, and the strategy of the rescue mission. With a cast of mostly 'B' actors, the characterizations are marginally effective, but not particularly strong, with the exception of Connie Neilsen's performance as American nurse Margaret Utinsky. Utinsky, was a key member of the Philippine underground in Manila and was instrumental in the smuggling of medical supplies to the prisoners, which undoubtedly kept many of them alive long enough to be rescued. Unfortunately, the role included a tenuous love connection between POW Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), a composite, fictional character, and Utinsky, who was quite real. It's an unnecessary and gratuitous fabrication. Utinsky's efforts in the underground are notable, well-documented, and worthy of inclusion in their own right. The contrived relationship between them was more distracting than involving, as were a few other things.<br/><br/>After watching the film for about twenty minutes, I had the nagging feeling that something was missing. It was profanity. Hardly a single utterance can I recall. Anyone who's ever sat around a barracks knows how soldiers talk, and it isn't like these guys do. Even the most provincial person, while maybe not approving of such salty slang, knows that it exists, especially in a wartime context. Steven Spielberg, who's certainly not known for being offensive, recognized the need for such realistic, linguistic candor in ""Saving Private Ryan."" But, heck, there just wasn't any here. Paradoxically, Dahl has no problem showing the graphic brutality of the Japanese who, with frightening indifference, summarily executed prisoners and civilians alike, which undoubtedly accounts for the film's ""R"" rating.<br/><br/>Considering the flat romantic tie-in, the MPAA-friendly dialogue, and much of its visual style, this film has the look of a production that could have originally been intended for television, but was instead hung on the coattails of current events and put into widespread theatrical distribution, perhaps intended to rally support for a war that the nation seems to be tiring of. But although it lacks a certain verbal grittiness at times, and is often rife with platitudes, ""The Great Raid"" is a film whose heart, if not its mouth, is in the right place.<br/><br/>√Ç¬© 2005"

FDR even promises to the soldiers in Bataan, that help is coming. He let his soldiers be killed and others surrender to the enemy and suffered more under the cruelty of Japanese soldiers. He rather protect other country than his colony and his own people. We have every reason to get even with the Japanese than the Germans, REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR!!!!!!!!

It is on par with ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Band of Brothers"", and ""The Longest Day"". It was refreshing, and a great relief, to see a movie that portrayed Americans as heroes, instead of ""the bad guys"". It was not concerned about portraying the Japanese as the enemy. This is not a ""politically correct"" movie (maybe that's why the reviews have not been 4 stars). I noticed a few seniors in the theater, and wondered, since I'm in a military retirement town, if any had participated in this ""Great Raid"".

They must have made this movie very accurate to the real thing because I was sitting next to an old couple in the theater and they were crying throughout almost the entire film, so I believe that they might have actually been in World War 2.

","Saw this on Saturday night. This is an excellent war movie on the raid to rescue over 500 starving, sick American Pow's in the Phillipines in 1945. Actually most of the fighting in the movie takes places in the final thirty minutes. The rest of the movie concerns the planning of the raid and life in the prison camp seen from Ralph Finnes view, as well as Margaret Utinsky's (played with conviction by Connie Nielson) role as a former Army nurse now part of the Filipino guerrilla movement. This movie is a brutal and honest portrayal of POW life under the Japanese and includes graphic portrayals of executions and mass murder. The final 30 minutes is very well done, concerning the actual execution of the raid itself. <br/><br/>The only downsize of this picture is the lack of character development of the Ranger's soldiers. Benjamin Bratt as Col Mucci ( he does look like the real Col M) come off as somewhat wooden in the film. This is powerful war movie which will make you proud to be American. If you don't know already this is not fiction but is based on actual events and people with little Hollywood fudging. Just go out and see it you won't be sorry you did."
"unakaczynski","9","5","8","27 March 2006"," Another true story WWII film with Joseph Fiennes!
","The Great Raid Review<br/><br/>With my near constant-watching of the History Channel and ever-increasing love of World War II movies, I might just as well become a WWII History buff. This film is hailed as the best war movie since Saving Private Ryan. Clearly, whoever said that had forgotten about Germany's visually powerful, and very striking, ""Downfall"" chronicling the last days of WWII through the eyes of the ever-dying Nazi party, with special emphasis on Hitler himself. Like ""Windtalkers,"" this film follows the exploits of the Americans in WWII on the Pacific, rather than European, front. And, like ""Enemy at the Gates,"" this one also follows a true story, albeit, quite likely with a higher degree of accuracy. <br/><br/>Here, we follow the true story of the surviving American POW's dramatic rescue from a Japanese internment camp. These were the men who were ""forgotten"" in the Philipenes by the United States to focus on the European front and dethroning Hitler. The captured POW's endured near endless torture and starvation, and were the surviving members of those that died on the infamous Bataan Death March. The story chronicles the extreme bravery of a paltry few men (fewer, I believe, than 200) who journey 30 miles into Japanese-held territory to rescue their fellow soldiers. Why? Because they believed (with good reason) that when the Americans began their advance to the Japanese mainland, all those men would be slaughtered.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--The acting is generally quite good as is the detail of the scenery we have. We get to know the characters pretty well.<br/><br/>--Excellent cinematography and visuals. We only have a single opening sequence that gives off a feeling of being animated with computer graphics.<br/><br/>--Most of this two hour movie is build-up to the final confrontation, like many films. And that final confrontation is a whopper of a show. <br/><br/>--Plenty of violence for war film enthusiasts.<br/><br/>--Generally good dialog and writing.<br/><br/>--Excellent music, however, it felt at times like the music was a throw-back to the way soundtracks for these kind of films sounded in the 50's.<br/><br/>--Excellent tense moments and some genuinely tough imagery, namely, a cold execution of some soldiers.<br/><br/>--The film is bookended with footage from the war and narrated to fill us in on everything.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--Unfortunately, despite the massive amount of violence¬ómostly dominating the final act--the film is too bloodless. ""Saving Private Ryan"" gave us shocking scenes of blood, violence, and gore¬óand it really hammered home the terror and insanity of war. After that, this movie does come off as being a little tame for a war film. <br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--Some occasionally cheesy, clich√© moments, unfortunately. They didn't especially hurt the film, but they made the first, say, half an hour a little rough. <br/><br/>--Not as emotionally powerful as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Downfall,"" or ""Schindler's List.""<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--Does there have to be someone named ""Jimmy"" in every single WWII movie??<br/><br/>Memorable Scene:<br/><br/>--The attack on the camp.<br/><br/>A Note About the DVD:<br/><br/>--The DVD has an interactive timeline of the events of WWII which goes as far as to detail souring relations between Japan and the US prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, straight through to the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the war's wrap-up afterwards. Very nice.<br/><br/>Acting: 8/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 9/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 8/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 (brief dialog) Violence: 9/10 (not exactly tons of violence, but exceptionally well done) Gore: 3/10 (just blood) Dialog: 7/10 Music: 9/10 Direction: 9/10 <br/><br/>Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 0/10 <br/><br/>Overall: 9/10 <br/><br/>So, then, where does it stand in the annals of WWII films? For me, it's not as powerful as ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Schindler's List,"" or ""Downfall."" It's on about the same level as ""Enemy at the Gates,"" but more exciting (Joseph Fiennes stars in both of these). It's a superior film to ""Windtalkers,"" which I felt had some problems in the writing and the imagery wasn't gritty enough. It's a great film for War Movie buffs, especially WWII buffs.

This is a real story of how US POWs suffered under the Japanese Army. The plan, on the part of the Japanese, was to eliminate any evidence of war crimes and then slip away to Japan. The plan on the part of the US was to rescue the POWs. It shows how much the US Military progressed, in tatics and equipment, as the war evolved. Also, we get a good view of the Phillipine Resistance who took on the Japanese for 3 years.

We need to remember that WWII was not started by the USA nor where the Japanese mere innocent victims of the Atomic Bombs. The Japanses were in a war to exert their racial superiority and political ideologies over those the conquered. they treated POs with contempt, and disdain killing them with very little thought to the concepts or rules of Western War that the Americans, British, Dutch, and French fought by. Only using the concepts and rules of Feudal Japan.<br/><br/>This story is about a raid made by a company of Rangers to secure and bring home American POWs held by the Japanese. And the assistance they received from the Filapino underground fighters that helped them. <br/><br/>If you ant to watch a movie that will keep you interested, intrigued and on the edge of your seat with excitement and suspense this is a movie you want to see."

To be a prisoner of the Japanese during WWII was to suffer.<br/><br/>These 500 Americans were scheduled for execution by burning as hundreds of prisoners had perished before them.<br/><br/>Another overlooked fact about the war in the Pacific was the bravery of the Philippine people, both their soldiers and civilians.<br/><br/>This movie hasn't been a big hit so far, but it deserves to be."

","The classic World War II POW film is ""Stalag 17"" and now ""The Great Raid"" can join those ranks. Movie audiences have had many examples of war-torn European cities so it is significant to complete that visual history with pictures of wartime Manila. Presenting the role of the Filipino guerrillas and underground network playing their crucial role in the war also makes history more complete. <br/><br/>Great care was taken with the cinematography that gives a feel for the historical period with sepia tones. I appreciated the fact that this film was not used as a vehicle for a Hollywood celebrity's career nor used as mindless entertainment, like empty calories. I was surprised to find out later how long the movie actually was because it didn't seem that long; it was well paced, always filled with something interesting -- story-wise and visually. <br/><br/>My Filipino uncles were guerrillas who fought in that war, survived the Bataan Death March, and they were realistically presented -- finally! Now hopefully, the world will give Filipino World War II veterans their rightful recognition AND,coincidently, return veterans' benefits which the U.S. Congress denied or reneged on immediately after World War II. Because even though they fought under the U.S. flag and U.S. military leadership, Filipino World War II veterans were treated unjustly when it came to getting medical treatment at U.S. military veterans hospitals and the other usual veterans benefits (pensions, etc.). These veterans and their advocates and Filipino community activists have held protest demonstrations and presented legislation to Congress to have their veterans benefits restored. This movie shows why they deserve it!"
"birck","8","8","15","7 August 2005"," Slow at first, packs a wallop at the end
","I watched this film after reading Hampton Sides' excellent book, Ghost Soldiers, and I did not feel disappointed at the end. The structure of the film is straightforward: newsreel footage and the presentation of Japanese atrocities against American POW's starts the audience off hating the Japanese; from there, the story pretty much follows the book, with one exception. In reality, there were a number of Philippine resistance channels operating on behalf of the starving, disease-ridden prisoners. The filmmakers chose to combine many into one and base that one channel on a platonic love affair. Why not? Many resistance fighters were motivated simply by patriotism and hatred of the Japanese-but that would have taken more screen time to establish, and would have taken attention off the main story. <br/><br/>The film gets off to a slow start, deliberately, I assume, to present contrast with the action at the finish. Everyone underplays, the POWs, appropriately, because they are being starved to death, and the US Rangers because-why? I'm not sure, but the effect is well-maintained: everything leads up to the firefight at the camp which lasts, on screen, approximately as long as it lasted at the Cabanatuan camp in 1945. By the time that happens, the audience is ready for it. The film also makes a point of the reliance of the Rangers on local Philippine guerrillas, who wound up wiping out a battalion of Japanese which could have relieved the camp garrison and halted the rescue. I'm still a little puzzled by the flattened affect of the players. Even Benjamin Bratt, who plays the overall commander of the raid, only cuts loose once, in a stem-winder of a pep talk to his green recruits, most of whom haven't heard a shot fired in anger. But on the whole, the film presents events in a manner true to the original, and keeps it all moving along dramatically enough to maintain interest and have some punch at the end. At the Sneak Preview I saw, there was a smattering of applause at the end, and nobody got up to leave until the music stopped, the screen went black and the detailed credits started rolling."
"romanorum1","7","3","4","7 December 2017"," A Tribute with Little Exaggeration
","""The Great Raid"" is about the most successful rescue mission in US military history. The opening monologue's newsreel footage provides a very brief summary of the Pacific Theater of Operations and Japanese anxiety as the tide of World War II changes. Shown are the terrible trials of the 1942 forced 60-mile Bataan death march, where hundreds of American soldiers and thousands of their Filipino allies perished in the Philippines. In 1944, the Japanese war ministry issued a directive that all prisoners of war (POW) were to be eliminated before rescue by the Americans. One horrible scene in particular demonstrates Japanese cruelty: the Palawan massacre, when 150 American POWs were forced into trenches, doused with gasoline and burned alive shortly after MacArthur's 1944 landing.<br/><br/>In late January 1945, the Americans made preparations to free the remaining 500 allied POWs from the Cabanatuan prison camp. The prisoners have been weakened and starved. There are 250 Japanese soldiers in the prison camp, and 1,000 more nearby. A quarter of a million fresh American troops were already on Luzon in the north, the largest Philippine island. Lt. Colonel Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) is chosen to direct the Sixth Ranger Battalion (120 men) and Filipino allies through 30 miles of jungles in a rescue attempt. Mucci's chief strategist is Captain Bob Prince (James Franco), who plans (and leads) the campaign. <br/><br/>There is a major subplot: It involves plucky Nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen, based upon a real person) who smuggles medicines, especially quinine, into the POW camp. Her place of work is Manila Hospital, which harbors Japanese spies and informers. She was picked up, questioned, and tortured by the Japanese. A widow, she is romantically linked with the unfortunate Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), the highest ranking American soldier in the Cabanatuan camp. Debilitated, he suffers from malaria and cannot get quinine. <br/><br/>While the Sixth rangers are the best-trained force in the US Army, they have never been tested under fire. Meanwhile just before the raid Japanese Colonel Mori (Ken Senga) receives many barrels of fuel, and awaits orders from Tokyo to liquidate all of the Bataan prisoners. A single American airplane flies over the camp at twilight to give prisoners hope. After dark the fighting begins. <br/><br/>There are no spoilers here. The movie's promotion states right up that this is a story about a daring rescue mission. There is no mystery as to who won the world war. Rather, the film is about how the rescue was done. It is amazing that only two Americans died (The Filipinos sustained 21 casualties). The actual footage during the end credits was a real treat along with the uplifting soundtrack. <br/><br/>As much as this tale deserves to be told, some may consider the first part to be rather slow-moving. Once the raid actually begins, however, the movie does pick up. Overall, this is an uplifting message of redemption based on actual historical events, and there is very little exaggeration. The film is narrated by James Franco."
"BroadswordCallinDannyBoy","7","3","4","20 November 2007"," Slow, but never boring
","I have noticed that war movies tend to fall in one out of three categories. There movies that show how boring war can be between violent outbursts of combat. There are movies that show how horrible war is with realistic depiction of wounds and combat. And there are action movies that use the backdrop of war for large scale pyrotechnics. ""The Great Raid"" however sidesteps this and shows something completely different. Instead of these loud battles of bouts of boredom we are shown how a carefully planned strategy is thought up and finally executed in the film's most exciting sequence. Seeing war as a precisely calculated battle of wits and nerves is not something that the big screen has not shown us too often.<br/><br/>However, this film, which runs at over two hours, has a few too many subplots. Well, maybe not too many subplots since they are all clearly relevant, but the screen time they are given versus the screen time of the soldiers performing the raid, makes this a movie with essentially no subplots, but three parallel plots. Thus the suspense of the upcoming raid is largely obscured. We are only told that the soldiers have thirty miles of enemy patrolled territory to cross, but aren't quite shown. The constant nerve wracking threat of discovery isn't really done justice here and that thirty miles seems to go by rather smoothly. Though seeing that the scenes of the soldiers creeping their way through patrolled enemy territory are cut out in order to show us the two parallel plots - one showing the inside of the prison camp and the other the smuggling of medicine into it - there is enough here to keep the viewer interested.<br/><br/>In the end, the film is more than worth it and easily could have been much worse. For instance, the film is not just about the courage of American soldiers, but the Filipino underground resistance is shown in the same fair light. This makes for good historical accuracy and surprisingly convincing military accuracy. So even if the suspense is a bit lax, ""The Great Raid"" has enough of what is needed for a compelling story from the books of military history. --- 7/10<br/><br/>Rated R for violence. Ages 13+"

","The Great Raid is a unique film. It is set during a time of war, but the focus is not on some great battle (ficticious or real), but about a mission carried out by a group of marines that served the war effort in only a minimal capacity. Viewers see three different sides of the mission. The films takes the audience inside the prison camp to see the wretched conditions the POWs had to endure, also seen is the marines preparing to embark on the great raid, which is being embarked upon so that the POWs may be rescued.

To quote Winson Churchill at the end of WWII, ""The country that does not honor its heroes soon will find itself with no heroes to honor."" <br/><br/>The history of dedication and sacrifice that made this country does not seem to be taught any longer in our school history classes. We need more movies such as The Great Raid to remind us what the red and white stripes on our flag stand for."
"the_starving_critic","7","3","4","24 August 2005"," The Great Raid is a surprisingly effective war film that manages to work despite stereotypical characters and a well worn premise
","The Great Raid ***<br/><br/>Here's a piece of advice when watching The Great Raid. Try and forget the flagrant jingoism and stereotypical characterizations on display and enjoy it for what it is.<br/><br/>And that is a good, old-fashioned war picture that, minus the violence, could easily have been made in the 1950s and would have been hailed as ""a crackling, flagwaving war programmer"".<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story, The Great Raid recounts what is recognized as the biggest single U.S. military rescue mission in history. A total of 511 American captives were rescued from a brutal Japanese POW camp in the Philippines following a highly coordinated surprise raid by U.S and local rebellion forces.<br/><br/>A narrated opening introduces us to the history of the U.S.-Japanese conflict. We then witness first hand the brutality of the Japanese army as they are instructed to eliminate all U.S prisoners as allied forces gain a foothold on the island.<br/><br/>The movie then spends its time intercutting between the plight of the POWs in the camp (led by Joseph Fiennes) and their abuse at the hands of their captors, and the efforts of a steely sergeant and captain (Benjamin Bratt and James Franco) to conduct a daring, 120-man rescue mission to get them out. <br/><br/>Despite the ultimate predictability of the story, it's definitely never boring. That's because director John Dahl (Rounders) wastes little time with extraneous character scenes and pares the story to its gritty essentials. He knows that most of us will have traveled this road before, and focuses on keeping the pacing tight and the suspense palpable.<br/><br/>There's a surprisingly strong female character played by Connie Nielson, as a foreign nurse helping to smuggle medicine into the camp. This forms the basis of an interesting, tense subplot that fits nicely into the main story and actually could have made a good little movie in itself.<br/><br/>There are a few missteps along the way though. The Japanese soldiers are portrayed as one dimensional, sadistic bullies whose sole purpose is to brutalize prisoners and play catch with American bullets. While I wasn't looking for richly developed characters a la Bridge on the River Kwai, the screenwriters could have at least have had one sympathetic Japanse character to identify with.<br/><br/>And with a movie with so many small roles, apart from the main characters it's hard to identify who's who, often resulting in audience whispers of ""pssst...who's he again?"".<br/><br/>But when the raid finally happens, it's a supremely well executed, adrenaline pumping sequence that only Hollywood can pull off with such thunderous, technical bravado.<br/><br/>When all is said and done, and the raid is over, the movie concludes with some emotional documentary footage of the real-life soldiers and prisoners who took part in the raid taken in the aftermath. In some ways this was more fascinating to watch than the dramatic re-enactment we've just witnessed. I guess it just reinforces the notion that while the real-life mission and the men who took part truly were great, this movie version is merely good."
"wlb","8","4","6","12 October 2007"," Based on the book Ghost Soldiers (a true story)
","Sometimes the truth is better than any made-for-Hollywood script. This movie is about an untested Ranger Battalion who volunteered to go miles behind enemy lines on Luzon and rescue the remnants of starved American POWs.<br/><br/>It left a small part of the book out - how an advanced scout group was able to sneak in right under the Japanese to give an intel report.<br/><br/>But a few hundred Rangers were able to go 30 miles behind enemy lines - come in under night cover - sneak across 800 yards of cleared area around 10,000 Japanese to rescue these men.<br/><br/>This movie certainly honors those soldiers - about a battle that was hardly known to the country before the book was published.<br/><br/>It also honored an American nurse who stayed in Manila - worked with the Philippine underground and smuggled in medicine saving 100s of lives in the concentration camp. <br/><br/>And it is a all true history - the closing credits show films of the actual characters."
"Bogmeister","7","4","6","22 April 2006"," The Greatest Rescue in U.S.Military History
","Late January, 1945, World War II: at the point at which this film begins, the horrible toll of war has already happened - the infamous Bataan Death March, in which thousands & thousands of American & Filipino prisoners eventually died. The film, from director Dahl, doesn't shy away from impressing this point, including showing an example of Japanese military brutality in the early going - burning some prisoners alive. From the outset, we seem to be instructed, or reminded, that war is not a matter of just heroism, exciting action scenes, or battle strategy - though this is how it culminates in this particular true story of rescue. But the majority of the film concentrates on the brutality; it's not a pleasant picture of what the POWs endure, nor should it be. Likewise, there is a parallel storyline taking place in the nearby city of Manila, controlled by the Japanese, where members of an underground who smuggle medicine to prisoners are all targets of the oppressors. Quick gangster-style executions are not unusual.<br/><br/>The aforementioned death march hangs like a pall over all the proceedings and the American military, which had ordered the soldiers to surrender, thereby inadvertently causing all their eventual deaths, seem compelled (or shamed, depending on how you see it) to mount some unusual rescue attempt of about 500 prisoners. It's mentioned that this plan has no real strategic significance, no pragmatic value; it's a decision of the heart, not the head. Specially-trained army rangers form the unit which will carry out this raid, all anxious and willing to do what is right. This is about glory all right, but not the kind we may think; it's not about publicity, cameras, medals, and so on. It's about the personal glory each soldier will feel inside, knowing he did something right. This is spelled out by Bratt's Lt. Colonel Mucci; Bratt, with whom I was familiar with for lightweight characters, surprised me in this picture. He seems to play older than he is, a man who had chosen to be a warrior and leader of men. His speech to his rangers before the mission was true-to-life and inspiring at the same time. Franco plays the captain under his command in charge of the strategy and the mission.<br/><br/>Besides the expected interest in seeing these historical events play out, this film can be instructional, as well. I'd forgotten, for example, about the strong bond forged between the Americans and the Filipinos (the guerrilla fighters) during this struggle against the Japanese oppressors. When some might question why it's necessary to relive such past events in the context of today's completely revamped modern world (why bring up past hates, past tragedy?), it also relives & reminds of past alliances and mutual respect. Of course, I doubt any descendants of the death march victims would want such history ignored or forgotten. The DVD I acquired was packaged with the book by William Breuer."
"artzau","7","4","6","25 February 2006"," Stimulating bit of History
","For those of us who read Hampton Sides short history of the rescue, Ghost Soldiers, this film had a double meaning. The events depicted in the film are based on the heroic rescue of these men who had been held in captivator for the duration of WW2. While there may well have been some padding to heighten the romance, the fact of the matter remains that a small number of Rangers did indeed penetrate the jungle and rescue these men. While some of the reviewers may have wanted a more blood and guts, shoot 'em up kind of war film ala Rambo, the fact remains this is a testament to the sheer guts and determination of Col. Mucci and his rangers. Actors Bratt, Fiennes, Csonka and Franco turn in great performances as the principals in this event. As avid history buff of the Pacific theater of WW2, I found the film to be well done. Sure, there are some details that don't jibe with Sides's book, but so what? In the final analysis, Col. Mucci and his gutsy Rangers get their long overdue kudos and the spotlight of attention that they certainly earned."

On my mother's side, I have relatives who fought in the underground resistance. Many of them were beheaded for helping the Americans.<br/><br/>In addition, this film shows a very personal side to war.

Most historical movies fudge the plot line in order to make an entertaining film. This film did a wonderful job of keeping with the integrity of the actual story without losing any part of its entertainment value.

"missmissa","8","4","6","25 October 2005"," A highly underrated film
","I have seen this film twice. The second time I was more convinced of its beauty. The film is beautifully lit and filmed and the art direction is superb. The acting from Joseph Feinnes, Connie Neilson, and Marton Csokas is excellent. Benjamin Bratt's performance seemed a little thin, but he honestly doesn't have a huge part in the film. I almost wanted to scream the word enunciate at James Franco by the end of the film. His character's narration of the film is fine, but his dialogue is a little mushy. The film isn't really about the raiders, it's about the raid. This approach led to scant character development for the raiders and the audience being told what was about to happen way too many times. The character development for the POWs was excellent and this made the audience really want the raiders to be successful. It wasn't quite the kind of war movie I enjoy, but it is a great throw-back to the war films of the 50s and 60s."

","My brother was the first one to talk about this, I wasn't sure what to think so I decided to look out for it. Last week, I went into the mall, I saw this being advertised, and hearing it is a war movie, I decided to check it out. I missed the first credits, but that didn't really matter, about the film, I must say this was a very decent movie unlike the ones which were released the same day, it lived up to it's title and story, it was based on a book, what do ya know? Anyways back to the film, it tells the true story of the 6th Ranger Battalion, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Henry Mucci who undertake a daring rescue mission against all odds. Traveling thirty miles behind enemy lines, the 6th Ranger Battalion aims to liberate over 500 American prisoners-of-war from the notorious Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp in the most audacious rescue ever, and audacious it sure was! The fight scenes were kinda impressive, and the scenes with the underground organization were okay, it showed accurately how the Japanese treated our people here during that time. Overall an impressive film, and Cesar Montano was convincing as a the captain of the Philippine forces and he did his role well. Recommended to all movie goers who would like to know about WWII in the Pacific, especially to the people of my city, and especially the Japanese people, even though others there might not get it, others would, at least it is more accurate, true, and this time it got the mark, unlike Pearl Harbor. But one more thing bothers me, why was this pushed back indefinitely by Miramax a few years ago? Was it because they wanted it to be in line with films 60 years after the war ended, or was it because of the war in Iraq? I hope the war in Iraq is not the reason, because this film is about World War 2."
"royjaruk","10","4","6","25 August 2005"," ""No One Gets Left Behind... Or Forgotten.""
","I've seen hundreds of war movies. I've studied the history of World War II since I was a small child. I knew the background going into the theater, having read not only the two books the script was drawn from, but also others containing the point of view of the guerrillas who were instrumental in making the jailbreak possible.<br/><br/>Even given all that knowledge and knowing how it turned out, The Great Raid still mesmerized me. That's how good a war movie it is.<br/><br/>I believe part of the reason why is both of the authors (William Breuer and Hampton Sides) were technical advisers on the film. When you have two authors who between them have spent almost half a lifetime researching the material, you know they won't let the director get away with much! Not that he needed to; the story is compelling.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. 500 survivors of the Bataan Death March, most too sick to work and all too weak to walk very far, are being held at the main Japanese POW camp at Cabantuan. Intelligence from the guerrilla forces in the Phillipines has reached Sixth Army headquarters that the Japanese intend to execute all Allied prisoners before they pull out of the camp area. It is known that at least one prisoner massacre has already taken place.<br/><br/>The 6th US Army Ranger Battalion is handed the mission: Rescue the prisoners locked up 30 miles behind enemy lines before the Japanese can kill them and bring them home. Oh, yeah, one other thing. You've got at most 5 or 6 days to plan and stage the mission before the killing starts.<br/><br/>The camp is located on the main road the retreating Japanese are taking into the mountains. Whole regiments and divisions are retreating past it at night, the only time the Rangers can make the element of surprise work for them. There is a beaten fire zone 200 yards deep all around the camp, with no cover for the Rangers to hide in. There may be tanks in the POW stockade; there certainly are tanks present in a transit camp across a nearby river. There's a large concentration of Japanese troops in Cabantuan City, four miles away. And the Ranger force Colonel Henry Mucci selects for the strike is one reinforced company.<br/><br/>All things considered, this is a job even Jim Phelps of Mission: Impossible would turn down. Yet Colonel Mucci and Captain Prince, whose company has been selected for the job, must make it work. The lives of 500 Allied POWs depend upon it.<br/><br/>The movie builds tension beautifully right up to the moment the strike on the camp begins. The tension is superbly released as the Rangers get the job done. It's good movie-making.<br/><br/>I could have done without the grossly inaccurate portrayal of the Manila Underground; I'd love to know where they got, and why they used, that Lockheed Hudson, a type which had long since been retired from frontline service by 1945; and the platonic love story left much to be desired and borders on the irrelevant. However, the melding of the guerrilla force under Captain Pajota with Mucci's rangers was accurately shown, and the raid itself is almost 100% faithful to what really happened. I also approved of the US Army Combat Photographers' film being used over the end titles, including showing quick glimpses of the real Colonel Mucci and Captain Prince.<br/><br/>The performances aren't likely to win any Oscars; the material rather forbids it. But in terms of historical accuracy, attention to detail and special effects not involving a computer, this movie is the best thing you'll see this year. It stands as proof that before you can have a good movie, you have to have a good script. This script was a great one. You'll want to see it in the theater before you buy the DVD. It's that good."

","""The Great Raid"" has it all. Action, Adventure and Romance. The acting, direction and setting all are outstanding. The thing that struck me the most was the fact the movie did not cave into political correctness and try to water down what was happening to our Prisoners of War at the hands of the Japanese. These men and women gave so much all in the name of defeating an imperialistic and brutal regime. It was good to see this story told and hopefully will be seen by many who have no understanding of what was going at that time. The movie has an excellent plot so although it is based on a historical event it offers a source of entertainment while at the same time providing insight to an amazing feat. The violence at which the Japanese inflicted upon those they controlled and held as prisoners is shown in the movie so parents should be forewarned it may not be appropriate for younger children.

","I just watched The Great Raid in the theater in this afternoon. I couldn't be more touched by the story, and the movie confirmed my respect to the American troops for their contribution and sacrifice. I am a Chinese. In China, we were taught to remember the horrible atrocity that Japanese army committed to us during their mass invasion into China in WWII. However the Communist Party claimed that they were the liberator of Chinese people and Americans joined the war because they just wanted to benefit from the war by selling weapons and taking control. After I came to America, I learned and heard more stories about WWII. Not long, I realized that that was a despicable lie. It was Americans that made the greatest sacrifice of lives and blood, saved us from being slaves and brought the peace to us. Without American troops fighting against Japanese and Germans, no nation could ever take them out from our map and nobody could imagine how long we had to be slaves for them. Americans gained nothing but greatest honor from the people around world for their engaging in WWII. Nowadays, the United States have possessed the most powerful military force and political influence in the world. I hope that today's young Americans remember their WWII heroes as much as we do, they will continue to stand for liberty, justice, humanity and freedom in front of the world, just like their grandfathers!"

It's poor reception by critics is a puzzle and why it sat in the can for three years is an unknown. The rangers and the American POWs are the heroes in this movie. The action is stark and without pity although the ""love"" story was a slight distraction but the intent was to show that for many Filipinos, the American POWs were not forgotten and would be helped even though the Japanese response was normally brutal and without mercy. The audience that viewed the picture with my wife and I were mostly older military retirees and many cried at what was being showed. Most stayed until all the movie credits were completed, something one normally doesn't see. This is a must see movie because the raid was true and this movie depicts it well.

Of course our very own Cesar Montano (Jose Riz√°l) who was very ""brown"" and symbolically represented the ""guerilleros"" at that time was always at his best. One of the strongest and breath-taking scenes were showing the City of Manila, with a street filled with streetcars (named Meralco), churches, business establishments and the Pasig River which was the gateway of commerce. It was mentioned at the movie how magnificent the city was and why it was called the ""Pearl of the Orient"" because it served as a link between Europe, The Americas and Asia. Signs of corruption were evident. There were some inconsistencies in the Tagalog dialect but overall the film justified what happened back then. :-)"

The producers (and director) took an important story and made basically a big screen movie of the week. The Great Raid has a low budget feel from the first scene until the last scene. Now the cinematography is nice, but the acting and story are just weak. There is not one character that you really care about because of the tepid acting. Benjamin Bratt is the WRONG choice for this film. Bratt is more of a TV actor and not a film actor. When Bratt tries to give his inspirational speech (to his men) he falls flat on his face. Bad speech, bad acting. The Japanese (and yes, they were HORRIBLE to our men) brutality was shown over and over and over. I believe it should have been shown to make the audience realize what our men went through. Again the film falls flat here---the brutality is shown in the civilian population and hardly ever in the POW camp. Why did we need to have a love story? Is it needed? No. The love story had no significance whatsoever. Another Hollywood write-in to have a female lead. I give this movie a 5 because of it's historical significance.

","After reading Ghost Soldiers, I had been waiting for this movie for some time now. I felt it was an accurate account of the actual events. However, one real disappointing scene in the movie for me was the prison camp flyover by the Beechcraft C-45. One of the events that helped make that raid so successful was the flyover, but it was actually flown by a Northrop P-61 Black Widow. If you're not familiar with the P-61 Black Widow, I suggest you do a little research. Coming out of the clouds at dusk, this all black, twin engine night fighter certainly did get the attention of the Japanese at the camp which allowed the rangers to get closer. In fact, this plane was also never before seen by any of the American prisoners. With all the technology that Hollywood has available, I was quite surprised they didn't use a computer generated one. I'm sure there are a couple of other ""historians"" that were disappointed as well."

There is no mention in the book GHOST RAIDERS, that Colonel Mucci ever mentioned anything like that.Modern Soldiers in general, would mistrust any officer that would use phraeses like that to motivate them. Soldiers judge Officers by their conduct, and not by their speeches. It seems that Robert Murdock and Jerry Falwell made their media influence felt. A dangerous thing to do, in a democratic state. It has the affect of polarizing people of different cultures. Not every American soldier is a Christian, nor was he in WW2. So this speech is clearly an inflamatory implant, to discriminate against minorities.

Director John Dahl fails miserably to put into perspective the story by giving us just the token scenes of abuse, death, destruction and rescue. He fails to connect the viewer to the P.O.W.s plight in the Japanese internment camps and instead tries to give us a very sanitized version of the events that happened during the waning days of the war. He also tries to intermix into the story a love angle between one of the prisoners and a woman who works as a nurse by day and a guerilla leader by night. There is just no connection with any of the characters in this film. It felt hastily done and low budget. In my opinion, it could have been done better by putting more emphasis on character development and not just going through the motions of telling the story. Examples of films with low budgets but were done exquisitely and told beautifully are the anti-war films ""A Midnight Clear"", ""Saints and Soldiers"" and the HBO original ""When Trumpets Fade""<br/><br/>On a positive note, Filipino actor Cesar Montano proves his mettle to an international audience by providing a respite from the wooden performances of his Hollywood co-actors. He manages to make the most of the token scenes given to him & comes out with a stellar performance and even achieves to steal some fire from his scenes with James Franco and Benjamin Bratt."

","Yes, I agree with your comments. It must have been really special when all those people showed up in San Francisco. Those soldiers felt as if they had been forgotten and left for dead.<br/><br/>Well, this is a story that needed to be told. I couldn't remember if it was factual, but the stats at the end confirmed that it was.<br/><br/>There was another raid on a civilian camp in the Phillipines. It was on a lake. It was attacked simultaneously from the air, land , and water. There was a movie or a recreation on The History Channel about that one.<br/><br/>Whenever I get a little tired, hot, cold, hungry, I think about those guys in the jungles of Viet Nam, the freezing cold of Korea, or a multitude of discomforts of WWII and I say I can go on. I can do this. Just think about what those guys went through.<br/><br/>P.G."

","While admittedly a good flick and from the point of the Rangers, there was more to the story, and I think that is important, as well. The Alamo Scouts were VERY involved in this action, as well as others, but received little recognition in the movie.<br/><br/>from http://tinyurl.com/yqh8dt :<br/><br/>""Among the Alamo Scouts who earned medals for that successful rescue mission was PFC (later Command Sgt. Major) Galen Kittleson. He also participated in the Cabanatuan raid. Twenty¬óthree years later in Vietnam as a Special Forces NCO he led an unsuccessful attempt to rescue Green Beret LT Nick Rowe from his U Minh Forest prison. In 1970, Kittleson was on the team that penetrated North Vietnam for the Son Tay POW camp raid. CSM Kittleson is the only soldier to have been involved in four such missions in two different wars."" The book ""Raider,"" released in 2002, depicted Kittleson's life as a soldier and prisoner-of-war rescuer.<br/><br/>Galen Kittleson was a family friend and neighbor. Amazing guy. I hope people that are interested in this movie will do a little more reading and exploring to find out more of the story... Unfortunately, he passed away in 2006.

"scubergmu","8","3","5","19 April 2006"," Inspiring, Under-appreciated Film
","It is truly a shame that ""The Great Raid"" was such a bomb at the box office, given that it was such a powerful and insightful telling of a truly amazing event in American history. I was particularly impressed with the way the movie paid service to so many different players in the event. Not only were the struggles of the prisoners and U.S. Army Rangers planning the raid told, but also those of the Filipino freedom fighters, and the underground resistance leaders, helping the POW's at great risk to their own lives. I thought the movie was an honest, unglamorous, yet incredibly compelling re-telling of the sacrifices of heroes in the midst of a brutal war. Heroes are individuals who put themselves in harms way in order to protect others, and you will find so many different examples of heroism in this incredible, true tale.<br/><br/>And yet the movie was a financial bomb. The sad fact is, if ""The Great Raid"" had been released in July instead of August, with a star such as Tom Hanks in the cast, it would have maid ten times as much, easily. I am not judging the movie based on its box-office performance, I am just detailing the melancholy truth that the story shown in this movie, every bit as inspiring as ""Saving Private Ryan"", reached a far smaller audience because its stars, James Franco, Benjamin Bratt, Connie Nielsen, and Joseph Fiennes, are not quite as well known as those found in that other movie. I hope that this movie attracts a large following in video form, because an amazing story, told with such passion and conviction as this, inspires people to be better, to have greater perspective on their world situation, and maybe believe in something larger than themselves. I hope everyone who sees this film takes away as much from it as I did. And I also hope that it finds a much greater audience in time."

","Much of what happens during war is not apparent to the general public: events that place American military personnel in a less than gratuitous light historically have been downplayed by the media, current events in Iraq excepted. Such was the case in World War II when Washington more or less ignored the imprisonment of hundreds of GIs after the Japanese attacked and took over the Philippines. This is their story as excerpted from the novels 'Ghost Soldiers' and 'The Great Raid on Cabanatuan'.<br/><br/>The action of the movie takes place over five days in January 1945 during which time a battalion of Army Rangers finally lead a successful raid on the POW camp in Cabanatuan to free the remaining American prisoners after their survival of the Bataan Death March and three years of beastly, brutal incarceration. The leaders of the raid are portrayed by Benjamin Bratt and James Franco and the survivors in the camp to be freed are held together by the characters portrayed by Joseph Fiennes, Marton Csokas and Logan Marshall-Green. Flashbacks to the period of time before the Death March are inserted to introduce those freedom fighters lead by Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) whose smuggling of medicine into the camp helped save the lives of her lover (Joseph Fiennes) and the others. This story is history so the ending is not a secret. The Rangers exhibit great bravery and succeed in the impossible mission of freeing the prisoners, with the important help of the Philippine military led by Captain Pajota (Cesar Montano), in a truly synchronous mission.<br/><br/>The film is very understated for the most part: real life black and white photographs of the events in the film are inserted to add credibility and they are gut wrenching. The devastation of battle is not ignored, but the attention is focused on the very human plights of the victims and their freedom soldiers. The film is shot in the muted tones of sepia with enough color to make the effect appear as an old 1940s movie. It works. Though the script is not great, the message is and the actors committed to this retelling of an important event do a fine job. John Dahl directs with a sense of pathos and while there are no raging overblown heroes, he allows the simple men involved in this story to stand taller than most heroes of the 'big war movies'.<br/><br/>The film met with disinterest and criticism when released. Perhaps now that people can view it in the privacy of their homes the quiet message within will make a more poignant impact. These ordinary people have dignity in the face of being ignored by their own government. And there is a lesson there we should not forget. Recommended. Grady Harp"

","If you like watching the history channel like I do you 'The Great Raid' is the summer movie for you. Not a flaw in The great raid. Directed and acted well. The script follows the historical and personal stories well. Movie is better than Pearl Harbor. The acting schools are better than years ago, and shows that no film needs a 9 million dollar actor which kills the budget, with cheap sets, and no script rewrite. Many years ago the need for name actors helped. Some of the no name actors do better films and acting, while the Julia Roberts, and Tom Cruises live on past glories and have been in disappointing films, with tired roles. Nice to not see all the computer animation in a film for a change, which is getting old. 9 or 10 out of 10. Nice to see a film which tells the story like it is. Not have all the Hollywood made up baloney. I rather watch the Duke if the film is fictitious. Good movie"

","Director John Dahl missed an opportunity to make a compelling story into a great move. Not only did he miss the boat, he never made it to the dock. The best part of the movie is the post-credits actual footage of the aftermath of the rescue.<br/><br/>After such great recent WWII dramas as ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""When Trumpets Fade"", Dahl chose to follow the model of a sub-par war flick like John Woo's ""Windtalker"", where he tried to force a romantic interest into a situation where it was totally out of place.<br/><br/>Hampton Sides provided plenty of plot and action in his book ""Ghost Soldiers"" that a good screenplay could have drawn from, unfortunately it did not occur.<br/><br/>I will say, the actual rescue scenes are energized and exciting but it is too little too late in the movie to prop up this cinematic failure.<br/><br/>Costume design!!! What did they do, go pick up some fresh uniforms off the rack for the POWs. These guys had been held in captivity for 3 1/2 years with the same clothes that they had survived months on Batan wearing. In reality their uniforms were mere rags, which should have been an easy detail to get right. Malnutrition - the prisoners looked better fed than I am. Really poor attention to detail.<br/><br/>James Franco's roll as Capt. Prince, one of the raid leaders, could have been played by a mannequin. He was awful, no wonder I'd never heard of him.<br/><br/>Read the books, skip the movie until you can get it on video."
"draven103","Null","13","38","30 July 2005"," read the book first
","Read, ""Ghost Soldiers,"" before you watch the movie. It's the best book I've ever read. If you can read it without crying, then you don't have a soul. <br/><br/>If the movie was done right, it will have the same effect. Some critics have complained that the movie has too much drama and not enough action. But you can't really set up the story without seeing the background. The book has it all. The Death March, the imprisonment, people dying every day of malnutrition and disease. When you finally get to the end and the attack takes place, all that drama will lead into, if the movie was done correctly, one of the most climactic endings in the history of cinematography. Period. <br/><br/>Action movies are a dime a dozen. These POW's waited for years for even the smallest glimmer of hope. What little hope they did receive, in the form of Red Cross care packages, were pillaged by the Japanese before making their way to the POW's. Their world was bleak and hopeless. How can we expect to understand the frustration and gradual loss of hope they felt if we don't have ample time to understand their suffering? <br/><br/>If this movie portrays the anguish, despair, and finally the redemption as well as the book does, it will absolutely be nominated for every award they can come up with. But that's a big, ""if."" The movie has the potential to redefine the word, ""hero,"" not only in the way we associate the word with movies, but in the way we apply it to real life. That just cannot be accomplished in the average 90 minute action film. <br/><br/>If you want nonstop action, watch Predator (which I do really like, by the way.) <br/><br/>If the movie is going to give us any appreciation at all for the horror these POW's endured, if it's intent is to give us even the vaguest idea how important this raid was to the POW's and their families, then without question it needs to be long and full of drama. The ending will take care of itself."

","I really don't understand why this movie did not receive critical acclaim. I am a big war movie person and have pretty much seen them all from the 1040's to the present. the account of the heroism of these rangers and Filipino freedom fighters is truly inspiring and makes me shiver like when I hear the national anthem. I think it is as good if not better than any war movie in the last twenty years. the subject alone is awe inspiring and the presentation of the entire story is unbelievable. the fact that it is a true story makes it all the more invigorating to watch. it's a movie you can definitely watch multiple times and get that patriotic feeling each time. in reading most of the bad reviews it seems like they are: <br/><br/>Anti American and American policy, even saw one quoting Bush politics and Iraq. saying it was American Propaganda, flag waving. thought I was back in the 60's when us soldiers would get spit on.<br/><br/>the movie wasn't perfect enough for perfectionist movie makers<br/><br/>Anti violence showing how brutal the Japanese were and they were that bad and worse. when I was young a friend of mines father had pictures of Japanese brutality in china like beheadings, etc. what is shown in the movie is mild compared to what the Japanese actually did to Americans and other people in countries they conquered. one person claimed it was being racist against Japanese.<br/><br/>if you eliminate all these BS low ratings the movie would probably be rated a 10."

","My friend told me about this movie and said that this was shot in the Philippines and is quite good for the genre of war films, so I pursued finding a DVD to watch this and find it myself whether it really is good or not.<br/><br/>The whole film technically was about journeying towards the end of the second world war where American soldiers were trapped and they are to be rescued. However, the film went beyond the storyline which made it better. It showed not only friendship but camaraderie, and showed not only battalions but brotherhood.<br/><br/>The actors really did well, including local actors coming from the Philippines. They really did raised the tension on the part of the audience. I, for one, was so affected.<br/><br/>I understand that darkness added to the effects of the film, but how I hope they added some lights on most scenes because it was quite difficult for viewers to watch long dark scenes. It appeared to be very dull and thus the interest of viewers is slowly fading out.<br/><br/>I also have noticed some goofs on geography. They could have researched more on this because it was a big turn off especially for Filipinos watching who really does know the proper names of the places.<br/><br/>However, despite some criticisms, I'd still give it 8 because the whole package was tough and rough, but is very good to watch."

","The Great Raid is a World War II film about the Raid at Cabanatuan that located in the Philippines.It was adapted from William Breuer's book of the same name.It stars Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Fiennes, James Franco, Connie Nielsen, Motoki Kobayashi and Filipino actor,Cesar Montano. It tells the story of the liberation of the Cabanatuan Prison Camp by the US Military with the help of Filipino guerrillas.It is directed by John Dahl.<br/><br/>During the waning days of World War II,General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince, Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery with the help of Filipino guerrillas.<br/><br/>The conclusion of the movie,which was the raid of the prison camp,was well-done by the filmmakers.Unfortunately,the film ran too long due to many subplots such as a love story before the raid.Had the film just focused on what it was suppose to be,it could have been shorter and probably would have become a brilliant film.The performances of the cast were worthy of merit especially Filipino actor,Cesar Montano in his first Hollywood film.In summary,The Great Raid would have become a great film had it focused on the raid itself."

It is stories like these that make me proud to be an American and make me indebted to our men and women in the military.<br/><br/>I don't remember hearing about this movie when it was released in the theaters, so it must not have gotten great press.

It showed just how brutal the Japanese were in killing.<br/><br/>The cast did a good job. Connie Nielsen was quite gripping in her depiction of Margaret.

Acting is second; all performances are solidly founded. No over dialogue, no weak acting, excellent camera work, convincing sets of 1945 Manila and prison camp. I simply don't find any weak point about this movie. Besides it has a strong and rendering love story which never sideways the actual rescue operation.

"MrGKB","7","2","3","26 June 2006"," Well done if not overly-involving drama...
","...that sparked my interest in researching a little-known rescue action that was a small but significant part of the WWII campaign to retake the Philippine Islands from Imperial Japan. I'll definitely be on the lookout for the books, ""Ghost Soldiers,"" and ""The Great Raid on Cabanatuan,"" from which the screenplay has been drawn. As others have mentioned, ""The Great Raid"" is no ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but it treads a lot of the same ground in a different theater of that same terrible conflict, and does so quite effectively.<br/><br/>To digress just a moment, I'm intrigued by the unusually high ratings given this film by female IMDb voters, particularly those under 18 and over 45. I can only guess that a large number of these ladies are Filipinas supporting a film that does such a nice job of depicting the bravery and dedication of the Filipino underground resistance in their cooperative efforts with their American liberators.<br/><br/>Digressing further, I lived in the P.I. for a number of years as a young teenager. The experience gained me an international outlook that most Americans do not have. I was very pleased to see that ""The Great Raid"" gave the locals their due, refusing to lower itself to typical overwrought Hollywood ""patriotism."" In these paranoid and parochial post-9/11 days, that is extremely refreshing.<br/><br/>Director John Dahl is probably best known for the Matt Damon/Ed Norton vehicle, ""Rounders,"" and to a lesser extent for his noir-ish films, ""Red Rock West"" and ""The Last Seduction,"" but he acquits himself well with this very straightforward historical drama. The cast delivers a fine ensemble effort rather than ""star"" power, and the movie is all the better for it. Compare to when Ted Danson popped up in ""Saving Private Ryan""--I almost expected everyone to start singing, ""...everyone knows your name."" I haven't found a war movie this unobtrusively engaging since ""Stalingrad"" (a look at the German perspective that I wholeheartedly recommend, btw). Dahl helms a clean and relatively simple staging of a rather grimy and no doubt more complex tale of individual heroism and coordinated derring-do than this film has room to encompass.<br/><br/>I'm somewhat bemused that the film was not shot on location in the Philippines. Politics, no doubt. Cost, possibly. Still, even this once-upon-a-time resident alien found little to question about the film's verisimilitude. I think all I missed was the throng of Jitneys I remember flooding the streets of Manila and its suburbs, and I realize that the Jitney explosion didn't really happen until after the war.<br/><br/>The combat sequences are handled well, and mercifully lacking the faux-documentary shaky-cam cinematography present in so many recent war films. The action is clean and understandable, thanks to some careful exposition, and the firefights are believably realistic without being overly gory. This isn't, after all, a film about the horrors of war so much as a film about the courage and determination that triumphantly overcome those horrors. Kudos to all involved."

","Ben Bratt is a television actor who had a few minor roles in major films. He is not strong enough to carry a lead role on the big screen. The supporting cast, however, is very strong, as is the writing and direction of the film. The archival material is first-rate. The production values and subplots for the rescue of these men is also impeccable. So this is a much better film about WW 2 than most other films made after 1950. The problem with most WW 2 films is authenticity and the air of uncertainty or gloom. We get some of that in this film, but hardly any in the vast majority of other WW 2 films made after 1950. Saving Private Ryan has that gloom, as does Bridge Over the River Kwai and Stalag 17. This film is in that tradition. Highly recommended for a much better insight to the war in the Pacific."

","Released in 2005 and directed by John Dahl, ""The Great Raid"" is a WWII war flick based on the real-life rescue of Allied POWs and civilians from a Japanese camp near Cabanatuan City in the Philippines. On January 30, 1945, the United States Army Rangers, Alamo Scouts, and Filipino guerrillas saved more than 500 from the POW camp from ensuing death (the Japanese were ordered to ""liquidate"" all prisoners before evacuating in the face of MacArthur's advance). Benjamin Bratt, James Franco, Max Martini, Joseph Fiennes, Connie Nielsen and Marton Csokas star.<br/><br/>The rescue, along with the liberation of Camp O'Donnell the same day, allowed the POWs to share the truth about the Bataan and Corregidor atrocities. While the raid had no strategic value, as far as winning the war goes, it sparked a new wave of resolve in the war against Japan. Not to mention, it remains the most successful rescue mission in USA history.<br/><br/>Although the movie was shot in 2002, it was pulled from release schedule on several occasions before finally having a limited released in August, 2005, with little-to-no marketing. Was it any wonder it failed to garner an audience and box office success? Be that as it may, this is a solid WWII flick based on a true story. The prisoners of the camp are the survivors of the infamous 60-mile Bataan Death March of April, 1942. The movie's not politically correct in that it shows the truth of the brutal savagery of the Japanese military. The actual raid doesn't take place until the 95-minute mark, but it's worth the wait; the build-up is informational and keeps your attention. <br/><br/>While not great, this is a well-done and informative war flick. I'd watch it any day over ""Saving Private Ryan.""<br/><br/>The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Bribie Island, Queensland, Australia, with the Manila sequences shot in Shanghai, China. <br/><br/>GRADE: B- (6.5/10)"
"rmax304823","6","1","1","28 March 2015"," True to Life.
","This is a very expensive and carefully scripted scenario of a real raid staged by Army Rangers in the Phillipines towards the end of World War II. The raid was designed to liberate a prisoner-of-war camp before the Japanese could kill all the inmates. The raid was successful and the cost not as high as it might have been without the help of the Phillipine resistance.<br/><br/>The Japanese occupation of the islands was undeniably brutal. Germans treated their prisoners relatively well, as if they were captured warriors. But for the Japanese, the code covering treatment lay not in the Geneva Accords or, for that matter, in Bushido. The traditional warrior's code usually called Bushido varied a great deal over time. Earlier versions counseled patience and mercy. <br/><br/>The Japanese militarists had subverted Bushido and turned it into an ideology in which all conquered people were characterologically inferior. The result was described to me by a friend who had grown up in Ilo-Ilo. ""The river was filled with heads."" <br/><br/>The producers shot the film in swampy northern Australia and the city scenes in Shanghai. The period detail is impeccable -- right down to the herringbone pattern of the GI fatigues and the leather (not rubber) soles of their boots. The action scene is believable if confusing. It all rather resembles ""Saving Private Ryan"", which is understandable in view of SPR's success: a small elite unit sneaking through enemy territory on an important, life-saving mission. I suppose many other films would qualify too -- ""The Guns of Navarron,"" ""The Professionals,"" et al.<br/><br/>But there are problems with both the writing and the performances. It's not one story but three: (1) the mission led by Benjamin Bratt to rescue the prisoners; (2) the misery of the captives; and (3) the true experiences of a nurse, played by Connie Nielson, living in Manila on a forged passport.<br/><br/>The film is too long and seems sluggish. Way too much time is spent on the prisoners, whose abject despondency, if not taken for granted, could have been sketched in more briefly while remaining just as compelling. The nurse's story could have been dispensed with. As it is, a fictional romance is constructed to link her to the prisoners.<br/><br/>Joseph Fiemannes must have lost a lot of weight because he looks extremely drawn, but again, too much time is spent with him for no discernible reason except that he's a movie star. At least his malaria is shown for what it is -- a crippling and sometimes lethal disease that involves more than a spasm of shivers.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Benjamin Bratt as Detective Ray Curtis on ""Law&Order"". He was just relaxed enough in his role. Unfortunately, the role of commander of this raid requires a character with more power. My God, imagine George C. Scott! Bratt's money scene is when he gives his Rangers a pep talk, and the scene wilts as he recites his lines.<br/><br/>Another problem, not an uncommon one, is that few of the other faces are familiar, and in their dark, sweat-stained uniforms and fatigue caps they're hard to tell apart. No particular performance stands out in any way except, perhaps, that of the Japanese major played by Motoki Kobayashi, a handsome and convincing but humorless officer. <br/><br/>The director had a hell of a time getting the Japanese to be brutal but finally persuaded them by explaining they were playing soldiers who were ""just following orders."" It may not have worked in Nurenberg but it worked in Australia."

","In the notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan in occupied Philippines, the Japanese hold about 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March. The Japanese are getting orders to liquidate the prisoners. Over the course of 5 days starting at Jan 27, 1945, Lieutenant Colonel Mucci and Captain Prince (James Franco) lead the 6th Ranger Battalion along with the Alamo Scouts and Filipino guerrillas to liberate the prison camp some 30 miles behind enemy lines. The movie switches back and forth between the rescue, people like Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen) who is a nurse in occupied Manila, and the prison camp where men led by Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes) suffer under Japanese brutality.<br/><br/>It's an old fashion traditional war movie. It does stray into melodrama from time to time. It's also scattered among the various character sideplots. The scale of production is just below epic. There are a lot of good actors at work. However that does make me question why Benjamin Bratt is cast as the soldier in charge of the rescue. That seems to be the more important role and a more established actor like Fiennes should be doing it. This would work better if the movie picks between a prison movie or a rescue movie and put Fiennes in the lead of either. The final rescue action is done well and the movie is generally good but not great."

","This was a good movie to watch I recommend it if you know what the story is about or even read books about it, I knew they weren't going to go into every single detail of what happened because it would be too much to put in the movie. Although it won't be close to the real thing with gore, brutality and historical accuracy you have to consider the movie went for over two hours and was made on a budget you should know this beforehand when you watch the movie don't expect it to be like Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan.<br/><br/>Don't be discouraged by critics if they say its boring, in my opinion it was the opposite and the film was engaging all the way through dialogue and action with a steady pace. I don't expect the acting or portrayal to be Oscar winning but it wasn't so contrived as having an American teaching filipinos of ""this is how it's done"" with an American flag flying in the background in the end. So not for propaganda use. They didn't ignore the filipino support in the daring raid and at least showed some acknowledgement to all the war heroes, even at the end of the movie with a dedication.<br/><br/>Even if the movie flopped in the box office nobody watches war movies but it's there if people have a pique interest and its better than most B-Grade movies put out today. If you liked or disliked the Pacific Series you should watch The Great Raid afterwards."

","In addition to the movie, the extra material on the DVD is excellent. The ""timeline"" should be mandatory viewing as most folks are NOT aware of the chain of events going back to the 1930's. Those details are not taught in High School or college. They are NOT complimentary to FDR by the way. The boot camp section is enlightening too. It is amazing that the whole crew of actors including Mr Franco went through it. Now that is method acting!<br/><br/>My only complaint about the film is that the deleted scenes were deleted.

","I noted this war movie in the box offices and I'm wondering why such a film hasn't been shown in our theaters in Europe. I found the story very interesting because it is based on true events about the greatest rescue plan for prisoners in the American history. It was never annoying because there were many plots and turns. It's a question of courage, humanity and honor.<br/><br/>The music was wonderful and the direction from John Dahl superb. All the actors delivered here a great performance. Especially Benjamin Bratt, Joseph Finnes and Connie Nielsen convinced me in their roles. I hope to see more from them in future. Then the cinematography was fine too.<br/><br/>I am glad having seen THE GREAT RIDE because it opened again my eyes how hard the soldiers fought for surviving, liberation and freedom in the last world war and how much they suffered far away from their friends or families.

","The people who slam a film like this really are sad. Probably desensitised to the point that they really neeeed horrific scenes graphically shown. I purchased this film for a few pounds only, expecting a second rate attempt at some small scale event in history. Yes, to some this was a small event in the great conflict, but to those who took part, in combat, rescued, reunited with loved ones, it was probably the most poignant time of their entire lives. I knew nothing of this rescue until a few days ago; now I am looking forward to learning more of the actual events. This DVD will stay in my collection, and rank alongside the greatest war films in my collection. Perhaps I am easily pleased.......I don't care really. I do know that I was entertained, riveted, absorbed, and proud to have been born into generation liberated by the sacrifice of soldiers like these. Anyone who slags off a film because the uniforms were not right, or the props were of a later time, really don't have a clue. Just to end, I thought the real footage of these rescued people and the soldiers involved was just the icing on the cake."

","I have not read the book, though I will now consider it. It's bitterly ironic that a new film dealing with a seldom told piece of recent history will be so under-appreciated. I purchased this on DVD along with three other war movies that not an awful lot of people know, and this was one of the two of them that I had never heard of before. Apart from Joy Ride, which is a reasonable enough horror flick, I haven't watched anything else by this director, but he's clearly talented. This is engaging and interesting from start to finish. The editing and cinematography are excellent. This has intense and exciting sequences, and it's certainly not boring for a second. It's well-paced throughout. The plot develops nicely throughout. Acting is great, ignore the fact that there are next to no ""names"" in this. It is also very notable that this is fair to both sides, and without toning down the atrocities(...any more than most things coming out of Hollywood do). No one is demonized, and the facts are presented almost without exception. The production values leave nothing to be desired. On the DVD is an informative commentary track by several important crew members, as well as a handful of trailers. There is gruesome, bloody violence, disturbing content and infrequent moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to anyone who is old and mature enough to handle it. 7/10"

We have all seen similar scenarios but this one lacks tension. The acting is as clumsy as the dialogue. Being able to weave into the action the rudiments of a love story was particularly impressive; however it was a feat which did very little to engage the viewer.

"cdelacroix1","7","4","9","6 August 2005"," What a Great Story
","If you want a great *Story* check this movie out. <br/><br/>To me the the most appealing feature of a strong historical film is the Story within the Great Story that is the historical setting: in this case, WWII. The Story of the Raid, the Love Story (I very much agree, Nielsen is excellent!), the Comradeship Stories both within the Camp and within the Raiding party, are to me painted vividly and appealingly. The weaving of these Stories leading up to that last action-packed half hour ... the Raid Story Proper ... worked well for me. I mean, from the very beginning, we know there's going to be a Raid, and it's a helluva thing to anticipate. And here we are building up to it and building up to it through these interwoven Stories ... and by the time the Raid itself blazes onto the screen, I think both my emotions and my anxiety had been plowed and sown and grown to an acute point that plain old blew me away when It Finally Happened. <br/><br/>On a different note: I very much liked the cinematography. The colors, ranging from dry browns to burnished golds to field grays to dull greens, were to me very, very evocative, and gave the whole movie a flavor that fit the Stories very well indeed. Something especially about some of those scenes that were colored somewhere between those old time brown-and-white photos and modern tints and colors ... well, they were to me just wonderful. The device of starting the movie with B&W and closing it with B&W is sort of an old device now, but works very well indeed for me. <br/><br/>One more thing: I very much like the emotions of this movie. WWII movies following Saving Private Ryan seem to echo some of the early post-war flicks in combining lots of Action with lots of Emotion of a very basic sort: Horror (at Atrocity), Anger, Comeraderie, Love (of Man & Woman), Patriotism, Hope, Fear, Anxiety, Anticipation, Excitement, Longing ... especially Longing for Doing Things that Matter. These are the kinds of feelings I expect to find in good Stories within Great Stories of War and History. If you do as well, check out this movie: you won't be disappointed."
"squidninja2000","1","8","23","16 August 2005"," Uniforms
","It is an amazing true story, that deserved better than this. There were two major things that detracted from the movie: 1. Freshly pressed, new-looking US uniforms (the actual documentary footage from the raid & photos showed the US soldiers haggard from their trip through the jungle. Yet in the movie, they look like they just walked out of a wardrobe trailer) 2. Incorrect Japanese uniforms (Army officer's rank insignia was upside down!) Not to mention the Japanese camp guards wearing Rugby shirts. I laughed when I saw the Japanese tanker wearing a wide brimmed pith helmet with US flight goggles. He looked more like some kind of warped ""Afrika Korps"" soldier. Who did the military research?! Why weren't the Japanese tanker crews wearing tanker helmets? Or even the standard combat cap? Doesn't anyone watch the History Channel anymore? Overall, the film felt like a 1960's era episode of ""Combat"" with cheesy scenarios. The nighttime running-battle between the ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" was cartoonish! - - - - - Too bad, because it is an amazing story that deserved WAY better."

Its a little over 2 hours and there's about 10 minutes of action. The special effects during the raid were not that great, if you got shot, I don't think there would be a whole in you the size of a soft ball. Honestly, I don't know what to say about this movie. Just another heroic rescue showing what our army does to each other and cares for each other. The tactics during the raid were good, but then lacking a little... well, lets just say it was'nt perfect, but somehow only one man was shot and killed, which really happened so its alright.<br/><br/>I'm not going to be the ones saying, oh this movie sucks don't waste your time!

"sonarman65","8","3","6","7 March 2006"," An adaptation of real ww2 mission that seemed to fall through the cracks. Thanks to those who took the time to produce this superior ""war"" film.
","If ever a film, especially a film about war, deserved the designation ""sleeper"", this work should head the list. Over the years I can recall but 7 or 8 war films that I would classify as superior. ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"", ""Paths Of Glory"", ""Das Boot"", ""The Cruel Sea"", ""Four Feathers"" (1939 version) ""In Which We Serve"", ""Tora Tora Tora"" and ""The Red Badge Of Courage"" with honorable mention to ""Gung Ho"", ""The Enemy Below""( without its ridiculous ending) and ""The Battle Of Britain"" (if for nothing else than its exquisite aerial sequences). The wonderful picture ""Patton"" I do not classify as a war film as much as the definitive film biography. And then along comes ""The Great Raid"". A tight, believable, no nonsense story about a little known operation of WW2, and one that should make all Americans proud. Excluded are ,thanks be, to all the mind numbing clich√É¬©s',which over the years screenwriters felt duty bound to have our ethnically correct collection of (mostly lovable) G.I.'s, mouth on screen. The palaver to which I refer has ruined many potentially decent films about war and its stern reality. However this neat little film sidesteps the chronic pitfalls of the genre and is meticulous in portraying most of its combat sequences regarding weapons, battle dress, tactics and combat-speak. (take note of the 30 caliber, bolt action, Springfield Rifle Col. Mucci uses at the river instead of the semi-automatic M-1 Garand issued at that point in the war).And when I saw that Captain Dale Dye (USMC Ret.)was military adviser on the set as well as acting in a small part, I knew that all would be in order. The cast is excellent,especially Ben Bratt as Col. Mucci. So if your in the mood for a well above average action flick with a tension filled ending, where you will be cheering for the good guys, ""The Great Raid"" will not disappoint. (The use of real wartime newsreel footage at beginning and end provides an excellent touch.) NOTE: Because of some brief disturbing violent scenes of executions,I would not recommend this film for children up to age 16. ADDENDUM: The 6th Ranger Battalion was the only Ranger outfit to serve in the Pacific theater. It may be argued that it was the toughest, best trained unit in the U.S. Military. Col. Mucci, a West Point graduate,proficient in boxing,judo,hand to hand combat, use of the bayonet as well as night fighting and small unit tactics, trained his men personally through 1944 in the steaming mountainous jungle terrain of New Guinea. Only the best made it through and they followed one of the most charismatic leaders in the U.S. Army into battle. It is too bad that some of this part of the story did not find its way into the film to let the audience know of the uniqueness of the men being portrayed."

The first 2/3 of the movie is slow, with far too much emphasis on a love story than should have been included. The battle scenes are wonderfully done, with great graphics and special effects. But the love story woven in destroys a lot of the movie, and takes attention off of the true story lines and plots, sort of like Pearl Harbor.

"bobwoods3711","4","6","19","15 December 2005"," Just Like Travelling back in time...
","I can not fathom why this movie has such a high rating.<br/><br/>When I say ""travelling back in time"", I mean reliving in the era of biased prejudice that we all witnessed in those 'old time' black and white war movies of days (thankfully) long past. The movies where the Japanese/Germans were unspeakably evil one and all, with no redeeming features, as well as being terribly bad shots when it came to dispatching the righteous.<br/><br/>In those old films we were presented with the idea of the righteous American ideal, but in this film we are subjugated to a generous helping of Christian propaganda, and the righteous path is only walked by those of the faith. The film even depicts the Japanese executing Christian priests to ensure the audience is made aware that they are BAD BAD BAD.<br/><br/>I am sure this sort of directorial religious indulgence goes a long way when selling Cinema tickets in the US but it just made me cringe at every tired clich√©. This idealist approach takes something away from the bravery of real soldiers.<br/><br/>Putting these issues aside, the film itself leaves the viewer feeling disinterested. The acting from the major cast is passable but the script gives you no insight into the characters themselves and hence the viewer feels no affinity with them. For example, while in The Thin Red Line there are a far greater number of characters, the audience is given a far greater impression of their personalities. A few vaguely personal scenes with each of the commanding officers is all we get in this movie and as a result, when at the end we are told of their personal outcomes, I only knew them by rank and had difficulty working out who they were referring to.<br/><br/>Given Hollywoods obsession with changing history to suit the glorious American ideal, seeing the text ""inspired by true events"" just makes me think ""fiction"". I give full credit to every soldier that acted with honour during any war, and I am sure there is some truth in the story, it's just that given this Hollywood trend its impossible to discern said truth and I believe this belittles the real soldiers.<br/><br/>I give this movie 4/10, I would give it 5 but I know there is a Christian fundamentalist out there just waiting to hastily write a review in opposition."
"Boba_Fett1138","4","4","11","1 February 2009"," Boring, way too moralistic, modern war movie attempt.
","Ever since ""Saving Private Ryan"", war flicks and WW II movies in particular have become really popular again. This has had some good results but also lots of failed attempts. ""The Great Raid"" is really one of those failures. It's an overlong, overblown and just plain boring war movie, that even becomes annoying to watch in parts due to its moralistic undertone. This movie really deserved to flop.<br/><br/>The entire movie is just basically one big build up to it's 'great raid'. And well, no offense, but is that even a battle at the end? It's more a massacre in which the Japanese are completely surrounded and are being totally surprised and overwhelmed by the American forces, who are being helped by Filipino guerrillas. 523 Japanese got killed, while only 2 Rangers, 1 POW and some guerrillas died. Yet the allied loses in this movie are being portrayed as some big tragedy and all died as heroes. Yeah well, it's of course not like I was sympathizing for the Japanse but it shows how incredibly overblown and overly moralistic this movie is.<br/><br/>It's moral themes are totally wrong and misplaced. Japanese are noble and proud people but in this movie they are being portrayed as animals, while all Americans are extremely honorable, helpful and heroic persons. At least as gets portrayed in this movie. The movie is so incredibly simple and black & white with these themes. Also quite amusing how the camp commander is being portrayed as a James Bond type of villain, who in the end is personally battling the Americans, as the last man standing basically. It truly becomes annoying in parts and because of this approach this movie also can be seen as propaganda, while the movie tries to let you believe that this is a very accurate and honest portrayal of the true events, that occurred in late January 1945, near Cabanatuan. It's an important and great story but in this movie it's just being portrayed completely wrong, even though the intentions were all, no doubt, good.<br/><br/>It's approach is what makes this movie so bad to watch. It is not just its extremely black & white handling of its moralistic themes but also its main approach. The movie is like a mix of a realistic made war movie, that never feels realistic or authentic, and a spectacular made big blockbuster. Because of this very mixed approach, neither of those two really work out really. Because of this the movie also really never feels like one. On the one hand you have a story following a bunch of character being held captive by the Japanese and on the other hand you have a bunch of Allied soldiers, planning the attack and rescue. Oh and then you also have Connie Nielsen walking around in this all somewhere. Amazing that they even managed to throw in a love-story in this movie. The movie tries to be epic but just never becomes so. Instead the movie is overlong and above all things quite boring to watch, also since you just never really care enough for any of the characters. Not really the actor's fault, I mean the movie has some great actors involved but I more blame the simplistic script and approach of the movie for this.<br/><br/>It's also quite clich√©d all. I wished the movie had some more good ideas of its own, that way this movie might had been able to still distinct itself from other modern war movies.<br/><br/>Too slow, too dull, too moralistic, too overblown, too clich√©d.

It should play well on television over two evenings, but on a theater screen, its weaknesses become far too apparent.<br/><br/>The biggest problem is the film's length. Half an hour could easily be chopped out, especially considering how quickly the raid itself passes. The entire nurse subplot is completely unnecessary. Much of the POW scenes is redundant.<br/><br/>Beyond being too long, the actors in the Rangers unit are truly uninspired. Benjamin Bratt is OK as the colonel in charge, but the remainder act just like those in the POW camp. If the unit was full of combat veterans, I could understand the 'just another day at work' attitudes, but as explained early in the movie, these were raw recruits straight off the farm: ready, willing and able to kick some major butt.<br/><br/>Do NOT file this in the category Action Movie."

","Why this film failed at the Box Office is a mystery. It can stand proudly as one of the greatest war films ever made. Certainly not in the league of Paths Of Glory, or The Thin Red Line, but an important addition to the genre, as it depicts the not-so-often told story of the Asia/Pacific theater. THIS film should have had the success that the pathetic Pearl Harbor got. Technically it is a knock-out, with its large budget of $us70m right up there on the screen; huge set-pieces, authentic period re-creations, excellent cinematography, editing and casting. The inclusion of archive footage of the actual survivors a nice tribute, and a reminder that what we have just seen was real. As real as the onrushing World War Three that we are allowing to unfold, today, before our eyes.

","Everything about this film is great. I grew up in the 1950's and saw all those, now lost, films about WWII and the US against the Japanese. The Japanese are our friends now; but in the 1940's -- not so much. The Japanese actors did a fantastic job of portraying the WWII 'Japs' as a cruel enemy -- as well as those old films of the late 1940's and 1950's.. Well done all! Connie Nielsen is ALWAYS fantastic as just a bit of eye-candy -- and a great actress to boot.
Don't pay much attention to the critics who tended to give the film a so-so rating -- other than Roger Ebert -- who gave the film 3 stars. This film has suspense, well done action scenes, and believable prisoner conditions. For those who don't know their History -- this is the last resort after President Roosevelt decided NOT to rescue 60K Filipinos and 10K US troops resulting in ""The Bataan Death March"". The Japs were then going to kill ALL prisoners as our troops were closing in rapidly in '44-'45. This was a rescue attempt, a real one, of one of those Japanese prisons.
Well done all!!!!!!!"

","An incredibly exciting, true account that will move you to tears at this superb film's conclusion. Pulling no punches and accurately depicting the absolute savagery of the enemy, it is a courageous motion picture that everyone should see. The cast is uniformly excellent, with Benjamin Bratt giving the performance of a lifetime. Director John Dahl does outstanding work in bringing this story to the screen and deserves accolades for showing what kind of butchery our soldiers endured at the hands of their captors. The battle scenes are stunning and the musical score is one of the most beautiful ever composed. When the film nears the end and the actual newsreels of the liberation are shown, I was sobbing. The POW's were heroes who suffered so very, very brutally while held in Japanese camps. This film is a terrific tribute to those Army and Filipino heroes who ended the ordeal as well as the brave, courageous men and women who never cowered before the bloody swords of the beasts who savaged them."
"Pavel-8","3","11","49","8 August 2005"," The worst war movie in recent memory.
","I love war movies and usually keep tabs on the upcoming films in the genre. Therefore I was shocked last week when I saw a television commercial for ""The Great Raid"", a movie I had heard nothing about. Now I know why.<br/><br/>Inspired by actual events, ""The Great Raid"" relates a relatively obscure World War II story in which the 6th Ranger Battalion must rescue 500 American prisoners-of-war from Cabanatuan, a Japanese POW camp in the Philippines. The film traces three converging stories about the POWs, the men sent to liberate them, and the civilian resistance front aiding the process, one member of which is romantically linked to one of the prisoners.<br/><br/>While this plot sounds like an excellent foundation, the script and its interpretation prove to be the movie's complete undoing. War films do not require a full portrayal of everything related to the point of emphasis. Other aspects can be incorporated (as in ""Saving Private Ryan"") through brief asides or short encounters with incidental characters. These cinematic conveniences are conspicuous here in their absence, as director John Dahl (""Rounders"") and company ambitiously attempt to simultaneously tell all three sides of the story, and succeed in fully telling none of them. Had the movie focused on the rescue, it could have been decent. Instead trite and shrug-inducing story lines haphazardly slow everything down, pushing the decent battle scenes to the final act, by which point they are as inevitable and anticlimactic as possible. It is like stuffing an appropriately long one-hour episode of ""Band of Brothers"" with far too much filler that overwhelms the actual point of the story.<br/><br/>Due to this lack of action, numerous head-scratching military activities, and a weak romantic story arc, ""The Great Raid"" never feels like any kind of war film, let alone a good one. Soldiers spy on passing enemies from visible locations a few feet away; in a scene that nearly parodies itself, a captain hastily scrawls important battle plans in the dirt; characters' motives are rarely explained. Considering how much time is spent attempting to rachet up the drama, the audience is told as little as possible about all of the involved parties. A good amount of that time is spent relating a semi-love story that suffers from ""Cold Mountain"" syndrome. The love interests are never given even cursory screen time together, and with the relationship sketchy anyway, the lack of any established connection causes that half of the movie to flounder as well.<br/><br/>High technical achievement could possibly have salvaged ""The Great Raid"", but the special effects, like the nondescript acting, are nothing more than average. The music of Trevor Rabin (""Armageddon"") ranges from cartoon-like to a melodrama beyond anything John Williams has ever written. (Not to mention the shameless ripoff of Mozart's aria from ""The Shawshank Redemption"") The sole redeeming factor of the entire movie is the color palette, which is largely backlit. The look does not possess the grit of ""Saving Private Ryan"" nor the vibrancy of ""The Thin Red Line"", but lies somewhere in between. A slightly washed-out scheme emphasizes the natural greens and browns of the surroundings while still permitting the occasional bright hues to shine, literally and figuratively. But not even that and the blatant flag-waving bookends are nearly enough to earn the movie a recommendation.<br/><br/>""The Great Raid"" sat in the Miramax vaults for over a year, until the Weinsteins dumped it into theaters before their upcoming split with Disney. With two-thirds of the story wholly unnecessary and the rest filled with stock characters and situations, there is little wonder it might never have been released otherwise. This is one of the worst war movies I've ever seen, and that statement is coming from a guy who likes most any such film.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: I don't even recommend this for fans of the genre. Three of ten."

","The U.S. 6th Ranger Battalion (led by James Franco and Benjamin Bratt) makes a daring play in January of 1945 to save over 500 prisoners of war (officer Joseph Fiennes among them) from the notorious Cabanatuan Japenese camp in the Philippines. A sketchy and rarely talked about part of contemporary U.S. history here in a large and unwanted sleeping pill of near epic proportions. This is one of those projects that would have been better suited as a documentary or live action short subject. Amazing archive footage is the most endearing element as we have a faceless mass of soldiers, confusing situations and a totally out-of-place Connie Nielsen as a nurse who is part of an underground network of civilians attempting to help the American prisoners from certain death. The bad guys are almost invisible, the good guys have no narrative pace to work with and the direction is unclear with varying side-stories taking place from the beginning. The payoff is so dark and unspectacular that it does nothing to minimize the numerous problems found within. Production on ""The Great Raid"" started right after the events of 9-11, but the finished product sat on a Miramax shelf for over three years. Ultimately this would have been better left in the vault. ""The Great Raid"" is a long, dull and anemic experience that is sure to cure those with the worst cases of insomnia that fails completely in everything it wanted to accomplish. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

On wikipedia you will find this, During World War II, for the official purpose of forcing the Japanese to surrender unconditionally, the United States military dropped atomic bombs on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan on August 6 and August 9, 1945, respectively. At least 120,000 people, about 95% of which were civilian, were killed outright, and around twice as many over time. These were the first and only nuclear attacks in history.

","This is a movie that doesn't do anything well enough to give it 'must see' status, nor does it do anything poorly enough to make it unwatchable.<br/><br/>The direction is workmanlike and doesn't add to or detract from the experience. Similarly, the acting isn't especially good or bad with only Bratt's performance standing out (slightly) above the others. The main problem is the storyline, which is stretched a little too thin in the course of two hours. One irritating element of the plot is the romantic subplot, presumably added in order to make the film appeal to a wider audience. Luckily, it isn't too obtrusive and doesn't overshadow the story at hand. The story could also have benefited from being a bit more unflinching. Some of the reminiscences in the documentary 'Ghosts of Bataan' make this movie seem like a walk in the park.<br/><br/>In the end, while I can't completely dismiss this film there are many superior WWII presentations that should be recommended in it's place, for instance the HBO mini-series ""Band of Brothers""."

This is the most amazing movie, very much in character with other great movies concerning World War II. The fact that it dealt with the Philippines and the men we left there in camps through the war gave it the same in your face reality as ""Schindler's List""; I found myself flinching during some of the more graphic scenes in the movie. The movie illuminates the power of the human spirit during the darkest and most harrowing times, and the strength that abides in men's hearts to attempt the impossible. I came out of the movie eager to read more about this event.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","13 August 2005"," Strong on story; a little light on action
","Billed as ""inspired by true events"" in the opening credits and ""the most successful rescue mission in US military history"" in the end credits, this movie is shot in such a traditional style that it could have been taken as having been made in the 60s. And there is absolutely nothing wrong with this.<br/><br/>Depicting events taking place in 5 days, this movie has a clear focus of telling the story of the rescue of 500 prisoners of war from slaughter in the Philippines just prior to Japan's surrender. Two parallel story lines, about the prisons and the rescue troop, provide good alternating angles in this two-hour plus movie. The prison camp story, augmented by a simple subplot of the underground resistance movement of the Filipinos, is rich in human stories of endurance, illness, comradeship, courage, as well as cruelty and atrocity. The story of the rescue troop, understandably, takes a secondary role, dwelling mainly on tactical development. Still, we see a mild personality conflict between commander and subordinate, which ends in mutual respect.<br/><br/>It isn't until the two story lines finally converge (the rescue mission reaching the POW camp) that we finally see some action. Those looking for continuous action throughout the movie may be disappointed but the action sequence, when we finally get to it, is very capably shot and well paced with clarity that the audience can easily follow (but don't expect gut-spilling reality in the vein of ""Saving Private Ryan""). More importantly, the stories preceding this exciting finale are well watchable (albeit a tad too long) and well cast.<br/><br/>First, on the prison camp front, that Joseph Fiennes is a good actor should not require particular vouching but the closest he ever came to a war movie is probably Enemies at the Gate (which is not really a typical war movie), until this one. His persona here is that of the ""enduring hero"", a POW plagued with malaria and yet holding up as an inspiration to his fellow prisoners. Playing his best friend is Marton Csokas who played the bad guy in ""Kingdom of heaven"". Connie Nielsen (who gave a good performance in ""Basic"", left an impression in ""The hunted"" and had a role in the overrated ""Gladiator"") played a nurse, who is involved also with the Filipino underground resistance, in a Manila hospital under Japanese occupation.<br/><br/>On the rescuer front, James Franco (superb in ""Sonny"" but unquestionably much better known as Spider Man's nemesis) probably leaves the most favourable impression in this moving, playing a young gallant captain. Benjamin Bratt, who can be traced back to the first ""Miss Congeniality"" playing opposite Sandra Bullock, is the commander of the rescue troop."
"d_chocolatestarfishcrawl","4","4","14","1 September 2005"," From the producer's point of view
","HISTORY is written from the point of view of the victors. The same goes for historical movies.<br/><br/>When an Australian company filmed the Indonesian struggle in ""Year of Living Dangerously,"" it was seen from the point of view of Mel Gibson's character. In like manner, when ""A Dangerous Martial Law years, was shot in Manila, the script centered on the American reporter in Manila during that historic occasion.<br/><br/>Filipinos are flocking to see ""The Great Raid"" because it took place in the Philippines and co-stars our own Cesar Montano. But, the events in the movie are seen from the point of view of the victorious G.I.s.<br/><br/>The film does little to underscore the Filipinos' contribution, except to say that only two Americans perished while 37 Filipino guerillas died in the great escape.<br/><br/>The heroics are left to Benjamine Bratt and James Franco. Connie Nielson portrays a selfless nurse in love with suffering POW Joseph Fiennes. she undergoes Kempetai torture for her war efforts, while Filipinos merely act as her conduits.<br/><br/>Except for Montano and few Underground nationalists who are killed, the Filipinos seem rather helpless until General MacArthurs' delayed return.<br/><br/>The Japanese are naturally depicted as a mean and cruel lot. But the movie does not clarify the samurai position vis-a-vis war prisoners, although a line of dialogue states that a prisoner of war is no better than a dig and, therefore, does not deserve humane treatment.<br/><br/>If this were amplified more clearly, we would have felt greater emotional and cultural conflict in the film. However, the sepia documentary footage is a gem of local history well worth the film experience.<br/><br/>The film's conflict is finally resolve with a rather predictable shoot-out, with the Japanese bad guys getting their comeuppance amid noise and fury, signifying little. Will the film gain global admiration for the brave Filipino warriors who fought side by side with G.I. Joe? I hope so-but I doubt it"

","I read the book Ghost Soldiers by Hampton Sides, on which this movie was based, and was expecting a Saving Private Ryan level war movie. This movie stays true to the history, at least according to the book, but that is all it accomplishes. War movies often explore the dramatic aspects of war and are, as a result, usually rather moving films. This movie made a mockery of that tradition. There was no moment where I was smacked with the apparent humanity of these soldiers. The action was minimal and the movie was, among other things, flat out boring. The story itself does not have a lot of action in it, but, since Sides is a rather skilled writer, he made the story interesting without the gun play. The Great Raid fails miserably at this aspect.

The director would appear to have done nothing more than say 'okay, stand there and say your lines'. It does liven up when the 'great raid' actually occurs, but that is over 90 minutes in.

The closest I come is to Daniel, the leader of the POWs. There is just no depth whatsoever. I know cinema limits a lot, but I would have stomached an extra half hour of film if it would've made the first hour and a half tolerable. In the book, when the doc dies, it was a huge deal because of the relationships he had forged. In the movie, they mention it as though this death puts the whole movie in perspective, but they didn't establish him at any other part of the movie. Lastly, there was not nearly enough background about the POWs to make us yearn for their rescue. The filmmakers glance over the years they spend in captivity and try and summarize everything with an execution scene. Whatever.<br/><br/>There were other, minor changes that most adapted screenplays make that I'm not going to squabble over. Honestly, by the end of the movie I was looking forward to it ending."

","An unsung, but emotionally stirring, chapter of WWII is given a thoughtful, almost epic treatment in this reverent film, based on a true story. Following a defeat at Bataan, over 500 POW's are being held in a desolate, oppressive prison camp in The Philippines. When it becomes clear that Japan is losing the area, prisoners at other locations are being slaughtered and so Bratt and Franco team up to go in with their men and rescue their fellow soldiers, even though they are far outnumbered by Japanese forces in the area. Inside the camp, Fiennes is dwindling away from malaria while the woman he pines for, Nielson, is helping to run a resistance movement and is continuously smuggling quinine and other goods to him and his men. The title event is depicted with meticulous attention to strategy and with mostly realistic effects, with the film's credits capping everything off by featuring actual newsreel footage of the participants. Bratt may not be the first choice one thinks of for a film of this nature, though he does bear a passing resemblance to his real-life counterpart. He gives a solid performance though it is a touch overstated at times. On the opposite end is Franco who underplays to the point of stoicism and whose monotone voice suggests an almost total disinterest in the proceedings, whether he intended it or not. Bette Davis said, ""Always let them catch you acting just a little"", but there's no evidence of that in Franco's somnambulant performance. (He brings to mind an earlier flash in the pan whose acting was uneven at best, Christopher Jones.) Fiennes suffers adeptly, having lost weight from his already slender frame for the part. Nielson does quite well if one can overlook the fact that, through any and all tragedy and torment, she never does without her crimson lipstick and camera-ready, deliberately-tousled hair! Unintentional amusement also comes from seeing her try to blend in with the Filipinos who are all about a head shorter than she is. The film is a tiny bit long, but it does have three concurrent story threads to tell. Any sluggishness in the middle is forgiven by the time of the exciting finale and the heart-tugging d√©nouement, accented by the terrific vintage footage. Some nice music helps to set the tone in many sequences as well. Consuelos does reasonably well in a bit part and Broadway actor Montalban has a small role as a fellow soldier. This very respectful movie, on a subject well worth spotlighting, was the victim of a power shake-up at Miramax and was shelved for nearly three years before finally being released without fanfare."

","World War 2 was one of the most fearsome wars ever fought in recorded history. Many movies and documentaries tell stories of all the characters on each side. We are usually told that Hitler ""was a bad dude"" and how Churchill's leadership proved worthy against the danger of Nazi Germany. However, we rarely get a glimpse of Japan fighting America. Not long after World War 2 ended, movies and documentaries gushed out of old stories. However, a lot of them were left-wing media and often contained propaganda.<br/><br/>Even if WW2 media didn't have propaganda, they still contained a lot of profanity or extreme violence. Sadly, these movies mostly focus on the adults instead of the teens that are into history. Luckily in 2005, a movie called ""The Great Raid"" was released in the theaters. Director John Dahl tells the story of the Cabanatuan raid of 1945; just days before the war ends. The Japanese held more than 500 POWs in that camp and horribly treated them. For three years the POWs felt like they were forgotten and after the beginning of 1945, the American Soldiers planned an assault on the camp to free the POWs.<br/><br/>Now, if anybody wants to see this movie, I'm going to warn you that the level of violence in this movie is similar to a T-rated video game along with mild language (for a war movie, very low) and there are scenes where the POWs get hit and tortured by the Japanese though no gore or gallons of blood is shown.<br/><br/>Note: despite the R rating this film carries, I recommend people 14-years older or up to see this one."

","What a very uplifting story! I enjoyed the movie very much. It was pretty true to the story in the book ""Ghost Soldiers"" by Hampton Sides. I read the book before the movie, and was glad I did. That book is superb with many more details than the movie about all three aspects of the story, i.e., the POWs, the underground in Manila and the countryside, and the raiding party. Just the scene alone about crawling up to the compound is full of details and suspense in the book. The trip back to friendly lines was also very good with many details about problems encountered, including a separate group of bad Phillipino rebels that hindered their return. I thought the acting and rescue scenes in the movie were excellent. I was also very pleasantly surprised by the real-life film footage just before the credits. The book covers that well in the epilogue. Also, the rangers took a film crew with them during the operation, but the film crew could not film the rescue operation itself due to darkness. You could see some of the film taken when they were returning to friendly lines and afterwards."

","In January of 1945 a group of 120 men staged the most triumphant and successful rescue mission in U.S. Military history. This is their story. In the epic tradition of Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, THE GREAT RAID tells a grand story, inspired by true events, filled with both drama and plenty of action. After Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the US was drawn into World War II. The next year, after the Battle of Bataan, our forces were in the Philippines fighting the Japanese. Our men were overwhelmed there, and 70,000 were taken prisoner. It was the largest American army in history to surrender (besides the Civil War). The Japanese led their prisoners on a forced march out of Bataan. Before the ""Bataan Death March"" was over, those who survived would march more than 60 miles through intense heat with almost no water or food. 15,000 men died in the march alone. The Japanese captors were brutal, abusing their prisoners in an effort to annihilate these men, who they disrespected for surrendering. Some are burned alive in group executions, and others die from the diseases which are running rampant in the camps. Five hundred survivors of the march are transferred to Camp Cabanatuan, and the POWs wait over the next three years, holding onto the faith that their country would not abandon them and allow them all to die in a foreign prison camp. Some try to escape ¬ñ and are caught and executed. Others wait with the unwavering hope that it will end, and they will see their loved ones again. This movie takes place over five days in January of 1945, and tells the story of the daring rescue of those POWs from impending death in the Japanese prison camp, by a group of men with little or no combat experience. We get to see three different points of view as the story progresses - the prisoners rallying all their strength and fortitude to survive, the Filipino underground movement smuggling medicine and food into the camp, and finally the US Army Rangers who attempt the daring rescue. The Great Raid showcases true idealistic heroism, making it a truly moving and satisfying war story. With great historical accuracy, director John Dahl brings this great and often forgotten piece of military history to the screen. With all the war movie staples, but adding one thing: a strong female lead in the action, the nurse in the Philippines risking her life by smuggling supplies in to save the lives of these American GIs. To bring authenticity to this project, the filmmakers enlisted the aid of 22 year Marine Corp veteran, Capt. Dale Dye, as military adviser. He took all the actors out into the isolated jungle and conducted intensive training, starting out with an early morning jog each day for 5-8 miles. With no showers, not that much sleep, and tactical exercise drills, these men went from merely being actors, to being fully competent to portray the real emotions that these characters felt in the movie. As an added bonus on the DVD, real WWII veterans recount the difficult times they personally experienced in the camp during their prolonged stay. Starring Benjamin Bratt (Law & Order), James Franco (Tristan + Isolde), Connie Nielsen (Gladiator) and Joseph Fiennes (Shakespeare in Love). Benjamin Bratt was quite amazing, his acting skills shine, but as for a couple of the unknowns, they were not as good, so that is the only reason why I made it an 8/10. This movie is rated R."

","This film was a joy to watch.<br/><br/>I am not going to comment on its accuracy, others on this board do this better than I could. What struck me about the film was its feel. It was like watching one of those war movies I remember as a kid. Straight after the war, many movies were made while the events portrayed were fresh and painful. Often they cut actual wartime footage and newsreels. These movies were the stuff of Sunday afternoons watching the TV with your family. The director must have had the same experiences, because the qualities were the same. The soundtrack with its minimalist touches of brass and strings was very 50/60s too. I was also struck by the inspired casting. Not too many Hollywood pretty boys here. In the camp there were people who looked like they have been through hell, not just a strenuous make-up session.<br/><br/>Thanks to all the cast and crew, for a stunning movie."

","At a bit over 2 hours, my only 'complaint' is that parts of it moved very slowly, which is actually nice if you want a leisurely afternoon watching everything unfold. The planning and back stories of all the characters took most of the first 90 minutes. But I found myself wishing for a bit crisper editing at times. Otherwise, it is a superb movie.<br/><br/>This is based on a real rescue in January 1945, at a Japanese prison camp in the Phillipines. These American prisoners had been all but forgotten, and many of them were resigned to dying there. But an elite corps of men planned and carried out a rescue at dusk of over 500 men, with very few friendly casualties. There is a 7-minute extra on the DVD where many of the survivors talk about their experiences, plus Captain prince who planned and led the rescue. So I suspect the movie presents a quite accurate picture of what really went on.<br/><br/>Benjamin Bratt is Lt. Colonel Mucci and the officer who planned the rescue was Captain Prince (James Franco), trained in R.O.T.C. There is a love interest, a nurse Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), the wife of a deceased soldier, but she and one of the prisoners Major Gibson (Brit Joseph Fiennes, with a fine American accent) kept in contact via secret messages, and hoped to meet up after the war. She also smuggled medicine into the prison camp.<br/><br/>The Japanese army is depicted as very brutal, killing prisoners for any reason. It makes you wonder why they kept any of them alive at all. Based on first-hand accounts, it appears that this depiction is accurate.<br/><br/>I think we all need to see a movie like this now and again, just to remind us how evil war is."

I wish it had been filmed in real, natural color, not the grey overtone to make it look like it was filmed during WW II.<br/><br/>Everything about it is great except the photography. The cinemaphotographer tried to create the same effect in ""Sky Captian, World of Tomorrow"" with Jude Law. This greyed out effect is unnatural and detracts from the overall quality of the film. There is nothing wrong with depicting real color, rather than cheapening it to look like a lesser quality film was used. There is some archive footage that was undoubtedly filmed during the war and is black & white. That's fine, but modern film doesn't need to be made to look like it's lower quality film.<br/><br/>The war scenes are very realistic.

"gregsrants","4","7","38","7 August 2005"," The Great Raid is a Great Bore!
","Back in 1945, the 6th Ranger Battalion traveled behind enemy lines in the Philippines in an attempt to rescue over 500 American prisoners of war that had been held in captivity for three long years. The story of the soldiers in the camp and the daring true life rescue are the focal points of the new American heroes film, The Great Raid.<br/><br/>Directed by John Dahl (Joy Ride), The Great Raid stars Law & Orders' Benjamin Bratt as Lt. Colonel Mucci who is given the assignment of planning and executing the raid at the Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp. The five days depicted in the film begin with the assembling of the troops and focuses on Captain Prince (James Franco ¬ñ Spider-Man 2) who is portrayed as the brains behind the operation. Captain Prince was responsible for coming up with the military plan to be executed for the raid. We watch as he easily devises the attack while encountering minimal resistance from his commanding officers.<br/><br/>On the other side of the fence ¬ñ literally ¬ñ Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes ¬ñ Shakespeare in Love) is an American prisoner in charge of keeping his troops alive by providing them smuggled medicine and by maintaining order as their continued leader. Stricken with malaria, his health is deteriorating at the same time the special police move into the camp to take control. The timing couldn't be worse. The new commander of the compound has been mandated to ensure that to eradicate all prisoners now that the war is coming to a close. Their methods are horrific and the prisoners no doubt realize that the end ¬ñ one way or another ¬ñ is coming.<br/><br/>With the two stories having equal play time over the first two-thirds of the movie, The Great Raid soon shifts from mellow-drama to action film as the Rangers storm the compound. The theatre rumbled as mortars were shot, machine gun fire erupted and tanks and army vehicles flipped under the shear force of their explosion. While the American's were storming the compound, the Philippine rebels were aiding in ensuring that Japanese army could not be reinforced from the other side of the river.<br/><br/>The concluding rescue with an American force that was fighting against detection, against the odds and against time would be labeled as 'The most daring mission of our time'.<br/><br/>So then why was I so bored while watching? Maybe it was because of all the unnecessary yarns that lead up to the final chapter. A side story of very little interest involving Connie Neilsen as Margaret Utinsky, a hospital worker who helps acquire the smuggled drugs for the ailing prisoners felt like it was in another movie altogether. Another involving a prisoner that is hell-bent on escaping even after being forewarned that any attempt would result in ten others being shot seems awkward and unmoving.<br/><br/>Looking back on the experience, I think the makers of The Great Raid would have been better off staying with one side of the transpiring events. A story of the prisoners when expanded to feature film length would be something to leave the A&E channel at home for and likewise, giving two hours of screen time to what is such a military achievement would be equally engrossing. Instead we get a little bit of both without getting intimate to any of the characters and attaching the audience with any of the portrayals.<br/><br/>The Great Raid has been sitting on the Miramax shelf for two years. Originally slated to be released in 2003 and then again in 2004, the films theatrical delay was a result of the much publicized Disney/Miramax split It's too bad that they didn't use the time to chisel away at needless plot points and or strengthen stereotyped military personnel depictions. At the very least they could have revamped the musical score that would even have Hans Zimmer rolling his eyes in over-wrought expression or ensured that bravado dialogue such as 'Nothing in our lives will ever be as important as this' was liquid papered out of the final draft."

In fact, you can watch the entire thing while in fast forward. At that rate, it almost appears as if there is some action (but not much).

I'm no saying that The Great Raid is a bad movie or anything, it's watchable, but don't expect too much of it.

Filmed in the classic style of the WWII movies of the fifties, it is fast paced and does reflect the unfortunate attitude of the Japanese to the prisoners of war, which they held in contempt for the shame of allowing themselves to be captured.<br/><br/>War is hell, but this fact should not detract from the history portrayed, which is accurate.

","""The Great Raid"" followed on the heels of other popular war films like ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""The Thin Red Line"", and ""Pearl Harbor"" that hit cinemas around the turn of the century. Its aim is more educational: it takes fewer creative liberties, and revels in detail -- not only is there a narrator, but helpful captions pop up on screen to inform you of the location of every scene, as you might expect from a documentary. The writers expended so much effort on getting the details right that they forgot about the characters of their story.<br/><br/>The first two thirds of the movie tell three interconnected stories. There are the American prisoners of war in the Philippines prison camp, suffering and starving at the hands of their brutal Japanese captors. There's the attractive blonde nurse (Connie Nielsen) smuggling quinine into the prison and trying to avoid Japanese soldiers in Manila. Finally there's James Franco and his unit of US Army rangers planning a raid to liberate the POWs. The historical veracity of these scenes has been lauded by the type of people interested in that sort of thing.<br/><br/>So far the movie is largely about suffering: prisoners are executed in several horrible ways, and suspected members of the Filipino underground are rounded up and shot. (Many of them get killed trying to save Connie Nielsen, who, being tall and blonde, is more important to the film than they are). Meanwhile the whole thing is photographed in a dull, sepia-toned style well-suited to a Fourth of July weekend broadcast on The History Channel or Lifetime. The music, in what has become the standard for modern war movies, consists largely of a brass band playing somber variations on ""Taps"" and Aaron Copeland.<br/><br/>Once our heroes reach the POW camp the movie's documentary approach remains unchanged, though its focus shifts: now we get to watch the Rangers shoot the Japanese prison guards, which they do for about twenty minutes while the music tries to trick you into feeling excited. There's nothing exciting about this at all. All you're doing is watching people get shot and killed. I don't feel like I've learned anything about the war or the Philippines or the raid itself -- at least, nothing more than I could have read about on Wikipedia. The movie tells you ""These things happened"", but it doesn't get you involved in the story or the people. Maybe a few creative liberties would have gone a long way -- or perhaps just a writer and a director not so committed to saluting their subjects.<br/><br/>One last note: the events depicted occurred almost sixty years before the movie was made. Do the scenes of torture and violence serve an educational purpose, or do they just keep alive the poisonous feelings of nationalism and hatred that led to those events in the first place?"
"freemantle_uk","6","1","6","3 December 2009"," The not so Great Raid
","The Great Raid is a very unfocused war film, hoping to cash in on the critical success of other war films like Saving Private Ryan and commercial success of Pearl Harbor. It is a war film that tries to have it's cake and eat it.<br/><br/>During the dying days of World War II the American is started to advance through the Philippines. The Japanese are having to retreat, they start to kill prisoners of war, instead of releasing them. A new American Battalion had been formed, the Sixth Rangers. There are meant to be elite infantry troops. They are led by Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) and a very capable young officer Capt. Robert Prince (James Franco). They are giving the mission to liberate American PoWs from Cabanatuan. It is an opportunity for the Rangers to prove themselves. At Cabanatuan the PoW are led by Major Gibson (Joseph Fiennes), a survive of the Japanese invasion and the Bataan Death March. His story shows how the Japanese were becoming more brutal to the PoWs. It become harder to bribe guards and smuggle in supplies. The Japanese bring in the Kempeitai (Military Police) to run the camp, with the aim to kill the troops. They use fear to ensure that the PoWs done try and escape. The third story is about Margaret Utinsky (Connie Nielsen), an American Nurse who works in Malina. She works with the Filippo resistance, smuggling in medical supplies to American PoWs. The Japanese start to suspect she is working against them.<br/><br/>There are worst films then The Great Raid, but it does have a lot of problems. It basically is too ambitious for its own good and trying to tell too many story at once. It became too distracting and leaves the audience unsure and who there are meant to focus on. It's trying to tell a war story, a prisoner of war story and a resistance story. It bogs the film down, leaving it to be a little boring. A more sensible route would have been shown a film about the build up and training of the Rangers, whilst showing some scenes of the Prisoner of War camp and then show the troops fighting to get to the camp. The story of resistance could have been told in it's own film. It felt like the film was trying to be The Bridge Over the River Kwai, but obviously not as successful. The film should have been the raid. I also felt that the voice-over by James Franco distracting and gives the audience too much information. The beginning was too similar to the beginning of A Bridge too Far; text at the beginning would have been better.<br/><br/>There are some saving graces to the film. There are decent performances, Joseph Fiennes is normally good and put a lot of effort. James Franco was a okay, and so were many of the other performers. The action and war seems are also very good and the final third of the film is pretty exciting. There should have been more war scenes, considering it is a war film.<br/><br/>This film could have been so much more. I personally recommend The Bridge Over the River Kwai, or if you want a film about resistance watch Black Book or Lust, Caution."
"cmzapffe","6","1","6","7 September 2005"," ""The Great Raid"" Is Not as Great as the Story
","""THE GREAT RAID""(2005) This story is thrilling in concept because it is largely true with only a small fictional romance added for interest. In one of the most daring World War II missions ever undertaken, approximately 120 US Army Rangers were sent deep into the Philippine jungle to rescue 511 Americans held in a Japanese POW camp. The World War II heroes who led this mission later won Distinguished Service Crosses for their uncommon valor and courage.<br/><br/>""The Great Raid"" is populated with a large ensemble cast of lesser known actors, all of whom do a superlative job in their roles. This list includes Benjamin Bratt as Lt. Colonel Mucci and James Franco as Captain Prince, who played the the two leaders of the rescue operation along with Connie Nielsen as Margaret Utinsky, the Lithuanian leader of the Manila resistance.<br/><br/>If only the movie were as alive and as fascinating as the real life story. Unfortunately, somewhere between the scripting, directing, and the editing of the film, this movie loses its focus. The pieces were in place for a great film and its heart is in the right place, but the movie plods along as if the writers and the director had lost their way in the Philippine jungle with the soldiers.<br/><br/>Grade: B, Recommended? Yes. Flawed but still fascinating.<br/><br/>Carl Zapffe, The Cat's Meow Movie Critic<br/><br/>http://www.catsmeowmoviecritic.com"

","I'd have liked this movie more had it focused on the tremendous mission, rather than the prisoners. As such, I found it to drag.<br/><br/>I don't need to see atrocities by the Japanese six times to know that they are the bad guys here. Okay, I get it already.<br/><br/>The action scenes are great, but only for the six or seven minutes they are on screen. Had it been more about the great difficulties and dangers that those rescuers overcame, I'd have been more immersed. After all, it was called the Great RAID, not the Great Imprisonment, and so I had that expectation.<br/><br/>So a little less Schindler's List / Papillon was needed. You can't make a movie in the vein this wanted to be without forcing comparisons to those two classics, and this movie is not engaging in that capacity. It needed a little more Band of Brothers.<br/><br/>The fictionalized love interest to me didn't belong in a true story. In fact, the entire resolution of that plot line was unfulfilling and a letdown. I could be wrong about its veracity but it seemed like they took some facts and tried to mold it into that part of the story... please leave that for Sightings on the Sci-Fi Channel. Stick to what really happened.<br/><br/>Indeed, every part of the movie that was true was exciting. Every part they had to make up was trite or boring."
"pawebster","3","1","7","2 February 2009"," Dull throwback to old war films
","They might have got away with this if we had never seen Private Ryan or (especially) Band of Brothers. This is a war film as they made them in the fifties - handsome film actors wearing uniforms, but not seeming like soldiers, people being shot dead without any blood appearing (see especially the scene when white-clad hospital staff are gunned down) and virtually no swearing.<br/><br/>It is desperately badly written, especially at the start: long periods of dull exposition, including the fatal use of dialogue in which characters, for the sake of the audience, tell each other things they already know.<br/><br/>The PoWs are not nearly skinny enough. I know this is a tough one to get even nearly right, but the photos of the time show men who were walking skeletons.<br/><br/>James Franco is terrible. He seems to have the idea that to act a tough guy he has to speak in a droning monotone. He sounds as if he is on a heavy dose of diazepam.<br/><br/>Give this a miss."
"michael-sj-lee","3","1","8","28 December 2005"," a waste
","When a movie says it is ""inspired by actual events"", i have to wonder how much of it is made up. Naturally, I assume that everything except the name, rank and general outline of events is true for the soldiers. The narrative in the beginning of the movie tries to make me believe otherwise, so I assumed it was at least halfway true. (anyone else wonder how a lt. colonel and captain were involved in such a high risk operation such as this?)<br/><br/>Back to the movie: It was bad. The dramatizations of the POW's experiences seemed overdone or just poor. Emotions seemed too high for me to believe any of the pain that these soldiers felt. Good effort, I guess, on the roles of the filipino and Japanese military..the inclusion of the viewpoints in war movies are welcomed but should be excluded if acting is prejudicial or just plain bad. A lot of the time it seemed like the actors playing these roles all knew how to speak English and tried hard, but forgot how, to speak broken English. (Perhaps being Asian makes my perspective a bit different). <br/><br/>There was also a love story injected into the movie. What happened to that? Who are these people? bad character development, nothing to anchor the love on. It seemed just like some sort of high school crush.<br/><br/>Action? there was some. more about tension than anything else. perhaps this was the most real part of the movie. Although it doesn't blow you back, it is worthy of some mention. BTW How are the Japanese such bad shots? (only 1 American soldier was KIA)<br/><br/>This movie should not even be rented. If you still want to watch it, do something not recommended by the MPAA or just borrow it from your less than intelligent neighbor. <br/><br/>3/10 is for the inclusion of asians"
"pfarnell","6","0","1","9 March 2020"," Good to see Pacific War..
","Another fairly rare these days Pacific War movie is appreciated at least, of course the Pacific theatre and Japanese enemy has always played back seat to the European theatre in Hollywood in general.We in Australia would probably like to see more Pacific Theatre movies. I'd heard about the Cabantuan POW rescue raid,but did not know many details. A similar rescue of prisoners was tried in North Vietnam during Vietnam War, but although it reached the camp, the prisoners had been moved. In this movie, which I'd rate a fair effort without being brilliant, as often happens in Pacific War movies, the Japanese may be more convincing and authentic looking and acting than the Americans or Filipinos are in a WW2 context. (modern era war movies suffer continually with people who look and sound modern and not like people in 1944, even ""Saving Private Ryan"" had that problem) Glad the inaccuracy regarding the airplane that flyover the camp was mentioned in goofs here. It appears to be an Electra/ Hudson/Ventura style Lockheed twin-fin plane, although the US made such planes in large numbers, almost all were supplied to the RAF and British Commonwealth, very few were used by US forces at all, and highly unlikely one would have been flying anywhere near Philippines in 1944-45. Turns out the actual airplane in this incident had been a Northrop P61 night-fighter, a comparatively rare WW2 type, none left flying these days, that would have been unavailable to producers.I think maybe something like a B24, B25/26 A20 or even a B17 may have looked more in-place than the Hudson did in this scene.
Probably the prisoners themselves including main characters in camp actually look in a little still too good a condition and too well groomed still to have been guests of the Emperor for 2-3 years.
Unless you have a personal interest in this chapter of WW2, just worth a look, is about the size of it."

","This Movie Should be Given Legendary Status! I am a big history buff and I have read about the Cabanatuan Japanese POW camp rescue prior to watching this.

"elgordo15","3","0","4","21 April 2013"," I'm still waiting for the definitive film of this (or any other) raid to be made.
","This movie seems to trade right-wing sentimentality and propaganda for World War II Pacific Theater history, and there's nothing wrong with that if that is your goal. This movie claims to portray the raid ""based on true events"", and yet it loses its authenticity in its zeal to emphasize Japanese brutality and American virtue. The Japanese WERE brutal, of that there is no question. It does not need to be pounded into us by making the Japanese secret police commander into a T-2, virtually indestructible in addition to being completely evil. That's not history or drama, it's just stereotype.<br/><br/>Among the Americans there is no one who presents a compelling character to focus on, everyone is a clich√É¬© from countless war flicks that have gone before. The obligatory ""dead meat"" characters are quickly identified and dismissed as inevitably doomed. The non- historical love connection between the historical Margaret Utinsky and the non-historical composite character of Major Gibson added nothing to the story, functioning only as a distraction from the drama and the actual history of Utinsky's contributions. Probably the most irritating supposed historical assertion in the movie, the claim that it ""remains the most successful rescue in US Military history"", might be argued with by any one who participated in the raid a month later on the prison compound at Los Banos where over 2100 people were rescued in a massive raid by Army Airborne troops and Filipino Guerillas. I'm sure that hairs could be split over which was ""more successful"", but the raid at Cabanatuan was hardly even unique to the times. There was heroism aplenty and enough glory to go around.<br/><br/>If you're looking for right-wing validation of ""American values"" irrespective of actual history then this flick is for you, watch it and have a ball. If you're looking for insight into a little known episode of history well told, keep looking and pass this one up."
"Robert_duder","7","0","4","15 January 2006"," Valid attempt but not big screen material
","When I saw this on my shelves at my local video store I was immediately drawn to it. Benjamin Bratt who I've become a fan due to his recent Television work in E-Ring, James Franco, World War 2, rescue mission, sounded like a gem to me and I wasn't disappointed by any means but on a budget of seventy million dollars I was a little surprised by the little better than made-for-TV quality of film. I don't know if it was released commercially although I assume on a budget of that size it would have been but there was most definitely something missing to make it that big screen magic.<br/><br/>For the most part the story is quite interesting. A group of American POW's who have spent the last three years in a grueling Japanese work camp where they are tortured and dying off one by one. Nearby a new batch of well trained Rangers led by Lt. Colonel Mucci is preparing to launch a daring rescue mission to save them all. The Film shows us two sides to the story although attempts to show three. The first side is the Rangers as they prepare and carry out their rescue mission which gives most of the action element. James Franco plays Captain Prince who is in charge of planning this raid and making sure everything goes off without a single hitch. Franco brings his usual intensity to the screen and does a decent job but his character is mostly empty without any real substance. Same with Benjamin Bratt, who plays Lt. Colonel Mucci. It's like he's there just to be a name to the film (and he's not even that much of a name) but his character is more or less completely vapid with no background or real point. They try to establish him with the talk from the other soldiers but it never really takes hold. I don't blame Bratt or Franco but just a poorly written character arc. The second side to the story and the more focused and interesting is that of the American POW's. Sadly I can't remember or figure out which actor played the leader of the POW's but he does a great job and probably the best in the film. Heartbroken about being away from his lady love, struck with malaria, and desperate to keep his men alive and hopes up his performance is emotional and touching. Connie Nielsen plays his lady love who is working on the outside to smuggle supplies and much needed medicine to the POW's but it's getting harder to do so and the Japanese are on to the Underground resistance. The third side of the film tries to be (but fails) the side of the Filipinos who work side by side with American Rangers to help them get the POW's. In my mind it would seem that they put their lives on the line in a big way to help but the film didn't really focus on them despite the fact that they faced the biggest casualties and were far more targeted than the Americans. There was much more story to be told.<br/><br/>Director John Dahl has a style that tends to be a little vapid. His previous work doesn't have a lot of depth or real meat to it and for a film of this magnitude dealing with a historical moments of this caliber I don't think he was the right choice. However all said and done it's not a bad movie at all. It has it's moments, and the action and the Raid itself is intense and well done and the scenery and setting is gripping and gut wrenching but scenes of torture and death don't really tug at your heart strings because it's not handled with the delicacy and style that it needed to be. It's worth seeing but it won't stick with you for long, it's mostly forgettable especially in a day and age when there is some truly stupendous WWII films out there. 7/10"

","I am an avid history buff and would greatly enjoy this movie. On August there was a sneak preview at the local Cinemark which I was unable to attend. When the film was to have played at the Myrtle Beach theater I was informed by the manager that they were requested to send it back. Why was this done and when will The Great Raid play in this area? All other theaters have chosen not to play it also. I know of a large number of people who were looking forward to this film as I and needless to say we are disappointed! Please bring it to Myrtle Beach. The manager of the theater as well as several employees that I talked with mentioned that there has been a great deal of interest in this film and have asked the same question that I have. So the sooner the better for it's arrival at the Myrtle Beach Cinemark theater!"
