","Being a long time fan of the BJD books (three years and counting), I had nothing but high hopes for the movie version. I was lucky enough to get into a sneak preview last night, and I was not disappointed. The movie, like the book, has the most hilarious lines and moments, and each of the actors portrayed their characters so well you couldn't imagine anyone else in that part.  Renee Zellweger IS Bridget, there is just no arguing it. No other actress could have pulled off what Renee did in this movie. Hugh Grant makes for an excellent Daniel, who is completely two faced and has a smarmy sort of charm that makes you want him just as badly as Bridget does. Colin Firth is a superb Mark Darcy, but that was a given because the character was practically written with him in mind - as all avid BJD readers know, Mark Darcy's character is a play on the Mr. Darcy Firth portrayed in Pride and Prejudice.<br/><br/>Some of the more hardcore fans of the book may be disappointed with all the missing jokes and scenes, but to film the entire book would have left us with a 10 hour movie. The writers did an excellent job distilling the essence of the novel, and the finished product has all the charm and wit of the original. The audience, many of whom I'm sure have never read the book (and many of whom, surprisingly, were male), laughed nonstop throughout the film, and everyone seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. As for those of us who have read it, I do believe that this is one of those rare book-to-movie jobs that was really spot-on, and everything that was noticeably changed in the process only makes the movie better.  So go see it, it's hands-down one of the best movies of 2001 so far."

","(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)<br/><br/>What really makes this movie stand out from a venerable list of other working girl fantasies is the familiar but one-of-a-kind personality of the irrepressible Bridget Jones. Created by novelist Helen Fielding, who also wrote the script, and brought to life by the talented and zany Renée Zellweger, Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old pleasingly plump London working girl, a ""...verbally incontinent spinster who...dresses like her mother"" (to quote Colin Firth's character, Mark Darcy). She is also clumsy, the kind of girl who might spill sauce on her blouse, a little overweight, smokes, drinks too much and sometimes says what she thinks without consulting her brain. She is also very good at improvising on the spot, a talent that charms not only the two leading men, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, who vie for her affection, but also the five o'clock news audience who like her bum and knickers just fine.<br/><br/>Director Sharon Maguire, in her first outing, combines Brit witticisms, slapstick pratfalls, raunchy, sharp and realistic dialogue, and a blatant but inoffensive sentimentality into a romantic comedy that surely has Nora Ephron and Julia Roberts paying close attention. She keeps us guessing about who will get the girl (and who really deserves the girl) with the usual misdirections and misunderstandings characteristic of the genre. There's a little dead time about half way in, and the uncertainty about whether Bridget wants Hugh Grant or Colin Firth is milked a bit overmuch, otherwise this is nicely paced entertainment sure to chase away a blue afternoon.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both very good, and Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother is a charming, dotty sight to see. Bridget's friends are funny as a kind of foil to the tired glamor of Yank TV's ""Friends."" And there's a darling ""home movie"" sequence during the closing credits purporting to recall Bridget at four and Mark Darcy at eight, that retrospectively and adorably frames the movie.<br/><br/>Should a CHICK FLICK ALERT be declared here? No doubt, but thanks to a warm, bubbly, funny and decidedly unprudish and unaffected (and I must say, somewhat daring) performance by Zellweger, we'll ignore it because we ""like her just the way she is."""
"MetaLark","9","46","59","30 October 2001"," Not a hardcore chick-flick
","Speaking as one familiar with ""Pride and Prejudice""--the book and the 1995 miniseries upon which this work is loosely based--I like this spunky little movie exceedingly well, just as it is. Do not be put off by superficial comparisons to ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill,"" both shallow and pretentious movies memorable only for one fine eulogy and some physically beautiful protagonists. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is more.<br/><br/>Bridget Jones is, as its soundtrack suggests, ""Everywoman."" Every woman who has ever fumbled for words, fallen on her face, been embarrassed by her mother, chosen her underwear carefully, picked a cad for a boyfriend--whether she's a thirty-something singleton or a sixty-something grandma--can identify with Bridget on some level. You can't help pulling for her. Cheering her on is cheering yourself on.<br/><br/>But this chick-flick is not hardcore; it has a broad sense of humor. Male viewers have been caught in the act--smirking. There is even a fistfight to warm insensitive martial hearts. A couple of famous people make appearances here, too--one with a million-dollar price on his head--Salman Rushdie, who plays himself in a wryly irreverent little sequence.<br/><br/>It's easy to miss the movie's charm on the first screening--some very good lines are swallowed at the ends; the gratuitous profanity, casual sex, prodigious smoking and drinking are turn-offs; the heroine is an awkward, fleshy woman with reprehensible fashion taste, and one may easily posit that she ended up with an unsuitable and unlikely mate.<br/><br/>But I contend, after a second viewing, that this movie is a little gem. There is a wonderful economy in the editing; every scene, every action tends toward only one possible conclusion, a PERFECT conclusion. And the childhood clips in the ending credits give credence to that conclusion and provide support for it--which is that the hero and heroine are made for each other.<br/><br/>I rate it a solid 9 (with a 10 for the BBC/1995 ""Pride and Prejudice"").<br/><br/>* * * *  S P O I L E R S   A H E A D  * * * *<br/><br/>At first glance, Miss Jones seems stupid and inept and the last woman in the world one would pick for the intelligent and successful Mr. Darcy. But consider this: Darcy already had ""a clever wife"" before--bliss must needs be sought elsewhere. Besides, Bridget, though somewhat gauche, is not unintelligent, as evidenced by her voiceovers and some of her sallies. But most of all this: Each has something the other needs--he is steady and reliable, she possesses liveliness and warmth. Notice the wistful look on Darcy's face as he watches Bridget and Cleaver cavorting on the river. He WANTS some nonsense and indecorum in his life--needs them; she would be his savior. Imagine Darcy's life if he had settled on the competent but priggish Natasha--both parties would have stagnated. Imagine if Bridget had surrendered to the charms of a Daniel Cleaver--fun for the nonce, but misery for the long haul.<br/><br/>No, this ending is perfect in every way, down to the last delightful epithet uttered by an aroused Darcy. And oh yes, the kiss--very promising indeed; at once tender and ardent, it leaves one with the distinct impression that Darcy will be something more than ""helpful in the kitchen."""
"kwongers","10","88","119","10 February 2004"," Delightful, witty, and sexy  a TRIUMPH!
","As a huge fan of the books, I had incredibly high expectations of the movie. In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  <br/><br/>	 Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachablewe can relate to her.  <br/><br/>As Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. <br/><br/>
Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very muchjust the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) 	<br/><br/>I also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10"
"Critic2017B","10","51","67","1 June 2005"," My favorite Romantic Comedy
","This film I only discovered fairly recently, and just absolutely fell in love with it. It sure seemed familiar and lo and behold then I read about the Pride and Prejudice connection and then it all made complete sense.<br/><br/>This is such a charming, lovely homage to Pride and Prejudice. The three lead characters are just perfect. It is funny, sweet at times, sad at others, and just wonderfully sexy and v. romantic (especially the last 1/4th of it).<br/><br/>Renee is so extraordinary as Bridget Jones, who would have ever thought she could play so believable a modern Brit woman so well. Her accent seems flawless to me. Hugh Grant is hilarious and a charming Lothario throughout. But Colin Firth is who really sold me on this film. His ability to play a guy that you start out not liking but drooling over by the end of the movie is sublime.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the less is more style of acting that Mr. Firth puts forth in this film...much of his performance is in his eyes and his facial expressions. While Daniel (Mr. Grant's character) chatters on and on and tries to charm with his wit and words, Mark Darcy (Mr. Firth's character) just has a strong and rather silent presence along with an integrity of character that is revealed and he wins us over (as well as Bridget).<br/><br/>This movie has a lot going on outside of the wonderful romance as well. Contemporary events, gender inequities, social differences, work place decorum, fashion, self-image, sex, family, and friendship all come under the scrutiny of Bridget Jones and her diary.<br/><br/>This is a very good adaptation of a beloved novel. The tone, scene selection, dialogue and characters capture the essence of what fans of the book love about it. I cannot imagine it any better cast or written."

","What made this film work? What made this film break the usual British romantic conventional route? One actress! Her name is Renee Zellwegger, seriously, if the actress was British, this film would've been -'been there, done that'. Instead, this clever casting has made Bridget Jones a wonderful little picture.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger is an actress who changed to suit the screenplay, now that is ACTING! Her mannerisms, her weight, her enthusiasm and cutesy style are a wonder to behold.<br/><br/>Colin Firth does a great job, he plays his role well, a future James Bond perhaps? Hugh Grant finally gives us something different, he was actually quite funny at times.<br/><br/>Maguire as the director handles the proceedings extremely well, this is her debut and I think she will become quite successful with small films. The Super35 wide-screen frame is used well, bravo! The screenplay is lightweight, but written well, plenty of ad-lib and spontaneity transcend the script.<br/><br/>As a male, sit back and have a laugh. Quality!"
"justwand","10","76","108","17 November 2001"," Colin Firth is magical! It is a pity that most Americans don't know who he is.
","Bridget Jones's Diary is full of lighthearted fun.  The cast is wonderful - especially true for Colin Firth. His performance is magical.  Being given such a thin material to work with, playing a `dreadful cold fish', he has artfully shown Mark Darcy's kindness and charm that gradually wins everyone's heart.  This would be an impossible mission for actors other than Colin Firth.  I enjoy every minute of his performance.  In my opinion, they should give this nice boy more camera times - that's the only complain I have about this movie.  Besides this complain, I have to congratulate the whole production team for successfully creating a movie of such weightless fun, and at the same time being honest and sincere to the human emotions. It is very hard to believe that this movie is Sharon Maguire's first one. I never read the book.  So, you can trust my observation to be totally independent of the book.  If you wish to have some fun and also like to dream a little bit, this is definitely the movie for you. BTW.  If you enjoy watching drama and haven't seen Colin Firth's ""Pride And Prejudice"" (BBC), do yourself a favor and rent it.  He is *really* a great ""Character Actor"" - one of the most talented alive."
"Spleen","Null","62","90","13 April 2002"," It's not just charming - I insist it's charming
","With certain bad movies - ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is a famous extreme example - you start to wonder if there's something wrong with people who don't realise that they're bad.  I'm not saying that if someone LIKES ""Plan 9"" then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired; the suspicious, unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film, but being of the opinion that it's good.  (Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like ""Timecode"", where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.)  And something similar applies to, say, ""Citizen Kane"". Disliking it makes sense; thinking it's a bad film does not.<br/><br/>But there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  ""Dumbo"" is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might (mistakenly) have a low opinion of ""Dumbo"": some of the footage IS mere padding, the triumph at the end is too swift, the charge has been laid (falsely, but not ludicrously) that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think ""Dumbo"" is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't, THEN I'm suspicious.<br/><br/>I feel this way, to a greater or lesser degree, about a number of light comedies, and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" (N.B.: I'm male), but all the same, I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones, the central character, in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful (as beautiful as Renée Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind-hearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws, but none is particularly pronounced, most are purely negative and anyway, she shares them all with the rest of us - so don't pretend you're not like this, too.<br/><br/>This is an amiable, well-written and fresh romantic comedy with, for ONCE, an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon (I suppose there always are), and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do, but, dammit, you'd better LIKE it."

","Speaking as a singleton of a certain age, I found this move dead on. Although set in England, the theme and feelings of single people everywhere were universal.  The plot line stayed pretty true to the book with a few exceptions but the tone stayed the same.  I know when I went to see this with a female friend there were many men in the audience who looked like they had been dragged there but 5 minutes into the move they were laughing as hard (if not harder) than the women in the audience.  This is definitely not just a ""chick flick."" Renee Zellweger was a perfect Bridget.  When I first heard that she was going to play this role, I was skeptical but after I saw it(which I did twice, so far!) I couldn't imagine anyone else with such a mixture of cynicism and innocence.  Bravo to the casting of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth as Cleaver and Darcy, respectively.  If this movie doesn't win some Oscars it will be a crying shame."
"Quinoa1984","7","12","17","14 April 2001"," One of the most charming romantic comedies in a while
","Bridget Jones's Diary actually gave some laughs, and for that alone gives this film reccomendation, since so few romantic comedies now adays (outside of the classic Woody Allen flick) deliver laughs WITH corny plot twists.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger is as charming as she was in Jerry Maguire and Nurse Betty (though Nurse Betty has her best work) as a British woman who has some low self esteem about herself- she drinks, smokes, and eats too much, and has trouble staying away from bad boyfriends.  In the movie, it focuses on her relationships with Colin Firfth, a honest British lawyer, and Hugh Grant who is a coniving yet charming scoundrel.<br/><br/>Some of the movie might be a tad too over-conventional for some tastes (at times it was for me), but the film delivers enough surprises and good feelings (lame for me to say that isn't it) that it should make for a good date movie that the guy might not hate with all his being.

","I think I must have different contact lenses from the other people who've commented on this film.  Either that, or I saw a different film.<br/><br/>                      ***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br/><br/>First of all, I have to say that I found this a mildly amusing film with some good moments that made me laugh out loud.  <br/><br/>I also have to agree that Renee Zellweger does a fantastic job playing Bridget Jones:  she's plain, gawky, funny, warm, sincere, and a real twit all at the same time.  That said, I confess it took me a little while to warm to her character, partly because Bridget is such a twit.  I mean, she's 32 years old and she doesn't have a clue how to fix a meal for friends?  She automatically assumes that first-date sex is inevitable even before a relationship begins (hence the underwear angst)?  She cannot string two words together without babbling?<br/><br/>I guess the thing that bothers me the most about this film, though, and people's glowing reactions to it, is wondering what Bridget and Mark are going to talk about from now on.  I mean, he's a top barrister with education, money, social standing, and a variety of interests, humanitarian and otherwise.  Bridget, on the other hand, seems to have no interests, other than drinking, smoking, feeling sorry for herself, and catching a man. She's not intelligent, well-educated, committed to anything, or even with the prospect of being a viable, supporting housewife.  At least with Daniel, cad though he clearly is, [I muse cynically here] she had fun--and so did Daniel.  Fun and Darcy don't actually go in the same sentence! In the end, I thought she ended up with the wrong man.<br/><br/>I walked out of the movie theater a bit disappointed.  I'd heard lots of good things about this film, and although it has some good moments and some funny lines, and Zellweger's acting is commendable, I thought the film just didn't live up to expectations."
"stephen509","10","21","36","19 January 2006"," Bridget Jones review: By me!
","i absolutely LOVE this movie. Its had me in tears of laughter. Bridget Jones, arguably the funniest film of 2001, I think you'll agree. This is a film for anyone over the age of 15, but honestly I think seeing as I'm not fifteen myself, everyone will most probably love it. But, I'll give you one piece of advice, DO NOT, and I repeat DO NOT watch it with your parents or grandparents because it will lead to utter embarrassment.The Storyline- It's New Year's Day, hung over and still single, Bridget Jones- a 30-something year old journalist girl from London-decides to start a great new life. And in order to do so, she decides to keep a diary. Of which she rights down everything from her calories gained to her instant messaging with Daniel Cleaver (her boss). She makes new years resolutions such as: to stop smoking; make better use of time; and learn to programme video. It is a film like no other, a masterpiece of great storytelling. As for the genre-it is a Romantic Comedy, which is very equally balanced, which on one hand, makes you feel very sorry for Bridget at times, but on the other will leave you laughing uncontrollably. I mean, come on, how many films have you seen with a great storyline, a love triangle, and that can make you laugh till your ribs hurt? Now I think of it, not many!Characters: Mark Darcy, the love of Bridget's life, and Daniel Cleaver, quite funnily enough, also, the love of Bridget's life are sworn enemies. Mark is a very upper-class sophisticated character. Who is sometimes very up himself. Daniel is the complete opposite; he is a very laid back easy-going character. Jude, Sharon and Tom-Bridget's three best friends which give her some of the worst advice you can think of. But they do try to help, Tom-The main character-Bridget is a working class girl, slightly overweight, or so she thinks. She is infatuated with Daniel before Mark comes along.<br/><br/>Movie Soundtrack-Well, I can't say it has the best choice in music to be honest, but its okay, if you're into the whole complaining of heart-ache scene. But I suppose it goes well with the movie so I can get over that. On the other hand, there are quite a few classics in the movie such as; all by myself and without you."

It is called a romantic comedy but where are the jokes? It just an highly ""escapistik"" movie if you please recall the content. There is a drug addicted, not especially good looking woman in her mid-thirties as protagonist. She is clumsy and has no real abilities.

","One word sums up this movie: Idiotic.  British humor can be funny.  `Men Behaving Badly' and `Coupling' are very funny British shows I see occasionally on BBC America. But, for the love of God, this movie is positively not funny.  It also is complete foolishness, not funny foolishness but utter foolishness.  Sleep inducing foolishness.  Most of the characters are unlikable in almost every way.  Bridget is not very intelligent to put it lightly.  Her escapades I assume were supposed to be amusing but were more or less annoying.  Hugh Grant is by far and away my least favorite actor of all time.  If I had known he was in the movie I would most likely have skipped it altogether.  Colin Firth's character was the only character I enjoyed watching.  He at least had some kind of intelligence and depth along with a little mystery and intrigue.<br/><br/>In short, I wrote this because I am flabbergasted at how highly this movie is rated here.  To put it in simple termsThis movie sucks big time.  So for those of you who have not seen this film and say to yourself `IMDB ranks it high so it must be good,' think again.

Firstly, Renee Zellwegger has a nice English accent, yet I was put off by the idea of weight.  She looks incredibly plump, yet we're expected to believe she's a ""whopping"" 131 lbs. Whopping? Since when was that a lot?  Wasn't there just a People article describing Charlize Theron's 125 lb. frame?  Not very realistic.  And people wonder about the rising eating disorder rate, when a size 4 is considered 'plump'.<br/><br/>The story itself was sickening.  Alright, so Bridget makes a bonehead mistake by having an affair with her sleazy boss; I admit, I cheered her on when she wised up, yet the other leading male, Mark Darcy (played emotionally-dead by Colin Firth) made me snort.  He's arrogant, rude, and puts Bridget down so much, yet she ultimately jumps from one sleazeball to another.  So what does Bridget learn?  That someone loves her ""just the way she is"" (except when he calls her a foolish idiot, among other unpleasantries)?  What am I supposed to do?  Congratulate Bridget on this?<br/><br/>If you want to see a great movie about switching one's life around and standing up for oneself, watch ""American Beauty"".  Kevin Spacey breathed so much more life into Lester Burnham, and he didn't take crap from his wife or anybody by the film's end."

","Bridget Jones's Diary is a surprisingly good movie.  Detractors who deride it for its admittedly minimalist plot miss the point - this is a film that shows life without the layers of artificiality favoured by directors (resulting in movies somehow removed from the realm of the everyday in which us mere mortals dwell).  Life is frequently aimless and trivial; and therein lies the movie's attraction.  Notwithstanding of course that this is a very funny and highly original comedy.<br/><br/>
Bridget (played with considerable aplomb by Renee Zellweger) belongs to the ranks of that modern phenomenon - the over-30, unmarried career woman. Just when it seems Bridget may be destined for terminal spinster-hood, two opposing forces enter her life - charming cad Daniel, and uptight (but very sexy) lawyer Mark.  Which of the two is her Mr. Right?  And why does everyone insist on asking that question detested by all singletons - ""How's your love life going?""  The movie's conclusion is predictable, and although any other ending would leave the audience feeling cheated, it does seem somewhat tame and ultimately unsatisfying.<br/><br/>
The film encourages the viewer both to get involved with Bridget emotionally and to laugh at her at the same time.  Perhaps the best joke is the milieu inhabited by her parents - where the mini-gherkin is the height of sophistication, and 60-year-olds throw garden parties with such alarming themes as 'tarts and vicars'.  Bridget is certainly no social butterfly, and whilst we cringe at her public embarrassments (notably her TV report involving a fireman's pole and a bottom the size of Brazil), we triumph with her when she manages to turn a bad situation to her advantage.  Maybe we can recognise a little bit of Bridget Jones in all of us."

","Bridget Jones Diaries  or ""How Many Times You Can Say the 'F' Word in One Movie or Within Each Five Minutes?"" Frankly, I knew beforehand that I was probably not going to be thrilled with the Bridget Jones' movies; however, my fixation on Colin Firth's career since I saw him in ""Pride and Prejudice"" finally overcame my good sense. I rented both movies.<br/><br/>Amazingly, from the beginning, I was utterly stupefied to hear the amount of foul ""F"" words come out of some of the characters mouths. I couldn't really believe how many situations they felt that word needed to be used  one character used it repeatedly when she talked and it was actually supposed to be FUNNY! Among this, we are supposed to find a plot in the fact that this supreme klutz with her horrible taste in clothes is trying to find true love between two different men  or between two different sets of bed sheets. Bridgett does one mistake after another and can't seem to keep her goal on anything.<br/><br/>The viewers are supposed to believe that while she is having rampant kinky sex with Hugh Grant, the ""real"" love of her life, Colin Firth, is watching with longing from a distance. He has issues with the Hugh Grant character that are not revealed until the end, even though all the evidence is very clear that Grant is the one in the wrong. After all, Bridgett, look what he did to you.<br/><br/>In the meantime, we are supposed to swallow the fact that Firth's character is still crazy about Bridget and forget the fact that  out of the celluloid  a normal man would probably think twice or more about getting involved with a woman  any woman  who was sexually involved with the man who broke up his marriage. Very neat, huh? And oh, so romantic, that this is not even mentioned. Yeah, right! Ask any jealous husband or wife in the same situation.<br/><br/>If England thinks this type of movie  with the ending line by Firth's character, which not surprising includes one last offensive ""F"" word remark  is romantic, then no wonder their divorce and illegitimate children rates are up! <br/><br/>There are two other points that have to be addressed when discussing this first Bridget Jones movie. I heard that the writer watched ""Pride and Prejudice"" and modeled Colin Firth's character from the ""Mr. Darcy"" character he portrayed in the P&P movie. I wonder what hallucinogenic drugs she was on while watching the A&E production? Another item I heard was that using Renée Zellweger as Bridget Jones was in essence like using Vivian Leigh as Scarlet O'Hara. Yeah, right. Only Scarlet slept around after marriage and basically wasn't a slut! Furthermore, Vivian Leigh could act."

","On first hearing about this film, dread filled my soul like a fart in an elevator. And as its simile counterpart, news of the event spread fast, catching up with my girlfriend like a fat sprinter in a cherry pie dash. As the lightning crashed and the thunder rolled, words that Mankind had feared since ages past found form on my girlfriend's lips: ""Hey Mark, let's go and see Bridget Jone's Diary""...<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, ladies, I do like many films that are considered 'Chick Flicks', one of my all time favourites being 'Muriel's Wedding' or 'The Truth about Cats and Dogs'. The apprehension that clung to the bosom of my weariness lay more in the lack of any depth to the character/s. Bridget Jones is naive and abit thick - you'd think that any woman who was now about mid 30s could at least have a decent stab (no pun intended) at guessing if some guy (i.e. High Grant's Character) is a muppet. Although I can let that slide on the evidence so many friends have given me on how enigmatic most guys are (and how most of us are bastards, haha).<br/><br/>Some of the jokes will most likely need explaining to quite a few guys. One example is why a chorus of laughter followed her getting drunk and singing bad love songs alone. Another example is when she's sliding down a pole, smacks her arse into the camera and generates crowds of girly laughter as if the audience had been contracted to provide tinned laughter for some slap-stick home video show.<br/><br/>One issue however was with the tedious-neuroticism of Bridget Jones and her celebrating the latest fashions of excess with her incessant drinking and smoking. As I say I don't hate romantic comedies, it's just that this one seemed proud to have no depth and sectioning 50% of the humour to the 'Need to be explained to men' section...<br/><br/>If your a girl you'll probably find this a stunning exploration into the amorous side of woman-kind, where a single real-sized woman stands up amidst a backlash of what male-kind throws at her. Despite all the disappointments and let-downs, her optimism has not been misplaced as prince charming finally cuts a path through the web of first-impressions, pride and prejudice (pun intentional) to sweep her off her feet... though if you read the sequel, Mark Darcy turns out not so positive.<br/><br/>If you're a guy, it'll be mildy funny but a little tedious in places and Renee Zellweger'd get it..."
"jmerrington","3","11","22","10 August 2003"," A film with major problems.
","I can't say I hated this film at all, though I have a lot of pretty major problems with it. Ok, the first: I don't think Briget is a likeable or sympathetic character. Her romance with Mark seems not only contrived but also lacks even the slightest chemistry or realism. Its little more than a ridiculous feminine fantasy lacking anything deeper, like actual emotion for instance. Her boss is a much more realistic and likeable figure - he makes one mistake and has to pay for it over and over again. The fact that he doesn't want to settle down with Briget and get married, etc, makes him evil. Are men then meant to wait their entire lives for the perfect woman and forsake all others? Come on. Secondly, it bothers me that for an English film to be accepted by America (I class this as an English film very loosely) it seems that it has to be concerned only with the dull lovelives of obnoxious upper middle class London media types, who amount to less than 0.1% of the population. As an Englishman I see nothing of the England I know in this film, or in Sliding Doors, Notting Hill, etc. Thirdly, the music is gut-wrenchingly appalling. Having said all this, I still don't hate it."

","Bridget Jone's Diary is of course the book that was made into a movie. This movie was released in 2004 mostly for European countries. RenÃ©e Zellweger plays the main character called 'Bridget'. Bridget is in her late 30's and is not married; she is very concerned and starts to keep a diary. Now starts the movie. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant co-star as amiable men that she falls for. Other actor/actresses like Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones also co-star. I would give this movie a 10/10 for an excellent script. The movie is very humorous and shows different personalities of all the actors. The movie does contain sexual references and swearing so watch out if you are seeing it with younger children. Renee shows how wonderfully she can fake an English accent in this movie as well because of course she is American. This is probably one of the best pieces of works i have seen from Colin Firth as well. The movie must have been good you may think because there was a follow-up. The movie soon spread to America and critics from over here also give it wide remarks. I would recommend this movie too you 100%. Thanks for reading this and have a nice day! Bye"

It could have been a comedy with some depth to it, but there were too many stock Hollywood sequences like a fight breaking out with the restaurant windows breaking and cliches like that.  The music didn't fit well, it seemed too obvious that they were trying to sell the soundtrack. (I know, what else is new?)

Let's face it -- Daniel is a dog. But Mark is a very well educated, accomplished man. I'm so glad that Bridget ends up with someone so worthy of her and her sweetness and good heart.<br/><br/>Mark is very cautious because he has been hurt before. Therefore, his willingness to proclaim his feelings for Bridget and commit to her must be very difficult for him but he does because he wants Bridget in his life. Since he is an attorney, I would also assume he is very analytical and has looked at his relationship with Bridget from every angle imaginable.<br/><br/>I also think that Bridget might remind him a little of his mother. Remember, folks, his mother is the one who picked out his Christmas ties and wanted to fix up Bridget and Mark in the first place. Also, Mark has seen how happy his parents have been for 40 years, so his mother's playfulness and humor probably contributed a lot to that fact. Besides, Mark has worked hard to become a very accomplished and well-thought of attorney, and he needs to balance it with the love, affection, sweetness, silliness, tenderness, and humor that Bridget can offer. <br/><br/>I just love this movie."

Not to mention that ""fat"" Bridget is not that fat at all - the majority of women these days wouldn't look half so good in that bunny suit.

I suppose he probably was bored and uninspired, considering this is exactly the type of role Colin keeps getting thrown into.<br/><br/>I understand that the book (which I haven't read) was based on ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the movie turned out as such a blatant knock off of P&P that it probably would have made more sense to acknowledge the inspiration in the previews.

"paul2001sw-1","3","6","12","14 November 2004"," Bridget Jones's dreary
","In the early 1990s, British newspapers were suddenly filled with columns written by journalists suffering from the arrogant delusion that their own lives were an subject matter of interest to their readers; journalists who often, with a startling lack of awareness, expressed shock and surprise when some of those they ridiculed in their articles (spouses, friends, etc.) took public offence. In response Sue Limb started writing the 'Dulcie Domum' column in 'The Guardian', an entertaining spoof whose fictional author was a struggling writer, whose limited understanding of the implications of their own words was the best part of the joke. 'Helen Fielding's 'Bridget Jones's Diary' came later in 'The Independent', but was very much in a similar vein.<br/><br/>In both columns, the terse style of a diary was used to invoke images of complete catastrophe in a minimum of words. Arguably, both belonged to a tradition started not in newspapers at all but by Sue Townsend in her 'Adrian Mole' books a number of years before. <br/><br/>'Bridget Jones', of course, had much more success than 'Dulcie Domum', although the writing was actually less good. But its subject matter, that of a thirty-something woman looking for love, had more resonance, I like to think because the concept was implemented with some subtlety. Bridget was a woman with deeply ambiguous feelings towards the romantic dream (of getting married, having kids etc.) that seemed to have passed her by; but was also a woman with little self-confidence whose erratic mood and behavioural swings owed much to her inability to handle the knowledge that she'd failed to fit the only approved template for a woman's life. The hidden tragedy was that if only she could think more of herself, she might find her life (disasters included) was actually not so bad. The column thus sympathised with Bridget, laughed at her, but contained also a degree of feminist anger at the way social values can on occasion reduce even highly competent women to states of emotional imbicility. But popularity brought popularisation: a move to 'The Daily Telegraph', then to hard covers and finally to celluloid.<br/><br/>And the load of witless drivel that is this film.<br/><br/>The original idea has here been reduced to a sub-Austen story about a beautiful but utterly ditzy idiot (with an apparent mental age of about thirteen) appearing in lots of sitcom-inspired moments of excruciating embarrassment, and falling in love at the same time. In many respects, the film character is the sort of person the original Bridget might have feared (when at her lowest ebb) she would become if she didn't find a man: a recognisable caricature of herself, but not the same thing at all. The essential angst of Bridget's condition is not dwelt on at all (the original was reliably single except for occasional one night stands, the film version claims to be afraid of being left alone but actually has no shortage of chasing men); while the dry comments of the diary, instead of inspiring the imagination as they did in the columns, in the film simply underscore already obvious incidents (the use of pop music to re-enforce every other point is also crass). Meanwhile, the overall direction of the plot is telegraphed from the start. American Renee Zwelleger manages of British accent of sorts, but her social class is wrong (she sounds far too posh): indeed, the essentially middle class dreariness of the original Bridget's life is traded for something altogether more glamorous (and fake). The film also invites us to accept her self-assessment as ""fat"" as face-value (it's true she fattened up for the role, but this tells us nothing except the perverse standards of actresses).<br/><br/>'Bridget Jones Diary' is romance for teenagers (the smutty, unfunny jokes and exaggerated swearing also confirm this). Incidentally, a new report out last week said there are far more single men than woman in Bridget's age bracket. But there's no market, I guess, for films that encourage men to do themselves down and identify with characters as juvenile as the Bridget who is represented here. The implications of that statement are even more depressing than this monotone film."

","Renee Zellweger's ludicrous British accent is only one of the outrages perpetrated in Sharon Maguire's film of the Helen Fielding bestseller about the life and loves of a thirty-something single woman. This is a film that could set the feminist cause back thirty years with its shamelessly aggressive belief that women have careers only to make themselves more available to men and that life isn't worth living if Mr. Right doesn't come along. Zellweger spends the entire film trying to convince us she's got the accent down but she's only a caricature--and a blank one at that. Maguire, meanwhile, spends just as much effort trying to convince us that a natural beauty like Zellweger is fat and plain--it's a sham (much like Janeane Garafolo is in `The Truth About Cats & Dogs'). The rest of the cast is uninspired; even the dependable Hugh Grant, trying to play against type as a cad, barely registers a pulse and Colin Firth, as Mr. Right, is curiously unlikable.

There is no inner core to the protagonist but a shallowness that detracts from any suspense as to what might happen next. As a result, watching Bridget becomes embarrassing and boring rather than exciting and funny considering the intent of the story, that of an obese 30 years old who wants to find a man. The whole film seems like an exercise in throwing out everything that worked (Bridget's great female friends, for one) in the book and keeping the worst parts (the parents and their excruciating friends) that ultimately fail to add up to anything.

","I haven't read the books; and neither am I a big fan of rom-coms and other ""girly-flics"". So I approached this movie with some supreme caution, reluctance and even dread.<br/><br/>However, some 90 odd minutes later, I have to say what a joy it was!<br/><br/>Lonely Girl (Bridget): identity crisis, getting old before her time, a dreamer, but scared of getting left behind as a cranky old spinster.<br/><br/>Total Cad of the Highest Order (Cleaver, Bridget's boss): womaniser, lier, betrayer of naive women's hearts; handsome, a weaver of words and irresistible to Bridget.<br/><br/>Boorish Barrister (Darcy): lives in a suffocating world of vacuous, society, people, boring jobs, boring lives; and shackled to the most hideous wife-to-be imaginable. <br/><br/>All three are inextricably linked, yet who will Bridget ultimately find true love with? <br/><br/>Yes, this kind of story has been done to death, Yes, it had a very predictable storyline, Yes, it was dreadfully clichéd, Yes, it stretches realism hugely, Yes, it yet again gave a rather stilted & blinkered view of jolly old upper-middle class England, Yes, it had a very telegraphed ending.<br/><br/>But you know what? I couldn't care a jot!<br/><br/>For it was pure, simple entertainment: I cared not about any of the above; I cared not how the film didn't live up to the expectations of the book; and I really cared not whether a ""plump"" Bridget Jones could really hit it off with a two very handsome men!<br/><br/>Just take the film at face value and leave the cynicism on the doorstep.<br/><br/>My wife loved it, and I was very entertained by it, especially with its light humour & slapstick; and of course the rather feel-good ending.<br/><br/>For a person who prefers far more weightier genres & more thought-provoking scripts, I didn't think I would ever enjoy a rom-com.

She thinks she finds the perfect man and for a couple of weeks she's really happy she thinks she's got it all but unfortunately Daniel isn't as perfect as he seems and they break up and she depressed again.

"Corky1984","Null","2","3","20 April 2005"," Better than the sequel but that isn't difficult!
","This film is complete tripe. Make no mistake about that. But when you compare it to Bridget Jones 2 it looks a lot better. Its better than movie 2 because at least it was new, if not original, following on from all those 90s English chick-flicks. There are a host of familiar faces in the film, most of whom coast through the film clearly waiting for the cheque to arrive. Jim Broadbent is welcome in the film, but after his brilliant appearances as Slater in Only Fools and Horses its sad to see him wasting his time in this bilge. The jokes are predictable and come with so much warning that you have time to redecorate your house before they arrive. Renee bumbles along as Bridget, her English accent all well and proper, her acting sadly not. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth play themselves as usual, and many blokes who view the film will secretly be hoping that Arnie makes an appearance to blow them away with a machine gun! Alas, they limp on. The music backing the film is that kind of cheap, cheesy commercial radio pop that is supposed to be 'uplifting' but is actually dated and boring. This film will amuse those who like the genre but for those who seek a little more you will be left cold. Overall a lazy effort from Richard Curtis who is in danger of destroying his credibility. He should really get back to Blackadder, we're well overdue a fifth series............."

","The main thing that appeals to me in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the fact that it is so recognizable. Of course it isn't exactly the same as my life, but the fact of getting older, the fear of having to live the rest of your life on your own without a partner, difficulties at work... all are very recognizable. Perhaps that's why I liked this movie so much. The other reason may be that, despite the fact that she doesn't exactly look like Miss World in this movie, Renée Zellweger has something appealing and adorable. She doesn't look like a model, but as the average woman, with all her imperfections like being slightly overweight, drinking, smoking, saying whatever she thinks... and she gets away with it perfectly.<br/><br/>I'm sure that the fact that Hugh Grant has an important role in this movie as her boss, also makes that this romantic comedy works. As we all know, this is the kind of movies he has been doing so many times before and he is really good at it. His typical British flair and humor were essential to make this movie work perfectly.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but if it is as good as this movie, than I definitely should give it a try. I really liked the movie and had some great laughs (for instance with the blue soup). In fact I think I can say this is a very charming romantic comedy with some excellent humor in it that should be seen by all. I give it an 8/10"

I saw it on the big screen and got into it wholeheartedly from the beginning. This movie combines a witty script, featuring classic comedy with great acting. Renee is perfect for the lead role, as she was utterly charming and whimsical in this. <br/><br/>Actually Hugh Grant was pretty good as well, It's difficult for me to think any female wouldn't love this(of coarse everyone has the right to their own opinion). I found Bridget to be a very realistic character as well as the characters of many around her. The attitudes that were shown toward Bridget as a single girl are indeed very realistic even in today's times. <br/><br/>I'd say this was one of the best movies of 2001 and a movie I'd wholeheartedly suggest seeing, to anyone who may not have seen it as of yet.It's warm, witty and fun.

"stephenwallace-1","10","2","3","31 July 2001"," Oddly dark but a wonderful film performance from Renee Z
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS***<br/><br/>I saw this film at its previews in Australia in July and was hesitant and a bit resistant because of all the raves from overseas. Also Renee Zellwegger had only come to Oz very briefly three weeks before for about a minute and there was no real premiere. I was glad she came but I suppose I felt it would have been nice to have her there for a premiere...I though maybe there was something wrong with the film...<br/><br/>On first sight I thought the film awkwardly directed, not as smooth as Four Weddings and a Funeral, a bit oddly darker and Hugh Grant seemed to be hamming it up. Also there were some faltering, unbelievable moments towards the end of the film: like the big fight scene between Daniel and Darcy (they smash up a restaurant and the owner says NOTHING!)and the rather ridiculous ending (American style)where Bridget runs semi naked through the  snow in pursuit of 'Mr Darcy'(who walked out of her flat to buy her a new diary without so much as mentioning to her that he was doing it! (He'd just stopped her from going to Paris for New Year with her friends!) Has anyone EVER seen a British woman run out into the snow in her knickers and camisole and a cardigan? I think not. British women are the greatest overdressers in the world, at least when I was there. They are very vivacious women but bold, ridiculous displays of emotional longing are not their forte. Still, I am not British so what do I know?<br/><br/>Despite all this I thought the film VERY funny and on second viewing, despite still some of the sometimes formula direction (wide shot, medium shot, close up) there was also some very imaginatively directed scenes (the aerial shot across the wheat paddock seeing Daniel's sports car and Bridget doing her Grace Kelly impersonation was bold and effective and must've taken an age, the title sequence when Bridget mouths to the song 'All By Myself' was inspired as were some of the drunk scenes in her room...the falling out of the taxi etc, and the fire pole sequence.<br/><br/>However, for my money the most riveting thing about the film (and the director has to take full credit for this too)was Renee Zellwegger's performance. Considering she's a Texan this was a truly wonderful demonstration of cinema acting. To me, though she still stumbled a little with the accent, she was entirely convincing as the person 'Bridget Jones', she created a very believable person, at least in emotional tone. Perhaps not totally English because Renee Zellwegger has more direct access to her emotions than one sees in English women in general (I'm not saying they're not emotional just that they don't seem to display it!). Well, even more than Australian or American women if it comes to that. What distinguishes her performances (and it's true also of Jerry Maguire)from other actresses is her belief in the intensity of the moment, especially in moments of intimacy in relationships.  Renee Zellwegger takes enormous emotional risks all the time (look at her weight gain for this film) and she understands the way cinema acting works outwards from sincerity and emotional openness and spontaneity. How it can radiate if you only let it. Even Julia Roberts can't get near her in this department.<br/><br/>There is an intimate moment with Hugh Grant when they are in bed together on the 'weekend', when he tells her that he has to go back to work and not to the Tarts and Vicars party, when, for a few seconds, she looks at his face(a few feet away)with such intense and painful longing and love that she transcends the moment in that radiant way that only cinema can capture. I don't know any other actress who does this with such easy passion. It looked effortless.<br/><br/>There's another moment with Daniel, near the lift after she's been gawked at by the 'tits pervert' Mr FitzHerbert, when he tries to take her aside to ask her out and she suddenly giggles. It's only a moment but the giggle means everything...embarrassment at FitzHerbert, anticipation of Daniel's interest and just general sense of fun. Was this directed? To me it's an undirectable magic moment that must surely come out of Renee Zellwegger's spontaneity. But Sharon Maguire knew about it and got many of these moments out of her actress.<br/><br/>When Daniel tells her he's engaged to the American publisher, the camera dwells on Renee till she goes out the door. The subtlety of the pain and emotional transition in her face as she leaves and the subsequent shot of her sitting at her computer, to me, is cinema acting at its emotionally balanced best. It might seem obvious to the eye but I think it is very difficult to get it on film. How often does one see even an attempt at subtlety and understated intensity in big budget movies? Most film acting, especially in love stories, is overstated and over controlled. Renee Zellwegger conveys the inner life of Bridget, the inner passion of Bridget (and all of us) so truthfully that you hardly notice it.<br/><br/>
She also allows herself to be dressed in the Bunny outfit, not very flattering, and to pull on huge knickers in a not very flattering shot. This only added to the emotional range and truth of the character. To me, it's great to see an actress (now an A list actress I guess) not protecting her image of herself all the time but actually trying to act the part.<br/><br/>I think this attitude, plus Renne's magic intense moments, made Bridget Jones more than it might have been. It still has some very funny lines, a wonderful performance from Bridget's gay friend Tom (?) and from Gemma Jones (as her mom) and some great use of music, though I thought putting It's Raining Men over the fight scene was a bit insensitive. It'll be big hit in Australia. So well done Working Title in general and Sharon Maguire in particular (though with a slight reservation)."

I must say though that Renée Zellweger does a wonderful job and earns her Oscar nomination for portraying Bridget Jones. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant fit their roles well also. The script is pretty average for a film like this, I don't know why but I wasn't really struck with the writing like a lot of people were, although I did like hearing Bridget's narration throughout the movie. And there were also some pretty genuinely funny moments. Now with all that said, that still doesn't mean that this romantic comedy is the best of its kind, in my opinion it's not. There were just some scenes that I thought lagged on too long and other parts that were dull. I do think that there are better romantic comedies to choose from out there, but it is worth just one watch just to see Renée Zellweger, because she really shines, if only the rest of the movie would've kept up with her. 6/10."

Despite her embarrassment she holds it together. She begins a diary, which consists of her opinions of people around her. At a Christmas party her mother attempts to set her up with that quiet childhood boy she never liked, who has grown to become a successful barrister. The men in her life somehow elude her. She is currently involved with her boss, a publisher whom is unable to commit himself. She supports her father when her mother leaves with another man. Great directing debut by Sharon Maguire with Renee Zellweger's ravishing presence for comedy. Colin Firth plays her childhood friend now barrister who is involved in a routine relationship that impresses others, yet he sees expressive freedom in Jones. Hugh Grant plays her non-committing boss in a daring yet charming performance. A highlight comic moment arrives when both males get into an awkward fist fight over a situation that isn't so visible at first. Jim Broadbent as Jones's father demonstrates forgiveness when dealing with affection. Gemma Jones plays Bridget's confused mother who always attempts to fix her daughter up on dates.

","A delightful film which accurately and skilfully adapts Helen Fielding's unusual novel for the screen. Key to the film's success is Renee Zellweger who is truly outstanding as Bridget. I expect that a few eyebrows were raised when an American actress got the part of the quintessentially English heroine  but Ms Zellweger delivers a performance of such authenticity that you soon forget her Texan roots. It is not just her accent (accurate though that is) but she IS the epitome of a thirty-something English girl of modern times. She is Bridget Jones.<br/><br/>As with most movies in which Richard Curtis is involved below the surface of the very funny script there are some quite serious undercurrents running. These include the fact that groups of friends are a source of strength when times are difficult. We saw this in ""Four Weddings"" and ""Notting Hill"" and we see it again here. Indeed some of the best moments involve Bridget's support group with James Callis particularly good as the gay faded pop star.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Colin Firth bring to life the very different characters of Daniel Cleaver and Mark Darcy and there is a delightful cameo by James Faulkner as the predatory Uncle Geoffrey. But the best supporting performance is Jim Broadbent who believably portrays Bridget's father coping with the mid life crisis of his rather barmy wife.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is also good  worth buying the album."

"denis888","7","1","1","19 August 2007"," Pure Fun, Excellent Entertainment, Albeit A Bit Rude
","Bridger Jones is a clear phenomenon, nobody can deny the fact. What Helen Fielding managed to achieve with her book is enormous. Here, both in the novel and the film, we see the heroine who is far, far from perfect. She, in words of Mr. Darcy, smokes like a chimney, drinks lake a fish and dresses like her Mom. Bridge is not ideal, she is a woman on a fatter side, prone to fall a victim of all her weaknesses and her friends. The film manages to catch this. Renee Zellweger is a great choice for the main part, albeit being a Texan, she overcame the initial difficulties and here she is a real Londoner, with an unmistakable British accent, British ideas and customs. The other great winner is Colin Firth who depicted Mr. Darcy with his cool, reserved, down to earth manner. Colin is hilariously reserved and his near smiles are unforgettable. Hugh Grant is yet another perfect choice for the part of Daniel Cleever, a classic cad, sweet and deadly nice outside and terribly rotten inside. Typical cynical British humor shines and sparkles like a tinsel all the way through; unbelievably hilarious situations which Bridget finds herself in make you laugh all 90 minutes of this light, tight, bright and delightful comedy. What made me feel a bit repulsive was a continuous talk about sex, sex, sex. When the topic was repeatedly returned to even by Bridge's Mom, I was nearly shocked. Then, maybe this is a huge cultural gap, but the sheer impudence of some talks also nearly killed me. In my country, Russia, to tell a woman in her face that she is getting old and she absolutely must get a man is a unimaginable rudeness. Here, it is shown as if it is natural and no one seems to correct themselves after such a shocking case of rude behavior. Sometimes, the film gets pathetic, though, especially when it does show the way too prolonged scene of fistfight between Darcy and Cleever. After all, the film doesn't make you think too hard. Well, we all are created imperfect, we smoke, drink, and say foul words, have premarital sex, tell lies, cheat, et cetera. This has to be fought, not somehow celebrated. But it is good to be made fun of. In which, the film got very well."

","How would Bridget Jones write this in her diary about her life? This film is a cute, comedic unrealistic commentary on women in their thirties like Bridget Jones played beautifully by Texas American Renee Zellwegger. A role that could have been done by any British actress striving for her big break has been done by one of Hollywood's brightest rising stars. Renee can sure play British and she also plays Beatrix Potter. THe casting choice of her to play this very British role might be shocking but she manages to do this role without being Meryl Streep and being more a talent to watch out for. Bridget's parents are played by the underrated Gemma JOnes and Oscar Winner Jim Broadbent. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant play the men who seek to win Bridget's heart. Firth plays Darcy here and in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice television mini-series and Hugh Grant is famous for playing the lovable loser at love. The film was filmed mostly in London and England. Although you can't stand in any airport for JFK in New York City. Any way, the film is a lot of fun to watch and should be shown over the Christmas holiday season."

","""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a successful romantic comedy inspired by the classic novel 'Pride and Prejudice'.It uses the plot thread of the humourless and non-communicative Mark Darcy against the seemingly charming Daniel Cleaver. To make a film about someone's unspoken thoughts is no easy task.It works very well in one scene in 'Annie Hall' where the actors thoughts appear as subtitles -- but a whole movie!That said,""Bridget Jones's Diary"" works very well indeed due to the fact of Renee Zellwegger's powerfully comic performance.She has really done her homework - acquiring physical weight, comic timing and the accent.The speeches she delivers at the Book presentation and Darcy's 'engagement' are very funny and are comic highlights of the film.There are physical gags to and climactic confrontation between Darcy and Cleaver. Richard Curtis and Andrew Davies's screenplay strongly supplies many a comic incident.Hugh Grant is surprisingly effective as the comical scoundrel Daniel and Colin Firth counters this by being a twentieth century Darcy (witty casting coup in the fact that he had already played Darcy in 'Pride and Prejudice for the B.B.C).The supporting cast are strong though slightly wasted.James Callis as Tom sparkles as Bridget's confidant -- the has been pop star. Shirley Henderson and Sally Phillips as Jude and Shas respectively are warmly supportive buddies.Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as Bridget's parents give likable performances as their marital problems come to the fore .Paul Brooke is comically lecherous as 'tits'Fitzherbert, Donald Douglas and Charmian May are effective as Mark's parents.Sharon Maguire's direction is inventive and keeps the film moving at brisk pace."

","I really didn't know what to expect when I tuned into Bridget Jone's Diary on ABC Family.<br/><br/>Though when I saw the very first scene, which features Bridget lip-synching hilariously to a depressing love song whilst watching an equally depressing movie on her television, I figured that it couldn't be that bad.<br/><br/>I was right.<br/><br/>Of course, for this to be a really good review, I would have to address the things I learned about the movie after watching it. I learned that some see in it a totally adorable woman they can relate to, and others see sexist trash.<br/><br/>To say that Bridget isn't a terribly desperate single gal would be a total understatement. As a result, I must warn those of you females who feel that the portrayal of any such female- who, I MUST remind you still actually exist- is a jab at your independent womanhood, to stay out of this one.<br/><br/>Although the plot in this movie can sometimes be a little predictable, Bridget is not. You never really know what is going to come out of the woman's mouth at any time- and neither does she, which adds to the entertainment.<br/><br/>Additionally, the story is not entirely about Bridget Jones. A decidedly tongue-in-cheek side story involving her dysfunctional parents is present as well.<br/><br/>I loved the performance of the actors in this movie. First of all, Renee Zellweger, of course, and second of all Hugh Grant, as he seemed perfect for the charming-yet-decidedly-perverse Daniel Cleaver.<br/><br/>I certainly think that this movie is worth giving a chance to."

","BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY, in my opinion, is an absolutely charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good. If you ask me, Mark (Colin Firth) was more suited to be Bridget's (Renée Zellweger) prince than Daniel (Hugh Grant) was. I said that because Mark was more of a gentleman that Daniel was. Anytime Mark and Bridget kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. In addition to that, I went, ""Aw!"" Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this absolutely charming romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to any Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, or Hugh Grant fan who hasn't seen it.

","What is it that makes Bridget Jones's Diary such an addictive film? Perhaps it's the great combination of wit, reflection, self-analysis, drama, romance and sheer hilarious situations. This is the story of Bridget, a very real British woman with many issues, mainly weight and romance related. Greatly portrayed by Renee Zellweger, Bridget is both witty and interesting, making for a purely enjoyable film. I first watched this film when it was released in 2001. I enjoyed it thoroughly. Three years later, I gave it my second viewing, and since then, I must have watched it over 100 times. I honestly can say that this is the ONLY film I can watch everyday if given the opportunity. Although not the best film, and perhaps without much depth (not to say none), Bridget Jones's diary is somehow addictive and absolutely enjoyable. Definitely set to be a classic, this is a film that all people should view at least once, not because it's philosophical or because it makes stunning comments on society, but because it is simply fantastically entertaining."

","Bridget Jones' Diary is a romantic escape into the life of an imperfect singleton and the little events and habits in her life that we find amusing -- probably in part because we are each a little bit like Bridget and want to be accepted and loved. Who hasn't been embarrassed by their parents, unintentionally made a fool of oneself at a social gathering, wore the wrong clothing (or costume) to a party, dated the wrong person, or messed up at an interview? Bridget Jones' Diary is lovable and funny because it is believable and deals with these every-day events, though usually with a cruel or embarrassing twist at the expense of poor Bridget.<br/><br/>Overall, Bridget Jones' Diary is an excellent example of a romantic comedy, and its popularity is gained through lovable and quirky characters that are easily sympathized with. Although the same lovable characters appear in the sequel, the humor is not nearly as imaginative and not focused around the everyday little events. Watch Bridget Jones' Diary is you're looking for a light and funny film. Don't bother with the sequel unless you're a major fan of the genre."

Her Bridget is also vivid. she did a great job.no doubt she got the Oscar.<br/><br/>It is really unexpected to know Hugh Grant plays Daniel.In my mind,Hugh Grant usually plays those romantic good man,like Charlez in ""4 weddings and 1 funeral"" and the guy in ""Notting Hill""(sorry, forgot the name). It was really hard for me to re-build an image for him when the film goes on, but he did a good job.<br/><br/>As to Colin Firth,I knew nothing about him before this film. But he is exactly the right person for Mr.Darcy who is deeply hurt by his previous love. Besides,his appearance reminds me of the original Darcy in ""Pride and Prejudice"".A good match I believe.(Colin's role in ""Love Actually"" is also this kind.)<br/><br/>I have seen this film several times and enjoy it every time.I recommend it without any reservation."

","I'd fully decided I was not going to like this movie. However, the bottom line for me is not the Brazil-sized appendage which we see sliding down the pole at the Lewisham Fire Station, but the Brazil-sized personality which shines out right from the start, and which, for me at any rate, is completely charming and endearing. Warm, happy, adventurous, amusing, unpretentious  her face (especially the mouth) expresses it brilliantly. No, she isn't quite believable as a hard-nosed reporter  certainly not as a literary publisher. She quite plainly enjoys the company of nasty (but witty) Cleaver far more than that of the dreary, stuffed-shirt, cucumber-up-appendage, Darcy. This is because the former is much better suited to her fun-loving personality  he just needs his priorities rearranged (some might say, given a sound kicking). ***possible spoiler*** This is what happens when we tie ourselves to a story, which, though it may be satirical, has strong moral undertones  it doesn't all quite fit. Luckily, however, the personality wins in the end. People like Bridget really do make this world a better place and Zellweger portrays her perfectly."

","I adore Jane Austen. The woman could have been a Behaviorist, so far was she ahead of her time. Add to that her keen insight, sharp and witty tongue, and impeccable prose style, and we undoubtedly have one of the top 5 or so authors of the 19th century. While I agree that Bridget Jones's Diary could not possibly compete with Miss Austen, though based on themes and characters from several of her works, I have to say I found it extremely entertaining in it's own right.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger is a talented comic actress, and anyone who can play a difficult comedic role with such skill and finesse cannot possibly be as clumsy and inept a person as the character she is depicting, however limited she might appear to some. She made me laugh and call out to my roommate to ""Come and watch this girl; she's a scream!"", something I am not in the habit of doing on a regular basis.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant was equally funny, and a wonderful foil for Colin Firth's character. Bridget's family was hideously but hilariously portrayed. I am normally not an admirer of the getting-older-woman-looking-for-a-husband-before-it's-too-late genre of films, but this was really less tired and superficial than some of these have turned out in the past.

","If you're looking for deep meanings and world-shaking issues, don't look here. If, however, you are looking for a couple of hours of light entertainment, then this is the place to look. Ms. Zellwegger acquits herself well in this part of a young English woman who is on the brink of giving it all up, but decides to do a major make-over with the help of her diary. There is the philandering heel of a boss (Hugh Grant, in his signature role of the hesitant talker, with his er's and um's) and Colin Firth (a particular favorite of mine). If you don't think much of Firth as a screen personality, then you haven't seen the British Television long-form (6 hours) version of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". His portrayal of Mr. Darcy (the same name as his character in B.J.'s Diary) is as well rounded as one could hope for.

I loved this film when I waited anxiously outside Woolies, waiting for it to open so I could run in and be the first to buy it. And oh how I love Mark Darcy...<br/><br/> You probably already know the story - Bridget is a food adoring, chain smoking singleton who is desparate not to die alone and be eaten by alsatians but also is determined not to fall for the wrong guy - certainly no peeping toms, meglamaniacs, commitment phobics or emotional f**kwitts. So who does she fall for? Charming Daniel Cleaver - a bed-hopping rogue who just happens to be her boss. Very naughty Bridget! With the added pressure of trying to stop smoking, start dieting and basically becoming a better person, Bridget Jones is weaving a very tangled web, that is until the beautifully mysterious Mr Darcy enters into her life.....<br/><br/> To be honest I had my doubts about Renee Zellweger cast as much-loved Bridget - why couldn't they just pick a good old English actress, someone like Kate Winslet perhaps....? Well, thats what I thought before but after watching the film several thousand times now, I CANNOT imagine any other woman in the world playing her, Zellweger was fantastic - she managed to be hilarious, heart-warming and totally georgous all at the same time. I usually find that most American actors/actresses when portraying English characters usually opt for one of two extremes - alwful cockney accent similar to that of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins or completely OTT, Royal family type, well spoken accent similar to that of the Queen, Zellweger managed to get hers spot on without sounding completely ridiculous.<br/><br/> It was great to see Hugh Grant not be type-cast yet again as the mumbling, all round good guy with the giantic floppy fringe, he still had a bit of the fringe but managed to show us he can play the sexy, bad guy too.<br/><br/> And finally, I thought I'd save the best to last, Colin Firth. He was perfect as Mark Darcy, he didn't even have to open his mouth once and he still would've made the film - I know thats probably really shallow and girly-like of me but per-lease, the man looks good in a reindeer jumper for crying out loud. I'm not really a big romantic comedy type fan, but even I was yearning to be in Bridgets shoes in the very last 'coat' scene - for those women who have already seen it, you'll know what scene I'm talking about.....<br/><br/> To sum up, it's funny, heart-warming, very funny and more than just a stupid 'chick-flick' and if you're not going to see it for its suberb script, hilairious jokes, great acting and brilliant soundtrack. Then see it for the fireman pole scene.  10/10"

","There were times during this movie when I laughed out loud and couldn't wait to see more, other times when it put me out.  Ordinarily I don't complain about a film's content, but ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" does seem to have a lot of gratuitous bad language and some really crude dialogue that doesn't serve its story or quality.   I guess I *am* one of those people who gets tired of hearing f***ing-this, f***ing-that every few minutes, so if you're one of those people as well, you may have trouble really getting into this movie.  Still, the leading performances are excellent: Zellweger tackles the accent nicely (Definitely will have any American fooled, and we are pretty starry-eyed discerning when it comes to those English throats.) and Colin Firth is perfect as the sexy, straight man in the reindeer sweater opposite Grant as the slimy but oh-so-cute jerk.  Add to this the movie's ""novel"" approach to providing a glimpse into the world of your average man-troubled, work-a-day, hate-my-weight unmarried young lady, and the results are poignant but still sweet enough to evoke dreamy sighs from the female audience and appreciative chuckles from the males.   I wouldn't consider this a chick flick; more like an accurate Slice 'o Life from the girl's corner that is funny and multi-tiered enough to entertain anyone. Minus the vulgarity of her goofy friends, plus the cute subplot of her parents' marital woes, plus a splendid street brawl between the two roosters, and assorted jokes and wit throughout = a really fun evening alone for someone who can truly sympathize with poor Bridget.

","For the hundreds of reasons people have already mentioned, I love this film. It is, very simply, incredibly entertaining!  Now, come my (few) non-standard reasons for enjoying Bridget Jones.  First, it was directed by a woman.  Very, very few films are (pay attention sometime, it will really shock you!), and I appreciate so much seeing a female succeeding and promoting other females to succeed through her subject matter.  Next, the way Bridget looks at men.  Do you ever get tired (really, really tired) of watching the camera slowly slide up the backside of some starlet?  Was it not the most refreshing thing in the world when the camera slowly slid up Colin Firth's backside?  Did you not want to stand up and cheer?  I most certainly did!  Finally, this was a film that displayed joy.  So many movies are just so exhausted.  Even many comedies just walk along comely, doing their thing and hoping to sell more tickets - but this was a film with heart and soul and joy and humor.  I would even go so far as to (gasp!) say it improved upon the book.  This is one of my favorite comedies of all time, and every time I see it, I just get the happiest, silliest grin on my face.

","I checked out this movie with suspicious, squinted little snake eyes, intrigued by all the hype, but on the lookout for gushy sentiment and romantic drivel.  Boy, was I surprised.  <br/><br/>Bridget Jones is a 32-year-old, single, working woman, who has decided to trade some of her independence for a romantic relationship.  She's thinking marriage. Her difficulties arise from the fact that, while she's charming, attractive, spontaneous, trusting, and perfectly sincere, she's not terribly bright.  <br/><br/>As she enters this new stage of her life, she begins to journal about it. Ms. Jones narrates the film in the third person, as if audibly writing in her diary, a great way to get inside the personal struggles of the heroine.<br/><br/>
Basically, in the course of her personal quest for a relationship, she's confronted with a choice between `intensity' and `intimacy,' the one offering danger and excitement, the other safety and excitement.  They look alike, but they're not.  The first type of relationship is your typical `cosmic' romance, in which some poor dumb idiot is always looking for a `soul mate,' who is always disappointed that nobody is perfect enough.  This person is usually codependent.  The second type of relationship, while less dangerous (it's a peculiarity of the human psyche that people are more sexually attractive to us when we associate them with danger), offers warmth, acceptance, mutual individuation, and self-expression.  It's the joy of intimacy based upon clear-eyed acceptance of each other's strengths and faults.  <br/><br/>There's a great scene in the video, where Bridget throws a dinner party for her friends.  She's a horrible cook, and the meal is, by all accounts, hard to swallow.  In a jocular mood, her friends argue over which of several courses was the worst.  But it's not malicious.  It's the kind of jesting that is totally affirming, that fully accepts Ms. Jones in spite of, and maybe also because of, her shortcomings.  Now that's intimacy."

","After all the hype this movie received when it was released, I was almost expecting to find a comedic masterpiece that redefined the meaning of comedy. What I found instead was a mildly amusing and quite pleasant tale of a 30-something woman (Renee Zellweger) dealing with being single and in search of the right man. The stereotype bothered me a bit; this idea that Bridget just couldn't live a satisfied life unless and until she found her man. Zellweger was good in a performance that didn't really demand all that much in terms of acting ability - the idea that her performance would even be considered for an Oscar is something that I just don't understand. I'm not saying that she was bad; simply that the role didn't ask very much of her.<br/><br/>A strong supporting cast including Hugh Grant as Daniel and Colin Firth as Mark - Bridget's rival love interests - helped move the story along. How enjoyable this movie is depends on what you're looking for. If you believed the hype you're going to get less than you expect, but if you simply go in with an open mind you'll probably find this a decent enough movie. Overall I was a little disappointed, but would still rate this effort as a 6/10."

","To say that I was completely, well, delighted is probably the word I'm looking for, is a definite understatement. It's hard to believe that this film, with a cast of characters that use the word ""FUCK"" more frequently than any of the characters in Tarantino's films combined, be so romantically charming, but much like Bridget's weight, it oozes right out of its' seams. The charm, that is. I did not intend for that last remark to be offensive in any way, but it is a fact that Bridget (Renee Zellweger, whom I never really cared much about as an actress, but man was she great in this film!!) is overweight. What also is not meant to be taken to offense is the use of the ""F"" word in the film. These are everyday characters, having everyday conversations. I myself loved the dialogue, and with that the overall mood and tone of the film. This film allows you to unbutton your pants, and relax. Bridget makes you feel comfortable in your skin by allowing you to see her in just about every embarrassing situation possible...and there were plenty of those. From her being continently fixed up and dressed by her mother, to forgetting to change into her normal sized underwear before she got lucky(these being the most tame examples), Bridget takes it all in. I found myself laughing the whole time, but I realize that I was in fact laughing at myself. She is a character that in one way or another you sympathize with, because we all have had moments in our life that we were embarrassed about, but by seeing her we feel at ease. Now the performances... there is definitely some great acting in this film. It starts with Rene Zellweger's ""Raging Bull"" Bridget performance, and carries through with almost every character in this film. They are all acted the way acting should be, so that you can't tell they are acting!! I was definitely surprised at how great Rene played Bridget, the accent is right on, so much so that you leave thinking she is British and plays all her past roles faking the accents. Hugh Grant also gave a great performance, one that I was happy to see. In the role of Bridget's low-down-sex-crazed sleaze of a boss, he acts against type. We are used to the Hugh of films like Four Weddings and a Funeral, or Notting Hill(another film I loved), but in this film he sheds all that proves he's got something more to offer. You'll hate him and love him, something only the finest leading men can accomplish. I also must give a quick mention to Colin Firth, whose performance ties in neatly to the whole story, and does a great job being part of what could have become a messy love triangle story. I really would have given this film 4stars (and secretly I must admit, I love it beyond that), but it does rely on the romantic/comedy clichés in the end, or a spin on them at least. For example, the final chase scene for the one you love, how many times have we seen that? Don't get me wrong, I love that stuff. It's the best, and man it works in this film as much as it did in Notting Hill. I'll leave that 1/2 star out because in a way I wish it had found another way to work its self out. So if your girlfriend/friend/whatever wants to go see a movie tonight, make sure you skip the Freddy Prinze Jr. crap, and beg her to go see this. You'll both love it, and I expect all of you to thank me when you leave that theater with a smile on your face."

","Dissatisfied at age 32 with the direction her life is taking, a young woman vows to make some changes, and to keep herself on track she decides to start a daily journal, hoping it will make her toe the line, in `Bridget Jones's Diary,' directed by Sharon Maguire and starring Renee Zellweger.  Bridget (Zellweger) begins with some New Year's resolutions that include no more drinking or smoking, not being paranoid about her weight, and developing poise.  And-- last, but not least-- to avoid any romantic attachments to alcoholics, workaholics, peeping Toms or perverts.  Of course she promptly falls for the one man she knows who embodies all of those characteristics: Her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).  In the meantime, her mother, Pam (Gemma Jones), continues to play matchmaker for her daughter.  At a holiday gathering of friends and family, Pam nudges her in the direction of an old childhood chum, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), now a respectable attorney, and recently divorced.  Their initial meeting, however, proves to be a less than monumental event, further complicated by the fact that Cleaver was Darcy's Best Man at his wedding, and has some tales-out-of-school to tell about the subsequently ill fated marriage that puts Darcy in a rather bad light.  But Bridget could care less; she thinks Darcy is rude and a bore, and anyway, Daniel is her guy.  Work is good, her life is going well and-- as she is about to wake up and realize-- she hasn't kept a single one of her resolutions.  And, oh! she should have.<br/><br/>	First time director Maguire proves with this auspicious debut that she certainly knows her territory and how to negotiate it.  She has the touch and the eye for detail of a seasoned professional, and her sense of timing is impeccable.  She successfully avoids a major pitfall that do in many rookie directors right out of the chute, by never fishing for the cheap, forced, disdainfully pretentious or concocted laugh.  Everything in this film, especially the humor, flows freely and naturally from the circumstances of the characters and the story, which makes it all real and believable and allows it to be readily embraced by the audience.  This is a funny, often hilarious movie, but it's also very warm and at times poignant, and for handling it so sensibly, and with such sensitivity, Maguire deserves to be granted even more kudos.  It's quite simply an exceptionally well made film, presented with a style and grace that reflects that of the director herself.<br/><br/>	Of course, having a superlative leading lady was certainly not disadvantageous to Maguire's efforts, either, and Renee Zellweger has never been better than she is here as Bridget.  With her quirky good looks, personality and charisma, she is endearing, and she invades Meryl Streep territory by affecting a perfect British accent.  Whether she's lip-syncing to a Celine Dion song, doing karaoke at an office party after having a bit too much to drink, or battling with a blender, it's easy to believe that someone would like her just the way she is.  Even with her hair mussed, or in a somewhat disheveled state, she's alluring, and it all has to do with who she is deep down inside; Zellweger makes it clear that this is a woman of substance, and it's easy to like her.  There's a down-to-earth honesty and accessibility about her that makes her appealing, and she's someone to whom many in the audience are easily going to be able to relate.  For her portrayal of Betty in `Nurse Betty,' Zellweger received a Golden Globe; `Bridget' should land her smack in the middle of Oscar territory.<br/><br/>	As Bridget's smarmy boss, Daniel, Hugh Grant turns in a noteworthy performance, putting a rather tarnished sheen on his natural charm that works so well for this character.  It's a nice departure from his usual bumbling, reserved Mr. Nice Guy routine he perfected in such films as `Notting Hill,' and `Four Weddings and A Funeral.'  With this role he challenges Greg Kinnear's part in `Someone Like You' for the top spot in the Boss-You-Should-Never-Date category.  And Firth does a memorable turn as Darcy, fairly reprising his role of the same name in the PBS miniseries, `Pride and Prejudice,' from which this story is loosely derived.  Initially appearing a bit sullen, he gets the chance to develop his character as the story unfolds, and he does it quite nicely, ultimately revealing Darcy's true nature.<br/><br/>	In a supporting role, Gemma Jones gives a performance that deserves mention, doing a good job of fleshing out Bridget's mother in the brief time she is allotted.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Crispin Bonham-Carter (Greg), Jim Broadbent (Colin Jones), James Callis (Tom), Sally Phillips (Shazzer), Honor Blackman (Penny), Embeth Davidtz (Natasha), Shirley Henderson (Jude) and Celia Imrie (Una).  A warmly humorous, uplifting film, `Bridget Jones's Diary' is a delightful and satisfying experience with more than a touch of magic in it.  Not only is it an entertaining showcase for Zellweger's many talents, but heralds the arrival of a director from whom we can expect great things in the future, Sharon Maguire.  A well crafted, reality based comedy/drama that is enjoyable and refreshingly devoid of inane nonsense or gross jokes is a rare find these days, and this is one of the best to hit the screen in a long, long time.  It's a film to be heartily embraced, and one I guarantee you'll want to see more than once.  I rate this one 10/10."
"vsphil007a","Null","1","1","15 April 2001"," This ""Diary"" is Worth a Look See
","There is something about England-based romantic comedies that have a sense of neverending charm and sophistication to them. Their stars tend to be nothing less than perfect and their words are those we wish we could say. The creators of `Bridget Jones' Diary' have filled their film with the above criteria, taking a `Notting Hill' esque approach to singles and dating in the 21st Century.<br/><br/>
The Plot: Renee Zellweger plays Bridget, a publisher's assistant who arrives at her 32nd birthday determined to reel in her life, which has spiraled into excessive drinking, smoking, eating, and dating the wrong kinds of men with the best of intentions. A running gag in the film begins as she monitors her daily intake of vodka, menthols, and crumpets. Her self induced makeover hits a bump when her mother introduces her to your typical stiff-assed, handsome Brit and divorcee, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).<br/><br/>Darcy's rude comments about Bridget at a Christmas party prompt our heroine to pursue her boss, Daniel (a rascally cad portrayed by Hugh Grant). Daniel ends up having a tryst with a Yankee Bridget describes as `an American stick insect,' thus ruining their relationship and forcing Bridget to re-examine her love life while facing her `mum's' mid-life crisis.<br/><br/>
The Good: `Diary' has too much going for it to fit in this section. The dialogue comes at a quick pace, sharply delivered and always funny. Zellweger goes back to `Jerry MaGuire' territory, gaining 20 pounds and constantly reminding us how perfectly cast and effortlessly adorable she is in the sappy Snow White-like role of Bridget. Grant shows a nasty side that makes us snicker and Firth is a revelation. Scenes of note are the `Prostitutes and Priests' costume party, any scene with Grant and Zellweger, and the finale's birthday dinner scene.<br/><br/>
The Bad:  Why must all Hugh Grant comedies end with a pointless car chase, whose aim is to get to one's love before they go away?  This tacky scene, and the oddly placed and flow of a street brawl between Daniel and Collin, are too American for this import.  They distract, rather than entertain. But a movie this close to perfection has to have some spoils here and there.<br/><br/>Some pages can be skipped and it can use touches of WhiteOut, but overall, this `Diary' is worth a look see."
"Kurzbein","Null","1","1","16 April 2001"," I haven't read the books, but...
","I think this movie could have been better.  While I loved Grant's portrayal of Daniel as well as Firth's perfectly understated portrayal of Mark Darcy, I couldn't help but think that Zellweger wasn't the best choice for Bridget. Weight gain or not, she's hardly the average-looking woman that I assume Bridget is in the books.  The idea that someone this cute would have trouble meeting a companion wasn't particularly convincing.<br/><br/>On top of that, Zellweger's Bridget seemed downright happy-go-lucky, not weighed down by her situation.  There was very little bitterness, if any, on display, and Zellweger didn't communicate the kind of desperation you'd expect from this person.  While she spoke/wrote of eating and drinking too much, these were usually presented comically and had no dramatic weight. There are real people in the same sorts of predicaments who pacify their disappointment in drink and food, and it's rarely cute or comical.  The movie would have benefited greatly from a truer representation of Bridget's disappointment, making the ending that much more satisfying."
"popes002","10","1","1","12 March 2002"," I liked Bridget Jones: she is different
","This  movie is extremely pleasant, funny and endearing.  It is also a relief to break from the typical perfectly successful, thin, invariably rich blonde that one finds in the American movies from the same class with Bridget Jones (such as ""When Harry met Sally"", ""Sleepless is Seattle"", ""You've got mail"" etc.  Love Meg Ryan, but sorry! have to be honest.) Bridget is different especially through her ability to think about what she is and what others are.  And, as some of us know, when one has a world inside one's head, sometimes one goofs with the world outside!  The script could have been better, sometimes things go too fast, I think.  But it follows the book and it doesn't disappoint. Renee Zellweger delivers a performance decidedly worthed an Oscar, she has the talent of a great comedienne.  Colin Firth is wonderful (as Mark Darcy), he can do a heartbroken, handsome, rich divorce like no other (hopefully he can do more than that!).  I love Colin Firth in all his movies that I have seen; unfortunately, his presence in this one gives the movie an air of unrealism, because the guy is too handsome not to be snotty and vain.  But because he is so unbelievably good natured, he makes us dream that he could be a real man.  Hugh Grant succeeds in being annoying, which is the purpose of his character (Daniel Cleaver). One should not accuse the movie or the character Bridget Jones for lack of philosophic depth, for imperfection, pretentiousness, or anything alike, because this movie is not trying to show how we should be, but is just telling a story of how some of us are.  The story is beautiful, the characters are well contoured and there is enough romanticism (see unrealism!) to make one dream and want to see the movie again, or read the books again. Another excellent point for the movie is that it is definitely not targeted to the half-brained sex-obsessed American teenage generation."

","To begin with,I have not yet read the book that this film was based on so my opinions are based only on the film itself.On the plus side I found the film to be quite well cast. Renee Zellweger is outstanding as Bridget. She perfect adapts a British dialouge and fall so deeply into the role that You forget she is an american.She is perky,caustic,cynical and quite fetching.<br/><br/> Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are priceless as the objects of her affections. Grant finally gets another chance to stretch his acting muscles as a vapid womanize who prove quite unloveable...and Firth finally gets another big screen role to equal ""Valmont"" or his stage performaces.He develops his character slowly and deeply throughout the film. Special attention must be given to the wonderful Jim Broadbent as Bridget's Dad.Although not on screen for any length of time,It is another well drawn character in his ever growing list of great portrayals. On the down side I can only state the under developed nature of some of the supporting roles,I would have liked to see more of Bridget's friends,Mother and family."

","Ok. I will be the first person to admit that I really didn't expect much from this film. In Fact, I did all what I could to get out of seeing it.(Faking colds,financially challenged,I have an impending surgery..etc.) But I must thank my wife for her tenaciousness and curse the creators of the video tapes..With a big all encompassing grin on her face and video in hand, I knew the jig was up,as it were..... Well,from the beginning,this wonderfully enchanting film had me. Renee Zellweger's Bridget is a happy go lucky single woman in her early thrities who is in search of true love(hoping to avoid all the ""commitment phobic"" blokes that she often falls for)and a slimmer waist line. I immediately fell in love with Renee's almost flawless performance in this picture. She,at least to me,took control of this character and breathed life into it. She made me care for Bridget as if she was one of my own friends,who was going through life's ups and constant downs. This is an oscar worthy performance by Zellweger.It seemed like it was tailor made for her. Written by Helen Fielding,Andrew Davies,and Richard Curtis(who wrote some stuff for Mr.Bean as well as the movie)this movie takes through the times and trials of Bridget Jones.All involved in this picture did a splendid job. Colin Firth, who sometimes plays a bit of jerk in films,does a great job playing the rather stiff but honorable,Mark Darcy...The movie,at first,makes him out to be rather a snotty sonofagun,but as it progresses,we see that's not the case. Hugh Grant,plays Bridget's wolf in sheep's clothing,boss,Daniel Cleaver. He is very effective as this womanizer that gets his claws into our dear Bridget,but fear not....all turns out well in the end. This movie was a real unexpected gem. It's not just a ""chick flick"".It's about accepting yourself and others.About making changes in your life,for yourself,and not for anyone else.Having good friends who love you,just as you are. It's a great film.Don't pass it up."

","I have read Bridget Jones's Diary 100 times.  It will always be a book close to my heart, because its' tone is so sincere, and its' plot hits so close to home.  I was overjoyed when I heard there would be a movie, but I was really peeved when I heard Renée Zellweger (a TEXAN !) would play Bridget (a boozing chain smoker from London).  However, after seeing the movie, I've changed my mind.<br/><br/>Zellweger does an excellent job playing a part I hardly expected her to live up to.  Bridget, at times, is a total dork.  Inside she's got all the self-help book lingo down, she knows what men want, what makes them tick, she's read all the books...but when she opens her mouth...UGH.  As Mark Darcy calls it, her ""verbal incontinence"" is heartening.  She's me...she's YOU !  When you try to act all cool and then make a total fool of yourself in front of the coolest guy you know, well that's Bridget in a nutshell.<br/><br/>
She is a 32 year old ""singleton"" in a city full of ""smug marrieds,"" all trying to set her up with a succession of the worst sorts of men.  She makes a list of New Year's resolutions (dozens of them, including: quit smoking, drink less, don't date men that suck, etc.), and has broken half in the first day and all of them within the first month.  By the end of the movie, she has managed to only keep one of resolutions, poor girl !<br/><br/>People of both sexes and all walks of life will appreciate Bridget's plight, and sympathize.  So go see it, rent it, buy it...just WATCH IT !  You'll love it !"

The characters, the humor, the comedy of the situations that charmed us all in the book are all present. And, although I must admit after being dragged to it for the third time I was a wee bit sick of it, still, it brought much enjoyment and pleasure. What a nice change Bridget is from the ever present popsy pretty Barbie dolls that America always has to stick into their romantic comedies. How wonderful to hear for once some snappy conversations rather then the ever flat usual burble. And finally, how nice to see real characters and people rather then washed out dolls ( I know I mentioned that before. but it's worth mentioning again). All in all, a true romantic comedy worth watching, and in very close spirit to the book."
"hprill","9","1","1","30 July 2001"," Between oddball and screwball: near-perfect comedy
","Romantic comedies seem to have a hard time in reviews, they don't seem to get the truly high ratings other types of movies get. Perhaps this is because they are slightly predictable and generally wearing a bit thin.<br/><br/>Not so this one. Helen Fielding, who wrote the bestselling novel 'Bridget Jones's Diary' also co-wrote the screenplay and co-produced this film, which was probably a good thing. Instead of standardized, stereotyped U.S. romantic comedy stuff, we get some truly wacky British humour, somewhere between oddball and screwball, but never in bad taste (the elk sweater early on is as bad as it gets ;-) ).<br/><br/>Considering the number of copies Fielding's book has sold, the plot probably needs little comment. Bridget Jones, age 32, tries to find a man for fear that she may die a spinster and be eaten by alsatians.<br/><br/>Great acting from Renée Zellweger, who manages to portray Bridget as clumsy, chaotic, but also as very likeable and believable. Despite the fact that there were many traps for overacting, she managed brilliantly to come across as a person rather than a caricature. Kudos.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant was finally cast in the perfect role. This is so much better than the type of character he usually plays. I don't think he's a great actor or particularly good in this film, but this role was just so perfect.<br/><br/>Colin Firth as the other possible love interest seemed very distanced and strangely cold -- that's okay considering his role, but I felt he should have thawed a bit more towards the end.<br/><br/>Of the remaining cast, Jim Broadbent stood out in a brief, yet remarkable performance as Bridget's father.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the better comedies this year. Usually I'd give it an 8, but this has a serious acting bonus for a great ensemble who seemed to have enjoyed themselves, so I'll give it a 9."

It's not bad, but the self-satisfied performances and embarrassing escapades make you want to leave the cinema rather than egg Bridget on for all her social faux pas.<br/><br/>Despite Zellwegger's Texan origins (Her accent is pretty good, and, despite the bitching she did about it, she looks a lot sexier at ten stone) you can practically taste the phrase ""darrrrrrrrling, you were wonderful"" all the way through this one. All the prerequisite Richard Curtis elements are there: the wacky friend with the squeaky voice, the token promiscuous homosexual and the posh friend that says ""f***"" a lot. I don't know who it was that decided posh people swearing was funny, but whoever it was they should stop it.<br/><br/>Being in the company of such people for 100 minutes is acceptable, but would you really want to know any of them in real life?

"celerityuk","Null","1","1","4 May 2001"," Very very funny
","Lighten up, people! I'm very surprised that this movie has got so many negative reactions. It's not meant to be a piece of feminist doctrine, or a heavyweight meditation on the nature of womanhood. It is a romantic comedy. As such I don't think it has an obligation to be either utterly realistic or deeply meaningful. I think it is what it tries to be: a very very funny movie with a heart. And no, it never snows in London at Christmas. But frankly, it looks better that way and it doesn't really matter. ;) *spoiler*And I have to say, I just don't understand the people who would rather Bridget stayed with the slimy, floppy-haired bounder whose idea of a crawling-back line is If I can't make it with you I can't make it with anyone' rather than the gorgeous, understated, quietly caring nice guy who also has a few life issues that he needs help with (see reindeer jumper and penguin (?) tie). Anyway, what is especially good about this movie is the wonderful script. There were few moments where I was not laughing out loud or rolling on the floor. Worth special mention is the fight scene, which is so gloriously haphazard, unchoreographed and generally hilarious that it is almost impossible to watch without bursting a major artery. Apart from set pieces like this, the one-liners come thick and fast and after seeing the film once you immediately want to watch it again, afraid you've missed some good lines. The actors have all proven themselves to be very able in other productions, and here they all get to exercise their comic timing  very successfully. Renée Zellweger makes a wonderful Bridget  I'm just sorry that the hype about her accent (almost flawless) and weight gain (not as noticeable as you would think) has distracted attention from her endearing and very funny performance. Hugh Grant was magnificently smarmy and insincere as Daniel  it was nice to see him in a role where he didn't have to stutter and hide under his hair. A cheeky, if fairly contrived, piece of casting was the role of Mark haven't-we-seen-you-somewhere-before' Darcy, taken by Colin Firth, who, as many have already said, even makes a reindeer jumper look good (and seems to enjoy sending up his wonderful performance as Fitzwilliam D. in the excellent '95 adaptation of Pride & Prejudice). I'm just sorry that we didn't get any naked/wet Darcy scenes, unlike in P & P where we got, respectively, 1 and 3. They could at least have done a spoof of the lake scene While on the subject, you will probably enjoy this movie marginally more if you have read P & P or seen the aforementioned adaptation, because as well as the fact that much of the plot and many of the characters are taken from that book, there are also a few sly little in-jokes: Pemberley Publishing Co., Darcy's P&P-esque comment that he has been labouring under a misapprehension', and Bridget's It is a truth universally acknowledged, that the moment one area of your life starts going OK, another will turn into total disaster...' Summing up  great movie. See it now."

","I went to see this film with the sister of my old girlfriend yesterday, and from the cues of people who were waiting round the block to see it, I knew I was not going to be disappointed.<br/><br/>I, like most of the entire cinema-going population of Britain, were apprehensive at the thought of an American playing a character that would be deemed to be quintessentially British, but I need not have no fear, Renee Zewellgger as Bridget perfectly captured the neuroses and worries of modern-day life, making them all the more pointedly because we were shaking our heads off in fits of laughter that threatened to demolish the whole cinema.<br/><br/>I, (who could be described as a thirty-something male singleton), could relate to Renee as Bridget, a person constantly on a state of alert about her job, her weight (Memo to Cosmo - Stick-Insect Women are not sexy, they look ridiculous), and about whether they will ever meet a soulmate for their life (Memo to Feminist Reviewers of this film - this does not portray women as gooey morons, just real people). Hugh Grant to me encapsulated perfectly the arrogant so-and-so who women will always go for and ultimately be broken hearted over to a T.  But Hugh Grant as the mean and moody Mr Darcy, (now there's a coincidence!), to me shows that just perhaps just being there for someone shows their true worth.<br/><br/>Bridget is not a pushover, her treatment of Mark as she revenges his treachery is an outstanding hoot, and she will not be deflected from her life, at the risk of losing the one person who would be best for her life, (apart from her dad, brillantly and poignantly portrayed by Jim Broadbent.)<br/><br/>The snow at Christmas time in London and at Bridget's parents may seem to be contrived, but I've experienced White Christmases before and it only enhances a film in which you cheer for the happy ending yet hope she will not lose one iota of her dignity.<br/><br/>99 out of a 100. for you losers who don't like it, get yourself a reality check and a life!"

","I've read the book more than once, and was a little leery of the film, but those fears were completely unfounded.  This movie was truly one of the funniest I've seen in a long time.<br/><br/>I know that some feminists don't like this character, but they just don't seem to get it. I am a woman of a certain age and, while I can't say I know anyone who is exactly like Bridget, I can say that every woman I know has some elements of Bridget in her.  Whether or not the anti-Bridget factions like to admit it, women have always obsessed about their weight, or about men, or about their parents, or whatever.  What the people who snub their noses at this book/movie fail to see is that Mark Darcy has his own neuroses.  This is a man whose mother who shows a dubious taste in Christmas gifts (but he loves her enough to wear them in public), a man whose wife had an affair with his best friend (but is too much of a gentleman to discuss it), a man who wants to have fun but who isn't really sure just how.  Hence his attraction to Bridget.  But since the story is told from Bridget's point of view, we dwell on her problems, not Mark's.  Bridget is Everywoman, and Renee Zellwegger turns in a stellar performance in this role.<br/><br/>Colin Firth, who was a fine Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 1995 version of Pride & Prejudice, is, in my humble opinion, even better as Mark Darcy in this modern twist on the Austen novel.  Hugh Grant should stick with playing cads and forget about the stammering leading man he has played once too often. He is wonderful as the Wickham-like character who has no scruples about taking what he wants, regardless of the consequences.<br/><br/>Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent are terrific as Brigdet's parents.  Jones is delightful as the ditzy mother who goes off to ""find herself,"" only to discover that her real happiness lies at home.  I would have liked to have seen more of Broadbent, but it was not to be, unfortunately.<br/><br/>From what I gather, the closing credits seen in Europe are different from those seen in North America.  While Europeans get to see interviews with Bridget's family and friends, we North Americans get to see home movies of Mark's 8th birthday party. Not surprisingly, Bridget is the life of the party; she stuffs cake into her mouth and strips down before jumping into the paddling pool while Mark sits quietly and watches.  I can only hope the DVD has both endings. <br/><br/>I've seen the film twice, and I have to say I managed to laugh even harder the second time.  My advice to the naysayers?  Lighten up.  This movie is FUN."

I reckon it was meant to target the dull spinster audience in order to cheer them up and inflict the idea that there is a chance for them all. Well, this is not something bad as long as one could imagine something like that happen in real life. But to go so far as to believe that two handsome and accomplished young men could fall for this Bridget is highly improbable. I'll just be blunt: Bridget is silly, dull, ugly and a bit too old for the part. But don't get me wrong; this is not exactly that which disturbs me most but the fact that she doesn't do anything to enhance her personality and physical aspect.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that the axiom inflicted by this movie- take me or leave me; I am the way I am and I won't change- is not a healthy guiding line in anyone's life.

"tedg","Null","3","6","13 May 2001"," The Anti-Austen
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>No author has been more pillaged for film than Jane Austen. Her books have been the source of `straight' adaptations, teen movies, and the recent `Mansfield Park.' In that last film, we had the modern notion of a film about Jane the writer conflated with the story she is writing.<br/><br/>Here, the adapter of `Pride and Prejudice' and `Emma' takes things to the next level, creating a P&P that features an antihero. For those not familiar with Austen, her novels are marvelously written, concerning `manners and morals.' Her method is to cast a few honorable people at the mercy of frivolous conventions. The charm of these books is how the frivolity of the times is embodied in some absolutely ridiculous secondary characters. The personal politics of the time are clarified and amplified through this device.<br/><br/>So here we have the next step. We have a writer and the story she writes, just as in `Park,' but here the heroine is one of the ridiculous, formerly incidental characters. Bridget is a genuinely trivial person -- stupid, unattractive, without any of the qualities that would elevate her into Austen's world of the heroine.<br/><br/>The story slogs through so many references from P&P: the overheard criticisms at the party; the `in spite of my better judgement I like you' speech, the false accusations against Darcy; the character Darcy himself played by the very actor from P&P; the `it is a truth universally acknowledged that..' line; the actor who played Bigley in P&P does a walkon here. Natalie here is much the same role Embeth played in `Park.'<br/><br/>What we have here, disguised as a `Notting Hill' for women, is a truly adventuresome idea: Austin from the perspective of one of the dummies. A sort of `Guildenstern.' I can see how this could have worked, if the ridiculous social conventions were actually ridiculed. As it turns out we are asked to buy every one of them: and Bridget gets her man not because she is internally noble, but quite the opposite: he loves her because she is inarticulate, stupid, fat, pliable and trivial. In the process -- since we identify with Renee -- we willingly blend into the broken society.<br/><br/>I suppose this is the `identify with the underdog' strategy in mass marketing. Obviously it works as the film is a hit. And because it was cheap to make, will be immensely profitable. I just wish they hadn't spit on Ms Austen in the process: there is something noble about her women, something which contributed significantly to our modern notions of romance. This is an anti-romance.<br/><br/>Renee was multidimensional in `Nurse Betty,' or I thought so. Here (and in `Irene') she shows me I was mistaken. Her acting is wholly in her face, and shallow at that. She could have played Jane playing Bridget, or at least a better actress could have."

","I saw this movie in 2002. I was, I remember, in a rather low phase those days. I'd actually gone for another movie but ended up buying tickets to this as the one I went for had a full house.Boy! I guess my stars led me to it! I left the hall fully entertained, satisfied and strangely with full of hope and a new vigor! The movie cheered me up and made me forget my sadness. I simply felt lighter and happier. And, although little over carried away as I might seem, this simple pleasure the movie brought me and the positiveness I felt is certainly worth sharing.<br/><br/>Rene is truly truly fantastic! what an achievement for her! she totally deserves her best actress nomination and should have won it too! see the work! What an acting! A girl from the glamour world that she is and doing that and with such real effects that we can't help it but be totally CHARMED by her despite the character's many faults. Absolutely lovely and heights of romance! Back then, I did not know Colin Firth and had not yet seen him in Pride and Prejudice (Classis! Classic! Classis!). The man blew me away! I fell in love with him and set out on a rampage to find all his works! He's a perfect dream man. And Hugh Grant just sizzles the screen with his perpetual mega play boy good looks. He played his role wonderfully and was really really funny. His attitute and mannerism towards his treatment of Mr.Darcy is a roar. Darcy, so uptight and he, so loose and free - each thinking himself more up than the other. He entertained me the most! all three of them are marvelous in the movie! <br/><br/>The story is fascinating! Unconditional love. two pole ends meeting and finding they suit each other. To have someone love you just the way you are even if you are a little pathetic..etc..etc. Go see the movie & enjoy. Think happy thoughts and escape to fantasy land. The ones who are unsatisfied with the movie should try it out again just for the mind's sake.<br/><br/>I rate this 10 out of 10 for pure entertainment."

","It is clear from reading a lot of reviews from this site that there are many who sincerely believe that ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is a story of real English people and that the whole country is populated by extremely irritating types who all work in ""The Media"" and live smug,self - satisfied lives and have big houses in the country where they turn up en famille every Christmas rather like children on holiday from the public school they all undoubtedly attended.They are all terribly,terribly well - spoken and most certainly don't buy their clothes from Matalan. They all met up at ""University"",Cambridge,generally,rather than Middlesex or Manchester and live in an almost incestuous round of dinner parties and soirees.Mr Cleaver and Mr Darcy - rivals for Miss Jones's hand in the movie - met at Cambridge.What a surprise.We are not told much of Miss Jones's background but she is most definitely not a working - class English girl as fondly imagined.Miss Zellwegger is spared the need to ""do"" Estuary English and settles for a sweet""Well- educated"" accent although it is not clear how well - educated Miss Jones has actually been.Well enough presumably to have heard of F.R. Leavis but not well enough to have known he has been dead rather a long time, much to her better educated Cambridge boss's amusement.The England portrayed in this movie sets a lot of store by one - upmanship like that where the intellectually and socially superior can feel comfortable in their superiority,and say what you like about Mr Grant - and I am by no means an admirer - he is very comfortable in the sort of role where he can patronise those less fortunate. To him Miss Jones is,basically,a good sh*g and, almost, you might say,a bit of rough.So he does. Then he dumps her. Hardly pausing to take breath,Miss Jones changes her affections to his college pal Mr Firth,hardly the act of a feisty,independent 21st century woman one would have thought.What is it they say ""Man is to woman as bicycle is to fish""?Don't tell Bridget. As for any other Richard Curtis work I did not believe in a single minute of this film.Mr Grant has gone beyond the merely irritating,Mr Firth should really try to display some sign of life.The constant use of the ""F"" word is no more amusing here than in ""Full Metal Jacket"" where at least it was excusable. Salman Rushdie shouldn't give up his day job. This is a film set in England for people who have never been to England,about the English for people who've never met any.Do so on the strength of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" and I guarantee you'll be disappointed."

But after having seen this movie I must say i've started to doubt this preference..<br/><br/>OK, so there are some funny developments, and I find Hugh Grant a rather amusing character, esp. when he has this immoral streak going on.. nevertheless, the development was predictable, the characters were rather stereotypical, dialogues where very very ... dull.. and the soundtrack was without exception the most horrible sequence of pep-tunes i have EVER heard..<br/><br/>yeh, i cant stress that enough: the soundtrack of this movie is horrible.. and since background music is able to make or break a scene, this might explain why scenes just lacked ambiance.. I actually had to turn of the sound to be able to keep watching certain scenes.. (now that cant be a good thing).. I don't know any names so i cant give examples, but rest assure that with its peppy and almost desperate selection of songs it stands out from any other romantic comedy in the most negative way.. it doesn't 'blend' the scenes.<br/><br/>About acting; other than Hugh Grant (who is actually a bit over the top) i find other characters very unconvincing and 'propish' (which includes this movie's good guy).. esp the 3 friends of Bridget, hanging around her throughout the movie as a soundboard for her romantic developments, really feel like being put there as filling.. plus they are annoying.. (i mean, please; 2 girls and the typical gay guy..

"gabridl","3","2","4","27 April 2001"," Broken Wing Attracts Male Every Time
","I went into this movie expecting to find a sad and funny tale of loneliness. What I got was an atavistic lecture in antediluvian sexism. Never mind if a woman is slovenly, overweight, smokes, drinks, and totally inept: all that matters is that if she appears pathetic enough, and speaks like a sex kitten, she will snare The Right Man (older, richer, smarter, and higher class) who will then Fix Everything. The last scene says it all: Bridget in Underwear in Snow Embraced by Protector. Please. As for men who do not fit the perfect mold, well, they're Losers and don't deserve sex. And as for attractive, competent women, well, they're ""Stick Insect"" castrating witches.<br/><br/>This movie displays a reversion to sexual politics as crude and pathetic as anything I've seen post-feminism. Its myopism is the funniest thing about it. Bridget can hardly see that she is imitating perfectly her mother's choices and is headed for exactly the same misery. Maybe that is the film's subtle message, but I won't give it the credit of being that intelligent. Too bad, because the cast are all fine actors."

","They say that if a man is not a socialist by the time he is twenty, then he has no heart, and that if he is not a conservative by the time he is forty, then he has no brain. So far as I can tell, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" depicts not a man but a woman who falls somewhere in-between both these two particular ages and, as a bonus, these two somewhat rudimentary world outlooks. While not a particularly political film, it is interesting to note how it seems to push the message that men and women are better together, and that individualism and empowerment is all well and good, but will ultimately lead to loneliness.<br/><br/>Texas-born actress Renée Zellweger plays the eponymous Bridget Jones, a desk-jockey in a plush London office belonging to a publishing firm. She is single; 32 years of age and desperate for a man in her life as yet another New Year's ticks by- bellowing out the lyrics to ""All by Myself"" after a day's slog, complete with all the drum and cymbal actions right on cue, to emphasise the point. Despite this, Jones is not lonely in the technical sense - she has a large group of contacts and acquaintances: her friends are an assortment of homosexuals and liberal metropolitans; her parents, played by Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, eventually become separate shoulders to cry on, while at the office, there is her boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), to whom she takes a fancy.<br/><br/>The film makes some effort to point out as to how Jones has been living life fairly liberally: she smokes; falls drunk out of taxi cabs after nights out; has neglected her diet over the years and has placed a lot of effort and energy into her career in order to be where she is - there are not many people in jobs, after all, who might be able to rub shoulders with both Salman Rushdie AND Jeffery Archer at a function. Much later on in the film, there is a scene involving Jones having to do some actual cooking from original ingredients - the likes of which comes as totally alien to her, inferring a complete lack of skill in this department. This is something which would not have been the case for her previous generation, the likes of whom kept the homestead.<br/><br/>The film depicts Jones seemingly want to break from most of this, and has her set about tidying up her life through a manner of ways which predominantly revolve around shedding her liberal skin - depicting the events amusingly in the titular diary, with her optimum goal being the obtaining of a man. Working with books for all her life, she is therefore afforded a degree of comedic prose with which to construct her entries. <br/><br/>There are two men in her life who have the greatest potential of filling her life's largest chasm: one of them, and despite having already identified him as being somebody who embodies all that's wrong with men, is Cleaver. The other is a barrister and an old family friend played by Colin Firth called Mark Darcy, whose good looks the film feels need confirming to us early on by two women during a private conversation and whose paddling pool Jones happened to play around naked in when they were eight. Playfully, the film affords Cleaver and Darcy an antagonistic history in that one once slept with the other's fiancé. <br/><br/>I was struck by just how passionate the film feels about its central message, that of how men and women are happier together and that love, it would seem, conquers all. At the time of the film being made, female employment actually outnumbered male employment in the United Kingdom for the first time in history. Feminism had found a happy place in society, allowing women to possess their own freedoms and careers - free from feeling ashamed about their bodies and allowing them to have relationships with co-workers on top of whatever else.
 
I'm not sure the film is necessarily taking a stand against much of this, and in its heroine, it has somebody who embodies these philosophies better than most, but it treads dangerously close to a line the other side of which commends monogamy; married life and things like pride in appearance: items which you might say are/were anathema to many of those who helped Labour to their landslide win at around the exact same time the source material for this film was conceived.<br/><br/>Certainly, by the end, the film has depicted more than just Bridget Jones turning her life around: Jones' mother, in actual fact, goes in the opposite direction - describing herself as living in the ""winter"" of her life and admitting that, if she'd had a second chance, would not have even bothered with having children. Being more liberal in old age, she leaves her husband for another man. There is even room for an otherwise irrelevant narrative about a Kurdish man who escapes illegal deportation and thanks the heavens he has had a wife by his side all this time. The manner about which these supporting strands eventually unfold only seem to serve to reinforce my belief that the film is about how human beings do better as twosomes. <br/><br/>Aside all things, the film is often just terrifically funny: moments such as the montage of job interviews Jones undergoes cannot help but make you laugh, whereas her desperate attempt to provide a speech at a book launch with the equipment not fully functional works on more than just the singular level. From the point of view of straight up genre film-making, the film ticks enough boxes. ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" has spawned two sequels, neither of which I have seen, but will certainly hunt down - I would recommend this particular entry besides."

Later at her workplace at a publishing house, she describes the colleagues she also dislikes, and her boss has his eye upon her, and he seems charming.

","As a rom com, this film had humor and romance, but the two didn't mesh well. It was so often cringe-worthy in its attempt to over-normalize Bridget, making audiences truly pity her rather than relate. Even the most socially awkward of us don't spit out our thoughts at the most inappropriate times as she does. Colin Firth managed to portray charm and endearment while remaining externally aloof and haughty, nailing the ideal romantic interest in a way less obvious than usual. Unfortunately Hugh Grant did not pull off the same feat, making it hard to like Daniel Cleaver even in his romantic moments, making the ending all the more predictable to anyone in the audience unaware of the original novel the film is based on, Pride and Prejudice. As a modern adaptation of the classic, it's not as progressive as I'd hoped, with Bridget Jones still seeming too helpless and the male characters still too dominating when not downright harassing, making it seem as if Jones can't handle herself, very unlike the original heroine Lizzie Bennet. All in all, it was an entertaining film that just tried too hard to be relatable, but captured a sweet romantic ending. Perfect for a lonely night in."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","0","0","11 July 2017"," Much more than a chick flick
","It was the cast that drew me into seeing 'Bridget Jones's Diary', although there were doubts as to whether Renee Zellwegger would work, as well as being familiar with the books, finding them entertaining enough reads if not among the best personally read, and that Richard Curtis has done some other great work.<br/><br/>'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a pretty darn good adaptation of the book, it doesn't have everything included (that would have been a tall order) but the essence and what made the book work are captured incredibly well. This said, it is a very good film on its own terms, it can be dismissed (and has done) as a chick flick and a film just for women. It is much more than both those things, being a film that tries to appeal to both sexes and having more depth than your average romantic comedy/chick flick.<br/><br/>Maybe 'Bridget Jones's Diary' doesn't cover any new ground. Maybe it doesn't break any conventions. That didn't matter to me, because whether it does matter with any film, TV series, episode etc. is wholly dependent on how well it executes everything else, everything else is executed with very little to complain about.<br/><br/>Some parts were a little contrived and there is a slightly draggy section around half-way, but these were minor issues really.<br/><br/>'Bridget Jones's Diary' is attractive visually in a film that doesn't require epic sweeping cinematography or opulence, but still manages to be beautifully shot, cohesively edited and have striking locations. Personally really liked the music, with a mix of the old greats and more contemporary performers, and it fits well.<br/><br/>A good script always helps, and it's the script that's one of the main good things here. The humour can be daft but is often hilarious and full of wit, while the romantic parts are sentimental but never mawkish or overdone and the more drama-oriented moments have an air of poignancy. Much of the film is also deliciously charming and to me relatable. Bridget manages to be more endearing here than she is in the book, to me she was easy to sympathise with and feel pity for regardless of her faults and the numerous things she does wrong, and quite a lot of us will find a lot of ourselves in her character.<br/><br/>Even if new ground is not covered, bright and breezy pacing and remarkably deft directing from Sharon Maguire in her directing debut help make that not count against the film.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger is fantastic in the title role, any initial doubts were completely subsided after seeing a performance of immense charm and that was both funny, awkward in the adorable sense and sympathetic. She does a good job with the accent too.<br/><br/>Cast against type, Hugh Grant still brings a smarmy charm so despite being a cad (which he brings out without seeming ill at ease at all) you do see what Bridget sees in him. Colin Firth is reserved and understated but injects the right amount of dignity, charisma and charm to not make the character dull in a role that seemed like it was written with him in mind (that his character's name is a play on from his most famous role, Mr Darcy in the wonderful 1995 'Pride and Prejudice', further gives that impression).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are a whos who of veteran British talent, all doing reliably solid jobs, with the always good Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent coming off best.<br/><br/>Overall, a delight and much more than a chick flick with something for everyone regardless of gender or age if given a chance. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

Sure, it has a big unnecessary subplot just to fill the empty duration, but with a supporting cast this strong, I wouldn't mind having to take a break from all the love triangle that was going on.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth may not have that strong of a chemistry, but throw Hugh Grant into the mix and somehow all three of them play each other off really well. Zellweger particularly went lengths for this movie, and I must applaud her for her impeccable comedic timing and sweet charm that lured me into liking her careless, clueless character.<br/><br/>It was a sweet romantic comedy for a date night, but don't expect anything original or mind-blowing about it. It's still just a fun romantic comedy, amazingly engineered and well-acted."

","The movie based on the novel by Helen Fielding is a bit of a misnomer. Despite, a few moments of observations told with the delicate staccatos of Renee Zellweger's inner monologue, the diary doesn't really fit into the story all that much. What the film should have been called is Pride and Prejudice 2000. Not to say that a loose adaptation of a classic is a bad idea it's just you don't have to be so obvious about it.<br/><br/>Our charming protagonist Bridget (Zellweger) is a bit of a hot mess. In the words of potential love interest Mark Darcy (Firth), ""she smokes like a chimney, drinks like a fish and dresses like her mother."" Bridget decides to mend her ways in an effort to find ""true love."" This promptly gets the attention of her boss Daniel (Grant), a notorious flirt and head of the publishing company she works for. Bridget comes to believe Mark and Daniel are acquainted and not on good terms. So naturally her budding relationship with Daniel causes a further rift while the accident prone Bridget juggles her work, her love life and her family. As you can imagine not everything goes according to plan.<br/><br/>All of he film's charm lies squarely on the shoulders of Renee Zellweger. The film goes through the motions as if it were in a trance yet she somehow makes everything bearable and even enjoyable. Much ado was made when she, an American was cast in lieu of a British actress. Rest assured her effervescence, her wit and her accent all make it through the picture unscathed. Truth be told finding a comedic character of this depth and verisimilitude is near impossible these days and for a female character to be this utter likable is a testament to Mz. Zellweger's abilities.<br/><br/>If only the supporting characters and competing love interests were as fully developed. Both Firth and Grant do their best yet neither fully succeeds in winning me over. Firth's rendition of Darcy acts like he's come in from an entirely different movie and only adds to the plot when a certain bit of information needs to be conveniently pushed to the side to become a dramatic macguffin later. Grant on the other hand can play many roles including a romantic lead but being a deceitful wastrel who ""wants to make a change;"" oh brother. The less I say about the completely wasted talents of Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones the better.<br/><br/>As I've said before the magic behind the source material i.e. ""Pride and Prejudice"" is it's universality. Despite two centuries of wide circulation, the Jane Austen novel works because it ultimately is about finding yourself within the context of a stifling social structure. To that end Bridget Jones's Diary succeeds until the very last act. Instead of a shrewd Elizabeth Bennet meeting the stoic Darcy on equal footing sans pride or prejudice, we get Bridget coveting a man she knows she loves yet hardly knows and is willing to brave the cold in her underwear to prove it. Bridget Jones is not a subversion of rom- com clichés (or the lives of landed gentry for that matter), it's a submission to the idle, unworkable fantasies of romantic love that to be quite frank has warn out it's welcome in the 90's.<br/><br/>Lacking the sharpness of the original source material and willing to submit itself and its audience to sentimentalism, the film is nothing more than your average run-of-the-mill romantic comedy made pleasant by Renee Zellweger. Bridget Jones's Diary should be viewed only to watch Zellweger find her muse in the rich inner-life of a single woman in her 30's fearing the looming threat of spinsterhood. Single people be warned, this movie is liable to push you into bad decisions; don't fall for the hype."

","It's an amusing romantic comedy with Renée Zellweger is a plumpish woman on and after her thirty-second birthday. She's single and nothing much is going on. She seems cheerful enough about it all but she decides to begin life anew, starting a diary and making resolutions such as losing fourteen pounds and cutting down on the drinking and smoking.<br/><br/>Zellweger works in a London publishing house and begins to wear short skirts and rather vulgar see-through blouses to the office. Soon enough she's flirting with her boss, the ever sly Hugh Jackman, and soon after than they're in the sack together. She begins to get a bit mushy and asks him if he loves her. For that, he buggers her for the second time.<br/><br/>Well -- does he love her? Is he willing to ""commit""? (That's code for ""willing to get married."") Evidently not, because she pays him an unexpected visit one day and finds a luscious babe naked in his bath room. The babe eyes Zellweger with a smirk and remarks, ""I thought you said she was THIN."" Ouch.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, always hovering around the background, is the successful but stuffy and decidedly unchic Colin Firth. Zellweger has loathed him at first sight. He never smiles or flirt or jokes around like the roguish Jackman. Not much fun, you know. But one day he takes her aside and tells her grimly that he ""likes her"" just the way she is. Coming from him, that's a Niagara Falls of a confession. In the meantime, though, Jackman has abandoned all his girl friends and tells Zellweger she can give him rebirth. That is, he's now willing to get married and so, it develops, is Firth.<br/><br/>At a dinner one night at Zellweger's flat, Jackman and Firth run into one another and have a fist fight over her. Now this has got to be female fantasy Number One -- two men fighting over you, a plain girl with not much going for her but brains and zest. And they're both successful and have other women salivating over them. Wow. I won't claim it began with Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" because I'm sure the theme goes back in history through the Greek masques, and is lost finally in the mists of antiquity. (For men's fantasy Number One, viz., The Conquering Hero. Start with ""Rocky."" Go back to ""The Iliad."") Much of the wit lies in the writing itself, full of irony and vulgarity. There are a few slapstick scenes -- Bridget trying to cook -- that hark back to ""I Love Lucy"" and Laurel and Hardy. They're still funny and the absurd characters are well defined.<br/><br/>Zellweger is a decent actress and though hefty she has an engaging blue eyes and a smile that could brighten a room. Jackman is his usual on-screen self, stuttering slightly, a little embarrassed at times. Firth is unpleasant and stiff but Zellweger has juice enough for both of them and she'll turn him into a paragon of élan before you know it."

","It must be some kind of unwritten rule that men are supposed to despise chick flicks. I myself despise the bad ones, but I can enjoy the good ones. Surprisingly enough, Bridget Jones's Diary can fit into that latter category. The rom-com looked so clichéd and dull based off the trailers, but instead it's a warm, charming, and funny film. It's not the greatest and not entirely original, but it's still a charming British rom com.<br/><br/>Sharon Maguire's film is about a woman in her 30's named Bridget Jones who is struggling to find love and is a little plump, and have smoking and drinking problems. Her life becomes even more confusing when these two men fall for her in different ways: her boss who has got everything a woman would want and a lawyer who is socially awkward.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted. Renee Zellweger's role is actually quite daring and she is perfect for this role. She plays it with her best and I'm not sure if anyone else would be right for this role. Both Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were excellent and quite charming as two men with opposite personalities fighting for the same woman(in one great scene, there was a legit fight.) Gemma Jones was excellent as Bridget's crazy mother.<br/><br/>Overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a rather solid chick flick. It seems a little overdrawn and it is not totally original, but one cannot deny the charm the film oozes out. It's a warm film and it has simple messages of love. I am not sure if the film was in need of a sequel as the ending was so perfect, but I know I'll check it out at some point. A very charming romantic comedy and I am pleasantly surprised. I rate this film 8/10."

Over the course of the film she comes to realise she is with the wrong man but by then it might be too late.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't have picked up this film if it hadn't been on the 50p bargain shelf at the local charity shop I'm glad that I did though as it was a lot of fun. There are plenty of great laugh out loud moments and Texan Renée Zellweger does a great job as the English Bridget. She is ably supported by a cast of well-known British actors; most notably Colin Firth and Hugh Grant as Darcy and Cleaver it was particularly fun watching Grant play the cad rather than the sympathetic male lead; not that he plays the two all that differently! It was also a highlight to see the two scrapping; not a well-choreographed fight but a believable brawl with them kicking, punching and grabbing each other in a messy but realistic and hilarious way. Overall an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half; it may be considered a bit of a 'chick-flick' but blokes can enjoy it too!"

The writing in this movie took all the same story that has be recycled over and over again and made something good out of it, taking away the stuff that we seen before and putting something new and clever. This has to be Renée Zellweger best role that she was in. Playing the cheeky, caring and witty person that she is.

","I'm gonna come straight out and say it – I don't really love romcoms. Recent and future entries in this blog may lead you to think otherwise, with both ""Love Actually"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" reviewed within days of each other. Actually no, on further thought, I love a lot of romcoms. The classics, like ""Some Like it Hot"" or ""Manhattan"", or recent subversions of the genre, such as ""(500) Days of Summer"" and ""Punch Drunk Love"", are films which I admire greatly despite being in this genre. These are the films which either began the clichés in an unforced and genuinely romantic way, or which turned the conventions on their heads. ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is occasionally funny, sickly sweet, but does nothing in the way of breaking convention.<br/><br/>The film follows the title character, played by Renée Zellweger, and her search for love with a few different men – including those played by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. Her impressions of the two change throughout the film as she gets new information, with her love for Daniel Cleaver (Grant) turning into hatred after he cheats on her, and her hatred for Mark Darcy (Firth) turning into love. She is a clumsy woman, prone to faux-pas, which leads to some interesting and witty comedy, and often leaves her unlucky in love.<br/><br/>Renée Zellweger is a good choice for Jones, and she passes off a sense of 'ordinary' which is important for the character. The comic set pieces and dialogue is managed well by her and she is actually a very likable character. Colin Firth also brings across the bumbling British romantic well, and despite their initial hatred for each other, you see how the two work as a couple. The biggest problem is Hugh Grant, who I continue to dislike strongly. Having seen this and ""Four Weddings"" in such close proximity, it's hard not to draw comparisons between their characters, basically the same in both.<br/><br/>""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has a lot of great things in some cast choices, and some excellently funny moments. The fight scene between the two men is genuinely funny, and I love many of Zellweger's scenes, particularly her terrible public speaking. Where it falls down is at the bare romance and reliance on genre clichés. It's too predictable and from the introduction of both men, we know which one she's going to fall for. The one grace in this is that, despite its cheese, the final scene is very sweet. It's not a particularly clever film, but then again, it's not trying to be. I didn't love it, but I'm sure that fans of this genre will – especially if they take a particular fancy to Hugh Grant."

","In structural terms, BRIDGET JONES DIARY doesn't have too much relationship to its source; the diary-form is soon abandoned in favor of the basic romantic comic plot. What the film does have, however, is a winning central performance from Renee Zellweger in the eponymous title role; many of her thoughts are heard in voice-over, and director Sharon Maguire has great fun exploring the distance between such thoughts and what really happens in Bridget's life. In many ways she is an idealist, perpetually in search of the ideal boyfriend but doomed to spend her life with lowlifes and/or cads. As Daniel Cleaver, her boss and one-time lover, Hugh Grant is a perfect example of this latter kind of person, the guy who protests love for Bridget on the one hand while trying his best to exploit her credulity on the other. The film also brings out the story's Austenian echoes; Colin Firth is wonderfully standoffish as Mark Darcy, but he understand his true nature from the way he stares at Bridget, even though he moves scarcely a facial muscle. Proud of his public image as a hotshot lawyer, he finds it difficult, if not impossible to acknowledge his true feelings - at least until the climactic fight sequence with Cleaver. BRIDGET JONES DIARY also contains at least two memorable cameos from Gemma Jones as Bridget's mother - whose antics put her daughter to shame - and Paul Brooke as Mr. Fitzberbert (or Tits Pervert as Bridget calls him), Cleaver's snobbish sidekick. In short, a film that improves with repeated viewings."

This film has introduced me to the charm of Colin Firth and I'm glad about that. Renee Zelwegger did wonders and seemed every bit British. Kudos to Grant too for playing a scoundrel type role, not something he usually essays. Although the movie's basic plot is predictable (this is intentional or else Colin Firth's character wouldn't have been named Darcy) pretty much from the start, the same cannot be said for the film's scene or dialogue.

This is actually highly believable as Cleaver is played by Hugh Grant. Grant captures that unmistakable schoolboy charm, and blends it with his often cruel wit. It's simple to feel at ease with him, even though you know he's a bit of a cad. Firth plays himself wonderfully respectable. His inability to express himself can often be painful. At the heart of it all is Bridget Jones played excellently by Zelwegger. She isn't some desperate hussy, or lonely weirdo. She's a good role model that makes some mistakes. The humour often goes for that very British awkwardness, and the script is sometimes let down being based on a fictitious diary and all. Luckily we get some truly unforgettable moments, such as the fight scene between Grant and Firth, which is very hysterical, in both it's choreography and pacing."

","Romance and humorously-derived self-humiliation mix somewhat uneasily in this glossy adaptation of Helen Fielding's book (by Fielding, Andrew Davies, and Richard Curtis). Bridget Jones, a British working girl with a mad crush on her boss, keeps crossing paths with a handsome lawyer whom she's known since childhood--a man who is naturally charmed by Bridget's downright clumsy attempts to socialize. Renée Zellweger (with added weight and an uncanny accent) is a perky heroine, a young lady prone to embarrassing herself in the midst of having a good time, who doesn't poke fun at her mistakes and bad choices (and who doesn't allow much guff from others, either); she's occasionally a flibbertigibbet but also a strong female character, one with drive and determination who goes after what she wants. The two men enamored of her (Hugh Grant and Colin Firth) work well with Zellweger, though the strained relationship between the guys is the worst type of movie contrivance (culminating in a fight scene that is also the very worst of its type). The movie doesn't scuttle its chances at being a funny love story...though there isn't enough of either element in the first half, and Bridget's initial job as a publicity executive is just a sketch (due to callow writing). Nevertheless, some big laughs and a wonderfully old-fashioned finale, plus fine work by the star-trio. Followed by a sequel in 2004. **1/2 from ****"
"JamesHitchcock","7","0","0","8 July 2011"," Have You Met Miss Jones?
","Bridget Jones is a single woman in her early thirties who works for a London publishing company. The title derives from the fact that she confides all her feelings, her frustrations and her obsessions to her diary. And Bridget certainly has plenty of obsessions. She obsesses about her weight, about the amount she smokes, about the number of ""units of alcohol"" she consumes and about her inability to find a boyfriend. She is haunted by the thought that she is fated to remain single forever and worries that the destiny of all single women is to be found dead in their flat, their bodies eaten by their dogs. She is so desperate for love and affection that she even begins dating her boss, Daniel Cleaver, although she is well aware that he is a notorious womaniser with a phobia about commitment.<br/><br/>Helen Fielding's novel was a huge success in Britain in the late nineties, so much so that the phrase ""a Bridget Jones"" entered the language to describe a certain type of thirty-something career woman. Fielding deliberately drew upon Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" when writing her novel; her hero, for example, is named Mark Darcy. Bridget first meets Mark, a barrister, at a Christmas party hosted by her parents, and their courtship follows the same pattern as that of Elizabeth Bennett and the other Mr. Darcy; they start out by disliking each other and gradually come to appreciate each other's good qualities. Mark and Daniel, once friends, now cordially detest one another, and the reason for estrangement becomes clear in the course of the film. (Their relationship parallels that of Darcy and George Wickham in Austen's novel).<br/><br/>Before his Oscar-winning performance in ""The King's Speech"", Colin Firth was perhaps best known for playing the other Mr. Darcy in the famous BBC adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"", so he was perhaps a natural choice for the role of Mark. Like his namesake, this Darcy is gentlemanly and possessed of firm moral principles, but is quiet and reserved and finds it difficult to express his feelings. Hugh Grant was best known in the nineties for playing middle-class romantic comedy heroes in films like ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""The Englishman who Went up a Hill."" and ""Notting Hill"", so playing a rotten cad like Cleaver- a man for whom the concept of morality is an alien one- was perhaps an attempt to broaden his range. (He had also played a villainous character in his previous film, ""Small Time Crooks""). He throws himself into the role with gusto, so it is unfortunate that since 2001, except in the sequel, ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason"", he has tended to retreat back into his romantic comedy comfort zone.<br/><br/>Of the three main characters, it is Bridget who bears least resemblance to her Austenian counterpart. (Elizabeth is generally cool and self-possessed, Bridget anything but). The casting of Renée Zellweger in the role caused some controversy in Britain, as some felt that it should have gone to a British star. (She was to cause a similar controversy five years later when she was cast in the title role of ""Miss Potter""). The normal reason for parachuting American stars into British films is to win over those Americans who refuse to see any film unless it contains at least one well-known name, but that may not have been the reason here, given that the British actresses considered for the part included such internationally-known stars as Helena Bonham Carter, Rachel Weisz and Kate Winslet. The film did, however, prove two things about Renée Zellweger. The first is that she can do a splendid English accent. Like Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Sliding Doors"" she manages to make her character sound convincingly like a middle-class Londoner, avoiding the twin traps of making her either too posh or too cockney.<br/><br/>The second thing we learn about Renee is that she has a gift for comedy, particularly important in the latter part of the film. (This is a romantic comedy where the stress is on the second word as much as on the first). Bridget leaves her job in publishing and becomes a television reporter; she tackles her assignments gamely but incompetently, and normally ends up making a laughing-stock of herself. Yet all the time she remains sympathetic, not merely ridiculous, which is important.<br/><br/>Another feature is the witty use of pop music, using titles which have some connection to the plot of the film. Examples include ""It's Raining Men"", ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"", each of which occurs at some pertinent point in the action.<br/><br/>There is nothing very deep about ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" unlike, say, ""Four Weddings."" or ""Sliding Doors"", both of which display a greater degree of ambition than one would normally associate with the rom-com genre. It is, however, a likable and occasionally witty comedy, one of the better British romantic comedies of the 2000s. It is certainly better than the below-par sequel. 7/10"

If you can be tolerant of a very weak Mr Darcy and a completely non-Elizabeth, you may well love this movie. <br/><br/>6 stars mostly for Hugh Grant. Without him, it would have been only stars. The movie might have worked better for me if Zellwegger had been Elizabeth Bennet's silly younger sister Lydia and ended up enforcedly with a resentful Wickham! Hugh Grant could have done a great line in greed!"

","Bridget Jones's diary is an excellent film. It's romantic, funny and sweet. I usually don't like Renee Zellweger, besides a few films. THe first Bridget Jones film is very funny and it ends on a nice note. Bridget Jones's diary is about a British columnist named Bridget Jones(Renee Zellweger), a British woman looking for some love. Her life is a bit of a blur. Every Christmas, she goes to a party at her parents place, filled with countless perverts who disguise themselves as close relatives. Bridget gets feelings for her boss Daniel(Hugh Grant), who states that Mark Darcy(Colin Firth) had sex with his wife. Mark Darcy is a lawyer that always goes to the Christmas parties. Also, she knew him as a child. THey didn't get along for a while. She soon falls in love with someone that she never expected to. Because Daniel Cleever is a man-wh*re. Bridget Jones's diary was based on a book by Hellen Fielding. Who has done many romantic novels. Renee ZEllweger is brilliant as Bridget, everyone in it is good. This is the first out of two films and is the best. Bridget Jones's Diary is a must-see."

","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is headed to her parents' home for a New Year's gathering. Again, she is going alone, with no boyfriend in tow. Once there, her parents re-introduce her to an old childhood friend, Marc Darcy (Colin Firth), who is divorced and a hot-shot, human rights lawyer. However, Marc insults Bridget, accidentally, and Bridget sees him as a stuffy, boring gentleman, too. So, a romance between the two of them seems mighty improbable. Back at her small apartment, Bridget gets a bit tipsy but makes a New Year's resolution to keep a diary. It will record the doings of a thirty-something, biological clock-ticking lady in London. Soon after, book publicist Bridget receives some overtures from her handsome but lothario-like boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant). Unbelievably, Daniel takes a shine to Bridget and they begin a ""thing"". Yet, this leave-it-to-Cleaver has wandering eyes and Bridget is about to be on the receiving end of his infidelity. Horrors! On the upswing, Bridget and Mr. Darcy, that is, Marc, meet time and again, by happenstance, and their icy feelings for each other appear to go through a semi-thaw. Is it likely that ""our Bridget"" will find true love in the early 21st century? This is a wonderful movie and a true antidote to the cares of the world, especially for women everywhere. Most of us, like Bridget, are insecure, a bit overweight, and clumsy at love, among other things. Therefore, it warms the heart to see the underdog succeed. As the main character, Zellweger is nearly flawless, exhibiting high humor, a sunny nature, and self-deprecation in perfect pitch. Then, too, Firth and Grant are likewise terrific as her love interests; in truth, no one could have played these roles better, either. All of the secondary actors, Jim Broadbent, Gemma Jones, Shirley Henderson and the rest, are quite fine, too. As for the setting in London, it is lovely, as are the nice costumes and camera work. Above all, the script, based on Helen Fielding's best-selling book, and the skilled direction are to be greatly admired, for they absolutely capture the essence of the unhappy, aging-by-the minute single woman in her thirties. If you were to keep a diary of your own movie views, dear reader, do make certain you include BJD as an entry. In fact, it is one of those films to watch whenever a spiritual ""pick me up"" is needed."
"zardoz-13","10","0","0","2 July 2008"," Don't Miss ""Bridget Jones's Diary!""
","This delightfully funny British import from the guys who gave us ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994) combines the best elements of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" with the classic fairy tale favorite ""Cinderella."" Bestselling author Helen Fleming, who penned the phenomenal 1996 novel of the same name, wrote the screenplay with ex-boyfriend Richard (""Notting Hill"") Curtis and Andrew (the BBC's ""Pride and Prejudice"") Davies. This saucy romantic chick flick with its unconventional heroine, clever slapstick farce, witty charismatic cast, predictable happy ending, and relentlessly self-depreciating British humor qualifies as the best chubby girl comedy since the 1966 ugly duckling English romp ""Georgy Girl"" headlining a plump Lynn Redgrave. Texas native Renee Zellweger of ""Jerry Maguire"" adopts a serviceable British accent and captures the klutzy charm of the eponymous 32-year old West London bachelorette torn between her womanizing boss Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant of ""Mickey Blue Eyes"") and divorced human rights barrister Mark Darcy (Colin Firth of ""Shakespeare in Love""). As comparisons go, ""Bridget Jones's Diary resembles a funnier, more down-to-earth, big-screen version of TV's ""Friends."" ""Diary"" chronicles our neurotic but sympathetic, size twelve, London office girl's year-long efforts to discover love and happiness. The vetty British soap operatic action opens one snowy Christmas. Bridget resolves to lose twenty pounds, to stop chain-smoking, to stop bingeing on chocolate, and to stop swilling Chardonnay at home alone while warbling the lyrics to Eric Carmen's ""All By Myself."" In an ironic voice over, poor Bridget muses, ""Unless I changed my life, I was destined to die alone and be found three weeks later, half-eaten by Alsatians. Bridget sets about entering her current weight as well as cigarette and alcohol use in a daily diary. At the same time, she vows with mock conviction to find a ""nice, sensible boyfriend to go out with"" and refuses ""to form romantic attachments to any of the following: alcoholics, workaholics, commitment phobic's, peeping Toms, megalomaniacs"" and so forth. No sooner has Bridget made such pretentious pledges than she finds herself dating Daniel Cleaver and flirting with the scoundrel at the office via e-mail. Meanwhile, Bridget's well-meaning but intrusive parents introduce her to another eligible bachelor, Mark Darcy, at their Christmas party.<br/><br/>Bridget and Mark get off on the wrong foot. She overhears Mark call her a ""verbally incontinent spinster."" Later, Daniel reveals that Mark stole his previous girlfriend. Bridget's dislike for Mark mounts. The conflict reaches boiling point when both guys confront each other at a dinner party that Bridget has whipped up for her friends. Basically, she serves them blue soup. Suddenly, Daniel and Mark tie into each other with fists flying and wind up in the street for one of the funniest fights ever filmed. The highlight of the fisticuffs occurs when our combatants carry their slugfest into a restaurant and pause long enough to chime in for a chorus of ""Happy Birthday"" for a dinner guest! Happily, unlike ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" nobody dies in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Nevertheless, scenarists Fielding, Curtis, and Davies maintain a commendable level of suspense throughout about Bridget's uncertain destiny.<br/><br/>Freshman director Sharon Maguire manages to keep everything light and flighty with an occasional poignant moment. For example, Bridget attends a ""Tarts & Vicars"" costume party dressed as a Playboy bunny, learning only too late that costumes were no longer required. Later, after she leaves Daniel and takes a job as an on-camera reporter for the TV show ""Sit Up, Britain,"" she ends up exposing her buttocks to the camera when she slides down a firehouse pole! Basically, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" features several embarrassing moments, one wedding and a marriage renewal. When Bridget cruises for the elusive Mr. Right, her parents (Gemma Jones of ""Sense and Sensibility"" and Jim Broadbent of ""The Avengers"") break up and her mom takes up with a TV shopping channel host. Lonely, single, average females without the heroin-chic, media-made looks of haughty Cosmopolitan cover girls searching for love in all the wrong places (might as well include their similarly distressed masculine counterparts) will applaud this helium light whimsy.<br/><br/>A truly outstanding cast breathes credibility into their characters. Zellweger steals every scene she has with her handsome English co-stars. Interestingly, Barbara Berkery, the dialogue coach who trained Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Sliding Doors"" and ""Shakespeare in Love,"" guided Zellweger's miraculous vocal transformation from Texan to Londoner. Further, Zellweger pulled a Robert De Niro stunt and packed on 20 actual pounds to appear plump enough for the role. Finally, to prepare herself intellectually, she spent time working at the London publishing house Picador, so she could get a feel for Bridget's job. Clearly, on the basis of this kind of dedication to her acting, Zellweger deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. Hugh Grant breaks new ground playing a convincingly leery-eyed, conniving cad, while Colin Firth maintains his dignity no matter how silly he appears in a clownish brawl with Grant or whatever outfit he wears, such as a reindeer sweater when Bridget and he meet for the first time. Mind you, it is no mistake that Firth won the role of Mark Darcy. Fielding has written complimentary remarks about Firth in her two ""Bridget"" novels and the in-joke is that Firth portrayed another Darcy in the acclaimed BBC version of ""Pride and Prejudice."" ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" proves a thousand times better than Renee Zellweger's earlier and abysmal ""Nurse Betty."""
"Atreyu_II","7","0","0","13 April 2008"," Another good example of British humor
","""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is another okay romantic comedy with British humor. It is neither a great movie neither a bad movie. Just acceptable and watchable, but without bad surprises.<br/><br/>This movie is in the same line as other British romantic comedies such as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", which wouldn't be surprising (considering they are all from the same producers and they all star Hugh Grant). I personally consider this neither better neither worst than those two movies that I mentioned.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, it's a reasonably entertaining movie with its fun. Its most positive points are: a good soundtrack (""All By Myself"", ""Respect"", ""Out of Reach"" and ""It's Raining Men""), some beautiful landscapes of England, the British humor (despite some offensive lines), the blue soup made by Bridget Jones (I wonder how that soup tastes like) and a hilarious fight between the characters Mark Darcy and Daniel Cleaver.<br/><br/>I also like the way how Renée Zellweger portrays Bridget Jones. Not that she is really great, but she's funny in the way she portrays this silly character. Hugh Grant is cool with this performance as the charming ""playboy"" Daniel Cleaver. But this isn't exactly a movie that I would want to add in my film collection.<br/><br/>Overall, a funny movie and a full plate for any fan of the peculiar British sense of humor. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys British comedies. As long as it is not taken too seriously, this movie can be easy to enjoy."

She is sensitive and sensible, yet she doesn't know it yet. She also has to deal with parent issues and struggles of life. All the characters play their parts incredibly.

","I admit, it was maybe around the time when this movie was released here in my country then, it was the Hugh Grant and the Colin Firth factor which made me secretly wish I could go watch the movie. I don't know, it was just like that. Suddenly thinking the British guys can be uh, handsome.<br/><br/>Five years on, I managed to catch it on cable.<br/><br/>Adapted from Helen Fielding's novel, it's about the main protagonist Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) trying to set things right on a new year by writing whatever she wants to say in her diary. In her 30s and still a single and a little kind of plump, she is determined to get a man in her life. The movie began with Bridget who went to attend a party and she met her former childhood friend who is now a lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth). Mark had been divorced with his wife and is single again.<br/><br/>But on the other hand, Bridget's boss in the publishing company she works for, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) started to become interested in her. Bridget found out later that her boss and childhood friend actually knew each other back in their university days. And the two guys never seemed to be on a good terms even before Bridget is in the middle of them.<br/><br/>It was made worse when Mark and Daniel realise they both like Bridget. Though Bridget found out once that Daniel had a girlfriend, Daniel told her they had broken up. And he told her that during her birthday. It was complicated to Bridget that Mark had did expressed his feelings to Bridget before Daniel came for the birthday party.<br/><br/>Well, who ended up had the girl in the end? The childhood friend or the boss? <br/><br/>Overall, I managed to catch the accents and I have to say Renee Zellweger did pretty a decent job in having a British accent for her role as Bridget to match with her fellow cast members. Definitely one movie which is just plain funny."

","It pains me to admit, as a huge fan of Pride and Prejudice, that - in spite of reading Bridget Jones's Diary numerous times and repeated viewings of the film - I didn't actually notice that the storyline was based on Jane Austen's famous novel. Even before I realised this, and perhaps more so now that I have, I love this film.<br/><br/>I heard that - while getting into character for Bridget - Renee Zellweger worked undercover at a publishers in Britain without anyone realising that she was in fact American, and having watched Bridget Jones's Diary I can completely understand why. If I didn't know it, I would certainly never have said she was an American. <br/><br/>There are a lot of subtle bits in this film that I like, as well as some of the less subtle bits. Look carefully at any scene in Bridget's flat and you'll see what I mean. Cans of Sprite, videos and packets of Silk Cut are dotted all over the living room. There is stuff all over her bathroom, which does make a big impact in one particular scene where she sits in the bath crying and the camera zooms out so that we see that she has hung her tights up to dry on the shower curtain rail above her. There's something about this very subtle scene that seems to express all the sadness she is feeling at the time. <br/><br/>As someone who - like Bridget - is always trying to look elegant (or even - dare I say it? - glamorous) and never seems to quite pull it off, I really appreciate those bits of the film where she tries to look good - dressed up in the manner of a Grace Kelly-type film star as she leaves for a mini-break - and ends up looking like she's been dragged through a hedge backwards. The see-through top scene is classic, and I love the very brief shot where she's off to a book launch and we see her trying to rearrange her granny knickers as she walks. <br/><br/>Although, like most people, I cringe for Bridget when she arrives in costume at her parents' friends' home expecting a Tarts and Vicars party that never really happens, what I really love about this bit is when Bridget and her dad are sharing a cigarette together. It says so much about their relationship with Mrs. Jones, Bridget's mum, and really reminded me of times when my friends decided to take up smoking as teenagers but always did it in places where their parents wouldn't catch them.<br/><br/>Something I like about the love interest aspect of the film is again to do with the subtlety of how it begins. Just a look between Mark and Daniel is enough to indicate their hatred for each other. Daniel's character is very much like Wickham in Pride and Prejudice - there are hints that he is not what he seems right from the start - but Bridget, like Elizabeth Bennet, quite naturally misses them."

","It is my sense that 8 out of 10 single women can identify with Bridget. After seeing this great flick, I can appreciate Bridget's inane desire to lose weight and over fantasize what perfection should be. This film showcases the reality of true beauty. Casting in this film was perfect. As an avid lover of Jane Austen, Mr. Firth as both Darcy & Darcy made the role his own. His humility of looks and demeanor, made his character, dare I say, more sexy, than that of suave, and handsome but slicky-boy, Mr. Grant's. I definitely know who I rather have. Also I enjoyed seeing other fine British actors in this film (so under-utilized in our own American film culture.) Still U.S. born & bred Ms. Zellweger is very convincing as a English girl on the brink. As ""Sex in the City"" is a dish of the inner most thoughts that reflect what seems to me more comic fantasy, ""Bridget Jones"" is a lush serving of the inner most thoughts that reflect a more humorous sense of reality that most of us (singles) can relate to"". For that I wish this was a series to be viewed each week. Still enjoy reading the ""diaries""."

","I rate this movie a 10. Renee Zellweger did such a fine job in the role of Bridget Jones, and maybe it was because I am used to seeing her look beautiful in films, but it didn't really look like she gained any weight to me, she just looked like her very pretty self. It wasn't until she had on that bunny costume, where I went..oh, well, MAYBE she gained some poundage, but she still looks pretty. She also does a very good English accent. Colin Firth was so much fun to watch, especially because he is playing ""Mark Darcy"", whereas he played ""Mr. Darcy"" in Pride and Prejudice.I was rooting for him to win Bridget's heart, and I am so glad he did, instead of Daniel Cleaver. I am sure that Hugh Grant is not like this in real life, as repulsive as he is in the movie.I also enjoyed seeing Jim Broadbent in this role, as I have only previously seen ""Moulin Rouge!"" with him in it, and his role in this movie is SO different, I barely recognized him. The women that play Shazzer and Perpetua; and the man that plays Tom are also very good. Shazzer kept me laughing! The only recognizable flaw in this movie is Gemma Jones in the role of Bridget's mum. I found her unbelievably unattractive and so annoying it wasn't even conceivable. I have read the book, and from what I can tell, her mum is supposed to be like that, but I still, even now, every time I watch it have to suppress the urge to wring her neck lol <br/><br/>This is a very funny movie, and it is an entertaining one.

","See this movie if you're female. But make it a girls' night out, and leave him at home. Don't say I didn't warn you.<br/><br/>Bridget Jones is a neurotic, lonely, but ultimately likable character. She is a heavy smoker, a heavy drinker, a few pounds overweight, British, a terrible public speaker, and has terrible judgment when it comes to relationships, but these qualities only help make her human and make it easier for people to identify with her. Of course, the fact that her character is portrayed by the very un-British and un-fat Renee Zellweiger makes some of what she says a little hard to believe. Despite this, Zellweiger pulls off the role with charm and grace - not an easy feat.<br/><br/>The story itself has no surprises. From the first five minutes, everyone in the theatre knew exactly how it would end. There's no exciting revelation or universal truth to this tale. It's a simple romantic story, and it doesn't pretend to be anything else.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant plays a fairly one-dimensional bad guy, and Colin Firth an equally flat good guy. Aside from the lead role, there are no noteworthy acting performances here.<br/><br/>I haven't read the book, but I hear that some of the quirkiness is lost in the movie. In addition, the movie has some issues with the plot that just scream ""should have been cut out when adapted from book"". After a while, watching Bridget make the same mistakes over and over again gets a little tiresome. But ultimately, the story works.<br/><br/>All in all, she's a likable heroine and we identify with her. The story is realistic and charming and, above all, harmless. It's a chick flick, but go see it if you're looking for a light laugh."

","Spoilers<br/><br/>No, not for BJD. Renee Zellweger had a most deserved Best Actress Oscar, in Chicago, stolen by Nicole Kidman who in turn had a chance the year before (together with Zellweger for BJD) which witnessed one of the most UNdeserving Best Actress Oscars. It should have gone to Sissy Spacek for In The Bedroom that year.<br/><br/>Watching BJD on video for the first time three years after it was released, I had the benefit of many people's hindsight and comments. Needless to say, it was all Zellweger's show. Messrs. Grant and Firth delivered their respective required screen persona professionally, with not much to fault. Zellweger acted well in scenes against them, but even better in scenes by herself. One interesting comparison is with Charlize Theron, and it is tempting to draw an easy conclusion that in the putting-on-weight-for-the-sake-of-art department, Theron has surpassed Zellweger. I would suggest that it is not necessarily so. In a way, it's more difficult for Zellweger. Theron put on weight, plus did a number of things to her face and body, to make the character repulsive (sorry if the choice of word is too strong). Everything she did work consistently in one direction. Zellweger however had to put on weight and at the same time make herself look attractive, 'the way she is'. (And here I'm aware of the politically unwise implication of what I'm saying). Which is more difficult?<br/><br/>The movie is enjoyable mainly because of the acting. There are some contrivances such as the ridiculously artificial 'climax' at the end with Mark's walking away after peeping at Bridget's diary, apparently in anger, but turned out to be just to buy her a new one. In any event, I enjoy BJD enough to look forward to the sequel 'The Edge of Reason', soon to be released, I believe."

","First the bad (though not truly bad at all): As I was watching this movie, I immediately knew the story as Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice.  This story is definitely not an original piece. In that aspect I was disappointed that credit wasn't given.  I would have seen it much sooner if it were the case, because that is my favorite book.  They call ""10 Things I Hate About You"" a modern adaptation of Taming of the Shrew, but for anyone who's read it, the movie barely resembles the story.  Bridget Jones's resemblance, however, is so plain and obvious, yet wasn't credited; except on IMDb.  Part 2 is sure to prove whether this writer has the ability to originate a plot.<br/><br/>Now the good: The humor was definitely original and HILARIOUS.  This movie actually made me laugh out loud... Something that most comedies today can't get me to do.  And I'm not a super serious person, on the contrary, I can be a total ham sometimes.  But this movies shows how foolish you can look when you're desperate, and this through the person's own private thoughts as written in her diary. It makes for some GREAT comedy. Renée Zellweger does a great job and stays in character wonderfully throughout the movie.  While another comment said Colin Firth was wooden, I happen to think differently. His character was quiet and actually somewhat oppressed by his colleague/girlfriend. But I think he did a good job of not letting this slip into cold and cruel.  I'm not particularly attracted to him, but after this movie I fell in love (not literally, silly. ^_^).  And I have actually watched other movies of his before this... so I'd say he did a great job.<br/><br/>
Besides the total jacking of Ms. Austen's masterpiece, I'd say it's rather original comedy. 7 out of 10 for lack of story originality."

","I must admit, I do like this film. I'm a sucker for British romantic comedies. But, what could have been the BritFlick to end all BritFlicks is fatally hobbled by the casting of Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--against all odds, she acts the part wonderfully. In fact, she was made for the part. The one glaring problem is her accent. Ninety-five percent of the time, it's perfect. However, she gets enough wrong to never let you forget that she's a Texan playing an Englishwoman. I found it quite nervously distracting--almost like waiting for a high-wire artist to fall. Granted, it's nowhere nearly as bad as Don Cheadle's appalling, unnecessary Cockney accent in Ocean's 11, Dick Van Dyke's mush- mouthed oratory in Mary Poppins, or--worst of all--Kevin Costner's vomit-inducing delivery in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves. BUT, it was just bad enough that it tarnished what could have been a real gem. <br/><br/>Why oh why didn't they cast a Brit? (Ditto for Johnny Depp in From Hell. Though he redeemed himself with his Keith Richards impression in Pirates of the Caribbean.) For that matter, why cast a Brit to play an American (e.g. the normally brilliant Bob Hoskins in Who Framed Roger Rabbit)?<br/><br/>That said, BJD is better by far than ninety-nine percent of the dreck out there and certainly well worth a rental.

","When British author Helen Fielding wrote Bridget Jones's Diary, she had no idea it was going to be a best-selling book; let alone a movie loved by millions. Fielding `shamelessly stole the plot' of Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', creating a much more updated version of the clever and romantic book. One of the most obvious similarities is the character of Mr. Darcy, conveniently reprised by the ultra-dreamy Colin Firth, who starred in A&E's `Pride and Prejudice' miniseries back in 1995.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger, being a wholesome blonde from Texas, would not have been the logical choice to play Bridget; the pleasingly quirky woman who smokes and downs vodka. But she dismisses all doubts in the first scene (which is at a New Years party) where she describes her mother as being from a time where `pickles on toothpicks were the height of sophistication', flaunting a figure 20 pounds heavier and a flawless British accent.<br/><br/>It is in this opening scene where Bridget is introduced to Colin Firth's character, Marc Darcy. Marc is an old family friend, who has become a successful barrister (lawyer). He exhibits an extreme sense of arrogance in their meeting and his distaste in Bridget is visible. She later overhears him insulting her; establishing Bridget and the audience's dislike of Mr. Darcy.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, who seems to always find himself in romantic comedies, plays Daniel Cleaver, Bridget's deviously handsome boss at the publishing house. They engage in flirtatious e-mailing, which soon develops into a merely sexual relationship. Hugh Grant's infatuation with Bridget gives off this `too-good-to-be-true' vibe; so when Bridget's surprise visit to his house results in the discovery of another girlfriend, no jaws are dropped.<br/><br/>Unlike most romantic comedies, the love affairs of Bridget do not overwhelm the whole storyline. We see Bridget meet with her diverse and earthy group of friends quite frequently. They offer her advice; along with a generous helping of the f-word. Not to be forgotten are Bridget's affectionate-but-frank parents; played by Jim Broadbent (Moulin Rouge) and Gemma Jones (Sense & Sensibility).<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of this movie is when Daniel Cleaver and Marc Darcy throw intense punches and kicks at each other outside of Bridget's flat. What adds to this humor is the background song, `It's Raining Men'. Their fight gets so crazy that they find themselves inside of a Greek restaurant right in the middle of a birthday party. Through their panting, they sing along and immediately resume their brawl with a jump through the window. With both of these handsome men bruised and battered, lying in broken glass, Bridget is forced to choose one of them.<br/><br/>Sure, every young woman wants to watch a movie starring two handsome British men. But the reason that Bridget Jones's Diary is so remarkable is because it's not unrealistic and corny; it's simply a light-hearted, feel-good movie that will forever be one of my all-time favorites.<br/><br/>

","AS A MOVIE, BJD does yeoman's work as the standard British romantic comedy. It's not the greatest film ever made. It's not the worst. The acting is quite good on several fronts: Hugh Grant, in particular, is superb as the smarmy UberCad, Daniel Cleaver. And of course Colin Firth is, as ever, a dreamy delight as the Brit version of an Alpha Male. The plot fits together neatly, the locations are lovely, the direction is serviceable, the laughs genuine enough, the dialogue at times clever, yadda yadda yadda... And yet...<br/><br/>I'm still disappointed that the BJD film strayed so far from the book. It was like I was watching a rip-off of a book that I loved. The heroine here was a quasi-bad girl, not the flawed, awful, and yet so adorable Bridget I knew and loved. So many of the plot elements (and Bridget's reactions to/observations of them) that made the book screamingly funny are dismissed entirely. The importance of her friendships in her life--gone. The parallels to Pride and Prejudice, particularly for the book's ending--obliterated. I haven't been able to watch the movie since the first time I saw it. I just can't bring myself to do it.<br/><br/>So, on its own, the BJD film is fun and sweet, not a bad way to find some light diversion, and heaven knows any opportunity to savor the talent and beauty of Hugh Grant and Colin Firth is not to be missed. But as the adaptation of a beloved book, BJD is horrible. Simply horrible."

","""I like you very much...just the way you are""- Mark Darcy, Colin Firth<br/><br/>
I had read both books before seeing this movie, and strangely enough, I WASN'T disappointed, as is usual for book-to-movie transitions. I mean there were a few missing elements that I thought would have worked well if they hadn't been left out, but it was really good.<br/><br/>Most romantic comedies are cheesy and ""blah"". Bridget Jones's Diary, while having those cheesy moments in it, is still one of the most lovable romantic comedies out there. Renee Zellweger is fantastic at playing out the socially awkward, quirky and slightly lonely ""singleton"" who gets overwelmed by all the changes in her life, while trying to manage her weight, smoking and drinking. <br/><br/>Her two leading men both bring great prescence to the movie, Hugh Grant as the cocky,full-of-himself, two-timing boss who has a charm and appeal that sucks Bridget in to what she believes is love. He also helps to make her dislike of Mark grow, as he makes up a lie about Mark stealing his fiance, which we later find out is a total lie...<br/><br/>Then there's Colin Firth, who is just AMAZING as Mark, who almost oppositely first comes off as rude and ignorant, but is really INCREDIBLY sweet and kind hearted. There is just something about the way he stares, and the look in his eyes that makes him irresistable and he plays the part so well, I just love him. My only regret was they didn't include some of those adorable short scenes with him and Bridget in them that made it clear why he liked her so much. Anyhow, this was just a really sweet movie, that restores your faith in men, and gives you a happy feeling when you finish it. And I have a feeling even the guys won't mind this ""Chick Flick"""

","Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) is 32, overweight, working at a book publishing company, always embarrasses herself in public AND single. She decides to do something with her life, starting with keeping a diary, in which she candidly tells what she observes in her daily life. She also makes plan for herself- stop smoking, stop drinking, go to the gym, eat less, find a man...when her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) begins flirting with her, she joins the game all at once. Meanwhile, she seems always unable to avoid the annoying presence of Mark Darcy (Colin Firth), a renowned barrister who saw Bridget running around naked when she was 4 in a paddling pool- and they just hate each other. In the meantime, Bridget also has to deal with the breakdown of her parents' marriage (which is portrayed in a rather comic way).<br/><br/>Eventually, Bridget painfully realises that Daniel is nothing but a j*rk, and gradually she and Mark become more and more attracted to each other, surprisingly. They both confess to each other that they 'like' each other. Bridget ends up kind of like a modern day Cinderella.<br/><br/>'Bridget Jones's Diary' is a finely-made romantic comedy, and Renee Zellweger's English accent is quite consistent and convincing (although still not as good as Gwyneth Paltrow's), unlike some other American actors. Hugh Grant is nice playing a different (from most other characters he had played) type of role this time, and Colin Firth is simply graceful and charming as Mark Darcy. The soundtrack is fantastic, and there are many memorable scenes and quotes, among them the very sweet cooking scene and the ultra-hilarious fighting scene. This is worth watching (and even owning!) for its hilarity and sweetness. 7/10"

","Gotta love those brits!  They have a clever sense of humor, interesting expressions and curse words, they're great.  Bridget Jones is a shy, single sinner living in England.  You become her for a year as she fights off her mom's set ups, her pervert uncle and Mark Darcy who seems to be everywhere. She decides that this year she will actually follow through with her New Year's resolutions, quit smoking, drink less, get a man, on the way she learns something.  Being herself will get her all those things and more. (Including to stop indulging herself in the perverted E-mails from her boss.) Hilariously original, I almost thought Reneé was English!  Great acting from whole cast.  If you liked the movie you will probably like the book, if you've read it already, I also recommend the ""Shopaholic"" series, just like it!"

","... I liked this one. It's romantic (read unrealistic, but who wants reality?) AND funny. <br/><br/>Random thoughts and SPOILERS ...<br/><br/>I hated Renee's character in Jerry Maguire, but she's so damn likeable here. And her accent is rather good, even if she exaggerates it occasionally.<br/><br/>SO glad Hugh Grant took a temporary break from the fop roles to play Daniel. His performance is spot-on. Apparently he's more like Daniel in real life than any of the bibbling idiots he's played previously.<br/><br/>Colin Firth must be so sick of hearing the word 'Darcy'. Some people think he's a wooden actor, but he's just subtle - TOO subtle sometimes. If you watch closely, though, he can communicate a lot just with his eyes or a facial twitch, all the while retaining the same stony expression. The chemistry between Mark and Bridget is great because they're awkward and embarrassed as well as being vaguely attracted to each other.<br/><br/>I thought more scenes should have been added in the first half of the film to show exactly WHY Mark likes Bridget just as she is. I don't think they really interacted enough for him to develop said feelings.<br/><br/>
Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent were hilarious (""She's just had her ovaries done"") and it was very touching when they got back together.<br/><br/>The fight was a stroke of genius. Every female Britflick addict must have been wetting themselves at the prospects of the Grantster fighting his Firthiness. It was a great combination of action (the punching, the bin lid, the window), humour (the cake) and wimpiness (the kicking).<br/><br/>**** out of 5."

","A delightful romp through one year of a young woman clearly looking for the right man and the love she's been missing. Renee Zelleweger is terrific as Bridget and is equally complimented by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. But the whole cast works here...from Bridget's parents played by the versatile Jim Broadbent and Gemma Jones, to her supportive and somewhat dysfunctional friends, to her work colleagues. <br/><br/>In this case the American actress, Zelleweger, clearly has to prove she can perform alongside the dry wit and humor of a thoroughly wonderful British ensemble cast. Does she ever!!! I thought she should have gotten the Oscar...she was that good. Ordinarily an American actor trying to come off authentic in a British accent doesn't work very well (see Brando's Fletcher Christian/Mutiny On The Bounty-1962) but Zelleweger not only does it well she sounds downright genuine.<br/><br/>Everything about this film works and word is out that they begin a sequel in Nov.'03 to be released in 2004. Usually I cringe when sequels are made, especially when comedy is involved, but my hopes are high here.

UK women weigh in stones and pounds. Bridget is not ""138 lbs"" - Bridget is 9 stone, 12 lbs. Minor irritant - no doubt concession to Yank audience. S'pose it's too much to ask Yank audience to adapt for 135 mins).<br/><br/>cigarettes: 0  alcohol units: 0 boyfriend: 0.<br/><br/>Application to nunnery in post.<br/><br/>_________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Appears self is in unique club; able to enjoy novel upon which movie is based and captivated by celluloid version too. Key to this is recognising each as separate entities; both work in their own way. Vive la difference! No point expecting exact conversion of book to film with all scenes intact. How often Hollywood achieve this? At least this adaptation not as egregiously criminal as 1940 Pride & Prejudice movie starring Laurence Olivier, Greer Garson and incorrect century (impossible to review BJD and not mention P&P!).<br/><br/>Rom coms one of self's favourite movie genres - especially 30s/40s screwball variety (Cary Grant - ding dong!). Modern interpretations largely forgettable. Few jewels in the crown; ""Annie Hall"", ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" instantly spring to mind. Not much else. However, self will add ""BJD"" to list of fave rom coms despite fact that it's not as clever as ""Annie Hall"" nor as witty as ""Harry/Sally"" nor as inventive as ""Mary"". Reason BJD joins list is because it's a delightful, perfectly cast little movie. Leaves one warm and snugly inside unlike ""How To Lose Guy In 10 Days"" which made self empty contents of stomach into nearest toilet bowl at way-too-corny denouement.<br/><br/>BJD movie not without flaws. Firstly, bit short. Needed 15 more minutes of biting observation of desperate singletons playing and failing at dating game. Could've achieved this via extension of scenes with BJ's wacky, neurotic circle of friends (Shazza, Tom and Jude).<br/><br/>Secondly, uncomfortable with some of the physical comedy. Example: Bridget arriving at hotel with Daniel and hair resembling candy floss. Struck wrong note. Infinitely prefer subtlety of comedy of manners scenes. Example: Una and Pam's hilariously obvious matchmaking attempts via pretence of lumpy gravy. Hahahaha! Mark and Bridget send up said gravy scene as they prepare food in her kitchen. They're all too aware what Una and Pam were up to - very sweet and funny moment. Melts your heart.<br/><br/>Have read reviews where some moaned couldn't see chemistry between Bridget and Mark. Get eyes tested! 'Blue Soup' dinner party segment is clincher! Positively crackled with electricity and sexual tension! Mark's warmth and obvious attraction makes B. coy. Marked comparison to the effect Cleaver has on B.<br/><br/>Cleaver makes B. horny - Mark makes her blush. BIG difference.<br/><br/>Finally, film needed more of Colin Firth. Even if he'd filled every single frame, self would still insist on more Colin Firth (!)<br/><br/>On the plus side: performances are wonderful! Ms Zellweger very commendable as BJ. Made her far more likeable than book version. UK accent is fine but what is really nailed is demeanour of insecure, neurotic, anxious, single woman in early 30s.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant a revelation as emotional f**kwit Daniel Cleaver. So good to see him expand his range and dump the fumbling fop schtick that he's lived on since '4 Weddings'. Brings a dangerous charm to his role - easy to see why Bridget falls for him. Heck, self wouldn't say no to tumble in sack with Cleaver! And who else in world but Hugh Grant can emit stupid, emasculating phrase, ""Oh mummy!"" during shag scene and make it sound so kinkily sexy?<br/><br/>Colin Firth is one aspect of celluloid adaptation that is vastly superior to book version. Picture perfect as Darcy in any century; Firth could play Darcy as cave-dwelling, Neanderthal and still produce same swooning effect on women. Defy P&P fans not to smile when Bridget addresses Mark as ""Mr Darcy"" during interview for 'Sit Up Britain'. Too funny! So glad Firth exhibiting sense of humour about the Darcy phenomenon. Out on his own when it comes to thawing reserved, repressed characters and giving them sex appeal, warmth and a dimension we never suspected existed.<br/><br/>But way, way, way out on his own in smouldering stakes: heart-fluttering ability to look at a woman with a mixture of both desire and tenderness, lust and fondness. It's all in his eyes. Eyes like a magnet - they draw you in. Phwoar! Watch his poignant expression during boating on lake scene as Cleaver and Bridget cavort around. Says a thousand words with one yearning look.<br/><br/>Considering that Firth's part is comparatively small, makes huge impression. Perfect foil for both Cleaver and Bridget.<br/><br/>Script not as hysterically funny as first BJ book but lines like, ""You'll never get a boyfriend if you look like you've wandered out of Auschwitz"" had self rolling in aisles.<br/><br/>Overall, film has freshness that is very endearing and appealing. Perfect date-movie and fab film to instil cheer on wet, rainy, grey Sundays. Gives rest of us singletons hope that we'll find our own Mark Darcy to love us just as we are.

Anyhoo, a friend got this out on DVD and I found it fairly consistently amusing. It wasn't offensively soppy, the characters, while still pretty stereotypical if you are used to more realistic, non-mainstream cinema, were at least slightly less commonly used stereotypes and there were a fair few laughs to be had for someone who expects at least a modicum of wit and intelligence from a comedy script.<br/><br/>I can't, in general, stand Mr Grant, and Colin Firth has been so typecast of late as a terribly ""nice"" fellow without much substance; Firth played true to type - I too found myself wishing Bridget would tell him to p*** off, she was so much better than him despite her human frailties - but Hugh Grant was surprisingly not bad.

I wasn't wrong. Even for the men, this movie contains much to identify with, even with the Bridget Jones character. The whole cast is fantastic, with Hugh Grant showing that he can actually pull off a really good role. Renee Zellweger is superb in the lead, and you just can't help liking her and her embarrassing habit of putting her foot in it. There are some clever and witty one-liners and some wonderfully put together scenes, with some well-observed comedy. I whole-heartedly recommend this film, despite the over sentimental ending, it does the job and gives you that nice warm feeling at the end of it."

","Movies like this always seem to follow a set formula, and most of them star Hugh Grant!: Loveable idiosyncratic loser has a series of mishaps before finding their perfect 'dream partner' and settling down happily ever after.  Yes, I know that applies to a lot of American ones as well, but there's something so quintessentially BRITISH about it by definition, right down to the wandering American star who appears in the film apropos of nothing... All of which isn't intended to suggest that ""BJD"" is a bad film.  It's quite the opposite in fact, it's just that this particular sub-genre has been so well MINED by Brit production companies that its in danger of becoming a target for parody before too long, much as ""Scary Movie"" did with the ""Scream"" series.<br/><br/>   Honestly, if this is your sort of thing then watch it, because it's not bad at all.

"Aidan McGuinness","Null","0","0","13 November 2002"," Engaging piece of romantic fluff
","Bridget Jones works in publishing. Her mother is constantly trying to find her a man, none of which have ever worked out. She fancies her boss, despite knowing he embodies every quality in men that she despises. She starts to keep a diary of her life, and how she plans to re-organise it to achieve her goals. We get to follow her along on her journey.<br/><br/>`Bridget Jones's Diary' was far more engaging than I had expected. It's as deep as a wet piece of paper and you know how it winds up within the opening minutes. Nonetheless the characters - thinly sketched as they are - are enjoyable. Special note goes to the titular character, played wonderfully by Renee Zellweger. She effuses her character with warmth and an indescribable cuteness. You feel affection towards her and want her to succeed. She has a genial clumsiness and awkwardness that's very endearing because it grounds as being more human than a lot of other rom-com efforts - she could be one of us. Hugh Grant went against his foppish norm (as he did again successfully in `About A Boy') to play her shallow but charming boss. Gone are the stuttering mannerisms that launched Grant's career - he's playing someone far more astute and assured here and it works well (though not as well as in `About A Boy'). He's ultimately not up to too much but he's entertaining. More fun is the secondary love interest - Darcy, played by Colin Firth. There's a great air of cynical observation off of him, a nice balance to Bridget's own self. A quiet, fairly reserved man, he's got far more pride and standards than Cleaver (Grant). There's also good chemistry between all three, which helps greatly as the film becomes a love triangle. They're fleshed out by a fairly forgettable support cast, with only Bridget's heart-broken father (played by the excellent Jim Broadbent) making an impression.<br/><br/>The script is quite witty and funnier than I would have expected. Naturally it's often from character observation but there's a nice dash of physical humour there. Watching Bridget and Darcy make the most inappropriate choice of comments this side of the BBC's `The Office' is a lot of fun. Sharon Maguire, in the directing seat, adds a few nice touches, such as the onscreen appearance of extracts of Bridget's diary. They all help add to the warmth. The locations, set designs, naturally reflect their characters well, if a little simplistically (clean cut designs for shallow Cleaver, disorderly haphazard for Bridget, etc.). The pacing is spot on so you're never bored, even as you await the inevitable. I'm not sure if it would stand up to repeated viewings but it certainly would point me to seeing the sequel and recommend it as one of the finest examples of the (typically woeful) rom/com genres. It's no `Amelie' but it could be the next best thing in recent years. 7.0/10."

"jangu","8","0","0","8 November 2002"," Almost perfect comedy and really heart warming
","Surely, there is a Bridget Jones in all of us! At least I can certainly recognize myself in a lot of the things she says, thinks and does. This movie manages to be heart warming without getting too sugary and still it doesn't lack guts! We have love, hate, disappointment, excitement and a fist-fight. There are some scenes that are absolutely hilarious (like Zellwegers tv-debut in a fire station and the ""Tarts & vicars party"") and others that are touching or heartbreaking (look at Zellweger's face when she finds another woman in Hugh Grant's bathroom). Every member in the cast is perfect. Grant plays a manipulative yet very charming creep, and does it well. It's a long way from ""Four weddings..."" where he was the one who had a sort of Bridget Jones-character to play. You DO however understand why Bridget is attracted to him. Colin Firth is the straight-laced lawyer who develops a crush for Bridget early on (if not at first), but have great difficulties to express his feelings. A character like his isn't easy to put across and might become a bore in the wrong hands. It is a great strength of Mr Firth that he conveys a sort of boyish awkwardness and lack of confidence instead of inducing yawns. Smaller parts are equally well cast with a few stand-outs, like Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent as her parents and James Callis as her gay friend. But finally there is Zellweger and she is perfect in her part! Absolutely amazing performance. You root for her all the way because you always feel she is so HUMAN. She makes foolish mistakes and put her foot in her mouth on quite a few occasions, but who hasn't? She is sweet, funny and a fighter. And she is in every single scene in the movie(except for a few funny ones during the end-credits) and yet I didn't spot a single false note in her performance. Academy-award stuff, really! If the movie has one small fault it is that a few scenes tend to drag a bit and are not as funny as they could have been. I also think that too many of the minor characters were reduced to clichés, but i have to admit that I probably wouldn't have laughed as much if it had been otherwise. All in all, a treat!"

","I recently brought the video wondering whether I was going to like it seeing as I don't usually like ""Rom-coms"" however I laughed all the way through. Renee is great as Bridget the ultimate singleton, she plays Bridget in a very likeable and realistic way. The other performances are good but you can't help but feel that some need more experience playing different sorts of characters as apposed to just the one all the time. Although it is obvious that it is loosely based on P+P the story is changed so that it is modern and you can identify more fully with the heroine who is more open than Lizzy in P+P. The film is very loosely based on the novel but instances re: tarts and vicars etc remain as well as new laughs. Okay so yes I am a girl as many will wonder before writing this off as a ""chick-flick"" but you don't need to be a girl to enjoy this, just your sense of humour."

","This is the kind of movie you can watch a hundred times and never, ever get tired of. So it's not a very original story but it is refreshing in its hilarity and a good soppy romance is always worth watching especially when it features the awfully handsome and awfully British Colin Firth.<br/><br/>For anyone who doesn't know, 'Bridget Jones' is a modern take on Jane Austen's classic 'Pride And Prejudice' and like its predecessor, it has become a classic in its own right.<br/><br/>Renee Zellwegger is perfect as Bridget, the single thirty-something who finds it hard to find a good man and even harder to give up the booze and drop those extra pounds. Her English accent is also spot on.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant as bad boy Daniel Cleaver is absolutely fantastic. Grant has managed to recreate himself with astonishing success with this charming, witty and very sexy character. Who would have thought Hugh Grant could play sexy but he does it here so well.<br/><br/>Because this is a remake of 'Pride And Prejudice' I couldn't have imagined anyone other than Colin Firth as Mark Darcy. He played the role of Darcy in The BBC's adaptation of Jane Austen's masterpiece so well that it would be hard to accept anyone else in this role.<br/><br/>Colin Firth is Mark Darcy, there's no doubt about that. He makes it look so easy, it's as if he's not acting at all. He's also extremely sexy without even trying to be. It's also great that he doesn't mind poking fun at his earlier work. After playing Darcy in 'Pride And Prejudice' he might have turned down this role but he didn't, thank Heaven!<br/><br/>To all the hopeless romantics out there, mostly women I know, you haven't seen  romance until you see this film. Definitely worth watching for the hilarity but more importantly for the incredibly gorgeous Colin, not to mention the best kiss I've ever seen!"

Maybe I would have enjoyed myaself more, if there hadn't been two girls sitting beside me, close to a nervous breakdown each time Hugh Grant appeared on the screen. The most stunning effort is of course Renee Zellweger's courage to completely destroy her outward appearance and look like the `average woman' instead of a sexy super-model (I suppose, that was the idea). Hugh Grant, like him or not, has great fun in the part of the macho guy. And Colin Firth does a good job as a phlegmatic cynic, though I am not sure whether I wanted Bridget to decide for him rather than for Hugh Grant.<br/><br/>The problem of the film is that while it is some kind of ironic response to romantic comedies, it turns out to be nothing else after some time. The ending is terrribly happy and conventional. But if you rent the film, don't turn off during the end credits! You would miss the very best joke of the whole film (`My name is Ellen.')!"

","Before seeing the movie, I read Helen Fielding's book, which was, I think, one of the best books I've ever read, so I had high expectations for the movie. I was disappointed by how much of the book was not in the movie, but all of the best parts were. I was disappointed by the fact that most of the plot with Mrs. Jones and Julian was cut out and that Jim Broadbent was not given much screen time. I was especially impressed by Zellweger's and Grant's performances and had no idea until after I saw the movie that Zellweger wasn't British. Bridget Jone's was a very sincere character that I could relate to easily, and I thought the movie was funny despite what some people say. I was particularily glad that the Tarts and Vicars scene from the book was in the movie--that was, in my opinion, the best part. All in all, I loved this movie. I'd give it four stars."
"pessimistic_girl","7","0","0","20 July 2002"," Nothing like the book, for better and worse...
","I think I'll start by saying that I am not a fan of the book, which I found rather childish and pointless. Therefor I had no higher expectations when I went to see the movie. But fortunately I was proved wrong, I think I can honestly say that apart from the names Bridget Jones's Diary (the movie) is nothing like Bridget Jones's Diary the book. And in my case that was a good thing... for a while.<br/><br/>Strangely no matter how dull the book is I get slightly ticked off if the movie doesn't follow it. And in Bridget Jones's Diary there are very few elements that resemble the book. On the upside, the movie runs smoothly and all parts are equally entertaining (for the most part). On the downside the movie is such a far cry from the book that I wouldn't recognize them if they didn't share the same name.<br/><br/>So for the acting; Hugh Grant is great, and a lot less annoying than usual. Colin Firth was way too dry for my taste but I guess that's how Marc Darcy is. Renee Zellwegger did have me impressed, especially with the accent, I saw her in Jerry Maguire a few weeks ago and was stunned at how different she sounded and looked. Bridget's friends are fine, although you see VERY little of them.<br/><br/>But honestly my main problem with this movie is that Bridget (and Renee Zellwegger) are NOT overweight. According to the BMI calculator 136 lbs on a 5,5 foot frame is HEALTHY! Bridget's BMI would be 22.6, that's normal. Over 25 is overweight. It's really sad the way Hollywood (and other parts of entertainment) makes 136 lbs out to be overweight.<br/><br/>I guess I'd give it (with the cut scenes that were hilarious): 7Â½/10"

","Although many people might not realise it, ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" is actually based on ""Pride and Prejudice."" The similarities between the characters are eerie and even the famous line ""It it a truth universally acknowledged that..."" is used.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger does an excellent job as portraying the insecure and lonely Bridget Jones, who after spending a New Years eve, alone and drunk ""with her head in a toilet"", decides to start a diary which contains her hopes in life. The diary is created with the intention of keeping her inline with her wants in life. To lost weight, drink less, smoke less and not get involved with men that aren't good for her. Ofcourse Daniel Cleaver, Bridget's boss, embodies all these elements. Ofcourse previous to that, her mother introduces her to an old friend, Mark Darcy played by Colin Firth. It is no coincidence that he was cast in this role as he played Mr. Darcy in the BBC's miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"". As fate would have it, Darcy and Cleaver have a history together, however it is best to watch the film, as not to give away Bridget's reason for hating Darcy.<br/><br/>Bridget embodies women's insecurities about weight and body image, lonliness and finding someone to love you exactly ""as you are."" She isn't the perfect woman with a great career, family and body. She's chubby, slept with her boss and must find a new job, clumsy as hell, can't cook and has embarassments (especially with a firepole). But overall, she's a lot of laughs and has the great humor of all; can laugh at herself.<br/><br/>Bridget Jones' Diary is a great and realistic movie and I can't wait until the sequal comes out."

","I really enjoy this movie.  We first see 32 year old Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger)at her mother's annual turkey curry buffet.  We see some of the main people in her life, her parents, her ""uncle"" Jeffrey (How many of us have had an ""uncle Jeffrey in our lives that we've had to endure, because it's just ""harmless fun"", raise your hand), and Mark Darcy (played by Colin Firth), a divorced lawyer who his and Bridget's parents are trying to get together.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, their first meeting gets off on the wrong foot, and Bridget spends that night drinking herself silly, alone in her apartment, listening and air-voicing to ""All by Myself"".  However, she decides to keep a diary. In her first entry she resolves to find a good man, and avoid her attractive boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant).<br/><br/>However, he starts making suggestive sexual innuendos to her, and, enjoying the attention, she starts dressing in a miniskirt and see-through top, and passing silly, flirtatious e-mails back and forth. She seeks advice from her 3 best friends on how to handle this. This sequence events leads to a purely sexual relationship between Daniel and Bridget, although Bridget is a bit too naive and insecure to really see this.<br/><br/>We learn that Daniel and Mark are archenemies due to some events in the past which led to Mark's wife leaving him.  Also, because Mark and Bridget often travel in the same circles, we do learn that Mark's opinion of Bridget has quickly changed.  From the look on his face, it's easy to see that he now likes her (Hmmm shades of Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice)<br/><br/>Anyay, Bridget eventually catches Daniel with another woman, and once again she is alone, and decides to seek another job as a television reporter. Mark rescues Bridget from being canned from her job, by allowing her an interview with people he was defending in a high profile case.  After this Bridget tries to cook a dinner for her 3 best friends and Mark shows up and is able to show his feelings for her.  Daniel also shows up, and he and Mark wind up in a hilarious fight sequence over Bridget.<br/><br/>While we are supposed to root for Mark to win Bridget, (I did), I was bothered by one thing.  Bridget was the one he wanted, but he was too spineless to break up his romantic involvement with Natasha, his law partner.  He even let it get to the point of the two of them becoming engaged before the predictable ending.  You could tell, everytime Natasha snapped her fingers and said ""Come on, Mark"", that he was kind of sheepishly following her.<br/><br/>I saw one review here that criticized Mark's saying ""You are a bad public speaker, you tend to run off at the mouth, but I like you just the way you are.""  I like that honesty, and I like being unafraid to let myself show to someone I like, and still have acceptance.  I'd rather have that, than someone blowing false sunshine in my face.<br/><br/>All in all, I gave the movie an 8/10, would have been a 9, had it not been for Mark's attitude of ""settling"" when he thought he couldn't have Bridget."

","I must admit I was a little apprehensive upon hearing that Renee Zellweger had been cast to play Bridget Jones, in the film version of the bitingly hysterical Helen Fielding books by the same name.  Even I, a lowly American, could sympathize with the British outcry - how could an American be cast as England's most famous thirty something singleton?  It seemed the movie would be doomed, and another adaptation from a wonderfully worthy book would be ruined.  <br/><br/>Let me put your mind at ease.....  Renee Zellweger not only adequately played Bridget Jones, she put her heart, soul, and considerable cleavage into the role.  Renee displayed guts and gusto and made this role her own. I don't think there will be many out there saying she did not portray a believable Bridget.  As for the rest of the cast, Hugh Grant was deliciously naughty as bad boy boss Daniel, and Colin Firth's piercing eyes revealed there is more to Mr. Darcy then pure stoicism.  <br/><br/>I felt the script was true to both the plot of the book and characters. Only minor modifications were made for sake of timeliness.  The laughs were non-stop, I feel I need a second viewing, I'm sure I missed several good one-liners while laughing at a previous line.  Especially funny were the birthday party scenes, and the subsequent street brawl that ensued.  There's nothing like seeing a couple of British guys engage in a knockdown drag out barefisted fight in the middle of the street.  Oh - if only I were Bridget ! Two handsome guys fighting over her, I guess life for Bridget Jones isn't that bad after all."

","I have never read the book that this film is adapted from but if it's as good as the film I'd rush out and buy it. I was wary of seeing this film to begin with because of all the hype prior to its release. I thought that (as has happened with many other films in the past) it would not live up to expectations.   The first thing that put me off watching was the choice of Texan Renee Zellweger to portray the very British Bridget. I thought the film would be ruined by another American actor failing miserably at attempting the British accent, however I was wrong. She sounded totally authentic. Also her acting was fantastic as a desperate, lonely thirty-something single woman. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were also brilliant.  It's great to see Hugh Grant in a change of character. It shows what a talented actor he is, easily making the transition from his usual role of nice guy to the smug womaniser he plays in this. What I loved though was how realistic it was. I'm sure many women cringed as they saw something embarrassing happen to Bridget and remember when they were in a similar situation.   Usually while watching so called 'chick flicks' you hear a great response from the women in the audience but the men look half asleep. This was not the case as I watched this film.

Perhaps, were I not British I would not be aware of this.

","There is a telling scene in 'Bridget Jones' Diary', when the heroine's errant mother comes home to a husband dazed and directionless having been abandoned.  Colin Jones has been set up as a model of dull decency on a par with Mark Darcy, and suggestive of why Bridget should prefer the latter's dogged solidity to Daniel Cleaver's caddish, fun, sexually explosive flibbertigibbet.  Mum begs Dad to take her back, apologising for what she has done.  Colin pauses and says he's not sure.  Mum bursts into tears, before Colin laughs, hugs her and says he was only joking.  good old dad. <br/><br/>
He waited until she had debased herself as low as she could go, until she was grovelling, had ceded any power (the great lack that decided her adultery) and independence to him as he restores his self-dignity.  It doesn't matter that he has treated her as a non-person for years, never mind not condescended to conubial favours.  There is a steely cruelty in this rare gentleman, and the scene is revealing about why Bridget has ended up as she has; what she wants; and a possible fate in store for her if she chooses Mark.<br/><br/>people have complained that a film of this title has largely forsaken the diary format.  This is not just a tired question of fidelity to text - by writing her life, Bridget takes control, shapes and interprets a seemingly chaotic, random, and failed existence.  In a film where she is an objective player, if still the main one, she is likely to lose even this mediating power.  <br/><br/>But the film we have here is not an 'objective', third-person story about a woman called Bridget Jones.  Everything in the film is filtered through her subjectivity - every pleasure and humiliation made to seem better or worse that it is because SHE experiences it.  In this way traumas like Salman Rushdie's ordeal, the racist treatment of refugees in Britain etc. all become reflections of Bridget's ego.  <br/><br/>Cleverly, the film inverts the traditional male focus of Hollywood narrative.  Normally it is the man who is given the choice between two types of women, the 'bad', sexually active one, and the good, more 'spiritual' one.  Here it is the men who are types - and reduced to their types so they seem caricatures - and Bridget's sensibility  which is whole and coherent. <br/><br/>
Traditionally it is the male who seeks a good woman who will take him in hand, in effect mother him; as I have suggested, Bridget's uselessness at 'traditional' 'feminine' tasks (cooking etc.) means she needs a father figure; similarly, it is she who forces the resolution, who chases the love object, not the man.  Just as Bridget in the book fixes a messy life, so it sit the film heroine's desires and goals that shape hers.<br/><br/>Ideological qualms aside (can't we see other Britains on film? etc.), 'Diary' is rather fun.  Quite why any woman would want to exchange a funny, charming, articulate rascal for a mumbling plank I don't know, but I am assured by friends that I am wrong, and that Colin Firth is swoonsome.  If you're looking for cinematic ingenuity, thematic density, an original story, or visual pleasure look elsewhere (Edward Yang, for instance...); if you want an amiable, undemanding film that passes the time, with cosy jokes and an excellent street brawl (loved it when caddish Cleaver fights back with a bin lid), than here you are.  Renee Zellweger is, for once, hugely sympathetic, not just for being winningly game - complaints about being too 'posh' miss the crucial point that she is only posh in public situations, as befits a work based on Jane Austen."

Two gorgeous men vie for the love of our hapless heroine -- how's that for a female fantasy flick?  They even duke it out for her -- how's that for trite?  The Darcy relationship relies on a sequence of annoying-to-watch misunderstandings so protracted one wants to fling one's buttered popcorn at the screen.  <br/><br/>On the plus side, a sexy plump heroine on the screen is long overdue.  With her spilling brassieres and full thighs, Renee looks luscious.  Her ditsy sincerity is charming, though one wishes she didn't have to be so stupid sometimes; at one point, she demonstrates a total ignorance of some big-deal front-page trial in which her would-be boyfriend is a key player! <br/><br/>

","One of the things that make this film so appealing and so good is the superb casting of absolutely everyone.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger is simply marvelous as the slightly daft Bridget Jones  unsure of who she is, whom she wants to be with, what she wants and how to go about getting it.  The character of Bridget is a bit of storm-tossed flotsam on the sea of life  going where the wind and waves take her and only occasionally taking charge of her own life.<br/><br/>Colin Firth  Mr. Darcy in this film and in `Pride and Prejudice'  is dark, brooding and enigmatic: he seems as unsure of what he wants and whom he wants to be with as poor Bridget does.  He underplays his character; and his performance is all the richer for it.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant is sublimely smarmy as Daniel Cleaver.  I understand how a woman could fall for such a jerk but you want desperately for them not to.<br/><br/>The sound track is great: lots of old songs that evoke the mood and feeling that the film is trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Though there is little overt nudity this film is rated `R' for language and sexuality.  I saw this film at a large metroplex theater and the girls in line in front of me bought tickets for a `G' rated film but after the obligatory stop at the concession counter made a beeline for ""Bridget.""  I don't think they were warped for life  but I have never heard the `F' word used more in any film.<br/><br/>This is a wonderful example of a plot and story driven film.  No big splashy special effects just a story of a young woman's journey of self-discovery. I highly recommend it."

","I can't believe most of the comments here, which generally seem to suggest that this film is a decent attempt at filming a brilliant book. It is a travesty. It is a typical Richard Curtis affair, filming by numbers (all that was missing was the disabled character). All his films are like overly sweet chocolate - delicious at the first bite, then afterwards you feel really nauseaous. So what is wrong with it? Bridget the book is great satire. Here, the satire loses all bite. Bridget the girl is not a sad, lonely muppet. The whole point of the book is that she has a fab life, and still feels inadequate (see an interview with Fielding in a copy of 20 ans magazine if you don't believe me). Bridget is supported by wonderful friends, who are entirely neglected in this film, with not one 'emergency summit' at cafe rouge convened. They also did all those stupid , pointless, irritating things films of books always do: Mark Darcy's Mum's name is changed from Elaine to Geraldine. Why? Daniel's other woman's name is changed from Sukie to Lara. Why? Magda goes from being a supportive friend even tho she has defected to the world of smug marrieds to another of their number. Why? Because Richard Curtis is so in love with his own writing he doesn't know when to leave well alone? I really went with an open mind to this film - and usually I adore Renee Zellweger. Here, all I got was a load of tosh. yes, Colin Firth mumbled quite admirably and looked embarrassed at the right moments. Hugh Grant has at last got rid of his floppy fringe and posh bloke stutter. But what a shambles (and it's cinematically bad too, with embarrassingly obvious slow mos whenever Maguire wants you to feel sad). Save your money and buy another bottle of Chardonnay instead.

It does prove to be a departure from the novel, but I feel it stays true to what BJD is all about.<br/><br/>Zellweger, Grant, and Firth were phenomenal...they embodied their characters, really making them come to life. I was impressed with Zellweger's accent...I would have never guessed that she was a Texan. Her comedic timing was impeccable, adding to the believability of Ms. Jones. :) Bridget has got to be one of the most truly accessible heroines out there...she's flawed, but that doesn't matter. Her humanity is what makes her great.<br/><br/>Colin Firth was fantastic. He really made the audience believe that a stuffed shirt like Mark Darcy could really fall in love with a quirky girl like Bridget. Considering that Helen Fielding has often commented that her inspiration for Mark Darcy was Firth's portrayal of Mr. Darcy in A&E's Pride and Prejudice (1995), it's no wonder that I couldn't imagine another actor in that role. <br/><br/>Austen fans, be sure to watch for the parallels between BJD and P&P...even some of the camera angles in Bridget Jones Diary echo scenes in the Pride & Prejudice mini-series.<br/><br/>I know this has already been said in other reviews, but it's so true...the audience was laughing so hard during the movie that I did miss occasional bits of dialogue. Bottom line, this is a witty film, with great dialogue, and a nice message...you don't need to a be a supermodel to find love...there can be someone out there who'll like you just the way you are."

","This film has many hilarious moments and Colin Firth still makes my knees weak, but what's all the fuzz about this story? It's a modern version of P & P sans the more intellectual Elizabeth. <br/><br/>Instead, we have a 30 something woman who can't control her weight, drinking, smoking or doesn't seem to have any talents except being ""good-hearted"". Her one break in career came from her association with Darcy. This woman is reportedly a heroine in UK? I found her a complete anti-feminist model. Is that the point of the story? The heroine for the new millennium should be like the one for the last, sweet, a bit cheeky, a bit plum, vulnerable and thus, needs a strong man like Darcy. All the intellectual career women in the film are portrayed as cold and calculating in order to contrast Bridget's sweetness, clumsiness and thoughtfulness. It's a enjoyable romantic comedy if I take it as a pure fairy tale. Once I think it a bit deeper, the storyline bothers me."

Yes, I'd been a fan of the original column series in the Independent newspaper but if I had any pre-conceptions of how Bridget would look or sound it mattered little as Renee Zellweger fitted the bill exactly. With that simultaneous air of vulnerability and confusion over her destiny , Bridget stumbles from crisis to climax  ( sorry ) , supported by  cadish Hugh Grant and detached Colin Firth.

But before you turn around and stop reading,thinking shes just 13, what does she know,please just listen to my comment. I thought that the Bridget Jones movie was v.good. Renée Zellweger was excellent as Bridget,her accent,if maybe rather posh, was otherwise flawless and her performance was v. good. This is not one of those deep and meaningful movies that win 300 Oscars but it is pretty darn good and if there was a category at the Oscars for funniest romantic comedy, this would win hands down. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth both show that they can act but Renée is the star of the show. The jokes are genuinely laugh-out-loud funny and the best bit about this movie is that there are no boring bits in between. Usually movies have a good bit then half an hour of nothing before you get to the next good bit. But not this one. No its not the best in the world and it probably wont get that Oscar. But its pretty darn good.<br/><br/>Overall rating: 9 out of 10."

I have to admit, when I first heard about who was playing Bridget I got this awful feeling. However, I'm glad I was VERY wrong. Renee is Bridget to the core; insecure, clumsy, terminally unlucky and absolutely hilarious. Colin Firth just had to be Mark Darcy and doesn't disappoint. Hugh Grant was also a brilliant (but not entirely unexpected) choice for Daniel.<br/><br/>I laughed and laughed through this film, admittedly as a hard core fan of the book I was disappointed that some of the plot of changed or was cut out completely.

","First of all, let's say that I am not the biggest Renee Zellweger fan, but she did a fantastic job in this movie.  It's not every actress that would gain roughly 25 pounds for a part.  Some of her facial expressions are priceless.  I went in  with the expectation that this would be more of a chick-flick than anything else, but it was actually a rather hilarious comedy.  I mean, I was laughing out loud at some points.  My friend and I were quoting lines all the way out of the theater.  Bridget is sort of a modern-day everywoman that anyone (women/men) can relate to on some level. Maybe you can relate to her loneliness, her disdain for her job, her astute commentaries on her life.  But largely, most people will relate to the comedy and the humor that can be found in life.  I really enjoyed this film and will probably tape it when it comes to cable."

Firth and Grant put in v. good performances as Darcy and Cleaver as they are both amusing and suave in their roles.

"Swangirl","Null","0","0","16 April 2001"," An all-too real reflection of single life
","Having read the book (well, parts of it), I knew they wouldn't be able to cram all of it into a movie. Considering what parts they did use, I'm very pleased with what Andrew Davies and the gang came up with.<br/><br/>The Brits might quibble about Rene (Bridget) Zellwegger's accent but I think this talented actress does a pretty good job. Her spunk is also contagious. She may not possess the British ""reserve"" but then she wouldn't be fun to watch if she did. Grant and Firth provide enough of that.<br/><br/>
I think this is one of the first movies I've seen that actually gave us a glimpse of what a REAL single woman goes through. Zellwegger's lip-synching solo at the beginning is classic singleton. And the underwear contemplation is also classic. For those of us who don't resemble sticks like Julia Roberts and Cameron Diaz, this was very refreshing. Zellwegger's ""pizza and Guiness"" diet gave her a figure that probably 75 percent of us really have. THANK YOU!<br/><br/>Bridget's interaction with her parents is also quite touching. And the dinner party in which everyone asks Bridget why she's not married is another true-life moment. <br/><br/>I have to confess that my long-time fascination with Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) has now been flamed into an inferno due to this movie. Since most Americans aren't familiar with his work, I was so thrilled to see him get a chance to be funny and gorgeous at the same time. His ""stick in the mud"" attitude is dead on and I don't think anyone else could have done it justice. And yet he leaves the door open a crack to show us there's a real guy under the gruff exterior. The longing expression on his face as he watches Bridget horsing around with Grant while rowing on a lake is riveting. I'm so glad Andrew Davies talked him into playing a modern Darcy.<br/><br/>True, the ending is rather lame but hey, I'll take it. Kudos to the cast, including Grant's cadish portrayal, for a memorable movie."
"macpherr","10","0","0","15 April 2001"," The script is marvelous, Renée is terrific!
","This is a very refreshing movie. The script is marvelous. It is extremely well written and each line is throughly tough and extremely funny.  I usually prefer to see movies when they come out on video because there is no one talking behind me or some really tall boy who comes to sit in front of me, but I love Renée Zellweger (One True Thing, Jerry Maguire, A Price Above Rubies), who is not just a beautiful person on the outside, she is beautiful on the inside as well. She is also a very good actress. Renée  has done some heavy duty acting with actors of the caliber of Meryl Streep, William Hurt, Jim Cary, Tom Cruise, just to name a few. She is wonderful in the part of Brigitt Jones. She is Brigitt Jones!!!!!!!!!! I hope she gets a nomination for this.  They tricked me because I thought she was going to stay with ""Daniel Cleaver,"" played by Hugh Grant (Notting Hill), but she does not. I am hoping they do a sequel, because I was reading that ""Bridget Jones : The Edge of Reason,"" is even funnier than ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" I think this movie is one of the best movies I have seen lately. It is funny without being canned. I think that Colin Firth (Shakespeare in Love) ,  Hugh Grant, all did a great job, specially Renée Zellweger's accent. There is a possibility that she learned British English at  home because both of her parents were born in Europe, and Europeans tend to have a British accent not and American accent in English. She also spent sometime in England studying the part. Favorites Scenes: Opening Scenes when Bridget  is singing along with a record. The fire station scene. Sending e-mail to Daniel Cleaver without showing any facial expression. Picking up which undies to wear. The whole movie is hilarious. Favorite Line so far: "" everyone knows that dating in the thirties is not the happy lucky free-for-all it was when you were twenty-two..."" I like Brigit's self-deprecating sense of humor."

","I'm an action movie guy. I like it when stuff blows up. So it's awkward for me to rent movies with my SO, who likes dramas. We often choose a comedy / romance, and some are pretty bad. Fortunately, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the best of the lot, along with ""High Fidelity"", and best of all in a refreshing break from tradition, it comes with a female protagonist. Hey, I'm a guy, and even I get tired of every damn movie starring a male in the primary role, even the romantic comedies, which cater of course to an audience of women.<br/><br/>The film is genuinely hilarious and quite original, unlike the generic films ""Serendipity"" and ""Pretty Woman"". And like ""High Fidelity"", it has something real to say about life without being so arty that the pace drags or only a film school type could appreciate it. In fact, apparently it's based on the classic book ""Pride and Prejudice"", but the deep thinking remains while the hard-to-identify-with British Victorian stuff is all gone, replaced with the hip modern stuff you'd see in ""Sex and the City"".<br/><br/>The acting is good, and since I liked this film even better than ""Jerry Maguire"", I'm really starting to respect Renee Zellweger, who got an Academy Award nomination for her role.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- romance types: a must-see<br/><br/>-- comedy-lovers: dare this one even if romances scare you<br/><br/>-- women in their 30s thinking way too much about dating<br/><br/>I'll give ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" a 10 out of 10."

","First, the good things: the funny scenes really are funny, Renée Zellweger is radiant and her English accent is as good as any I have ever heard from an American actor, her list-making and urge to self-improvement almost made me cringe with recognition, Colin Firth is fine (though not as overwhelmingly perfect as some people seem to think!), Hugh Grant is good as the cad, and I wish we could see more of Bridget's ""urban family"", à la ""Notting Hill"". Now the bad things: I haven't read the book, but is this really how far we have come?  Nothing else in life matters if you haven't got a man?  Also, at Bridget's publishing house, dealing with routine sexual harrassment is obviously still a matter of ""grin and pretend it's not happening"".  I just finished watching this movie and ""Someone Like You"" with Ashley Judd, back to back, so the next item struck me especially forcibly: I heard several times how Zellweger gained *twenty pounds!!!* for this film, and a constant theme is how Bridget needs to lose weight.  Also, one reviewer talked about how no rich, uppercrust lawyer like Mark Darcy would realistically be interested in a plain, somewhat overweight woman like Bridget.  HAVE WE ALL LOST OUR COLLECTIVE MINDS?  Renée Zellweger is gorgeous, and the world is full of women who would kill to have her figure just the way it is in this movie!  What she has is the body of a woman rather than a teenaged boy (which, despite her charm and wonderful smile, is just what Ashley Judd has).  Has our mass media brainwashing really gone so far that Ashley Judd is considered to have the perfect body, while Renée Zellweger is considered overweight, and plain to boot?  By the way, did anyone else notice that Zellweger seems to spend half the movie half-dressed (and I'm not even talking about the so-called ""sexy"" outfits she wears to the office to seduce her boss).  In the final scene where she runs out into the snow after her man, does she not hang her winter coat by the door like most people?  If a male actor consistently showed as much skin as she does throughout this film, there would be comments from all sides, but since she's a woman, it's all right.  Two more things: everybody in the movie smokes all the time, another throwback to an era I thought we had outgrown, and there are a lot of obscenities, which I personally didn't enjoy, and took away from my pleasure in the story."

","Bridget Jones' Diary  was a huge surprise, but not in the way that I hoped.  The buzz  was that this was a terrific movie.  I was looking forward to seeing a funny, charming, illuminating, character-driven movie featuring one of the more talented actresses working today, Renee Zelllweger (One True Thing, Whole Wide World, etc).   So last night I settled down in front of the home theater with my sweetie, dimmed the lights and loaded the DVD.   To our great disappointment, this film failed to deliver  the goods in a number of respects, but especially in terms of character and story development.  Bridget is not just  pitiful and hapless  for a minute for comic effect  -- she is hopelessly helpless throughout.  She is ultimately not not only a spectator to her own life, but a mute and uncomprehending one.   Because she learns nothing about herself and her world, neither do we.  Bridget's lack of self-discovery  is especially curious and disappointing because this is  something that a 'diary'  film might have been minimally expected to explore  successfully.   My wife' s comment was "" I couldn't imagine ANYONE being THAT stupid!""   The other major failing of the film is that  the dramatic events of the story are just too simplistic and even more implausible as they conspire  so conspicuously and predictably to deliver the requisite happy ending.   Bridget may have been happy, but we were not.  We hoped for something more thoughtful and revelatory.  Grade: C+, due to poor writing and direction."

Hugh Grant, for once, gets to play a sleazy, womanizing, villainous character and it was a nice change of pace.

There are a lot of big laughs, and the film has a great message about accepting others for who they are, Bridget herself being a slightly overweight woman who's overly jolly and seems to never come up with the right thing to say.

","The major chick flick of 2001! Renee Zellweger was hysterically funny as Bridget, and her more subdued moments of loneliness, self-pity, and drunkenness also spoke volumes to those of us in singledom. Classic songs ""All By Myself"", ""Without You"", ""It's Raining Men"", ""Me and Mrs. Jones"", ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough"" and ""I'm Every Woman"" are used as hysterical backdrops to crucial scenes. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are also perfectly cast as the two men in her life. It's nice to have Hugh Grant play the slimy sleazeball for once, and he's sure more believable here than in Sense and Sensibility! I loved the change in Firth's character, and I especially loved the light in his eyes and his shyness and warmth take the forefront. The last half hour may be predictable, but the slowly growing development of true love hasn't been as well done in a film I've seen since While You Were Sleeping. It's rare that an actress comes along that can handle goofy comedy OR wrenching drama. Renee Zellweger can do both. It's a testament to her that this movie worked as well as it did. Good job!"

","I love this movie.  I can see myself as being Bridget Jones ten years from now if not married!!!  I absolutely love Colin Firth in the film.  He is such a great actor and handsome.  He's has such a wide range of acting ability from Simon Westwood(Circle of Friends) to Mr. Darcy(Pride and Prejudice).  I recommend this movie to anyone who has ever daydreamed about someone you thought was unattainable."

","Any Jane Austen fans out there who adored the A&E mini series of the great book ""Pride and Prejudice"" will adore Bridget Jones' Diary.  Although Renee Zellweger's accent leaves something to be desired in places, she does a decent job of portraying a Brit.  But, then, what can you expect? Honestly. Colin Firth (Mark Darcy) is, as usual, stunning in this movie.  He does a phenomenal job of taking Mr. Darcy out of the Jane Austen movie and snapping him forward almost two hundred years and making it realistic.  Granted, a lot of this is credit to the author of the book (and the screenwriters), but he really does a smashing job and it does help that he was in that original great production of ""Pride and Prejudice"".  Again, for any Jane Austen fans, you will greatly appreciate the wealth of random ""Jane Austen movie"" characters from other adaptations of her books: Gemma Jones, James Faulkner, Jim Broadbent, Embedth Davidtz, Hugh Grant (of course), and Colin Firth (of course)!  It's a great plug for the origination of this storyline.  And it really is a great modern adaptation of Jane Austen.  Not quite as inventive as ""Clueless"", but great nonetheless.  Props to Helen Fielding for her great novel, and as well to the screenwriters.  This is a movie I would recommend to almost anyone.  Although, I have heard the criticism that the female character is whiny and unintelligent and on a completely lower eschelon than Mark Darcy (from a man, of course), I would definitely say this is a movie for the woman who has always wanted that one unattainable man--as well as a movie for those who believe in true love and that it truly does conquer all...even drunken stupidity, clumsiness, and outright moronic behavior. This movie proves that attraction and connection honestly are the two most important things when it comes to how we choose a life-partner...and that they're not exactly something we can control..."

","""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is the story of how a young woman fouls up every aspect of her life -- sometimes by trying too hard, and sometimes by not trying at all.  When she does finally get on the right track and the pieces of her ""life puzzle"" seem to come together, she almost messes that up too. It is certainly not a new story, by any means.  It's just another way of telling the ageless tale of how people are always their own worst enemy. We usually solve and resolve our individual, psycho-social problems by getting out of our own way!<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger, as Bridget Jones, does a terrific job of portraying her character.  She has done so in other movies (""Jerry Maguire,"" ""Nurse Betty"" etc.), but this time with the added challenge of the British accent and the quirky way in which the English say things.  I found myself making heavy use of the rewind and pause buttons on the remote control, in order to fully understand what these actors were saying.<br/><br/>""Bridget Jones's Diary"" deserves a double thumbs up.  It is a very good adult comedy, with just the right amount of pathos without becoming syrupy sweet.  Besides Zellweger, Hugh Grant, Colin Firth and other supporting actors do a fine job.  There is nothing to rave about here, because most parts, aside from the Bridget Jones character, are relatively low-key. It's not the first time an actor's performance has risen above the material. So don't take this movie too seriously, just watch and enjoy it for what it is."

","I watched this COMEDY without laughing once. And most of the people in the cinema weren't exactly off their seats. Either they were laughing internally or just didn't find it funny. The latter is more than likely.<br/><br/>
I thought Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant were good but the script was predictable and boring.<br/><br/>The jokes were forced.<br/><br/>Co-writer Richard Curtis is good when partnered with Ben Elton, who is a solid joke writer but (with the exception of FOUR WEDDINGS) he has failed to impress me.<br/><br/>Interestingly enough, Ben Elton's big screen mission, MAYBE BABY was pretty average.<br/><br/>I suggest the two embark on a big screen project together.

","Not having read the BJD books I went to this movie based solely on the TV trailers.  It was such a wonderful film.  Kudos to Rene Zellweger for having the courage to gain 20 pounds in order to do the role.  Bridget would not have been the same had she been a stick thin hollywood type and no amount of makeup or special effects could make those adorably chubby cheeks (both kinds!)  Rene's british accent was right on.  Hugh Grant was excellently cast as her smarmy boss and a svelte looking Colin Firth again played ""Mr. Darcy"" with just the right amount of disdain and pathos.

"nicenin","Null","0","0","7 February 2002"," A contradiction in itself *Spoilers*
","Lately, and I hope I am not alone in this, I have felt that I have stepped into a parallel universe, one in which I am isolated, out of step with all people and places around me, and in which I start to doubt my very existence as a human being.  Rather like the plot of a Robert Zemeckis movie, you might say.<br/><br/>It is from that state of mind that I commence my review of ""Bridget Jones's Diary"".  Judging by the reviews both critical and user, and box office returns, a lot of people have liked this movie.  Why?<br/><br/>The premise of the movie and its plot is a contradiction in itself. Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) cannot get a man.  She wants one.  Life as a ""singleton"" is intolerable.  However, she actually can get a man, by commencing an affair with Daniel (Mr. Divine himself, Hugh Grant). Nonetheless, he is simultaneously cheating on Renee - oops, sorry, Bridget - with Lara (Lisa B in the film's only half-decent performance).<br/><br/>
Alongside this affair, she is pursued by the supposedly hunky lawyer Mark Darcy (Colin Firth in a walking woodplank performance that makes Freddie Prinze Jr. look like Gary Oldman).  In a hoky plot device (done to good effect in the recent 'Serendipity') Darcy miraculously starts appearing everywhere Bridget goes, although he also is simultaneously seeing the bitchy and interesting Natasha (Embeth Davidtz).  Now, sorry to be personal, but I myself am a lawyer, and have met many walking woodplanks in my time, and I can assure you that not one of them would even be remotely interested in BJ when a toffee nosed richbitch such as Natasha is available.  Trust me - they just wouldn't.  And herein lies the film's dilemma.  It is so afraid of facing the horrible universal truth that good looking men, whether vacant or intelligent, just aren't interested in overweight, plain, cash strapped women.  And so the script abandons its interesting premise and narrative coherence goes straight out the window, culminating in a hideously ridiculous punchup between Daniel and Darcy in the street over Bridget. All to the rousing strains of Geri Halliwell.<br/><br/>However, the script also fails to recognise another universal truth that women have kept secret for centuries, and would have turned this into a decent film had the script had the wit and the balls to incorporate it. That is, discerning women know that less physically attractive men make the best lovers.  So, 'Bridget Jones's Diary' could have been infinitely more interesting, romantic and truthful had the filmmakers introduce a character actor such as Paul Sorvino or James Gandolfini, have Bridget give up on the pretty boys, and have the happy couple engage in the hottest, most intense and mindblowing sex ever until the end of time.<br/><br/>Gandolfini and Zellweger getting it on?  Now THAT'S a movie I'd pay in to see."

","I watched this movie unwillingly--a friend encouraged me to see it, since I thought it was just going to be a sex-diary sort of movie. As a fan of Zellweger's from ""Nurse Betty,"" I really enjoyed seeing her in this film. She looked like a ""normal"" woman, and the humor was wonderfully down-to-earth. I've never been a fan of Grant's, but I was happy to finally seeing him playing the greasy playboy I've always thought he was, and happy that he DIDN'T get the girl! (Drove me nuts that he kept playing stuttering nice guys in all these period movies, getting all dressed up and looking innocently lost. Gag.) But the guy who DID get the girl... ""Ummm,"" I thought (since I was unable to really get out a coherent thought :), ""Who IS this guy?!"" He gets the girl in this movie opposite two well-known movie stars, and I've never heard of him before!? So I wandered over to the IMDb and discovered Colin Firth (and ""Pride and Prejudice""! WATCH THIS MOVIE!! :), and have never been the same since. :) People wrote articles asking the question: ""Grant or Firth?"" and I snort. Firth, of course. Hands-down. No competition, and there never was. Grant is just an overly-confident British guy with a posh accent. Firth...is worth admiring. The final sequence of the film with him in that great coat and turtleneck and look oh so...um... Anyway, that whole sequence makes up for all of the grating you have to endure for Bridget's sake to get through the Grant parts to the really good parts at the end of film, when Grant's character is finally out of the picture.<br/><br/>In any case, all three actors (and the supporting cast) do a really wonderful job with this movie. You will laugh--guys AND girls--and not mind watching it again. I've never before seen a fight scene like the one this movie has. <br/><br/>Downsides: a lot of obscenities. Otherwise, though, this is a really fun movie. And you have to appreciate the whole ""Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy"" background to understand how truly ironic and wickedly funny this movie actually is. There is a whole subculture in the female English-speaking world surrounding Mr. Firth, and this film capitalizes (and is actually partially based on) this subculture. Bridget Jones is the embodiment of 30-something unmarried females who love watching ""Pride and Prejudice."" :) Enjoy!"

","So-so rip-off of Pride and Prejudice and Emma books and movies, but this just doesn't cut it.  Gwyneth did a less self conscious British accent in Emma.  Colin looked bored and uncomfortable.  There was no chemistry between him and Renee.  Note to movie makers: nearly all chic flicks fail when there is no chemistry.  In the promo VH1 and E-Channel shows, it was clear that Renee wouldn't even look at Colin and spent all her time joking (flirting?) with Hugh.  Hmmmm -- the next mistake after Jim Carey? <br/><br/>    Anyway, why would any guy care for a chain-smoking, boozing, insecure disaster area like Bridget.  What is the lesson here? -- the sexist adage that guys are supposed to be attracted to helpless women.  I loved Renee in her previous movies, and she owns the screen no matter what the part.  The one contribution is that a woman actor can actually perform at a normal weight.

","I sat down to watch this film certain that it would be a horrid compromise of British humour and US influenced shmaltz.  The casting of Renne Zellweger over the likes of Minnie Driver aggravated me.  There's just no *need* for it.  And the news that Renee had the same voice coach as Gwyneth Paltrow filled me with horror.  Paltrow's English accent is very credible Standard English.  The only trouble is, nobody except newsreaders speaks Standard English.  Everyone - *everyone* - in the UK speaks a recognisable dialect.<br/><br/>And initially, Renee struck me as similar.  Her accent is Standard English, except where it verges into generic over-rounded ""posh"".  It's not a dialect, and it rings just a little false.  Oh well, I thought, here we go. At least it's not Dick Van Dyke.<br/><br/>But to my delight, five minutes into the film, I'd (nearly) gotten over it. Because Renee *is* Bridget Jones.  She looks perfect, and her mannerisms are flawless.  I was won over, and quite in love, and considering that Bridget is actually not a sympathetic character, that's quite a feat.<br/><br/>And from there it was plain sailing, because the rest of the cast acted as though the roles were written for them.  Colin Firth's role *was* written for him (in the original columns and book) in fact, and Hugh Grant's might as well have been.  The support were equally as comfortable and recognisable, with only a couple of exceptions: Cosmo, who should have been more Tim Nice-But-Dim (British reference, but it's a British film) and Julian, who, to be fair was playing one of the few characters that had been changed significantly from the book.<br/><br/>Highlights were the scenes that were recognisable re-workings of the 1995 BBC miniseries of ""Pride and Prejudice"", lowlights were the slightly kludged ending that actually veers away from the Diary (and Austin) original, and the couple of Americanised scenes.<br/><br/>All in all, a splendid adaptation and a splendid film in its own right.  The big outstanding question is: if they film the sequel, which features an interview with Colin Firth, who will they cast to play him?  Enquiring minds want to know. ;-)"

","Though I gave it an 8 out of 10, I am very fascinated with this flick (I intended to rate it 9). This film again consolidates my theory that the British really knows how to offer the first class romance without humiliate the audience¡¦s intellect. Many of American romances appeal to the sensual attraction, with poor performance and terrible story, while English counterparts usually carry on with extraordinary casting and more serious implications. B.J. is no exception. Again we see the energy and power of British actors and actresses, with whose excellent jobs enrich the texture of the whole film. Of course Renee Zellweger is brilliant, who actually enlivens the woman with all kinds of foibles but at the same time makes it impossible for viewers to dislike her. The songs fit into the story seamlessly, and cinematography and composition of certain shots are unforgettable. However there is one reason that keeps me from rating it higher. While I expected to see a female enlightenment in this film, I found the ending quite disappointing in this dimention. B.J.¡¦s success in her career is a gift offered by Darcy, and her happiness, obviously, relies mainly on her love life. I don¡¦t know what other feminists think of this film, but I really think it¡¦s a setback."

","Bridget Jones is 32, single, and to put it mildly rough around the edges. She smokes too much, drinks too much, frets about her love life more than is healthy and has a perpetual case of foot-in-mouth disease.  And yet...there is a warmth about her, an undefinable something that makes her charming even when her behavior is less than commendable.  She is, in spite of herself, likable.  And as it goes with Bridget, so it goes with ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" the film adaptation of Helen Fielding's bestselling novel.<br/><br/>We begin at New Year's Day, with Bridget beginning her journal and promising herself that this is going to be The Year: the year when she sheds those extra pounds, chucks the cigarettes, and finds true love.  Two prospects soon present themselves for the last category.  Bridget has her eye on her boss Daniel (Hugh Grant), a naughtily charming bachelor who soon makes his mutual interest quite unmistakably known.  Bridget's mother, meanwhile, tries to throw her in the path of divorced friend-of-the-family Mark (Colin Firth)--an apparently hopeless cause as Mark is not only rather stiff, but both he and Bridget take a mutual dislike for each other.<br/><br/>No points for guessing that Daniel isn't the catch he appears to be, or that Mark will have a heart of gold beating beneath his apparently stuffed shirt. But in a movie like this, the destination isn't near as important as the journey to it, and for the most part it's a fun ride.<br/><br/>Most of the credit for the film's success falls in the laps of its three leads.  Rene Zellweiger, cast amidst great speculation, acquits herself as a very sweet and sympathetic Bridget.  Her heart's in the right place, even when her priorities are not.  After nearly cornering the market on stammering British nice guys, Hugh Grant does a surprisingly good turn as the rakish Daniel, mantaining his charm even after we've realized what a jerk he is.  As Mark, Colin Firth plays pretty much the same role he had in ""Pride and Prejudice"" (the fact that both characters are surnamed Darcy is in no way coincidental) but still plays him very well, with his apparent coldness gradually giving way to the tender warmth which shines in his expressive eyes.<br/><br/>Although Bridget's determination to perservere despite near-constant mortification is part of her appeal, the constant scenes of her social and romantic faux pas become trying at times.  The secondary plots to Fielding's novel might have added some variety, but these have been exised to give more screen time to the Bridget-Daniel-Mark love triange (and, no doubt, to the appealing personages of Messrs. Firth and Grant as well).  In the end, ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is your basic romantic comedy, with a colorful but peripheral supporting cast (Gemma Jones as Jim Broadbent are the highlights as Bridget's parents) and the Mr. Wrong and Mr. Right who end up being each other in disguise.  But even by-the-numbers films can work if done right, and ultimately ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" has that extra kick which sets it apart from the pack of romantic comedies that come out every year."

","Hearing about a film coming out of England called `Bridget Jones's Diary', a book coming to the big screen, I was not so sure what to expect. Yet by the time I finished viewing it, I was glad for the experience. Bridget Jones is a character that a woman or a man can relate to, as she is down on her luck in many things in life, but proves that if you give yourself a chance and wait your turn, things will work out ok. <br/><br/>32 year old Bridget smokes too much, drinks too much and has a tendency too say whatever is on her mind. As a new year's resolution she decides it's time to take control of her life  and starts keeping a diary. Now the most provocative, erotic and hysterical book on her bedside table is the one she's writing. With a taste for adventure and an opinion on every subject  from exercise to men to food to sex and everything in between  she's turning the page on a whole new life.<br/><br/>The cast of this film were fantastic. Undoubtedly Renee Zellweger deserves a big pat on the back for her role, which was not only funny, but also loveable. Hearing about all the lengths she went to fit the part is also another reason that this role will for me, be unforgettable. She had to endure days of eating pizzas and chocolate bars, anything you can imagine to gain weight for the role of Bridget, which is quite amazing.<br/><br/>
Also impressive in their roles in this film were the males stars, which include English heart-throb Hugh Grant. He was great as Bridget's boss and boyfriend, Daniel Cleaver, the one character that you think you can trust, then in one foul swoop, turns out to be the scum bag of the movie. His role is not much different from the one he had in Notting Hill which was a great, though in this film he is character has a lot more ego than the one he had in Notting Hill. Then you have the good guy in the whole film, the character of Mark Darcy, played by Colin Firth, who was great. You are never totally sure what to think of Mark in this one. His facial expression throughout the whole film is so plain, that he could be the bad guy or the good guy, for all you know? <br/><br/>This film was extremely clever' how it goes into the mind of Bridget Jones, via the audience hearing all the sarcastic comments that she has to say. Comments about `Uncle Geoffrey', who was not her real uncle, Publisher Mr Fitzherbert, who was affectionately known to Bridget as `Mr Titspervert', with Bridget's book launch speech hilarious. Whoever decided to put this side in the movie got it right, as it allows the audience to see what Bridget is thinking about.<br/><br/>There is one great soundtrack to this film. With performers which include Geri Halliwell, with the bopping hit `It's raining men', Gabrielle with `Out of reach' Shellby Lynne and Robbie Williams. In addition there are some timeless classic hits include `All by myself', which Bridget performs drunk and depressed, `Respect', `Don't get me wrong' and `Ain't no mountain high enough'.<br/><br/>So overall, Bridget Jones's Diary is a film that anyone could sit and watch and take something away from it. Whether it is just a laugh or some advice for real life, the message should come through somehow. There are many funny scenes attached to this movie that I will never forget, such as Bridget dressed as a Bunny Rabbit, going to her relatives party and having two men fighting  over her in the streets of London. So if you want a laugh, take the time to meet Bridget Jones. <br/><br/>By the way a warning: reading Bridget's diary might be a little dangerous and adopting her lifestyle could damage your health!<br/><br/>Rating: 4.5 stars or 9/10"

Quirky, off beat and unsentimental, this film is a good examination of today's singles who are finding marriage unattractive and relationships even less attractive.  The film does cast men in a rather negative light as both the men in the film are alpha males when every man and woman knows that the best husbands are beta males.  Not a great date film because of the rivalry that will develop between couples.  No, 'Bridget Jones' Diary' is an entry in the film community that is best served if guys watch it alone and girls watch it with their girlfriends.  Does that make sense?"

","Brigette Jones, where have you been?  I have been wallowing in the pseudo-romantic comedies that Hollywood has been pumping out.  And now, finally Bridgette has come along to save us from the insipid movies that have been plaguing our theatres.  Bridgette Jones's Diary is witty, entertaining, and endearing.  A story of a sexy but slightly overweight Londonite, ""Diary"" follows Renee Zellweger through the trials and tribulations of dating.  And what a ride it is.  Though I was a little tenuous to see Zellweger pull off an English accent, after 5 minutes I was lost in her clever non-sequitors and embarrassing faux pas.  Colin Firth and Hugh Grant are both perfectly charming in the roles as Zellweger's would-be suitors.  And, as in all Hugh Grant movies, the secondary cast of friends and foes are brilliantly written and acted.  <br/><br/>Before the movie ended, I was already ready to see it again and enjoy the magic that Bridgette brought to the screen.  Maybe that's what I'll do now :)"

","What a wretched film this is - I'm not sure if the book is as bad, or whether it took special effort to make such a shallow, lazy piece of fluff with such obvious contempt for the audience of 'middle youth' females whose buttons it thinks it can push.<br/><br/>What's depressing from the film's commercial success in the UK is that it obviously DOES push the right buttons. The whole concept of the movie is to get clearance on the most cliched 'classic' love and disco tracks (""that'll get the girls laughing/swooning/crying!"", you can hear the makers tittering smugly to each other), and then use the film as an extended music video with Renee pouting vacuously and pratfalling about over Hugh Grant and Colin Firth.

","I'm trying to be as fair to Renee Zellwegger and Hugh Grant as possible. After all Renee Zellwegger did work hard at the role, putting on weight, an English accent and all and appearing quite convincing in both. And Hugh Grant did a rather good job playing the bad guy. However much I hated Daniel Cleaver, at least it was not one of those idiotic fumbling characters that he usually plays. But methinks, Colin Firth stole the show! He's never looked so good, so perfect on screen before! This movie had him reprise the role of Mr. Darcy, the handsome elusive prince charming, who initially seems like a pompous know-it-all and ends up being Mr. Ideal himself. ""I like you, just the way you are."" Sigh...Too Idealistic, actually... Colin Firth's come a long way, you would would never imagine him being such good lead if you had only seen 'Circle of Friends' or 'Shakespeare in Love', two movies in which plays a chauvinist to boot! <br/><br/>I haven't read any of the Bridget Jones books, so I don't really know how Sharon Maguire has gone about adapting the novels to screen. To me it seemed like a modern reworking of 'Pride and Prejudice' with an overweight Elizabeth Bennett(minus the sisters, thankfully). But the movie is still thoroughly enjoyable and even re-watchable! The music is excellent! It features some really beautiful songs like Gabrielle's 'Out of Reach', Sheryl Crow's 'Kiss that Girl', Robbie Williams's 'Not of this Earth' and Shelby Lynne's 'Dreamsome'(the song played as Bridget and Darcy are making the blue soup! This one's a personal favorite!) And there's of course Geri Halliwell's 'It's Raining Men' which is just too good! Worth mentioning is also the theme of the movie composed by Patrick Doyle. The tunes are so beautiful and enchanting, they elevate the movie and the listener up to some ethereal world! <br/><br/>All in all, buy the soundtrack and see more Colin Firth films!"

","This review contains spoilers. The gorgeous Renee Zelleweger did a fine job of portraying a British citizen.so much so that one forgets that she is an American. However, I believe a person with such a beautiful voice should not cover it up with a fake accent.  I have never been much of a fan of Hugh Grant and was disappointed when I found out he was in the movie.  His performance wasn't bad, but opinion of him hasn't changed.<br/><br/>
Well, enough about the actors.movie review time.  As a single nearly thirty-somethinger, I found this movie hit close to home.for the most part. A story of a single woman's attempt to start the new year out right by losing weight, stopping smoking, drinking less and finding Mr. Right.and tracking her progress in her diary.  Fair enough, simple enough.  However, I found myself watching a character simply bumbling through the new year.including numerous tragically embarrassing moments and landing a great opportunity at her new television job by missing a huge interview but moments later being in the right place as someone she knew saved her butt by allowing her to interview the `headliners' wife.  She didn't lift a finger for this interview but reaped the benefits.  Sure this might be how it sometimes happens in real life but then why would I need to watch it in a movie.I'll simply land a television job.miss an important interview.and hanging out in a corner store until I end up with the interview.it could happen.just give me time.  Okay, so she bumbled her way through the movie.that's what made it so real you say.bull.that just told me that letting life push you around until your content is simply fine.  No, take life by the horns and pull.you can't sit back and simply let it happen to you.<br/><br/>As far as the romance was concerned, I found it hard to believe that Cloin Firth's engaged character would move back to England for Bridget after his big New York promotion simply because `she liked him just the way he was'. Wow! She liked him! Let's throw away a New York promotion and a marriage engagement with a woman to whom, for all we know, there has been a lengthy and deep romantic relationship.  We know little about this other woman which is why it's easy to root for our heroine.yeah Bridget deserves him that's the way it's suppose to be.  Limiting ones knowledge about a situation always makes their way right and feel good and the other way wrong and inconceivable.  Its okay though.what ever makes money for the movie biz these days I guess huh?<br/><br/>But with all of that said, I am a sucker for a happy ending and am a huge fan of Renee Zelleweger, so I'll rate this movie as one star better than average.six of ten stars."

And as for it being an update of ""Pride and Prejudice""? Not on your life. Sure, Colin Firth's character does kind of resemble that other Mr. Darcy, and Hugh Grant's sort of resembles Mr. Wickham's, but that is where the likeness ends. Bridget is the polar opposite of the intelligent, witty Elizabeth Bennett. If you want to enjoy a great romantic comedy, watch any of the filmed versions of ""Pride and Prejudice"" - including the miniseries that was on A&E a few years back that stars the very attractive and talented Colin Firth, who is wasted in BJD along with Rene Zelleweger (who really DID sound British), and Hugh Grant.

And that she's still one of the most beautiful women in the world may have helped also, but that's besides the point! On the whole, it's just a great movie, I'm sure I could pick it apart and find flaws, but I would rather not because as fluffy as it is, it leaves you with a warm feeling, and a desire to watch it over again!

","I was a bit late picking this one up. Still, it seemed worth viewing late, rather than not at all. Renee Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth star in this not overly complicated love triangle story. Bridget is infatuated by her boss, who becomes more interested in her the more weight she loses and the more unattainable she becomes. Firth, in the role of Darcy (no, not his role in P&P) is the third person in the triangle. Some of the lines are genuinly funny. Zellweger's character as famed by the book that preceded the film is excellent, as are her co-stars efforts. The supporting cast is at best one-dimensional which is unfortunate. This is down, I feel, to the constricts of time, rather than of ability. Nicely paced and an uncomplicated story are always a boost for a mass audience appeal, which this has in spades. Think Four Weddings & A Funeral' meets Notting Hill' and you are in the right area. Not a classic by any stretch but follows a successful and pre-determined route to box-office millions. (7/10)"

Rejection leads her to begin her diary.<br/><br/>The screenplay written by Richard Curtis(Four Weddings, Blackadder et c. et c. et c.) and Andrew Davies(Middlemarch et c. et c. et c. ) adapted from the novel by Helen Fielding  gallops on and on, at a pace that doesn't leave you much time to breathe, with stylish wit and humour.

Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy might be called the 'bigger' people according to their social status. BJ is of a lower caste consisting of ordinary people, and might seem boring due to its simplicity. Yet i like the light-hearted manner of this movie, and i like its simple-mindedness. the way it's brought 'down' the 'noble' feel of PRIDE AND PREJUDICE just tickled my heart^^(but for people with more exquisite tastes, the movie's probably degrading the original idea of the novel - hey, i'm being too serious^^)<br/><br/>casting Renee as Bridget was wise, she did an excellent job! Hugh Grant was a pretty nice Daniel, but he should be given a fuller attention - in the end Daniel simply evaporated, to me this is sorta strange. Colin looked good as Darcy, but as many have pointed out, his transformation was abrupt, and his timing was so 'unnaturally' perfect! (he stepped in just after Daniel was out) besides these i have not much to complain about this comedy, just perfect for laughter and maybe a little bit of thought afterwards if one likes^^"

","After seeing this movie, having not read the book beforehand, I felt relieved.  I thought that *I* was the only goofy, neurotic female, in the world that spoke without thinking, is horrible public speaker and wore cool pajamas?!  I now know that I have sisters in Britain!!  UNITE! <br/><br/>
I LOVE THIS MOVIE!  I LOVE THIS CHARACTER!  ""Mark Darcy"" is the reason why I am still single.  For the simple fact that, I'm holding out for the fairy tale -- *I* deserve nothing less.  ""Mark Darcy"" proves that there are nice guys out there who aren't absolutely CLUELESS and afraid of love. This movie not only made me want to hold on to my ""fairy tale,"" but it also made me believe that it CAN happen.  It also made me want to read the book and learn about British culture.  Call me delusional, but I think there's too much seriousness and fear in our world.  Why not want the fairy tale?  Why not be brave?  THANK YOU HELEN FIELDING!  You are very brave to have let the world (ie: MEN) in on our idiosyncracies."

"rjschultz","Null","0","0","26 October 2001"," unlikeable
","I think anyone who watches this movie will be very surprised at how utterly unlikeable the three main characters are. They are all kind of miserable people who really lack any desirable features. Bridget is supposed to be this woman that you secretly root for and hope she finds happiness but instead I found her to be selfish, petty and without any kind of concern for others at all really.<br/><br/>As for Firth's character, there were two main problems. One, he just has a very constipated demeanor throughout the whole movie. As the movie went on, I began to find it very frustrating to watch him. I understand he is supposed to be a sort of constricted fellow, but he took this to the point of not acting at all.<br/><br/>Secondly, his transformation is totally unbelievable. For the first part of the movie, he criticizes Bridget. But then suddenly at a party he just blurts out that he likes her. When did this transformation take place? We never see him showing any kind of interest at all and then this suddenly happens. This is just very ham-handed directing and I was not surprised to see this was this director's first movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, Hugh Grant's character was supposed to be the cad. He was supposed to be shown as being a jerk because he slept with another woman. Well, Bridget is the one who falls far too quickly for him, mentions love very suddenly in the relationship. AFAIK, Grant never said anything to lead her on that this was an exclusive relationship. Again, we are supposed to feel for her, but she shows absolutely no intelligence whatsoever in this process.<br/><br/>In the end, everyone just wanted something from someone else. I found myself not really caring about who ended up with whom.<br/><br/>I know some people will say that you have to be a 30-something single woman to enjoy this movie, that you see something of your own life in it, but I have to say that if you must be somewhat like the main character in a movie to like it, then that movie has failed."

","There are many things that make this a great movie, but probably the biggest of them all is the acting. Colin Firth and Hugh Grant appear to be perfect for their respective roles, and they do a great job. But Renée Zellweger shines and gives one of the two best female performances of the year (along with Julianne Moore of HANNIBAL (9/10)). This movie is especially great because it gives us a female lead that isn't a gorgeous supermodel and has her share of flaws, but we still love her. Renée Zellweger played the role perfectly.<br/><br/>This is also one of the more original films this year. It also is not too predictable. At times it is predictable, but until later in the movie, I honestly did not know which of the two men she would choose from. The movie is also very funny, as I laughed out loud more than one time during this movie. (Which is more than I can say about the ""comedy"" ZOOLANDER (3/10))<br/><br/>Highly recommended.

To start with, it is so clear that the story is BORING, haven't we seen something similar like a million times before? It is also so predictable! I kept waiting for something to happen ( something exciting ) but nothing did, and the movie ended and I was like: huh, is that all ? Indeed it was. As far as the cast are concerned, RenÃ©e Zellweger is as natural as ever, she is the best thing about this movie! Hugh Grant fits well in the character, but what about Colin Firth (Mark), he is so BORING, wrong choice, how can they expect us to like this guy when he is so dull? I wonder.

"FlickJunkie-2","8","0","0","21 October 2001"," Zellweger shines as a quintessentially English girl
","This film is another excellent showcase for the talents of Rene Zellweger. It is a fairly common occurrence for British actors to play American characters with varying degrees of success in duplicating an American accent.  It is almost unheard of for an American to play a British character, and when it does happen the accent is almost always awful. Zellweger nails both the accent and the demeanor of the quintessential middle class English girl and is absolutely charming in the role.<br/><br/>The screenplay is an adaptation of Helen Fielding's novel of the same name that follows the single life of everywoman Bridget through the trials and tribulations of being a singleton.  Fielding unabashedly admitted in interviews that the original story was borrowed from Jane Austen's `Pride and Prejudice', going so far as to name one of the main characters Darcy (Colin Firth), the identical name of the corresponding character in Austen's novel.  To complete the bizarre crossbreeding, Firth played Darcy in the BBC production of P&P just before being cast in this role.<br/><br/>Fielding's screenplay is full of the ironic and droll humor that makes English comedy unique.  Bridget is written as such an adorable ditz that you can't help loving her, especially with Zellweger playing the role.  First time director Sharon Maguire does a bang up job of keeping the silliness moving at a rapid fire pace.<br/><br/>Zellweger is perfect for this role and must be commended for expanding her horizons (in all senses of the word).  She packed a great deal of weight onto her normally svelte frame to properly depict Bridget's weight problem. She then boldly allowed herself to be photographed in various skimpy outfits where flab burst forth from every seam.  Even more important than her excellent English accent is her comic ability to make the most of every peculiar situation with matter-of-factness so natural it is hard to believe that she didn't grow up in England.<br/><br/>Zellweger totally eclipses her male leads in energy, comedic ability and charm.  The normally likeable and bumbling Hugh Grant is sorely miscast as the jerk.  Grant's strength is his sincerity and his character doesn't possess any, leaving him adrift in his ability to interpret the role. Firth, who has excellent comedic and dramatic skills, is really wasted in a role that mostly sees him leering dourly at Bridget for two thirds of the film.  When he finally gets a chance to interact he is very good in a stuffy sort of way that is right for his character.<br/><br/>This is a delightfully wacky comedy with a fabulous performance by Rene Zellweger.  I rated it an 8/10.  It is peppered with funny truisms about single life that make Bridget's plight one that is with which easy to identify."

Renee Zellweger was wonderful as the of balance and less then graceful Bridget.  Hugh Grant, who is ussually quite the good guy, changes his stripes in this film to produce a funny and believable character, and Colin Firth reprises his Darcy role (one that he originally portrayed in 1995 for the BBC Pride and Prejudice a film very worth checking out!).<br/><br/>I can not stress enough how great this film is and how worth viewing it is.

","Of late, cinematic writers of romance have been finding the urge to steal from Jane Austen irresistible.  The creators of ""Bridget Jones' Diary"" are no exception.  Colin Firth even plays a character named Mr. Darcy.  The transferral of characters and plots is not a detraction however; it's all done in plain view and, morally speaking, the trotting out of Miss Austen's manners and morals in modern-face is perfectly above-board.  The gem of the picture is Renee Zellweger as Bridget Jones, a delightful blend of Elizabeth Bennett and Emma Woodhouse.  Hugh Grant, as the publisher, Mr. Cleaver, successfully reprises a role done previously, the dashing rotter.  Ms. Jones, like her fictional predecessors, wishes to marry well.  When Mr. Darcy first reappears in her life as a stern critic of her apparant fatuity, she flies into the rakish embraces of her employer, Mr. Cleaver.  Herein lies the arch flaw marring this substantial confection: the love chemistry between the shallow boss and the adoring wench possesses a wattage and a charm far greater than that found within the propriety of her ultimate union with Mr. Darcy."

","Go Renee! Houston girl makes good as a British girl. This film is really a commentary on those women who mis-manage their lives, become unattractive, untalented, and lament that ""all the good ones are taken.""  Well, 'duh!', they were taken by all the young ladies who actually took care of themselves, developed skills, and are attractive. It is a good film, certainly not great, and will be remembered by the same fans who remember ""Three Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"", not because they all have Hugh Grant, but because they all have a similar look, wit, and 'feel' to them. I like all of them.<br/><br/>Bridget is ""30-something"", beginning to have visions of growing old without ""A MAN"", and some day dying alone, being found days later, half-eaten by her dogs. She begins a diary and begins a self-improvement plan. However, she doesn't make much progress and fortunately is found attractive by Colin Firth's character because he ""likes her just the way she is.""  This is a running theme in fantasies of single women everywhere, wanting someone ""to love them just the way they are.""  Unfortunately, in real life few of them are cute and attractive as Bridget is in the film. Hugh Grant is fine as the cad.<br/><br/>The DVD is a very good one. Not only the film itself, but most of the extras, like music videos and deleted scenes, are in Dolby 5.1 surround sound. The surround is used very effectively, although there is not much opportunity to showcase either rear channel sounds or deep bass. The widescreen picture is just perfect.

In essence it is just a good old-fashioned girl meets boy tale with an added dash of humour, but the vast array of talent on show provides more than just that.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are both superb in their roles. Grant plays the lovable posh bloke he has done many times before, but this time shows a harder, more vicious edge without detracting from the comedy aspects. Firth too shows how far he's come from baring his backside in Pride and Prejudice. He is the perfect foil for Grant and his chemistry with the lead is compelling.<br/><br/>The real magic comes courtesy of the screenwriters however. Helen Fielding did a great job with the book, but converting that into a hundred minutes on screen is no mean feat. Richard Curtis is no stranger to screenwriting though after Four Weddings and Notting Hill, and alongside Andrew Davies the pair have done real justice to the story.<br/><br/>But if there's one person who deserves the most praise then it's Zellweger herself. Her accent is spot on and it is her terrific insecurities that complete the character of Bridget adding substance to the whole tale. Zellweger simply IS Bridget. Very few actresses could have lived up to expectations as such an idolised character, but Zellweger does all that and more.<br/><br/>It seems ironic that a film that could only be made in Britain, an American steals the show, but after her Golden Globe for Nurse Betty and her performance in this there really is only one way for Ms Zellweger to go next, and that's up.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Having read the great books I thought that the movie would disappoint me. I didn't even want to see the movie but my boyfriend and came onto it in a sneak preview show. My general opinion is that a film can never be as book as the novel. Having said that I can safely say that the film is absolutely great. Although it had to be abbreviated, it stays close enough to the book so that readers won't be disappointed. The cast is well-chosen as well and they play their roles convincingly. The only weak spot is that the film is not really British enough."

","Whoever thought of doing Bridget Jones as a modernized version of the ultimate romance 'Pride and Prejudice' is a genius.  Perhaps it was Andrew Davies, who wrote the script for the wonderful BBC serial of that classic, with, of course, Colin Firth as the inscrutable Darcy, aloof, self-possessed, but underneath a seething maelstrom of emotions.  (By coincidence or not, one of our cable channels has just re-run the serial.) In-jokes and parallels abound--Crispin Bonham-Carter in a tiddly little role; the only kiss between Bridget and Darcy coming right at the end, along with Darcy's only smile for the film; the differing reports of the early relationship between Daniel/Wickham and Darcy, leading to some of Bridget's Prejudice (along with her overhearing of Darcy's first impression of her); and this is a small sample of the delights for lovers of P&P, both the book and the serialisation.<br/><br/>Even without familiarity with P&P, it is a fun film.  Bridget is a wonderful mess, who does a fine line of embarrassment; Daniel Cleaver is a gorgeous cad; Colin Firth a gallant hero (though what he could see in Bridget ...?); and the usual Chorus of friends (cf. Notting Hill, Four Weddings, Sliding Doors) is entertaining.  The performances are strong all down the cast list. I particularly enjoyed James Faulkner's 'Uncle' Geoffrey, and Paul Brooks's Mr Fitzherbert ('Titspervert').  Renee Zellweger's accent has been criticized, but it completely fooled some English friends, and she was charming in the role.<br/><br/>I loved 'Diary', but I hope that any attempt to mount a sequel is quashed immediately."

","Bridget Jones' Diary (2001) Universal /Canal Plus<br/><br/>      Two romantic movies viewed within the span of one week are quite hard to swallow. Yet, when they are two movies that seem to evoke laughter and a sense of belonging, it could be worse. The two movies in question are Someone Like You' and the newest addition to this catalogue of reviews, Bridget Jones' Diary'. It seems that as long as people will date, the Hollywood machine will churn out romantic movies. The only difference is, will they be smart, clever and intellectual films that make one re-think their whole romantic life?      This previous question may be applied to the film, Bridget Jones' Diary', in which Renee Zellweger plays the titular character in a quite surprising way. Let us deconstruct together. First and foremost, I had my reservations about a Native Texan taking on the lead in which her character was a Brit. Second, is Zellweger ready to undergo such a strenuous Hollywood task in which she has to carry a bug film such as this entirely on her shoulders. The answers, in my opinion are YES. Jones' Diary' is a picturesque, clever little film about the trials and tribulations of a thirtysomethings misadventures due to her disastrous romantic life. Along for the delightful ride are Hugh Grant who puts a wicked, fun twist as her womanizing boss (all romantic films must have a womanizer to portray the villainous evil which is man), and Colin Firth plays a mysterious stranger who seems to magically appear where Renee Zellweger's character always seems to be. That said, Firth makes a stunning breakthrough as the stranger with a mysterious past. Simply in watching the film we have never been exposed to a character that we can sympathize with, then completely despise (Caution: These two emotions are listed in no particular order in which they appear in the film). Simply watch the film, and just observe his facial tics and mannerisms, he plays his character in a simple yet complicated way. He is absolutely oozing with mystery throughout the whole film as he gazes at Zellweger's character only to later on discover his true past.      The movie develops at a medium pace describing Bridget's life as a total failure. And in retrospect, the film seems to be longer than its' 94 minute run. But the film encompasses the scope of her life in a comedic and sentimental manner. From her parents to her friends, Bridget sees her life as a complete failure. She is depressed; therefore she drinks, eats and cries her days away. That is until an incident in her life forces to feel confident and take control of her life. Forcing her to make rash, yet unprecedented romantic decisions that will change the course of her love life.      The film is sold as a comedy and contains some great chemistry between all three main characters. Hugh Grant plays Daniel Cleaver who is a vivacious womanizer who happens to be Jones' boss, and Colin Firth plays Mark, a successful lawyer who happens to share a mysterious past with Grant's character. And suffice to say, Zellweger does a good job at capturing and conveying the character of Bridget Jones that was initially written in the novel in which the movie is based on. Director Sharon Maguire does not break any new ground in this film. She captures the many comedic scenes in a delightful and touching way and makes the audience experience some great laughs.  The movie has the same flair as did Notting Hill', of course that can be because it is from the same producers, but is it as good? No. Instead, this film tries to create its' own look with the use of slapstick  keep your eye out for a great comedic fight sequence between Firth and Grant as they fight in the middle of the streets. Furthermore, the film creates its' own look with the incessant use of vulgarities  a lot of characters enjoy using the f*%# word.<br/><br/>     The film itself is a great date movie because it will make the women happy. Upon exiting the film, I saw not one woman with a sad face. The movie delivers what it should, a great time at the movies and brings forth the notion for women that every girl can have a picturesque romantic relationship  no matter how bad the previous relationships were - witness Bridget Jones' previous relationships. Therefore, it is safe to say that this romantic film gets a perfect finale that simply is picturesque. So perfect that it is what I like to call a bow-tie ending'. This terminology implies that all the loose ends were taken care of and the girl gets her guy- whichever one it may be. <br/><br/>

However, within the first few minutes of the movie, I was not only enjoying myself but almost belly laughing at the well written and well acted film.  Moreover, the humour is not simply the plight of a single, aging woman, but rather how she makes a fool of herself and how her peers (and us, as the audience) laugh at her. She is treated like rubbish and we enjoy it.  Hugh Grant is great, very cool, very believe.  All in all an enjoyable evening."

","I saw a sneak preview of this and I loved it! I will admit I did not like the book, but the previews looked so good --- and I was not disappointed! The writers did a great job formulating a compelling plot from the book, you will not take your eyes off the screen the whole time you are in the theater!<br/><br/>The best part of the flick is Renee Zellweger herself --- she is excellent as the title character, expressing that bumbling side that does embarrassing things in public that every one of us has and is afraid will show itself --- right in front of the guy we really want. You have to feel for her when the embarrassing situation is not her fault --- someone gives her wrong information and she ends up looking silly, but she takes it all in stride.<br/><br/>
And what girl hasn't vowed to take up a campaign of self-improvement because we hope our dream guy will sit up and take notice of our new and improved self?<br/><br/>The best thing is watching Bridget discover, over the course of a year, that her true self might be just fine after all."

","Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the best comedies I've ever seen. Why? I assume it's because every character is so relatable - none of them are cartoonish - maybe a bit clicheed (especially Hugh Grants character) but still they're so human that most of them resemble somebody you know if not yourself.<br/><br/>The love affair between Bridgets mother and this TV shop host is  hilarious to say the least - but still there is a human angle on the whole thing. There's a wonderful scene when the mother returns to the father hoping for forgiveness. It's film making at its best.<br/><br/>But the real gem in this movie is off course Renee Zellweger - she's just perfectly cast as the vulnerable and unconfident Bridget Jones. You can't help sympatizing a lot with her character - she's so genuine, so sweet, so real - so fantastic. I cannot imagine one single other actress that could have been better in this role. And you can bring them all: Julia Roberts, Meg Ryan, Cameron Diaz, etc. etc.. Show me a guy that leaves the theater without a light crush on Renee, and I'll show you a guy with restrained emotions.<br/><br/>Rating: 9 of 10."

","I've read many of the comments users sent, and I couldn't agree more about all the good things everybody wrote about Renee's acting. I think she's really great. I also think her acting is so good that many scenes where she's naked/half naked/less dressed could be more gentle, less vulgar. I really think many ""less-dressed"" scenes should have said to the viewers ""this character is crazy, does stupid things sometimes, and doesn't give a f*** in the rest of the times"". I really DON'T THINK there was any need to say ""look, here's a movie where you can see her almost naked, her tits and legs are showed.."" etc. Maybe with an actress who can't act that trick does the job and bring the people to the cinema, but not with such a good actress like Renee.<br/><br/>I really think she deserve better scripts then that, because she got so much to offer, and this kind of scenes just makes the movie look kind a low (if you know what i mean).

To see a typical normal woman doing goofy things and being a normal healthy size female (goes to show you can look sexy without having to be the shape of a stick) made it a truly enjoyable movie. Renee should be very proud of her performance.<br/><br/>Hugh shedding his image of 'Mr Perfect' was a nice change, though I love his movies and these roles.  He does the character of Daniel Cleaver being a cad very well and I'm sure there are many males out there that can relate to Daniel's dilemmas with relationships.<br/><br/>Colin, what can I say, he was exceptional.  His performance was flawless and was a great shame he didn't get more screen time,  I look forward to seeing more of Colin's work in the future. His character of Mark Darcy is heart warming without being mushy or going too far and being labelled with a 'Mr Perfect' tag after Mark makes some insensitive comments.  The highlight of the movie, however, was the ""just the way you are"" scene between Bridget and Mark. It was moving.<br/><br/>Colin, Renee and Hugh each deserve top awards for their excellent performances and Helen for her excellent writing. 9 out of 10 (It would have been a 10 if it had more Mark Darcy screen time!)"
"Rammstein-2","7","0","0","1 August 2001"," Funny stuff
","A movie that gets the amount of attention that ""Bridget Jone's Diary"" has received is thought to have some deeper point to it, but pretty much like ""Notting Hill"" or ""Four Weddings..."", this one is very, very enjoyable without actually having one. I'm not saying that it is completely pointless - I'm saying that the diary of Bridget Jones really doesn't reveal anything revolutionary or cast any new light on men vs. women. Some men are a**holes, most are not. Some women are degraded gold diggers, most are not. Most people are just like Bridget Jones - willing, kind and really low in the confidence department. Therefore, all the fuss about this being such an ""insight"" is bull. In the end Bridget Jones just wants stability, love and calm and shies away, quite rightly, from sleazy s.o.b. men like her boss (Grant)<br/><br/>It is a very funny movie though - not quite in the caliber of ""Notting Hill"", but still a good laugh. The acting is impeccable (with that cast it would be impossible to miss), Zellweger, Grant and Firth are all enjoying their respective roles so clearly, some of their good mood spills over the brim.<br/><br/>Good fun."

","It is a truth universally acknowledged among publishers that a lady novelist who has written a fetching tale is anxious to see a theatrical production made of it. My prior experience of approaches by young men and women of large fortune who wish to adapt my humble accounts of county life for the kinemascope have left me with a mixture of emotions: pride, surprise, anger, outrage and dismay. Thus I must own to be prejudiced against such adaptions, for they concentrate on the charms of the scenery and the countenances of my characters rather than on what I may call their inner beauty.  Alas I can do nought, since my copyrights have well and truly expired.<br/><br/>The present is an attempt to transplant my youthful experiment, `Pride and Prejudice,' written when I was of 18 years age to a London of 200 years hence. Bridget (Miss Renee Zellweger) is a lady of some 30 years still in a single state and very desirous of meeting a suitable young man and settling into matrimony. Unlike my heroine Elizabeth Bennet she is not living at home and has a paid occupation, but nevertheless her mother (Miss Gemma Jones), a foolish woman, is constantly thrusting prospective husbands before her. One, of them, the son of a considerable local family, happens to be named Darcy (Mr. Colin Firth). Following my story, Bridget becomes enamoured of her employer, a Mr Cleaver (Mr. Hugh Grant), an utterly charming man who is a villain so base that my own Mr Wickham pales into insignificance. As in my novels sense prevails, if not sensibility, and Bridget and Darcy are reunited, but not before a great many parties and dinners and even some fisticuffs.<br/><br/>I was struck with the ingenuity of replacing Elizabeth's sisters with Bridget's group of friends, which included a man described as a `pouf'  - I take him to be a kind of hairdresser. Much of their communication seem to take place at considerable distances by means of a device which grew out of their ears. I was amazed that little in the way of meaningful social intercourse between men and women took place until they had had sexual intercourse first. I recognised much of the London in which the drama takes place. It looked a great deal cleaner but I was puzzled by the absence of horses though I did notice Bridget driving in the snow at furious speed some manner of self-propelled metal cart, and Mr. Grant had another version with no roof. <br/><br/>One should always allow other writers their artistic licence, even when they use one's own characters, as is the case here. However I must take the writers to task over their Bridget. Like my Elizabeth she is not devastatingly pretty, but she lacks Elizabeth's positive qualities of intelligence and good manners. Bridget spends most of her life in a state of embarrassed self-absorption as she bumbles (is that the word?) from one social fiasco to another. My Elizabeth was never such a clown, and if she were, Darcy would not have been interested in her.<br/><br/>I must however congratulate the performers for their spirited rendering of their parts. Miss Zellweger (who I was amazed to discover is a native of our late American colonies) conveyed the agony of her entertaining but not very appealing character with great flair. Mr. Firth I have seen and admired before in the role of Darcy and he did not disappoint. Mr Jim Broadbent and Miss Gemma Jones were quite affecting as Bridget's parents, though it must be said that, foolish woman though she was, Mrs Bennet would never have run off with anyone, let alone an itinerant jewelry vendor with purple skin."

However (after a dodgy karaoke style start) the movie settled down into an enjoyable character driven comedy.  You end up enjoying Bridget's failed attempts at making a mark for herself whilst wishing that all will come good in the end and that she will choose the right man. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are excellent as the love interests, with both of them having good and bad points, such that you can see why Bridget is attracted to both of them. Zellwegger is great and after a while you get used to her ""English"" accent, although at the start you feel like walking out, but then again the non-English people watching this probably won't even notice.

","Bridget Jones would not be as good were it not for the great Renee Zellweger. I am not dismissing the film (I liked it a lot), only saying that Renee's wonderful performance is absolutely the best. Her expressions are priceless. As a matter of fact I 'discovered' her in Nurse Betty (Another masterpiece), where she shone as well, and here she hasn't let her standards slip. Excellent job Renee!<br/><br/>Warning! - Little spoilers.<br/><br/>Aside from Renee's awesome performance, Bridget Jones' Diary harks back to the typical (And sadly not too frequent) English humour, also featured in movies like Four Weddings And A Funeral, unfairly overlooked by the way. Here Hugh Grant plays a selfish jerk who is Bridget's boss and also her lover, until she can take no more abuse from him and dumps him on the spot. Colin Flirt (Hadn't heard of him before) is a sullen and grim ex neighbour from Renee's childhood who will eventually get her love.<br/><br/>The film is full of comic situations and wacky and hysterical lines. Probably the funniest scene is that of Renee's butt descending by firemen's pole broadcast live on the news.<br/><br/>What I did not get is why British press reacted negatively when Renee Zellweger was chosen to play Bridget Jones. As far as I am concerned there's not any other actress who can beat her now. How they could ever think the fact of being from the US would prevent her from playing a good role? If they have seen the film I hope they have realised how wrong they were.<br/><br/>To sum up, an extraordinary, funny and intelligent movie. If Hollywood ignores this movie and doesn't nominate it for next year's Awards the little credibility they still have will fade away, not to go back. Let them try so they can show us how blind and narrow-minded they are.<br/><br/>Ten out of ten for this movie."

","I am not exactly Bridget Jones,but i could relate to some things in the movie the one thing i didn´t like was that she didn´t choose<br/><br/>Daniel over Darcy. Okay he hurt her but come on,he has a much more exciting personality maybe he is a cheater,but he is fun and exciting maybe i´m wrong but when i get old (17 now)i would rather remember having fun and enjoying  life (possibly with a handsome charming wild guy;)) and let´s face it that´s probably not possible with a responsible caracter like Mark Darcy!;),but that´s just my opinion.exept for that choise i cinda liked the movie. 9&9/10 out of 10."

","For any single woman over 30, the book ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" is one of the most real snapshots of our lifestyle.  Going in with the fear that ""the movie is never as good as the book,"" I was happily proved wrong.  Renee Zellweger brought Bridget to life - she captured Bridget perfectly.  Hugh Grant and Colin Firth were wonderful, too.  After three months of prodding, my boyfriend - not a fan of chick flicks - finally agreed to see it with me - and he laughed until he cried.

","Renee Zellweger brought Bridget Jones to life for me.  The expresssions on her face speak volumes as to what the character is feeling.  Of course, Colin Firth is the perfect Mr. Darcy whether in ""Pride and Prejudice"" or ""Bridget Jones"". As the movie goes along, you discover that Mark and Bridget have a lot more in common than first thought.  What can I say about Hugh Grant - wonderful just does seem enough.

When my friend and I entered the cinema a little late, commercials were over, we saw the opening scene of Bridget Jones's Diary. At first sight I thought it was Pearl Harbor or something, but while looking closer, I saw it was Rene Sellweiger walking trough the snow. Then everybody started screaming: ""Oh my god, there playing Bridget, their playing Bridget"". This includes me, I waited so long for this film to come out, and I was so happy to see it at last. The film was really great, the type of humor used was fantastic, and the actors were even better. I really liked Hugh Grant, in a completely different character then the usual.

","Very, very good film overall. Renee Zellwegger was brilliant. Colin Firth his yummy self as smoldering hero. Even men friends have loved it -- the fight scene especially, I'm told. Audience laughing loudly and throughout. Was slightly disappointed in ending (bit too contrived and sappy) and annoyed, occasionally, with melodramatic violins (e.g., during ""Tarts and Vicars"" party, when Bridget smoked with her dad outside and during Naked-American-Stick-Insect- Sitting-on-Bathtub"" moment). Otherwise, the music enhanced many of the scenes (e.g., ""All by Myself,"" ""It's raining men,"" ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough,"" etc.). But the crowing glory was Renee's performance. Without her nuances of expression and comedic timing -- I think audiences would have been more critical of this first-time director's cut-and-pasted look. It definitely needed tighter editing and a better flow (musically and otherwise). Also, the British humor was sometimes completely lost on the Americans. Most American women don't find sexual flirting in the workplace funny, or comments from men to women like ""...you dirty bit__"" or ""...you ham-fisted cu__"" funny either. Nor do Americans find heavy smoking and drinking particularly funny. They can't really relate. Wonderfully naughty British humor. Would highly recommend the film, despite criticisms. To tell you the truth, when I raised these issues with friends, they all thought I was being too picky. Everyone I know has adored this film."

","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** Compared to '4 weddings', this was rubbish. It had a couple of quite funny moments, but there were so many things wrong with it that spoilt it for me, namely:<br/><br/>1. The plot - if you can call it that. 'Do I fancy Daniel Cleaver or Mark Darcy? Well, let's see if I can take up the whole movie trying to decide.'<br/><br/>2. The way Bridget bumps into Mark Darcy at every possible opportunity. By half way through the film, you just know that every time there's a knock on the door or a figure lurking in the distance - da da - there he is again.<br/><br/>3. Mark Darcy himself. Aloof, tongue-tied, bumbling, cold and repressed - Bridget quite rightly wants nothing to do with him at the start of the film - so how come by the end, though he hasn't changed a bit, he's suddenly Mr Right?<br/><br/>4. Bridget's friends. All three of them reduced to complete caricatures - they might as well not be there for all that they bring to the film.<br/><br/>5. The snow. PLEASE!!! When does it EVER snow at Christmas - let alone two Christmases in a row.<br/><br/>6. Bridget talking at a snail's pace. Surely no-one speaks this slowly? Unless, of course, they're a Texan actress doing their darnedest to make sure their carefully cultivated British accent doesn't slip.<br/><br/>7. The blue soup. How many times can you make a joke about this for it still to be funny? Answer: one, at a push. Definitely NOT four.<br/><br/>8. The ending. OK, maybe it's because I'm male, but it had me barfing into my popcorn.<br/><br/>9. The soundtrack - like the worst sort of 30-somethings record collection (ok, this is subjective, I admit, but maybe it's because I just can't stand Van Morrison)<br/><br/>Apart from that, not too bad!"

","I have been looking forward to seeing this movie, since I have read Helen Fielding's The Edge of Reason and found it enormously funny. And this movie has not disappointed me. It is one of the best comedies I have ever seen, despite its super absurdity of plot. But this absurdity is one of the most appealing part of this film. Who wants to sit in a cinema paying five bucks just to see a ""truthful"" but maybe ""dull"" portrait of a 30-sth singleton's boring life? For a movie goer, this movie has the hilarious plots, the creative lines, and a bunch of brilliant actors and actresses. I am serious thinking about seeing it again and even buying the two books! My favorite scenes are:<br/><br/><ul><li>When Bridget heard Mark Darcy's comments about her spinsterhood to his mother and she squeezed out that bitter smile: I felt so sorry for her. This kind of prejudice against ""older"" singletons are truly hurtful.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Bridget sang in her pajama ""All By Myself"": I nearly cried. I can't believe I can relate so much to this scene. Personally I'd rather work out to death in the gym than singing karaoke in my apartment if I were her, but I can feel her pain.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Briget spitted to Daniel by saying ""I'd rather *** than ***"" when she decided to leave the publishing house for a new job. I had such a good laugh. It's perfect vengeance to a sleazy guy like him. And the expressions on the onlookers' face are also funny. Again only BJ will say such words but that's what makes her so unique and lovable!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When the ""one and only"" Mark Darcey said ""...like you as you are"". Wow!That's the sweetest line any woman wants to hear, esp. for someone like BJ, who keeps bumping into social blunders and thinks she is an idiot most of the time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Darcey helped her out of embarrassment at the dinner table when the smug-married couples are waiting to see her humiliated. This is so sweeeeet!!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Bridget blurted out on the last gathering (like saying ""I object"" at the wedding) and then changed her mind and said sth else, I half laughed and half felt sad. But the expression on Darcey's face is almost ""smug"" :-)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When Bridget ran out in those funny clothes after Darcey and it turned out that he just wanted to buy her another diary. This is truly unexpected, and heartening.</li></ul><br/><br/>They are many more subtle scenes and good laugh triggers throughout the film. It's refreshing to see the British style of humor well meshed with the American mastery of comedy making. It's not an ordinary comedy but a WONDERFUL one. I guess I really begin to like British kind of humor now, after Notting Hill and BJD. I wonder when the sequel can be made. That one is good too. BTW, I don't like Hugh Grant but I must say he is a very good actor, no matter an innocent, awkward bookstore guy or a scoundrel that combines all the bad things BJ resolved NOT to have. Colin Firth is very British, but downright charming. He is the modern version of Mr. Darcey. The music is GREAT! The songs and the drum of the fighting scene are so artfully arranged!<br/><br/>Conclusion: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED."

What distinguished this movie from the ninety-nine zillion other movies about the same subject with the same plot skeleton: girl is wallowing in her loneliness, girl meets guy who ends up hurting her somehow, another guy in the background crawls out of the woodworks to sweep her off her feet and they live happily ever after.  This theme has become incredibly cliche, and makes for an extremely ordinary movie.  Tacking on a diary to the plot doesn't really change anything.  There were other pointless ""features"" of this movie, such as the fact that Daniel Cleaver stole Marc Darcy's wife, but lied to Bridget about it.  Any such feature of a movie that can be cut out completely without altering the story shouldn't be included in the first place.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger's British accent was HORRIBLE!  Listening to it for the duration of the movie was agonizing.  And I'm not even English!

The film was brilliant, it included every necessary scene from the book, and also added its own (the fight scene, etc.)  I was never one of those who doubted Renee Zellweger and now that I have seen it twice, all I can do is laugh in the face of those who did.  The three main leads were superb.  Zellweger did a great accent and actually looked the part of 9st and a bit Bridget.  Hugh was pleasing as Daniel. When I first heard of his casting, though, I was sceptical as he is usually playing the romantic hero, however, I have been proved wrong again.  I was never a fan of Colin Firth and I hadn't even seen the BBC version of 'Pride and Prejudice' - until seeing this film.  He is suitable as the aloof barrister Mark Darcy, however he is smouldering and very good looking, despite appearances.

","What a treat this movie was!  Being an avid fan of the books, I was so afraid this would just be another book ripped to shreads by Hollywood. Boy, was I wrong!  Sure, there were lots of funny moments from the book left out, but you can't film it all.  I think the essence of Bridget has been truly captured here.  Why is it that the funniest movies seem to come out of England, or have mainly English casts?  Hmmmm...maybe Hollywood should take some pointers.  Back to Bridget Jones' Diary....Renee Zellweger's performance was flawless!  I never noticed her accent waver a bit. And the scene during the opening credits where Bridget is wallowing in self pity and listening to awful 'adult contemporary' songs, is one of the funniest scenes in the movie.  I can't tell you how many people I overheard uttering, ""Oh my god, I do that ALL the time!""  Zellweger captured Bridget's hopes, fears, embarrassments, humor, zanniness, neurosis, honesty and likeability in a wonderful performance that is sure to get her at least a Golden Globe nod. Hugh Grant gives one of his best performances since Four Weddings and a Funeral.  How nice it was to see him NOT play a good guy, and do it so well. And then there is the delicious Colin Firth.  He portrays Mark Darcy with a quiet elegance that makes his performance seem effortless.  That's what makes it so good.<br/><br/>I, for one, am breathlessly waiting for the sequel.  I guess I'll have to see the movie a few more times.  However, I am anxious to see how they will handle the interview Bridget so hilariously messes up with Colin Firth, since Colin Firth is playing Mark Darcy.

It is hard for me to relate since I am a bit out of the target range being a young committed male in my 20s. However, I did enjoy several of the film's funnier moments. After it was over, I was generally pleased with the film.<br/><br/>Its faults (like so many romantic comedies) lie in the completely predictable plot (I mean this one was super-predictable!) and the mega-cheesy and ultra-predictable ending. <br/><br/>The merits of this film are the wonderful performances of Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant. Zellweger's bumbling Bridget provides most of the genuine laughs of the movie. The film did provide good characterization of the Bridget character; we are left caring about her at the end.<br/><br/>I was pleased to see Hugh Grant in the role of sleazebag for a change. He plays it with comedic style. His behavior in the movie provides the rest of the genuine laughs. This is the best role I've ever seen him in as he really makes the movie funny.  <br/><br/>FINAL RATING: 6/10 A good genre film. Fans of romantic comedies will no doubt love it.

Finally, I buy movie tickets (using my 1994 student i.d.)  for the new british romantic-comedy `Bridget Jones's Diary.' Since I am a big fan of british comedies such as `Four Weddings and a Funeral' and `Notting Hill', I did have high expectations.<br/><br/>4:40 p.m.- I sit down in the multiplex and start shouting all the answers to the movie trivia questions that are shown on the large screen before the previews start. Yes, I know my mind has an endless capacity for useless information!! <br/><br/>4:53 p.m.- I view some previews to some upcoming summer films such as `Planet of the Apes' (which is the story of some of the girls that I have met when I have been really drunk and realize the morning after that the truth hurts) and `Legally Blonde'  (which is the story of some of the girls that have gone with me to watch the submarine races at a nearby beach).<br/><br/>
5:05 p.m.- I start watching a quite amusing little gem of a film in `Bridget Jones's Diary.' I first notice that Renee Zellweger was born to play this part; even though many critics felt that she would be unable to play the part british. Renee's british accent and acting was excellent.  <br/><br/>
6:10 p.m.- I get a good feel about what the plot of the film is all about: a distress chain-smoking social-drinker chunky british single female determined to fight the right man, lose weight, and change her drinking and smoking habits by year's end.<br/><br/>6: 40 p.m.- I get up to go to the bathroom to do #1. Yes I know! That is T.M.I. (too much information). Anyways, at this point I do realize that the movie had made me laugh from time to time. I also realize that Hugh Grant and Colin Firth also deliver some very effective performances as the men in Bridget Jones' life. Screenwriter Richard Curtis again proves why his writing always deserves curtain calls. <br/><br/>7:00 p.m.- The movie ends. I was quite satisfied with `Bridget Jones's Diary', even though it is not in the same line of cinematic excellence as `Four Weddings' and `Notting Hill'. <br/><br/>11:00 p.m.- I write this review for `Bridget Jones's Diary' and recommend to all moviegoers that this film has the `write' stuff!<br/><br/>**** Good"

","I saw BJD last night with my wife, who has been asking about this film for weeks now.  I kept putting it off, thinking it to be another clunky, formulaic romance film.  I wasn't exactly incorrect, but the film is rather inventive in how it handles some conventional situations.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger did a fine job as Bridget Jones, although it's difficult to see why men would find her physically unattractive, even with the modest weight gain Zellweger had for the movie.  I thought she looked terrific. Hugh Grant and Colin Firth (one of my favorite underused actors) swap their normal roles around for this film, and both are outstanding.  Grant is the sophisticated, ethically challenged Lothario, Daniel Cleaves (nary a stutter!) while Firth's character seems almost unable to break outside of himself at all.  You can feel Mark Darcy's tension, his wanting to express himself and his despair at not being able to do so.  I'd say Firth's performance is easily the best in the film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, but not too importantly, the crucial plot twists in the story are pretty obvious to anyone with half a brain, especially the one concerning Cleaves and Darcy.  In the meantime, there's a lot of edgy humor in watching Jones bounce from disaster to disaster, trying to exceed her own abilities and in a few instances succeeding.  Some people have commented on her lack of moderation in drink, tobacco, and sex and how that made her unsympathetic.  That seems to me to be a somewhat sexist point of view, as many films feature male characters with the same exact issues, and these manage to garner sympathetic reviews.<br/><br/>One last note: Previous reviews have mentioned ""Someone Like You"" in comparison to BJD.  My thoughts were on ""Circle of Friends"", which dealt with an overweight central female character trying to break free of her own expectations and those of the people around her.  While I really enjoyed BJD, and CoF doesn't have the same edgy humor, I think CoF does a much better job of handling the central conflict of both films and treats the characters better.  (Colin Firth is also in CoF, although he is in his traditional jerk character.)  When Bridget Jones' Diary comes out on DVD, my wife will be clamoring for a copy, and then we'll put both on the same night and have a film duel!"
"bedazzle","7","0","0","23 May 2001"," not just a chick flick
","First thing, I had wanted to see this movie but almost did not go because of the main review which described this movie as ""Brill!"" I thought, ""Oh god, not only is this a chick flick, it's a teenage chick flick."" Gladly, I overcame my apprehensions and came over to the movie house...<br/><br/>Though this definitely could be considered a chick flick, there must be something else to it; for, I do not enjoy the typical chick flick. Thinking back at the most humorous scenes, I believe it was the dialogue that made this movie enjoyable for me.<br/><br/>I, you see, am a regular word smith, a true logophiliac. When a movie has no plot, or a disagreeable plot, or a predictable plot, creative conversationist nuances can certainly bring a movie forward. For example, at one point Mark refers to Bridget's speaking skills as ""verbal incontinence."" Later, referring back to that comment, Bridget uses the phrase, ""verbal diarrhea."" Another time, Bridget comes to work skimpily clad. Her boss asks if her skirt is ""home sick."" Bridget replies that her skirt is indeed present and that his attitude must represent some sort of biased ""size-ist"" ideology. Those are the first two instances I could think of. I found them quite amusing.<br/><br/>But if such subtleties to not amuse you, I'm sure you may enjoy this movie for it's chick-flick aspects. Aspects include: problems in dieting, embarrassment of ""spinsterhood"" (another gem of verbosity), self-pity followed by triumph!, and other such not-nearly-as-unique-as-the-dialogue scenes. Just to brag a bit, SPOILERS, I did predict both ending and the cloths misconception and cheating misconception that allowed for said ending to occur. Yet this was not a plot movie for me, so it did not detract from anything, for me.<br/><br/>Also, I thought the fact that the heroine was to purposely game weight for the movie was a refreshing change. Although more plump than when sleeping with Jerry Mcquire, Renee was not over-ripe and did a fantastic job. The accent did not hurt either, scruptous.<br/><br/>One more thing I thought was interesting, if not contradictory or revealing reverse sexism. Why does - yet another SPOILER - Bridget finally wise up and drop the cheating dog Daniel, while Mrs. Jones leaves Mr. Jones to go have a month long orgy with a television star and he takes her back with no thought whatsoever? There is only one answer: miss Mcquire and her feminine agenda do that think a man can get past his self-pity enough to escape his dependence on an unfaithful partner, while Bridget has no problem doing this even before she learns the truth of the cheating misconception.<br/><br/>
That was partly joking, because I do not remember having ever seen a movie with a female director. Yet I give you kudos, miss Mcquire, for making a film with two levels of enjoyability."

Bridget Jones is a very funny piece of escapist cinema; it is not an in-depth documentary style commentary on the role of single women in contemporary society or anything else equally as pretentious.

And i was not dissapointed.<br/><br/>I was dreading Rennee Zellwegger's embarrasment of her poor portrayal of a British Accent but i was very pleasantly shocked. she was incredible. She pulled it off better than Gwyneth Paltrow in 'Sliding Doors'. I loved her in 'Jerry Maguire' but i really loved her as Bridget. She has a charismatic screen presence that reminds me of actresses of yester-year! Also, she has a brilliant comic side to her that draws you in to the character even more.<br/><br/>
All the supporting cast were superb. I loved Hugh Grant as her self-obsessed, egotistical, womanising boss. It is clear on screen that he enjoyed playing the role. Colin Firth didnt really have much material to work with in the film but made the most of it and was perfect for such a role. Embeth Davidtz was good as the bossy fiance of Firth. She is also good at the British accent and brilliant in another British movie, 'The Hole'. i suggest you go see it if you like slick and clever thrillers. But the best supporting cast were the TV brit actors playing her oh so funny group of friends.<br/><br/>The story was good also and not full of over-the-top crying. and it definitely isnt just a woman's film. anyone will appreciate the emensly funny screenplay by Richard Curtis. The man is a movie genius. Plus, it manages to achieve something that not many films do anymore - you really care for the characters and want to know how it ends.<br/><br/>If you havent seen it yet i suggest you go and see it now.

","An unambitious, lazy and coarse woman of decidedly loose morals who drinks and smokes too much, is irresponsible and inept at work, and sadly (and drunkenly) warbles sentimental songs (""All By Myself"") between slugs of vodka alone in her apartment has not managed to find someone who would like to be her boyfriend.  What a surprise.<br/><br/>   We are supposed to perceive of 30-something Bridget Jones (Renee Z.) as a sympathetic character; (the audiences are predominantly female, and presumably are commiserating).  What I saw instead was a foul mouthed lout and obtuse loser who, despite promises to the eponymous diary, made no real effort to address the deficiencies she herself fully recognized.<br/><br/>   Working at a publishing house in London, she responds to the lewd e-mailed suggestions of her boss, played by Hugh Grant (the caddish snake with a proper British accent is a slight variation on his usual character, but one he does well).  Although she seems to know he is up to no good, she happily proceeds, merely setting herself up for humiliation and disappointment (the two common occurrences which provide the ""humor"" of this movie).  The alternative with whom she is presented is a stodgy (divorced) lawyer whom she ostensibly knew as a child, but seems to have been raised in a manor house on an estate some distance away, contradicting a central theme of the story, which is that (according to her mother who is trying to set them up) she romped naked as a four year old in his wading pool (he was eight at the time).<br/><br/>   The representation of middle class life in London for a young single person is interesting, as it was in ""Notting Hill"", but it was also noteworthy that the two significant incidences of potential calamity had their origins in ""New York"" (interestingly the home office not only of her publishing firm, but of the lawyer's firm as well).<br/><br/>   Most people have some vices, bad habits or other imperfections.  Bridget has these, but precious little else.  Her troubles are those caused solely by herself and her actions (or inactions).  The story laboriously drags itself to its clearly telegraphed ""happy"" conclusion, but we are left wondering, why?  <br/><br/>   Midway through the movie, after cataloging a list of faults, the lawyer and potential suiter somewhat inexplicably states ""... but I like you"". That's more than I can say for Bridget, or the movie.  If your girlfriend (or date) insists, then go, but otherwise stay away!"

","It's funny the way these British Richard Curtis comedies come out: dead in the shower of Late April, every other year.  First it was Four Weddings (the biggest grossing British film in the, then it was Notting Hill (the next biggest UK grosse)r, and now it's Bridget Jones's Diary the next biggest grossing film in the UK.  Then next year it'll be Hugh Grant in `Floppy Hair, Floppy D**k Donkey S**t': the next biggest UK grossing film<br/><br/>Bridget Jones is in her thirties.  She's all on her own in much the same way William Thacker was in Notting Hill: everyone's trying to get her a date. But instead of falling for an American movie megastar, she is faced with a yucky-looking Colin Firth.  But then, whilst working at her journalist job, she starts to fall for her boss, Hugh Grant.  I'd like to be able to tell you the name of their characters, but you see, I can't remember them.  I only remember Renee's character's name because it is eponymous.  So, who's she going to end up with?  Both of these men have their own quirks and vices: of course, one of them is a sad mummy's boy and the other is a charismatic a**hole.  Such is the choice of everyday English men today. So, whilst hypothesising, drinking more wine, eating Tesco's Alpen cereal and generally making a right a**e out of herself (both with her friends and people she should be impressing) she dilly dallies around thinking she's made the right choice when, of course, she hasn't  then she cries about it, makes a half-witty gesture, screws up some more and cries a bit more (usually in that order) until finally she ends up with someone some ninety minutes later.<br/><br/>But being fair Bridget Jones's Diary does have its merits.  It's reasonably funny in places and the acting is generally very good.  The direction by the practically unheard of MacGuire (a woman directing a box office smash? First for the record books!) is good, but a little flaccid in places.  The film starts off with text on the screen describing how much Bridget weighs, smokes and drinks - something which I hope would have continued.  There's also a nice `f******k' subtitle in one scene when she discovers she may have `f**ked up'.  I thought those were nice touches.  However, those touches and the direction of the film gets sloppy about half way through.  Like its namesake, you can practically read the story of Bridget like a diary: girls like this have to end up with the right guy and be happy, otherwise nothing is achieved.<br/><br/>So, on to Renee herself.  She makes an adequate English woman: her accent is fine and if you didn't know she was American then, A: you'd be fooled and, B: no-one in America would have bothered seeing this.  Renee, in terms of superstardom, doesn't  and probably won't ever have  the bums-on-seats-guarantee of Julia Roberts or Andie MacDowell.  Why?  Because she's not got the drop dead gorgeous look to her, unfortunately.  But that's not necessarily a bad thing, really: I think Renee was an inspired choice bearing in mind that an American had to have played her: a B list star is usually better than an A list in terms of quality.  But why oh why couldn't we get an English woman playing Bridget?  Keeping to the true text of the book, I would have rather Sally Phillips played Bridget Jones: we already know she's a terrific comedienne and actress (I'm Alan Partridge, Smack The Pony) and I firmly believe that Zelwegger and Phillips would've been better off swapping roles.  Just a thought.<br/><br/>Luckily, to stop the English public from running out of the cinema, the film is BLITZED with cameos an stretched-cameos (not quite constituting bit parts) from literally dozens of well known British actors and comedians. We've got Salman Rushdie as a book enthusiast, Jeffrey Archer makes an appearance as a crowd member, Lynne from `I'm Alan Partidge' plays Bridget's co-worker, Sally Phillips pops her head in now and then, David Cann from `Jam' pops up as a cameraman, `Drop the Dead Donkey's Robert Duncan shows his face as a TV director and Jim Broadbent plays Bridget's father  to name a few.  Even Honor Blackman is in it for about 3 seconds.  It's a shame really because for the most part all of the above are grossly underused and are giving very little to play with.  With the possible exception of Rushdie and Archer, I would've liked to have seen these fine British actors in the film more.<br/><br/>As it is, Bridget Jones's Diary is a big sloppy, mush-riddled mess.  None of the characters have any space to develop.  But the excruciatingly fatal mistake in the film is totally exposed: none of us give a flying monkey about Bridget.  Sure, she's had it tough, she's a bit ditzy and likes to think everything will work out.  Well, sorry to be a party pooper  but EVERYONE is like that.  So, essentially, is Bridget Jones' a chick flick? Yes.  None of the men who watch this, like her co-boss, will want to know her unless she gets satisfies her `Fitzherberts' and gets those jubblies out.  As such, Renee is decked out in very, very risque costume for most of the time anyway: at one point she wears a bunny outfit and, lastly, the final scene just has her in knickers.  Splendid.  Bridget Jones is like a porn film with two alterations: the actors are great and there's no sex. And I'm afraid women will just find this Jones exercise a waste of time  especially when you arrive at the last five minutes.<br/><br/>Now I'm hearing that they're planning a sequel?  Trust me, one is plenty. The only way you'd get away with a sequel was if you named it `Bridget Jones Gets Killed in the Temple of Doom'.<br/><br/>4/10"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** 30 Second Bottom Line: A single woman in her 30's wants to settle down with a man in a long-term relationship. Her choices are her fickle boss or a bedrock conservative she has known since childhood.<br/><br/>Story Line: Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) works in a London publisher's office, where she has a special knack for embarrassing herself with what she wears and the things she says. She catches the eye (and other body parts she's been after) of her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) and they have an affair. Daniel's considerable charms, embodied as they are in Hugh Grant, don't quite redeem him here. When he gets a promotion to the New York office, he announces that he has more than a passing interest in the woman from NYC that has been on a temporary assignment working at the office in London. Bridget once again loses her lover and, she declares in her diary to change her life by doing all the right things; to eat properly, to ease up on the drinking and smoking, and exercise 3-5 times a week. From that point on, however, her diary entries begin with increases in her weight.<br/><br/>
Bridget's mother Pam (Gemma Jones), during her annual holiday parties, always tries to fix her up with a man. This year the lucky guy is a lawyer, Mark Darcy (Colin Firth).   Firth recalls the other Mr. Darcy role he portrayed in Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, for A&E TV. Mark and Bridget played together as children and as her mother reminds her, he saw her with her clothes off, splashing in a wading pool. That embarrasses Bridget and as she avoids eye contact with Mark she notices his holiday sweater has a big silly looking reindeer face on it. She then realizes that she is not the only socially inept person in the room, wearing funny clothes. Her mother bought her a party outfit in a brocade fabric that would look better covering a sofa.<br/><br/>Although there is an attraction between Mark and Bridget, Mark is already spoken for, with his near-engagement to Natasha (Embeth Davidtz). Will Bridget get her man? And if so, will it be Daniel, Mark or some truly fresh meat?<br/><br/>Tell Me More About It: Zellweger showed us in Nurse Betty that she can really get into a character. She does that here, but the surrounding characters and the overall story are not quite as interesting. I will admit I've not read the best-selling book, but the movie should stand on it's own (e.g. Along Came a Spider and Hannibal). The popularity of the book and the buzz on the film had me expecting witty banter and a sort of Everywoman character. Missed on both counts. Blowzy is the word that comes to mind to describe Bridget for me. She appears to be just this side of tipsy most of the time, with both her underwear and her opinions often overexposed.<br/><br/>Ashley Judd in Someone Like You did a more effective job of portraying a single woman, lonely for a long term relationship, and dealing with many of the same issues and problems in trying to find a man. Bridget has relationships with both Daniel and Mark and neither one appears to be a prize.<br/><br/>Zellweger does a wonderful job with the British accent. Hugh Grant is more of a cad than we're used to seeing him play (art imitating life?) and Colin Firth is a great Darcy.no matter which century. Cast alone recommends this film.<br/><br/>Much is made of panties and derrieres in this movie; true, with a bit more class than usual. As many of you have heard, Zellweger does a scene where she runs down the street in her panties. I thought it would be just an event in the film rather than THE event in the film. It was cute but it left me feeling a little flat. Perhaps Bridget could do with a bit more soul-searching in that diary."

","Having held the two books by Helen Fielding about Bridget close to my heart, I'll admit I was a little apprehensive about seeing this movie. I was excited about the casting of Colin Firth as Mark Darcy for innumerable reasons, not least of which was the question of the scene in the second Bridget book, when she interviews Colin Firth. Will they have him play himself and Mark Darcy? I wondered. But I guess I'll have to wait for the (much anticipated and hoped for) sequel for the answer to that question. As the credits rolled, I immediately noticed that Andrew Davies name appeared as one of Fielding co-conspirators on the script. Knowing that he wrote the adaptation of the BBC Pride & Prejudice mini-series in which Firth played Austen's Mr. Darcy, I thought that I might see something a little different from the Bridget Jones Diary I know and love so well. And right from the beginning, it appears that the intention is to cleave the books together much more than in the original incarnation. Mark Darcy is much sweeter in the book, and Bridget is much less independent. Mum gets her tv job for her, and overall she is much more reliant on her friends and family to guide her than she is in the movie. They've boiled down the story to the Bridget and her two romances, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. To try to include everything would have required a four and a half hour mini-series along the same lines as P&P. I think they've accomplished what they've set out to do. They've made a happy little romantic picture based on a limited Bridget. She's been Americanized so even though Renee does a great British accent and scarfs down Branston Pickle (ugh!)this movie really is most palatable to an American audience who might not take to Bridget's hard-drinking and ultimately British ways.<br/><br/>Oh and Hugh Grant was good too."

"Mrs Jones","Null","0","0","8 May 2001"," Fun, but not to be taken seriously
","This film is full of the comedy moments we've come to expect from Richard Curtis. I found it lighter hearted and the main character more likeable than in the book. Renee Zellweger was charming, very ""real"" - I forgot she wasn't English! I found certain aspects of the character annoying - the fact that she couldn't seem to be happy for herself, without a man in her life. I know quite a few single 30-somethings who are like that and I can't understand why they're not enjoying their personal freedom. I think in Britain we're very much pressurised into marrying and having a family ""before it's too late"" whether that's what we want to do with our lives or not. It's a shame more film and book characters aren't rebelling against that conditioning. I also thought the two leading men were very lacking in charm, which made me wonder why Bridget was bothered about either of them. Still this was a book adaptation and the plot couldn't really be changed. And I guess Bridget's weakness of character made the film funnier - we all have friends like her don't we?"

","Colin Firth as Darcy Part Two made this movie for me.  He was great!  I have a feeling that there are a lot of people who haven't seen the BBC ""Pride and Prejudice"" in which he starred as Jane Austen's Darcy and who therefore don't ""get it.""  Some of those people might think that he comes across as cardboard, inanimate, and even humorless.  However, Firth makes Darcy so subtle, so just completely as much the off-center character that Austen intended that it's possible to miss how great he is.  Firth is Darcy and he is perfect.  He is full of humor, unseen strength, and, above all, amazing sex appeal.  If you didn't see it in him the first time, watch Bridget Jones's Diary again (a great flick - Hugh Grant is totally on target), re-read Austen's Pride and Prejudice, and just look into those brown eyes of Firth's.  It's all there."

","Ok, so I read the book before I went to the movie.  The movie was alright, but I really didn't like the storyline or lack of storyline with Bridge's parents.  IMHO the storyline in the book was very funny and explained the attraction between Bridget and Mark.  The movie kind of just expected us to believe that she could fall in love with him because of one conversation. The cast was very good though.  Although I wish that they could have shown her friends more.  Bridget's friends are an essential part of the book and they seem to have been more or less dismissed in the movie.  A lot of people thought that Renee Z. couldn't pull off the accent, but I thought that she did a good job. I did enjoy the movie, but I enjoyed the book twice as much."

","My admiration goes to the script and Renée Zellweger.  She surprised me in this role of insecure British ""gal"" that so many of us can identify themselves in.  Renée is our next Julia Robins and she is possibly even more talented (sorry Ms Robins).  Again the straight-to-your-face British humor has charmed the world.  This film is a top notch comedy but lacked little suspension and the end was too predictable.  Bridget's friends were also a bit of a failure, but hey! who is perfect?  A very enjoyable movie."

Colin Firth plays the role that was literally made for him. Add in top-drawer supporting performances and you have a wonderful, hilarious movie that had everyone laughing out loud for most of the movie. As a reader I have seen a lot of book-to-screen movies fail miserably, but BJD transferred very well. There were a few funny running jokes that didn't make it into the screenplay, but I hardly missed 'em.

","I took a chance and plopped down my eight bucks and can say that although I didn't run screaming to the manager for my money back, as I was tempted to do with the last Working Title film ""Notting Hill"", I definitely felt I could have waited for this to come out on video. Hugh Grant turned out to be an excellent choice for the role of Daniel Cleaver, who makes misogyny almost an endearing quality.  Colin Firth actually made my knees a little weak, and I expect after this role he shall enter the ""League of Overpaid Leading Men"" where his co-star Grant now resides.  However, Renee Zellweger only turned My Ideal of Bridget into a nightmare.  Her accent was impressively good, but I was put off by her weight.  Nowhere in the book is it stated that Bridget is actually overweight.  She yo-yo's between 119-130 lbs. and unless she was 5'0"" tall, that is nowhere near overweight.  The fact that in the book when she reaches her lowest weight people tell her she looks sick and she looked better before should have been a clue.  I think my sistership with Bridget solely relied upon the self-obsession that all women, whether they admit it or not, possess.  And the law that this self-obsession will inevitably cause you to make a horse's ass out of yourself.  I am not denying that this movie was entertaining, I was just looking forward to more of the self-loathing and naivete that made me love Bridget so much."

Like many other best sellers, the book is no literary masterpiece, so it would be surprising if the movie was on the level of, say, Philadelphia Story.<br/><br/>Yes, the film's sexual politics are hardly ""correct"" - though many thirtyish women seem to find no difficulty in identifying with Bridget -and its portrait of Britain displays the usual Richard Curtis (sorry Sharon Maguire!) cozy stylisation - with almost all the faces as white as the inevitable snow. But Zelwegger, Firth and Grant are all excellent, and there are lots of laughs. In particular, high praise to Renee Zelwegger, who as well as having a near-perfect English accent, projects that mix of sexiness (though muted here) and vulnerability that makes her appealing to both male and female members of the audience. <br/><br/>One specific criticism - the fight scene is a tad too savage and prolonged for a movie of this kind."

","Bridget Jones is an oddball, 30-something British woman who is desperate for a man in her life in the beginning and she manages to bag one by the end of the picture. Aside from that, I didn't see any character change whatsoever. That would require some insight that she gains in the course of the story and this romance is much too conventional for that.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong--Renee Zellweger is great playing Bridget with all of her goofy charm but beneath it all, this is some warmed-over Jane Austen piece crossed with much of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral."" The main reason she falls for this rude, blank of a guy Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) is because he says something nice to her at a party. She's so desperate for affection--any affection--she mistakes this for some kind of romance. This desperation is also why she has an affair with her lecherous boss (Hugh Grant), which provides some funny interplay, but ultimately makes her seem none-too-bright.<br/><br/>That's okay if you want to build a movie on a woman who makes those kind of wrong choices (like ""Muriel's Wedding"", for example) but, hopefully, she eventually wakes up and realizes she can be a complete person without necessarily having a man. Unfortunately, this movie is too gutless to even go there. It blindly accepts that premise, doesn't question it whatsoever, and passes it all off as some light and frothy romance about a ""modern"" woman. Bridget Jones was too good for either of these jerks!<br/><br/>As well, my wife and I were offended by the obvious and predictable songs on the soundtrack.

","I was pleasantly surprised to find that I actually like the movie better than the book.  My only disappointments were that the movie is way too short and that Colin Firth is not on-screen nearly enough.<br/><br/>The entire cast does a fantastic job of bringing Bridget Jones's quirky world to life.  Renee Zellweger effectively portrays Bridget Jones as slightly ridiculous but lovable, and Hugh Grant and Colin Firth are perfect in their respective roles.  It's certainly nice to see Hugh Grant finally take a break from the foppish, stuttering, self-deprecating persona he's been cultivating ever since Four Weddings & a Funeral---and his new buff look (as made evident in the lake/wet shirt scene) isn't bad either!  I only wish the writers had come up with a reason to have Colin shirtless (or at least wet!)<br/><br/>As much as I enjoyed the movie, the reason I and my friends have already seen this movie several times and will buy the DVD the day it comes out is Colin Firth and his quietly (but devastatingly) mesmerizing performance. Several critics have commented that Renee Zellweger and Colin Firth have no chemistry, but I beg to differ.  That very palpable chemistry (The way he looks at her when she's interviewing him? The incredibly charming cooking scene? The scene near the end where he leans down to kiss her on the cheek before she runs off to change into ""genuinely tiny knickers""?) is what makes the ultimate resolution of the movie so satisfying.<br/><br/>Having long been a fan of British films, I've always been aware of Colin Firth as an accomplished actor (e.g., Another Country, A Month in the Country, Valmont), but it wasn't until Pride & Prejudice that it dawned on me that he was also incredibly attractive.  He then went on to play rather unappealing characters in such films as Circle of Friends, The English Patient and Shakespeare in Love, and, me being the fickle fan that I am, forgot about my crush on him . . . until now.  As a ""serious actor,"" he seems to choose roles that will ""challenge"" him, and unfortunately for us besotted fans, they are often unattractive villains and cuckolds.  But I've come to realize that the fact that he is so successful at masking his undeniable attractiveness is a testament to his extraordinary acting ability.<br/><br/>It was clear from Disney's marketing and PR campaign that they felt Renee Zellweger and Hugh Grant would be the only draws here in the U.S., but I know a lot of people who went to see the movie because of Colin Firth.  I can only hope this film will earn him the recognition of audiences (and studios) beyond the legions of women who fell in love with him in P&P. It'd certainly be wonderful to see him fulfill his promise as a leading man (a la Ralph Fiennes and Russell Crowe) and leave all those ""character actor"" roles behind him.<br/><br/>It looks like Working Title Films is already talking with Renee Zellweger about making the film version of ""Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason."" Apparently, she's only interested if she doesn't have to gain weight again. Let's keep our fingers crossed that Colin Firth's desire to pursue more challenging roles  doesn't keep him from signing on for the sequel.  I can't imagine anyone else playing the role of Mark Darcy.<br/><br/>Finally, I'd just like to say that I wholeheartedly agree with other IMDB users who've described Colin Firth as ""sex on a stick,"" ""dreamy,"" ""swoonsome,"" ""a revelation,"" ""beautiful,"" ""delicious,"" ""riveting"" and weak-knee inducing.  I wonder how many of us will be trekking to London next year to see him on-stage in Hamlet?    SIGH . . ."

A dozen painfully trite sitcom situations, and a silly happy ending (after, of course, the most thoroughly unconvincing excuse for pre-climactic suspense I've ever seen). This is the sort of film that makes you feel like a heel if you don't have a knee-slapping, foot-tapping wonderful time, but I have to admit I did not enjoy it. The film lacks a center, has no sense of rhythm, and contains no genuine insights into the plight of the single girl, except for those harvested from a lifetime watching television sitcoms and television-sitcom-derived movies.<br/><br/>I left the film feeling empty, and wearing an ebbing smile."

But as good as all of these actors are, it's Zellweger that carries the movie. Her performance is perfectly nuanced -- she's funny, adorable, and goofy, and manages to convey just enough pain during her character's misadventures to be touching, while still letting you laugh.<br/><br/>It's an ideal date movie, and she's still as cute as a button with the extra weight she put on for the role."

","It's talented Miss Z (Renee Zellweger) meets Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth), with Hugh Grant the Imp-erfect boss, Gemma Jones the glamorous Mom, Jim Broadbent the tolerant Dad, and Embeth Davidtz as Natasha, shadowing Mark Darcy. If you've seen the A&E 1995 miniseries ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you might think that they intentionally have Firth as Mark Darcy in ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" The two Darcy's truly belong to Colin Firth, who delivered both characters with equal brilliance and restraint. The latter, being outside of Austen's landscape, provided more room for Firth's subtle comedic touch.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed the preview of director Sharon Maguire's 2001 ""Bridget Jones's Diary."" Zellweger put on 15-20 pounds and a British accent for the lead role. Once again, she optimized the chance to deliver the role with spot-on comedic tempo - one cannot not laugh and chuckle over the endearingly clumsy, not so articulate or business smart Miss Jones in her 30's, looking for the perfect man to take her away from the life of being single.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant certainly is taking risks these days - he was a charming swindler in Woody Allen's ""Small Time Crooks"" 2000; here in ""Bridget Jones's Diary,"" still exuding his infectious charm, Grant has no qualms in displaying the slapstick side of him, appearing uncouth and downright drenched and untidy (and 'bit of bloody, too.)<br/><br/>The audience at the preview obviously enjoyed the movie. I was unable to catch certain phrases due to the laughter and hearty chuckles. We're having such a good time watching Zellweger, Grant and Firth interacting. The dialogs were funny and engaging, and the plot is not entirely predictable - we were kept in suspense prior to the ending. (Demonstrating how easily we assume and react, thinking at once in our own perspective vs. pause to project - oh well, an inescapable human condition inherent to relationships, indeed.)<br/><br/>There was no ending credit roll at the preview, but the songs were catchy and finger tapping. I hope they will keep the beyond-ending segment of rolling the childhood video of Jones (at 4) and Darcy (at 8) - it sure adds depth to the history of love.<br/><br/>Other worthwhile Renee Zellweger films are: director Dan Ireland's ""Whole Wide World, The"" 1996, as Novalyne Price opposite Vincent D'Onofrio; director Boaz Yakin's ""Price Above Rubies, A"" 1998, a substantial gutsy role as a Jewish young woman in the jewelry business opposite Christopher Eccleston; director Carl Franklin's ""One True Thing"" 1998, as daughter to Meryl Streep and William Hurt; director Neil LaBute's ""Nurse Betty"" 2000, as Betty Sizemore, another funny and sensitive role, opposite Morgan Freeman, Aaron Eckhart, and Greg Kinnear."

","Helen Fielding originally started writing the leading fictional character's scribbling as articles for The Independent, this was later fully published and became the biggest selling book of the 1990s, so it was only right for her and rom-com writer Richard Curtis (Blackadder, The Vicar of Dibley, Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill) to team up and bring her to the big screen. Basically Bridget Jones (Oscar BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Renée Zellweger) is an average woman living in London who works in an office, has issues with her weight, smokes and drinks, has many imperfections, and is single. Following New Year, to take control of her life, Bridget decides to start a diary, to tell the complete truth, to try and change her habits, to lose weight and stop smoking, and express her true feelings about her job, her family and friends, and of course her pursuit to find the right man. Bridget works in publicity at a book publishing company, and fantasises about her boss, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant), one day he starts to flirt with her, and soon enough they embark on a relationship. Bridget has fallen head over heels for Daniel, but his feelings are not reciprocated, she discovers he is a womaniser, and he even becomes engaged to another woman, she quits her job at the publishing office and eventually finds work in television journalism. Bridget on many occasions encounters barrister Mark Darcy (BAFTA nominated Colin Firth), he is good looking, but she cannot stand him, she also assumes he is already dating colleague Natasha (Matilda's Embeth Davidtz), but he surprises her at event by confessing that he likes her. Bridget celebrates her birthday, inviting her friends round for dinner, only to cause chaos with her cooking skills, Mark is there to support and show affection for her, a drunken Daniel also shows up, assuming she was alone, Mark and he step outside and have a fight, Mark wins but is shunned away, while Daniel is rejected by Bridget. Meanwhile, Bridget's mother Pamela (Gemma Jones) has left Bridget's father Colin (Jim Broadbent) and started an affair with shopping channel presenter Julian (Patrick Barlow), they do reconcile, and Bridget's mother reveals a truth, Bridget assumed it was Mark who had an affair with Daniel's wife, in fact it is the other way around. Bridget at the Darcys' ruby wedding anniversary party she wants to confess her feelings for Mark, but she is devastated to find out that he and Natasha have accepted jobs in New York, but Bridget speaks out about how England will be losing a good man like Mark, her words obviously have an effect on him, but he stills travels to America. At Christmas time, Bridget's friends invite her to join them on a trip to Paris, France to forget all about Mark, but he surprises her showing up at her flat, they kiss for the first time, there is a moment when she assumes he leaves, after reading about her hatred for him in her diary, but they embrace in the snow after he explains he was buying her a new diary, to start the New Year. Also starring Smack the Pony's Sally Phillips as Sharon/Shazza, Shirley Henderson as Jude, James Callis as Tom, Celia Imrie as Una Alconbury, James Faulkner as Uncle Geoffrey, Drop the Dead Donkey's Neil Pearson as Richard Finch, Honor Blackman as Penny Husbands-Bosworth, Paul Ross as Mr. Sit Up Britain, Crispin Bonham-Carter (Helena's cousin) as Greg, Sarah Alexander as Daniel Cleaver Lover, Salman Rushdie and Jeffrey Archer. Zellweger does an impeccable British accent and is adorable as the 30-somthing heroine who gets herself into embarrassing situations but you root for, Firth is very likable as the good looking uptight lawyer, and Grant is splendid and escapes the posh twit persona seen previously to becomes a caddish bastard. All the acting by the ensemble cast of stellar Brits is great, the script is witty, daftly funny, hilariously cringy and suitably sweet, and the pop music soundtrack, including ""Out of Reach"" by Gabrielle and ""Have You Met Miss Jones?"" by Robbie Williams is great, it just has all the right ingredients, a brilliant romantic comedy. It was nominated the BAFTA Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film and Best Adapted Screenplay, it was nominated the British Comedy Award for Best Comedy Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Hugh Grant was number 73 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 8 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, Colin Firth was number 29 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, the film was number 52 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 48 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!"

","This was shown as an in-flight movie and its a good thing too, otherwise I would have walked out on it. Renée Zellweger's accent is grating to listen to and the story is very weak. Although I like Renée Zellweger in other films I have seen, she is horrible in this story. The film has no contrast because there are few frames of the film that Renée Zellweger doesn't appear in. The truly milk-toast matter in which her character is presented is insulting to her acting talents. I think too much focus on the fact she beefed up for the role was about the only thing done right for the film. I feel the hype about her weight gain was to compare her efforts to Robert De Niro as he did in Raging Bull. This is no classic."

But what is worse is the character she plays - an annoying, simpering, pouting, insecure, overweight woman whose sole preoccupation is trying to keep relationships with men who obviously do not care about her and should have absolutely nothing to do with her. The character is so unattractive, indeed abrasive, that there should be no surprise that she has problems maintaining relationships. But Ms. Zellweger's horrible, phony British accent is just too much to bear. The producer of this movie couldn't find an English woman to play Bridgit Jones? They had to hire an American actress? Why not have Brad Pitt play Hugh Grant's character? If you like movies which feature American actors playing unattractive, piggish-looking people, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, stay away!

"ccave-62620","6","1","2","3 May 2019"," Destroyed by it's own hype
","I probably would have enjoyed this movie more had there not been so much hype around it. But sadly the expectations were established and definitely not met.<br/><br/>Bridget is likeable in a goofball sort of way, and has a few good moments, but overall it was difficult to respect her character and therefor root for her success.<br/><br/>It was also difficult to find the relationships believable - especially between her and Darcy, who had little to no interaction. One thing I did like was how she and Darcy noted each other's faults before expressing their love. Too often people have this misconception that true love is someone who finds you perfect and who you find perfect. Those who have been in long term relationships know this isn't the case. There is something genuine in saying ""I see the worst in you and I love you"" and it's a rare take for a romcom.<br/><br/>Darcy's business partners role was unnecessary and served no purpose to the plot, other than to make me question how good of a guy Darcy really was. He consistently included her in his life in such a personal way with no purpose other than to avoid attending functions alone. Given how even his family and friends viewed their relationship by the end, it was clear he was knowingly misleading her. But because Bridget is our lead, the writers don't care about the emotional games this woman would be subjected to.<br/><br/>It had great potential, but is one of those films you'll only really enjoy if you dont think about it too much."

","I wouldn't call ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" the best movie of 2001 (and I usually have no interest in ""chick flicks""), but I do think that it was worth seeing. Renee Zellweger plays the titular character, a working Brit who has some plans to drastically change her life. I think that Colin Firth's and Hugh Grant's characters weren't totally necessary, but I guess that they were conduits of a sort. Bridget herself can gravitate between sweet and bitchy, and she does just that. Overall, Zellweger's energy makes the movie really good. I don't know whether anyone else would have done the role better, but she certainly does a good job. Definitely worth seeing."

I couldn't help but feel a morbid adoration for Daniel Cleaver; for some strange reason, I didn't really find him charming in the beginning of the movie, but I digress. The lovely constituents of this movie combined with each other to make this splendid comedy. All the cast members in this movie did an excellent job, and so did all the crew members. Renée Zellweger, Colin Firth, and Hugh Grant acted extremely well, and Sharon Maguire directed the movie superbly; digressing once more, I have to credit Helen Fielding for writing the book that inspired this movie in the first place.

"crazychap","8","1","2","24 May 2005"," Brilliant film!
","Bridget Jones is not only one of the best date films of all time, it-s a work of art. To tell you the truth, it's better than most of the chick flicks I often watch with my girlfriend. I've read the book so I know the plot {again, many scenes have been omitted and others, like the fight scene, added in to give the movie some feel}.<br/><br/>The movie is about a modern-day young woman living in London... actually, about a woman in her early 30s... with no serious relationship, unmarried, overweight-- her weight often resembles that of a man's--, and someone who simply spits out whatever she thinks about, regardless of the consequences. But this year is the year in which she finally experiences love, and also ends up in a dilemma: She must chose between her charming boss {superb performance by Hugh Grant}, and the far more reserved barrister Mark Darcy {Colin Firth give an equally great performance}.<br/><br/>Although I'm disappointed by the fact that many scenes have been omitted from the book-- those who didn't read the book I shan't reveal them--, This is nevertheless a movie with a great plot, performances and charm.<br/><br/>All of the three leads steal the show in his/her own way. Zellweger--being an American-- seemed an unlikely bird to play a typically British character, but She makes it very believable that those who never heard-- I knew from watching JERRY MAGUIRE years before-- of her thought she was a Brit herself. I couldn't imagine anyone playing Bridget, not even Winslet, who was one of the leading bets-- who almost got the part but was dropped because she was too young, 24 at the time, for the role--. Hugh Grant gives charisma to the naughty Daniel Cleaver, and sidesteps his usual characters. Colin Firth gives a comeback to familiar ground-- I remember watching PRIDE and PREJUDICE in 1995, in which he became a star in the UK-- as the solicitor Mark Darcy with no problems at all.<br/><br/>For anyone who plans to strike a relationship or is in one already, this a perfect film to put and it is More than just a ""date movie"" or ""chick flick"". TO end it, it is by far one of my favourite films that is amusing all the way."

","Bridget Jones's Diary: 4/10: There have been a great number of woman's films that have successfully crossed over to the mainstream. Sleepless in Seattle, Jerry Maguire and Aliens are three classic examples of ""chick flicks"" that men can watch with their ladies, enjoy the film, and still get credit for being a sensitive guy that likes what she likes. <br/><br/>Bridget Jones's Diary tries to come across as a frothy crossover comedy. You know one of those estrogen flicks that Hugh Grant now does since Tom Hanks was shipped off to make ""important films"". Diary however doesn't successfully crossover. It's a real chick flick through and through. <br/><br/>The thirty something equivalent of Sixteen Candles. In fact it seems to have basically the same plot and characters as that John Hughes eighties perennial. Instead of our sixteen-year-old ugly duckling we have a thirty two year old overweight alcoholic with virtually no social skills. And instead of one impossible cute and rich suitor we now have two impossible rich and handsome suitors that fight over our protagonist. <br/><br/>Now I have always felt Renee Zellweger was easy on the eyes and talented to boot. As for the extra weight she put on,(An act that the media with a straight face called ""brave"") well let's just say she wears it well. Her character however is such a horrible deceptive person that one really wonders why either man would want her for anything more than a quick shag. <br/><br/>Like those other lovable raging alcoholics of the silver screen say Arthur or The McKenzie Brothers two hours of screen time is one thing but day-to-day living is another. One really wonders how long either man would really stick around with Miss Jones? (A: Till he got tired of shagging her.) <br/><br/>One last question. What's is with the music? It's Raining Men? Ain't No Mountain High Enough? Does the CIA use this soundtrack on prisoners at Abu Ghraib? Doesn't the Geneva Convention mean anything?"
"flipgirl38","Null","1","2","14 December 2004"," Perfectly Charming Tale of the Average Woman
","Year 2001, a heroine entered theaters whom women could identify with. A woman with insecurities over her looks and weight, over drinking and smoking her life away, and not being able to find and hold onto the right guy. And that right there played into all the insecurities every woman on the face of the planet faces everyday. Who is this woman? Why, Bridget Jones, a 32 year old British woman living in London! Normally, a character in Bridget's position would in a typical movie be the supporting player, the one off to the side with the sub plot and the witty one liners, becoming very two dimensional and stereotypical. Yet with this film, that stereotype is given prominence, and how wonderfully it succeeds! Depressed over the comment Mark Darcy made about her (He called her a spinster) at her parent's annual Christmas party, Bridget decides to finally take control of her life, to cut back on drinking and smoking, to lose weight, and to find a nice man to make her happy. To keep track of all this, she decides to keep a journal.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger was perfectly charming in this film, creating Bridget Jones into a sweet, adorable, likable character that was very easy to relate to. People thought Renee wouldn't be able to convincingly pull off her British accent, but watching the film you sometimes forget that she is actually American. Renee was able to convey the stress of keeping her spirits up after discovering that her boss was cheating on her, and slowly discovering that her perfect man had been in front of her all along. Her Oscar nomination was absolutely deserved.<br/><br/>Colin Firth was amazing in his role of Mark Darcy. Though he really does not say much throughout the film, you could always tell what he is feeling just by looking at his eyes. They convey so many words that Firth could have been silent the whole film and you would be able to understand him perfectly. But it is wonderful that he does speak, for the speech he gives to Bridget about ""Liking her just the way she is"" was so sweetly put, it makes you long for someone to say those words to you.<br/><br/>Hugh Grant, who before this was type cast as the dorky-sweet romantic lead, breaks from this with his role as Daniel Cleaver. Hugh Grant is one of those actors who brings so much more to the role that you could ever expect, and with this character, Grant does not disappoint. Hr plays the wanker down to a T, is convincingly caddy, and the playboy everyone wants but knows will be in trouble if they have him. Not to mention, watching Cleaver and Darcy fight near the end of the film will have you rolling in the aisles!<br/><br/>Bridget Jones's Diary. Probably considered a total chick flick, but has a wonderful theme: Being yourself is all you'll ever need, and accepting yourself for who and what you are will lead you to happiness.<br/><br/>Highly recommended.<br/><br/>MJR"

","The overrated movie of Helen Fielding's newspaper columns and later book, 'Bridget Jones's Diary', flops onto the screen and never really goes anywhere.<br/><br/>Renee Zellweger plays the annoying singleton who drinks and smokes a lot, mimes (badly) to junk like 'All By Myself', and thinks life begins and ends with a man. She gets two to choose from - love rat Daniel Cleaver (her boss, Hugh Grant, who flirts with her by email in the office) and sensible Mark Darcy (Colin Firth, in a part which gently sends up his Pride and Prejudice role of a few years earlier) - but, being Bridget, can't make up her mind.<br/><br/>Is Bridget Jones an interesting character? No. She's a silly and empty-headed character, not even funny. I can't see the attraction. Grant and Firth are OK but both are playing clichéd characters.

","...is what some people may not have liked about this movie. Firstly, compared to the way Renee Z normally looks, she is overweight. And, the fact that her character is far from perfect, saying and doing inappropriate things at the wrong times helps us to relate to her. She is a regular person; who has not put their foot in their mouth from time to time? Or did something totally embarrassing? Everyone should be able to relate to her.<br/><br/>Her character is non-pretentious which is part of her appeal. Bridget is fun loving, genuine, honest and funny. She is not unlike most of us, looking for love while we sometimes trudge through the mundane everydayness of life. Well cast and acted, a little corny at times, but fun!"
"Bob A-2","6","1","2","26 June 2004"," A bit too much cynicism passing for humor
","Saw Bridget Jones's Diary last night. Audience liked it, I must admit, but for me it was nasty and obnoxious. The fact that she's cynical is automatically inferred to mean she's funny. In the first five minutes she's put down her mother for serving pickles on toothpicks as hors d'oeuvre, a potential boyfriend for wearing a funny reindeer sweater at a Christmas party, and a gay man simply because women have some unquestionable God-given right to do so. The unintentional irony is that, for all Bridget's self-alleged independence, the picture's central, driving purpose is to attach her to a wealthy, influential man, at which point her story will end -- in marriage. Ultimately nothing better than a throwback to most of the Julie Andrews musicals (My Fair Lady, Cinderella, Sound of Music, Thoroughly Modern Millie) of ancient times -- minus the songs. The other irony is, even Julie's material has grown beyond such a shallow self-image for modern women.<br/><br/>Snowflakes at the end looked fake in close-ups."
"teddyryan","Null","1","2","21 June 2004"," boring
","BRIDGET JONES'S DIARY creates a world where sex, dating, and emotions are like a CD you broke.  Yeah, it sucks it's in three pieces but you can always get a new one at the store.  This kind of attitude in filmmaking creates a relaxed atmosphere for the audience and allows us to see society like a circus as opposed to acknowledging it as anything real.  SEX AND THE CITY carries the same objective and makes the trendy singles scene look fun, happening, and intriguing.  Unfortunately, if a filmmaker's goal is to obtain a recognition of truth, BRIDGET JONES and its cousin fall far off. Although casted well and executed in a cute summer reading fashion, the movie continuously catapults us into English bar set ups, where each member drinks heavily in order to create a comic event.  Therefore, when the director tries to create a poignant scene with sustinence, it takes off to what Keith Moon would refer to a lead zeppelin."
"movieguy1021","6","1","2","31 January 2004"," Bridget Jones's Diary: 6/10
","If there's anything I hate more than overrated movies, it's overhyped movies that don't even begin to live up to their reputation. Bridget Jones's Diary is one of the latter. With an original premise (which is of course taken from a book), a rising star, and charm out the wazoo, how could you go wrong? It's all in the marketing. A clever comedy has to have two things. A consistent clever quality to it and comedy. When lacking in either of these two categories, the company (usually Miramax) just overhypes it (as they're great at doing) so it'll be like the next Gone with the Wind or something and make sure that everyone knows that the lead actress packed on a couple extra pounds. And, unfortunately, that's what this movie is.<br/><br/>The title character (Renée Zellweger) is a slightly overweight, slight neurotic thirtysomething who has a menial job and wants to make something out of her life. So she starts a diary and becomes romanticly involved with her boss. Without the diary, the movie would just be another British chick flick. The diary adds some characteristic to the movie, but, as most movies do, anything interesting they could do with the material is defenestrated for general romantic comed clichés and stereotyped characters.<br/><br/>Why am I being so harsh on it, you may ask? Well, I had been hearing the hype for two years, since the movie first came out. ""Oh, Renée is so good, she gained 25 pounds!"" ""The movie is hilarious!"" Oftentimes I can just put away the hype and go in with an open mind. But I did not see this before hearing about it; if I had, I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more. For example, I saw My Big Fat Greek Wedding before it was huge and grossed over $200 million at the box office. I enjoyed it a lot, but if I watched it for the first time now, I'm sure I'd be thinking exactly what I am about this movie here. I was led to believe that this movie was strikingly original, nothing else had been done before that was even remotely close to it. As I have mentioned earlier, the only original part of it was the fact that the diary was getting us closer to Bridget's life. But after the first twenty minutes or so, when they knew they had us in, they took it out and went to cliché land.<br/><br/>There were some funny moments to it, though. Nothing was down-and-out hilarious, but many points were pretty humorous, although I wouldn't be able to name them now. It's not one of those movies that sticks with you, it's just one of those that you can use to pass the time and that can be used by production companies for unnecessary sequels.<br/><br/>Renée (who starred in here before she became America's it-girl) was pretty good and mastered a British accent masterfully, and proves that she's worthy of a future in romantic comedy. Hugh Grant, as Bridget's boss, is his usual self, and Colin Firth, as Bridget's other love interest, is alright, but that added a few plot holes, such as: if Bridget could never get a guy all of her life, how come suddenly she gets two at the same time, not to mention they look like Hugh Grant and Colin Firth? I guess I'm overreacting, but when I see something that's not what it's cracked up to me, I get upset, which is how Bridget Jones's Diary made me feel.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10<br/><br/>Rated R for language and some strong sexuality."

","After yet another year of loneliness and disappointments in love Bridget decides to improve her lot and find love while keeping track of her progress in her diary.  She gets involved with her cad of a boss, Daniel, but also is attracted to the upright Mark Darcy.  Will she get either or loose both?<br/><br/>Brought to cinemas on a wave of hype due to the success of the book this was well looked for.  I've never read the book  nor do I read those type of books so I had an open mind but feared I may not like it.  The plot is relatively straightforward but is quite amusing.  The jokes are funny and some of the situations are very good.  It also boasts the most realistic fight put on film (no fancy moves or punches  just two men swinging, kicking and scrabbling around).  What put me off was the similarities to the US TV show Ally McBeal.<br/><br/>Like Ally McBeal the film uses fantasy scenes that only exist in our character's head and she has a troublesome love life.  This is OK but it does give you the feeling you've seen it al before somewhere.  The bigger problem is that the character suffers from the same problems as Ally  in that you want her to just get a grip and grow up.  For women this is different as they may see elements in the character that they can recognise in themselves (like many men could in High Fidelity's Rob Gordon), however for me Ally is irritating as she seeks perfection and is never happy. Bridget has the same basic character and it makes her hard to get behind  the only sentiment I can say I felt for the lead was pity rather than empathy.<br/><br/>That said Zellweger still does a good job  her accent is good and she does manage to look a little frumpy and put upon.  Ignoring the question of why they couldn't get a British actress to do it (one word  money) then she does well.  Grant is funny in a harder role than usual  he still does hi usual stammering bit but at least he's a bit more of a cad than a fop. Firth is a bit Stoney but is good and the support cast (including Jim Broadbent) are all good.<br/><br/>Overall this is funny but it is definitely for girls as many men will fail to sympathise with the character of Bridget.  I saw some of her in many of my women friends of the same age but I still couldn't get past the idea that she was a bit irritating.

Will she find it?<br/><br/> Well watch the movie and see it for your self, as for me, I didn't search the answers with her, I just simply enjoyed an hour and half romantic comedy (heh, with a touch of British humor), though i would prefer that Hugh Grant would play a casual-looking guy with a ""deer-pullover"" instead of ""woman-just-can-resist-me"" type of boss.

","I found this movie to be good, heartwarming and funny. I couldn't stop laughing at Bridget's misadventures, or feeling bad about her problems in life.<br/><br/>But realistic? No.<br/><br/>Here we have an incult, compulsive, alcoholic, chain smoker, whom, we are supposed to believe, gets the affection of the most decent, intelligent, witty and educated guy on the whole movie. That is a little bit too much to believe; I can understand the physical attraction part, but no sane man with such qualifications would dare to get romantically involved with a ticking time bomb of a woman. She was a great couple to Hugh Grant's character: both were basically airheads, only caring about love and sex in the most basic of ways. In fact, being harsh to Bridget's character, even Hugh would have been bored by Bridget's... hmmm... stupidity.<br/><br/>Maybe that was too harsh, but I tried to find something, anything of value to Bridget's character. The only thing I found was her desire to find true love. The rest was shockingly bad: she was mediocre, full of vices, dumb, incoherent at times, fat, etc.<br/><br/>I think I am looking too much into the movie. Maybe the whole thing was an exaggeration on loneliness and the failure of a human to find a partner in this time and age. If so, then this film is simply superb. If it is meant as an accurate depiction, then I don't think it's as good.<br/><br/>Last, but not least, the minute I saw Renee, I was shocked. Was she the same woman that appeared as a sex symbol in ""Me, Myself and Irene""? She looks *terrible*. I wonder if she gained weight in order to appear in this movie (I don't think any woman alive would do that), or if she got the part because of her figure. Terrible."

Hugh Grant is great - makes a change from his usual bumbling foppishness, and really well cast.<br/><br/>I have added this film to a list that includes Match Point, Sliding Doors and any of Richard Curtis' films - namely - awful, but so bad, they are worth watching just for the unintentional comedy."

","Want to know what its like to live in England? Ask Richard Curtis. Hes always on hand to paint a picture of London life as imagined stateside - a London where everyone is middle class, has eccentric friends who are frightfully naughty because they swear a bit - where the ever so slightly repressed English handle sex with a mixture of crude embarrassment and the odd 'outrageous' outburst and a London in which it always snows at Christmas. If reality was half this middle of the road we might all kill ourselves with two and half big neurofens to a large glass of Chardonnay but thankfully this version of my fair city only exists in the mind of the Chelsea set and the Oxbridge media cult. Women love Bridget Jones of course, shes one of them you see. She worries about being fat, drinks too much, gets screwed over by men all the time (they ARE bastards aren't they?) and is prone to getting squiffy and making a fool of herself. A comfortable caricature for a lot of people I'm sure and lets be honest, if you identify with Bridget then its odds on that you've never held an original thought in your life. I'll bet you drink Pinot Grigo at pubs, are currently on a fad diet, have a fitness video hosted by an ex-Big Brother contestant and read Heat magazine. OK, you may say, what's wrong with a light bit of fairytale entertainment? Well nothing except that it seems to be the only kind of national representation that has any hope of being made these days and it gets on my bloody nerves. Also, would it be possible for an English lead to be played by, wait for it, an Englishwoman? Its bad enough that we've got to watch ourselves being parodied but surely to God we don't have to be impersonated as well? Incidentally, and I don't wish to offend anyone...which obviously isn't true but stick with it, there's nothing remotely funny about being the sort of Cosmo reading, ever so slightly kooky girl depicted here - if this is you, sit down and have a rethink tonight - life's too short to be a cliché."
"Anonymous_Maxine","6","1","3","6 August 2002"," Not as good as some of Hugh Grant's other romantic comedies, but Bridget Jones's Diary stands out as one of the better comedies of 2001.
","First of all, yes, I realize that it sounds kind of ironic to say that Bridget Jones's Diary is not as GOOD as other Hugh Grant movies, but keep in mind that even this hideously charming English actor has come out with some genuinely entertaining and memorable films (I am thinking, in particular, of films like Four Weddings and A Funeral and especially Notting Hill and even several of his other films that are not Mickey Blue Eyes). With Bridget Jones's Diary, director Sharon Maguire approaches the daunting task of attempting to convince the (American) public that there is a big-breasted blonde played by Renee Zellweger who has made it to her thirties without ever having had a boyfriend, and the film that results from this effort depicts the point in her life where she happens to gain two boyfriends at once. <br/><br/>At the time that Bridget Jones's Diary was released, Hugh Grant had recently starred in Notting Hill, in which he famously uttered the words 'whoopsy-daisy,' removing any room for respect from his character that there might once have been, although at the same time making us love him whether we liked it or not as well as realize that his character was made un-respectable for that very reason. Because of this uncomfortable but ultimately pleasing love for his character in that film, we are willing to forgive a lot of the terrible things that he does in Bridget Jones's Diary, but only when we see him change from the womanizer that he amazingly plays in this film and reverts into the same caricature character that he always plays (see my Mickey Blue Eyes review) that we have grown to know and love, for the most part. <br/><br/>Colin Firth, on the other hand, has just come out of his role in Shakespeare in Love, where he played the jerk who Viola De Lesseps was forced to marry, despite our desperate wish that she would find a way to escape the arranged marriage and marry her true love, William Shakespeare. Bridget Jones's Diary plays off of both of these past performances in the formation of its story, suggesting (erroneously) that the roles were written for the actors and greatly enhancing the effect of its plot. <br/><br/>I remember watching this film and being disappointed from within minutes of the film that I was going to watch a childish exercise in the traditional romantic comedy (indeed, it's not hard during the e-mail trading within the office to assume that Bridget and her boss, played by Hugh Grant, are going to go through some weak romance trouble and then wind up happily in love at the end of the film). There is an interesting introduction of the other love interest in Colin Firth's character, who she hates from the moment we meet him. And, if I may interject for a moment, on a personal level, my two best and closest friendships, with Ryan Collette and Kyle Blount, started exactly the same way. When we met in high school, there were times that we were literally inches away from fistfights, and now, several years later, they're brothers to me. There is nothing that I wouldn't do for them or them for me, and it's interesting to consider whether something like this inspired the introduction we see of Firth's character into the film or whether the writers were simply trying to come up with something original.<br/><br/>In any case, it doesn't matter, because while the film doesn't exactly generate the most respect in the way that it plods through its content (some of the interactions between Bridget and her two men are less than convincing, which is nearly catastrophic because the success of the film depends exactly on whether the audience is convinced of that very thing), there is a genuine element of not knowing how the story is going to end up. We are torn between our love for some of Hugh Grant's previous characters (as well as our expectation that the more well-known actor will end up victorious regardless) and our hatred from Colin Firth's character in Shakespeare in Love alone (a testament to the quality of that movie as well as to his performance within it) in trying to decide for ourselves what is to become of Bridget Jones's love life in the future. <br/><br/>There's a scene where this indecisiveness between the two suitors comes to a climax, when they both get into a fistfight in the snow-covered street, but the uncertainty of who she is going to end up with pursues until near the end of the film, when it becomes progressively obvious. True, this is not the best love story ever presented on film, but Bridget Jones's Diary is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the last few years."

Bridget Jones's Diary had middle-aged UK women in mind, and it's hard to imagine one would like this movie if he or she did not fit that exact profile.<br/><br/>Bridget Jones's Diary is the story of a single woman who doesn't want to be single anymore. Two suitors fight for her hand.<br/><br/>What really killed this movie was the character of Bridget Jones herself. The woman is not functional. In everything she does, Jones is cartoonishly inept. This ineptitude quickly stops being cute and becomes totally insufferable for the viewer. All of the movie's humor comes from Jones finding a way to embarrass herself. Sometimes she gives an awkward speech at a public event, sometimes she accidentally offends her friends and coworkers, et cetera. This constant use of cringe humor is lazy and unfunny.<br/><br/>Why are there two men fighting over this woman? Both men are handsome and very successful in their work.

","Bridget Jones is a crazy woman. She's in her early 30's and single. However she's full of hope and she managed to get her boss, Daniel Cleaver, interested in her by a skirt (or lack of it) she wore to work one day. I think their relationship was too rushed and too full of sex. It's no surprise it didn't work out. After detaching herself from Daniel, she's hit on by Mark Darcy, one of her childhood acquaintances. Apparently, she fell in love with Mr. Darcy after he said that he liked Bridget ""just the way she was"".<br/><br/>The movie is subtly implying that women can't live without men- a woman is nothing without a man. Bridget should learn to stand up for herself. Even when single, she's already mentally and emotionally unstable, with her drinking and smoking problem! So how can she survive a relationship? Then again, this comes from a teenager who's been single since birth, so you can feel free to disregard that.<br/><br/>Despite the subliminal messages, this movie was okay. I couldn't see Shirley Henderson as anyone other than Moaning Myrtle in the Harry Potter series. I had to pause in the beginning of the movie, when I heard her moaning/complaining to Bridget. Anyway, this movie was not Colin Firth's best movie. And DEFINITELY not Hugh Grant's best one. However, Renée Zellweger was perfect for this role. Even though I haven't read the books (but I am planning to!), Renée just seems like a Bridget Jones! Her English accent wasn't that bad, either.<br/><br/>I was turned off by Bridget's alcohol and smoking problem, but her awkwardness and silliness made her lovable and easy to relate with. When I first watched this movie at a young age, I remember rooting for Daniel, simply because I was in love with Hugh Grant. And every time the ending came on, with Bridget in her underwear, kissing Mark Darky.. Yeech. I always thought, ""Why would she pick him when she could have Grant?!""

In fact, one could easily see this as a screwball comedy back in the '30s if Hollywood made the story starring Lombard, Cary Grant (not Colin Firth) and James Stewart (not Hugh Grant). Get my drift? Instead, Miss Zellweger looks more like pudgy Lynn Redgrave of ""Georgy Girl,"" an overweight and rather awkward young woman given to wearing tight clothing and making the most inappropriate remarks at the most crucial moments. She speaks her mind without any regard for the consequences and lands into one troublesome social situation after another because of her quirky attitude.<br/><br/>An inside joke has COLIN FIRTH's character called Mr. Darcy--and indeed, he behaves as that gentleman did in ""Pride and Prejudice,"" at first utterly rejecting Bridget Jones and then making a pass at her which she turns down, only to change her mind before the final reel.<br/><br/>HUGH GRANT has a thankless role as a witless cad but plays it with his usual charm, the sort of role James Stewart might have done had this been made back in Hollywood's Golden Age when screwball comedy was just as mad but a lot less risqué.<br/><br/>But Renee, Colin and Hugh are not Lombard, Grant or Stewart and the film suffers because none of them can make this kind of material seem like anything more than a manipulative romantic comedy about an awkward girl finding her Prince Charming in a Jane Austen kind of way--with all the modern sensibilities destroying most of the charm.<br/><br/>Unless you're a devoted fan of these stars, this one is pretty hard to recommend except as very lightweight entertainment in quirky British style, but Bridget's gaffes are too monumental to be accepted by Darcy."

Another coincidence you say, your smile becoming less relaxed.<br/><br/>3. In Pride and Prejudice, the two youngest girls are foolish and flirtatious, Mary is awkward and studious, Jane is kind spirited and Elizabeth has discernment and common sense.

Arguing who was the best guy for her, as I did in my original review is besides the point. Besides, what is more off putting about this film is that Bridget stupidity is supposed to be representative of the modern woman.

","I can't remember watching a film after which I felt less interest in the fate of ANY of the characters. The story is told without any feeling or energy whatsoever, with the sole exception of the Hugh Grant role (Daniel), and even he is far below his usual standard. Colin Firth is so wooden he has caused me to re-evaluate my opinion of the acting talent of Keanu Reeves. The film is nominally a romantic comedy, but the degree of apparent romantic attraction between Bridget and Mark (Firth) can only be described as microscopic even at the end of the film, when they've managed to get together. It's also hard to see what Daniel (Grant's 'Mr. Wrong') sees in Bridget, who is consistently presented unattractively, with respect to clothing, behavior, physical attributes, and personality. Perhaps it's that the two of them are equally shallow. As for comedy, the film (ie. the director) time after time walks away from potential significant comic scenes with a whimper, not a bang. This, after taking some pains to set those scenes up. Cases in point: the fire station interview, and the tarts and vicars party. In both of these cases we are apparently supposed to take the semi-exposure of Bridget's ample backside as sufficient comic payoff for the setup. This is more like British TV humor of the Benny Hill genre than what I expect to see as humor in a major motion picture. Given all of the above, and in all fairness, there are indeed four reasons to see this film: (1) Bridget's speech at the book launch, which is actually quite funny, (2) the fight between Daniel and Mark with their apologetic asides to the restaurant patrons as they trash the place, (3) Zellweger's British accent, which I wouldn't have thought possible, and (4) Daniel's stunning book-lined apartment, which appears, unfortunately, only briefly. None of these, of course, are important."
"callanvass","9","0","2","25 December 2004"," EXCELLENT Romance/comedy
","This was an excellent Romance/comedy film that is good natured and very funny. Renee and Colin were wonderful together and had very good chemistry. I'm not usually into these type of movies, there more like chick flicks, but this one was excellent it had a very good story and Renee is absolutely irresistible . However there is a problem i had (a minor one) and that was Hugh Grant i can't stomach this guy he annoys the crap out of me, and find him cocky and arrogant, and thankfully he didn't have a ton of screen time. The dialog is engaging and witty and i loved the scenes with Firth and Renee. The acting is Oscar Worthy. Renee Zellweger gives an Oscar worthy performance here, she is EXTREMELY likable had great chemistry with Firth (and as much as i hate to admit it Hugh Grant too, plus she was pretty hot. Hugh Grant did okay here and had good chemistry with Renee but i am just not a fan of his. Colin Firth is Excellent here and very likable, and i loved the Hugh Grant and Firth fight scene!, plus his chemistry with Renee is so on!. Gemma Jones is good as Bridget;s mom but didn't have much to do. Jim Broadbent was good as Bridget's dad. Overall i highly recommend this funny romantic comedy you won't be disappointed! ****1/2 out of 5 a must see!"
"jmverville","7","0","2","7 December 2004"," Surprisingly Good
","When I saw previews for this film, as a man, I thought that it would not appeal to me. It was really by chance -- seeing it on while a former roommate was watching it, sitting down, expecting to leave within the next five minutes, but I ended up watching the entire thing, becoming completely incapable of pulling myself away from it. In fact, I would later feel compelled to drag somebody along with me to see the sequel that came out in the Fall of 2004 on opening night. It became very obvious that I was greatly mistaken.<br/><br/>In an age where 'war' films like Pearl Harbor contain sappy romance stories, this was very bizarre seeing something that was a Romantic Comedy that was more of a comedy than a sappy, cliché Romance that makes the more sound of mind wish to vomit. I find that opposed to other romantic comedies, this one really embodies a sense of a realist's look at life, and as opposed to focusing on sexy women trying to get sexy men with horrible, predictable jokes being thrown in on occasion, this is far more refreshing. Great performances by everybody involved, and a very refreshing story overall.<br/><br/>It breaks all the stereotypes of modern comedy, lacking any crudeness or immature antics, and it breaks all the stereotypes of Romance, giving an honest portrayal of a relationship and the attitudes of normal people, often poking fun at itself. As far as major motion pictures go, this one is a tremendous surprise as far as entertainment & content go. It is the kind of film that anybody can appreciate. <br/><br/>If I were to make a list of films that pleasantly surprised me, this would probably be at the very top. A tremendous production."

"panasit","Null","0","1","21 November 2004"," A great romance movie, but the very best of the romantic comedy genre.
","There is something enjoyable but tiresome about watching a bunch of 30 something depress woman trying to find a man before their biological clock expired (though none of them seem to want any kids... so what's the rush). At first glance, Bridget Jones follow the formula of Ally McBeal and Sex and the City. These women want to be in a deep and committed relationship, though they do not to be ""trapped"" in a committed relationship (because... woman rights. Haven't you heard?). Calling it a hard task is an understatement.<br/><br/>So, I was expecting something I have seen before in TV shows/sitcom that is now being put in movie form. I rented the DVD along with a bunch others, and on the day I have to return them, I force myself to watch it in a ""now or never let just get it over with"" situation. I worked late the night before, came home at 12 and sleep at 3 in the morning. I woke up at 8 to use the bathroom and I realized that I want to return the DVDs early, so I have start watching it with my eyes half open. 10 minutes in and I couldn't stop smiling. This movie is just so cheerful and funny. This is what movie is supposed to be, entertainment. And it is extremely entertaining. Now, I own it on DVD and saw it twice.<br/><br/>Romantic Comedy genre is weak in my opinion. I think the best romance in film bury within other type of genre that is not comedy. Movie like You Got Mail, Truth About Cats and Dogs, Addicted to Love, etc. They all are just something to watch when you are bored, and has no classic feeling to it; even a gigantic Oscar hit like As Good As It Gets, which I loved. Best romance I see comes from Drama like Casablanca, Adventure like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, and Epic like Far and Away, or *sigh, Titanic. Now, after watching all those, I can safely say that Bridget Jones beat them all (well, except Casablanca for the obvious reason, it being the best movie of all time and all). Here's Why:<br/><br/>So many people have all ready mention how flawless Renee's (girl from Texas) British accent is, so I'm not going to bother, and go right to the meat. Bridget Jones is a lot like Ally McBeal in term of character design. She wear short skirts, flirt with men at her work place, and have eating disorder. Ally McBeal, however, failed where she tried too little, just whining and sleeping with strangers until none of us has the energy to cheer for her (and she didn't find true love in the end). Jone is much more mature like characters from Sex and the City. The only thing that she didn't have are money, which in my opinion, let us relate to her better.<br/><br/>I take love very seriously, and most of my friends, myself included, are all being sadistically torture by it. What I love about Bridget Jones is that even though we realize she is desperate and obviously have low self-esteem, she still won't settle for less. Usually a girl who is overweight (or at least think she is overweight.. I think she looks cute and sexy in the movie with her weight gain, a dude's opinion) and doesn't have a steady boyfriend until they turn thirty (where the movie began) are those who might willing to settle for a lesser man. But when one of the men in the movie become rude to her or disrespectful to her, she knows what to do. She never go cry to anyone with her relationship problem. She worked at it on her own, may be asking advice from friends on what to say here and there, but never whine about it. There's no ""why don't you just..."", she did everything a smart and intelligent woman would do. Not bad for a girl who thinks El Nino is a latin band. Is there a latin band called El Nino?<br/><br/>I was reading some of the review by men about how Bridget Jones' Dairy ruin a generation of young girls by saying that it's okay to be fat, sloppy, clumsy, idiot, and still think there is a chance of finding a good man. First of all, that male person is probably a closet case because straight men like women with curve. Second, those kind of people and their way of thinking is why this movie is so important. No matter how hard we try, none of us can be perfect. Life is a battle. You fight for money, you fight for survival. Fighting to look good and pro-create is just one of the things some people don't really need. The reason we want to find our significant other is to ease the heaviness of the fighting. To make coming home from work late at night only to get up early the next day to pay for the house you barely spend any time in, more bearable. We understand that about Bridget, and relate to her. And when a man comes in to tell her he likes her Just The Way She Is, call it unrealistic, call it cheer dumb luck or whatever. But if that scene is too impossible to happen and too much to ask for from the real world, then more of this kind of movie need to exist. A lot more.<br/><br/>There are some things about the movie that I don't like, but to be fair, taking them away would make it a whole lot less cute. For one thing, Bridget couldn't find any messages on her answering machine. Awww.. she's lonely. But wait, didn't she have 3 friends who always supported her? Plus, again, she looks gorgeous. It's hard to feel sorry for you when 2 men were willing to fight for you. But those are minor setback to a overall story that is simply perfect.<br/><br/>If anything, this is truly a movie every young girl (and guy too) must watch. Unless.. you know, you are too young for all the swearing. Speaking of which, this movie, unfortunately, is another classic that got slap with R rating for absolutely no good reason like Almost Famous. I can blame it on the Rating board, but why would the movie put those kind of language or drug content (Almost Famous, there's no drug in Bridget Jones) on there when it doesn't even have anything to do with the story and may even help them reach much larger group of audience?<br/><br/>Oh Well. 10/10"
"beckrbug","7","0","1","1 October 2004"," Better than the Book (and this is coming from an English BA)
","I just read this book, cute because of the diary-like entries, but not enough DARCY! Movie was better. Hugh is such a dope - really slimy. Darcy shines through every time. I love how this was based on Pride and Prejudice and how in the book there are mentions to the A&E Mini and to Hugh himself (amusing). One other thing I did not appreciate in the book was that Bridget thinks she's a cow at 129 pounds. Give me a break. I'd have to cut off both my legs to be 129 pounds SHUT THE HELL UP BJ YOU ANOREXIC TWIT. But, the movie was alright. See it if it's on TV - don't go out of your way to see it. And see it at your leisure if only to get every bit of Austen that's floating around out there (like I did). Plus, you get to see Colin as Darcy. (I bet he's gross in real-life, oh well)."
"fairys_love_vodka","Null","0","2","16 June 2004"," What a movie!
","A few months before this movie was released i saw the posters going up around my local town and initially thought ""well.. that looks like a load of rubbish.."" how wrong could i be?! I decided to go and see this ""brilliant"" movie i had been hearing all about from friends, and thoroughly enjoyed it. As soon as it came out on video i went out and purchased it, and at one point was watching it twice a day! Two years later, and i am still watching it on a regular occurrence. Renee is an amazing actress, and her performance is no less than spectacular. I think the beauty of the character is that everyone can relate to a certain aspect of her. (men problems, smoking, drinking, problems at work etc etc.)<br/><br/>If only all films could be as wonderful as this masterpiece... eagerly awaiting the sequel ""the edge of reason"""
"jambalayaval","Null","0","1","14 June 2004"," Finally, a movie that us ""fat chicks"" can enjoy!
","What a nice change to see a leading character who's not wafer thin and perfect. Bridget Jones's flaws make her both entertaining and engaging: her inability to keep her mouth shut at the appropriate time, her inability to keep a job or to get the right one, her inability to become ""the perfect woman"" in the kitchen or the bedroom, her inability to make her life and her parents' lives work smoothly. Of course, we'd all like to have the dilemma of having to choose between Hugh Grant and Colin Firth, and that might be the one part of this movie that's hard to get beyond. Were her boy toys just average looking, we might not feel so bad for whomever she cuts loose. My only other complaint about this movie is that the lead wasn't British (or even Australian). I can think of 10 great actresses (Helena Bonham Carter, Toni Collette, Minnie Driver, Jennifer Ehle, Catherine McCormack, Frances O'Connor, Julia Sawalha, Naomi Watts, Rachel Weisz, Kate Winslet) who would've let me focus more on the character and less on waiting for that moment when Renee Zellweger gave away her Texas roots."
"Smells_Like_Cheese","9","0","2","22 May 2004"," For a person who doesn't like chick flicks too much, I enjoyed it
","Seriously, I'm a girl. I hate chick flicks, with a passion. Very rarely do I see a chick flick that I like. There only a handful of chick flicks that are good, in my opinion. But ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" was different. It was very funny and very true about life. I felt like in some ways she was like a person I knew. Or could even relate too. Whenever you meet a guy that's too good to be true, you can't get your mind off of him. But then you meet a guy who you don't like at all, but he likes you and he is the right guy for you.<br/><br/>
Bridget Jones is a very funny movie. I think you'd enjoy it. For a chick flick. :D<br/><br/>9/10"
"fuzed","Null","0","1","11 August 2003"," 'I thought you said she was thin.'
","This is a witty film and I highly recommend it.  It was based on 'Pride and Prejudice' from Jane Austin.  Colin Firth plays Mark Darcy who was based upon Mr. Darcy in P&P.  The author mentions in the DVD extras that she actually modeled (in the book) the character Mark Darcy after Colin Firth..he played Mr. Darcy in the movie ""Pride and Prejudice.""  The only disappointment is Renee's accent.  I have heard that it is very good but in fact it is actually the opposite!  It is passable, but it sounds like an American trying to sound British..even though Hugh Grant claims he didn't know she was an American when he first began the film with her.  There are certainly other films in which American actors practice british elocution with 'expertise' but this is not one of them.  It is almost laughable in that respect.  However, it is definitely worth seeing.  I can see there are many who thought her accent was very well done....er.. The acting is excellent..Hugh Grant was a splendid choice for this film...  It is one of my favorites.  The likeness to Ally McBeal is noticeable but I am not an Ally fan.  Therefore this film is certainly not only for Ally McBeal fans."

"hernan_amado","Null","0","1","30 June 2002"," Is it supposed to be hilarious?
","Well I saw this movie the day before yesterday and really felt disappointed because of its plot, it's dull. It seems to me that the creator of Bridget Jones's diary makes fun of viewers by showing them a simple and uninteresting love story between an approximately 32 years old woman and her boss. He tells her that her other suitor was a deceitful person since he slept with his old girlfriend, but it was too predictable that the boss was lying to her, I didn't have to think hard to realize that. I don't think this part was a twist at all. Is that kind of plot supposed to be funny? Perhaps many of the reviewers who liked it found Bridget's personality funny, but it was annoying to me. All she does is talk about her lovers and be embarrassed all the time, which I didn't find that amusing, maybe I smiled a few times, but that was it. I thought this movie would be great since I read good reviews and some critics gave it 5stars/5stars, but I felt disappointed after it ended. It has unnecessary bad language, which I also found annoying. I don't understand why Renne Zelleweger received an Oscar nomination for her performance. Nicole Kidman gave a better and more complex performance in ""The Others"", that's for sure! <br/><br/>I thought Renne would shine on screen, but she gave a performance as bad as the one she gave in ""Jerry Maguire"", She shouldn't have been so shameless, since she was making jokes throughout the whole movie, we didn't see her doing something worthy, besides we barely saw her writing something in her diary, this movie should have shown her writing in her diary more often, but it only appeared at the beginning and the end. <br/><br/>All in all this movie wasn't that hilarious, it was bothersome, but I enjoyed the beautiful England landscapes, since they're gorgeous and I also learned that the cars in England are different from others, because they have the pilot seat on the right side, which I didn't know at all. 5/10"

","In many ways this is a delightfully off the wall film using creative and novel script and production techniques. But I was angered and repelled by the constant and pointless smoking! Okay, cigarettes have a slight role in the plot because Bridget tries to quit. But in a world where almost nobody smokes, it seems that EVERYBODY in this film smokes. There are numerous other product placements in this movie. Can we assume that the tobacco industry also paid big bucks to promote its vile product. I gave the film a 7.

RenÃ©e Zellweger, Hugh Grant and Colin Firth all deliver fantastic performances. Firth is the 'favourite' since he's also been brilliant in the best televisions series ever made (Pride and Prejudice) and one of my all time favourite films (Valmont).

What a pity the film isn't really British... Hugh and Colin (however both brilliant here) weren't enough to make the film true. I just wanted to see a real woman like me in a real world.
