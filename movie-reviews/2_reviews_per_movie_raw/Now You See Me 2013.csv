"markvanderpool","2","460","625","30 June 2013"," I went in hopeful and left feeling insulted.
","""Now You See Me"" has a stellar cast, a fun and intriguing premise and themes (showdown of rival magicians combined with a heist), delightful smart-assery and cunning tactics -- especially in those scenes dominated by Jesse Eisenberg or Woody Harrelson. Oh, and it has quite dazzling action sequences. All the best parts of this film are well-packaged and sold in the gripping theatrical trailer.<br/><br/>I took someone I loved to ""Now You See Me"" and expected the payoff of a perfect night of entertainment.<br/><br/>I'm not impossible to please at the movies and I actively wanted this to be a good time. I went out for entertainment and leisure and in good company and high spirits, not at all for the purpose of writing a critical review.<br/><br/>What's more, I'm a big fan of all of the raw ingredients in this film. I enjoy magic and I could watch Morgan Freeman or Michael Caine in almost anything (now proved.) I fully enjoyed a much better film called ""The Prestige,"" which might be regarded by some as a predecessor.<br/><br/>But what happened here?<br/><br/>After several fun scenes and a promising opening sequence that made me want to care about the characters, I discovered a film in search of a plot and utterly lacking intellectual integrity and respect for the audience. The twists and reversals weren't just surprising, they were completely unbelievable. You didn't see it coming, but not because of skillful misdirection (the art of magicians, so often implied.) <br/><br/>Rather, you didn't see it coming because the explanations were crooked and cooked up and merely expedient.<br/><br/>Especially, by late in the film when they start tracking backward to earlier events to show you how you were fooled and what was really going on the whole time -- the explanations presented are less convincing than simply believing in real magic.<br/><br/>!!!Spoler Alert: Stop reading here if you would like to watch this movie without knowing anything about the late scenes, reveals, and reversals!!!<br/><br/>For example, the ""Four Horsemen"" stage the death of one of their own by perfectly orchestrating a high-speed traffic accident on a crowded bridge. It's imperative that the car he's apparently driving flips and tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. <br/><br/>But it's equally imperative that the pursuing detective can retrieve a stack of papers from the wrecked car. He *must* be able to retrieve the papers but not the body, all while getting away with his own life, or else the plot begins to unravel. <br/><br/>The timing is of course worked out impeccably, and it's carried out with no other fatalities on the bridge. And somehow the magicians have stuffed a replacement body from the morgue into an identical car just before turning it into a time-bomb. <br/><br/>The audience knows, emotionally, that the Dave Franco character shouldn't really be dead (as I heard one person exclaim loudly during the closing sequence when ""Jack Wilder"" shows up again,) but the way his death is apparently faked would defy an unlimited budget and dozens of trained stunt drivers and coordinators -- unless, of course, you close the bridge to public traffic. Yet it's just one more miracle that the Horsemen carry out with aplomb, at a frenetic pace and on-the-fly, with less than half-a-dozen total team members, empowered by an unlimited budget and a mystery benefactor.<br/><br/>All the while, apparently real traffic zooms along with presumably untrained and unprepared public going about normal business.<br/><br/>We are expected to believe that the way Hollywood makes a high-speed accident occur without killing anybody can be done by a handful of highly motivated professional stage magicians (read: amateurs to road stunts) and somehow this can be accomplished without completely controlled surroundings.<br/><br/>This elaborately and improbably faked high-speed death scene is just one example of the film jumping into an explanation of ""how it really happened"" that seems less probable and less believable than *anything* you could have guessed before being told.<br/><br/>And the plot problems go much deeper than buying into death-defying scenes that require an elimination of anything random in a busy public space. I couldn't buy the ultimate reveal about the real identity and motives of the Mark Ruffalo character, either. It seemed incongruous. It felt like a cheat. The way he is planted in relation to earlier events seems like an afterthought. <br/><br/>And I couldn't buy that underneath his deliberate blundering and willful ignorance was someone not only much smarter than he appeared, but someone so capable of perfect planning as to be damned near omniscient.<br/><br/>The total impression is of a promising film idea that fell on its own very expensive sword. I don't know what happened, but it looks like it got battered and morphed around and rewritten by multiple teams of writers. The total feeling is that the story got killed and Frankensteined back together multiple times. And it looks like the final edit came after the director and all concerned were out of steam and over budget. <br/><br/>I felt intellectually raped, to put it bluntly. I felt like the director was content to dazzle us with action and effects and to take our money while demanding our total credulity on the plot points, using the angle provided by magic in a rather disingenuous way.<br/><br/>This, instead of providing a coherent narrative that would allow an adult audience to cheerfully maintain a willing suspension of disbelief. <br/><br/>The storyline turns into a madhouse of improbabilities and then rationalizes its real business like a pathological liar. What a travesty to the promising themes of magic and old rivalries, treated so well in other recent films. And what a waste of a beautiful all-star cast, so entertaining as individuals in the early scenes."
"svenhaadem","3","227","310","24 August 2013"," The greatest trick ever pulled is to make anyone believe this film has a coherent story.
","I believe the target audience (and maybe even the writer) are all 14 year old boys who think magicians can do anything they want. I love a good sci-fi setting and I can accept some really fringe premises if the movie exploit them in a good way. This movie just relies on the audience swallowing everything and never questioning anything. If you start to pull any of the many loose ends it all falls apart faster than you can say bullshit.<br/><br/>I wanted to write this whitout spoilers, but the plot has given me a itch I can not scratch.<br/><br/>First, they stole 140 million by knowing the guys first pets name!?? Do they suggest the bank secure their assets with a simple password recovery scheme like that? I don't begin to understand. Are they seriuous? Why didn't they just say they hypnoticed him into withdrawing the money. Even thow that is not possible it is far more believable. This is maybe the most unbeliveble way to explain a heist I ever heard of. <br/><br/>There is not a singel interesting or plausible event in the whole film. Everything is just random. The fbi guy, did he base his whole career on this single moment? That is determenation and planning out of this world. But, I guess its a whole lot easier to say its just distraction and magic that did it all. <br/><br/>I would say that convincing people to pay for this crap is a far greater con than any of the ones presented in the movie.<br/><br/>I have seen allot of bad movies but they all have something if find interesting or good in them. Except this one. I cant find any thing positive to say. Stay clear."
"HelenMary","6","269","393","6 July 2013"," trying desperately hard to be more intelligent than it is
","Overall a showman of a film. Flashy, loud with bells and whistles and big personalities, an exciting premise... illusionists rob banks using (supposed) magic but the four horsemen are just puppets in a game, but the hype is more than the substance of the film itself.<br/><br/>You'd expect suspense, twists, intelligent plot misdirection and all sorts of thrilling viewing? No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, ""Always be the most intelligent person in the room"" or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the ""twists"" coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But, unlike Oceans Eleven, for example, it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.<br/><br/>The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the ""glamour"" rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good.<br/><br/>This was supposed to be a big blockbuster film, big back drops, epic stunts and huge crowd scenes, but it failed to deliver. As heist/magic genre films go it's not that great, and The Prestige was far more cerebral and gripping. Entertaining to a point but I got a bit bored, and some of the scenes were too long - chases etc. If you are a fan of heist films or magic you'll enjoy it, or are a fan of particular actors, or will just enjoy it for what it is and don't want to be challenged intellectually, it's a great film. I think Hollywood endings are just too commonplace. 6/10 for me."
"pinkled5","6","668","1005","7 June 2013"," Watchable but lacks depth & substance
","This is one of those movies that is somewhat entertaining upon first viewing but is easily forgettable and has nothing of substance to make a second viewing possible to enjoy. The plot is convoluted as we don't know what the main characters are doing or why. In fact, everything we know about the 4 magicians is revealed in the first 10 minutes of the movie and after that there is ZERO character development! The entire movie appears to have been made solely for the sake of the ending and yet it was so cliché that I was actually a little angry about the way they did it. It's unfortunate that in the filmmaker's attempts to be clever they neglected the most fundamental elements of storytelling: plot and character.<br/><br/>Like a magic show without magic, you may find yourself somewhat entertained but inevitably wind up disappointed in the end because they left out the most important part of the show."
"andyreynolds-1","2","80","116","16 August 2013"," Disappointing
","In all fairness, I had been warned. A movie review show said this was less than impressive and the write-ups in print were ""luke-warm"" but when the missus said lets go watch a movie, I wanted to give it a try because the cast was impressive and come on, who doesn't like magic tricks???? Let's begin with the positives. It runs for 115 minutes which compared to The Long Ranger and anything Peter Jackson hands in is almost preview length so that was good. Unless the result of decent editing is a lack of character depth then perhaps it wasn't.... but we'll get to that shortly.<br/><br/>The cast were good. The Four Horsemen actors were solid while Mr Freeman, Mr Caine and Mr Ruffalo just don't know how to put in a bad performance. Ms Laurent was also quite good too.<br/><br/>Now, the negative. Whilst I liked the actors I don't like any of the characters... actually that's unfair, I don't dislike them I just don't know them. The film makers spent ten seconds giving us a back story for the main protagonists therefore giving me no cause to support their scheme. BUT THEY WERE RIGHTING A WRONG FROM A LONG TIME AGO I hear you scream!!! And this is true but we're not meant to know this until the final reveal......unless you worked it out as soon as Morgan Freeman mentioned it, in which case the whole movie failed as a mystery and you were left to decide whether to finish your coke before your popcorn or keep a little to wash out those annoying bits that get stuck between your teeth....but I digress.<br/><br/>I had also hoped to enjoy some magic tricks but these were all achieved with CGI so like Star Wars I,II, & III I'm left wishing the director refused to take the easy way out of disguising a less than competent script with colour and movement.<br/><br/>A couple of quick lessons from this film. One, when you pretend to kill off a character in a car accident get at least one of their friends to look like they're upset, distressed or just annoyed that they have to feed their cat while they're in hiding. No one cared when the young bloke was blown up in the car crash so we knew he had to turn up again.<br/><br/>The second suggestion is to paraphrase Mr Eisenberg's line during questioning ""the first rule of movie making is don't try to be smartest person in the room if you're not."" It just turns into a shallow mess.<br/><br/>I also read with some interest that the film makers were working on a sequel, which unless it's just the director and writers apologising for this effort then I won't be attending. Now you see me....now you don't."
"jim-littlewood","1","234","361","8 July 2013"," Shazam!!
","This film is about four magicians brought together to perform the ultimate trick...to rob a bank (or so they would have you believe). I think that's as far as anyone really got with the plot apart from a few obvious twists along the way. Each of the four magicians is drafted in for their individual talents however these aren't really highlighted or explored during the film in any detail. In fact there is no character development at all which is more disappointing given the fact that the cast includes Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman among others. <br/><br/>So a few minutes in and they perform their robbing a bank trick, the FBI man and the Interpol girl, who are somehow teamed up, are flummoxed so they take the magicians in for questioning. This doesn't go well for the FBI as the magicians use their mind/card tricks to outwit them and in the end they are let go. So the FBI calls in the help of Morgan Freeman, whose job is working out and explaining how tricks are done, to help. He has clearly seen this all before and explains the bank robbery within seconds. <br/><br/>This is where i kind of lost interest in the film. Anyway there are some attempts at this stage to add some depth to the movie but these all fail. The confrontations between Caine and Freeman are tired and they both just seem to be going through the motions. The love interest between the FBI man and the Interpol girl is forced and comes from nowhere. Basically she is hot and they are working on a case together so they fall in love. Even the main four cast members have no chemistry or likability. <br/><br/>So moving on a couple more tricks are performed and the cat and mouse game with the FBI continues. I wont ruin the disappointing end but let's just say there are a few twists that anyone who has seen a movie before would have worked out by now and then the film ends. <br/><br/>All in all the worst film I've seen in a long time and shame on Woody Harrelson for following his excellent performance in Seven Psychopaths with this garbage."
"kfine100","1","141","219","25 August 2013"," Skip it if you have a brain
","I agree with the other negative reviews: good actors performing an incoherent script. The film is more of a collection of clichés than a story. One thing I haven't seen mentioned is how left-wing it is. We are supposed to cheer when Michael Caine's character gets screwed. The only reason I can see is because he is rich. Jesse Eisenberg on the other hand plays a smug guy you would like to smack upside the head. However, his heart is pure so it turns out good for him. Much of the story and the tricks are based upon screwing the ""one percent."" If you aren't a Wall Street occupier or are greater than 12 years old I recommend skipping it. Come to think of it, it's too violent for viewers 12 or less."
"vicarious_tool","5","229","368","14 June 2013"," All bark no bite.
","If you like strong and logical plots, you are likely to dislike this one. It's all about appearances and show in this one, rather than actually being brilliant, the characters and story just ask you take their brilliance for granted. <br/><br/>The story revolves around illusionists (implicitly portrayed as demigods I would say) and how they manage to fool everyone and get a little fooled themselves. Of course, with all this fooling around there are always chances that something might strike the funny bone, that is to say it has its humorous moments now and then but on the whole the illusions and tricks etc. is just more of a dazzle than something logical and realistic. There is not much depth to the characters and a lot of misdirection to make the climax more effective, but the misdirection only adds to the illogical nature of the plot and makes the story hollow.<br/><br/>Having criticized enough the good parts for me were the cocky-as-usual Jesse Eisenberg and some of the funny moments but nothing else. Even the dazzle of the magic tricks was made slow and plain by all the simple filler like dialogues. Final word; skip it unless you don't have a better choice for a movie in mind."
"griffolyon12","8","296","491","31 May 2013"," Like a Vegas Show, Entertaining but Lacking of Much Else
","Imagine Now You See Me as Ocean's Eleven meets The Prestige and you sort of get what director Louis Leterrier was going for with this film. Is Now You See Me as successful as the aforementioned films? Not necessarily, but it's a fun movie that deconstructs the acts of modern magicians.<br/><br/>The story follows four Vegas magicians, known as the Four Horsemen, who rob a bank in the middle of one of their shows. What follows is a cat-and-mouse thriller where the FBI chases after these magicians, always one step behind, trying to figure out how they did it.<br/><br/>Where Now You See Me works best is when Leterrier creates cinematic sequences showing us how these magicians used real-life magic tricks to befuddle and dupe both their victims and the FBI. As well, if you want a film with twists and turns, this one will not disappoint. While most of the major twists can be found out before revealed, there is still a joy in watching those twists unfold, thanks to Leterrier's Sherlock Holmes' style of visual deduction. However, the script often falters in one of the most crucial areas, that of character.<br/><br/>Leterrier and company are constantly trying to balance the breakneck pace with the large cast of characters, and it just leaves the characters hanging out to dry. Character development is sorely lacking in Now You See Me, to where I never really cared about any of the characters. Part of this is because the film is constantly shifting points of view. The first thirty minutes follow our Robin Hood-like magicians, and then it switches to the FBI agents tracking them down, but then the film has the magicians constantly one step in front of the FBI to the point that it makes the FBI often come across as buffoons, and I find it hard to care for characters who are so easily fooled. Ultimately, I feel that had the film focused entirely on one set of characters, like the magicians or the FBI, the film would have been stronger and been easier to find a focal point, but as it is the film's core is often muddled.<br/><br/>While Now You See Me may not be a grand slam, it's still entertaining, thanks to the thrills and visual style of the film. Bottom line, if you're a fan of the heist genre, you'll like this movie. For me though, it just lacks a further script rewrite to have become one of the best examples of the genre.<br/><br/>I give Now You See Me an 8 out of 10!"
"TheTruth747","1","87","137","28 June 2013"," Pretty Awful
","Having been interested by the previews and ratings on IMDb, I went into this movie expecting some fun. But what started out as an interesting movie fizzled out in no time. In about 20 minutes, the interest was all POOF -- GONE ! <br/><br/>To start with, a lot of characters in the movie are very shallow. You hardly get any background info about them and what drives them to do what they do. <br/><br/>The makers try to add romance, action, suspense, drama and all of it fails. It went to the point where you just wait for the movie to end. <br/><br/>Lots of good actors and all of them have been made to play cartoonish roles in a movie that takes itself quite seriously. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. The street tricks on TV are way more fun and enjoyable. At least there you know the magician/illusionist/trickster is doing it to entertain or make a name for himself and a quick buck unlike this movie which tries to show them off with personalities like superheroes. <br/><br/>Tip: Sit back at home, sip on a summer drink and watch/do something else other than going to the cinemas for this."
"Robert_duder","4","57","88","8 June 2013"," Now you see me...but I wish I hadn't
","I remember seeing the trailers for this and I thought it really looked great. Reading some of the reviews on here, many of them ""claim"" that people with a low IQ dislike the film. Well, I don't mean to toot my own horn but I don't think I'm a stupid individual and I've seen thousands of movies...more than your average joe because I love movies. However, this was a stone cold dud. Decent cast, some real twists and turns but a blatantly complicated plot line that makes little sense and tries way too hard just to be complex. A truly smart film can be smart and tricky without trying SO hard. Now You See Me just throws in all kinds of tricks and twists without any build up or thinking about whether or not it makes sense. It was a very interesting experience when the big final twist of the movie was revealed and everyone in the theatre I was in gasped and then that was immediately followed by many people whispering ""That's dumb,"" ""That doesn't make sense."" They are exactly right. The big twist has no groundwork laid for it and makes no sense at all but by that time you are so completely lost in the silly story that you won't care that it doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>The cast certainly is not the issue for this film. The cast is actually pretty good. I'm just surprised they actually signed on to this but then again it is making okay money at the box office. I didn't much care for Jesse Eisenberg's character. That's not to say he didn't do a good job, I just didn't like him much. His character is smug and egotistical but fits the role nicely and carries the cast well. I thought Woody Harrelson was excellent in his role as a mentalist that can hypnotize. He was probably my favourite character and yet there wasn't a lot done with him which is unfortunate. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco I lump together because while they were good they were mostly underused and sort of the sidekicks to Eisenberg and Harrelson most of the time. I think if I was making a film like this I would ensure the four of them share an equal amount of screen time and have strong characters. But they do well. Mark Ruffalo is the FBI agent trying to get to the bottom of the group of thieves. Ruffalo is good, shows lots of intensity and the appropriate amount of angst for cop vs robbers. Unfortunately for her I thought Mélanie Laurent was very near pointless. I suppose she was there to give the audience yet another possible suspect, and also to give Ruffalo a romance but both those angles were completely unnecessary and her monotone line delivery was enough to put you to sleep. Finally, we have two legends Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. The best scenes in this movie easily are the ones with just the two of them on screen because their chemistry and on screen charisma is enough to carry any scene. However they are definitely blatantly used for their name power and the weak script does nothing for them.<br/><br/>Given director Louis Leterrier is a talented director, I'm surprised at really how bad the film was shot. Were there some nicely shot scenes? Yes there was but few and far between. I have actually seen all of Leterrier's films and this was by far the worst of them. I will give props to them in the opening scene when they play a magic trick that actually worked on me...they picked the car that I picked...I wonder if it works on everyone? After that the film falls into a complex web of lies and deceit and completely silly twists and turns that make little to no sense. Perhaps there are two many hands in the pot. There are no less than five screenwriters and story artists on the film. Its hard enough to find two writers that can jive and work together let alone five. Basically, Now You See Me was a huge disappointment for me. In a summer of blockbusters you need something better than this. 4/10"
"jimiuk","1","67","108","17 June 2013"," The real trick was making so many great actors so terrible.
","I'm just after leaving an advance showing of Now You See Me and I think it was horrendously bad. Just awful, truly terrible in so many areas, some being:<br/><br/>Dialogue- This reeked of laziness. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine's dialogue especially. It was wooden, inauthentic and the sort of dialogue that was so obvious that a child could figure it out from the context in the film. If they needed to say have the dialogue that was being said in this film, weeeeeellll, you're doing it wrong. Subtext anyone?<br/><br/>Characterisation- Again, really lazy. Every single character in the film was one dimensional with not even a HINT of a human variability or individuality. If some is a 'baddie', all he does is bad things. The 'romantic interest' runs around after our protagonist lovingly. The Four Horsemen magicians also I couldn't have cared less for. Worse still, I didn't care about a single thing any of them did.<br/><br/>Plot- I thought about this on the way to my car after leaving. Few major flaws. One, there was no tension at all for pretty much all of the film. You had the Four Horsemen magicians running about like Robin Hood and you were kinda rooting for them somewhat. Then, two, you had Ruffalo and the French lady running around trying to catch them, who you were also kind of behind too. There was only one real 'baddie' in Michael Caine but he was a cursory villain and not the main event really. Ruffalo's 'revenge' against the safe maker whose faulty safe killed his father was pulled out of nowhere. Even at the end there was no alteration in the states of our characters. The good guys stayed good just like they'd been at the start (why did I watch this film again?). <br/><br/>Cinematography- This wasn't as bad the elements above but there was definitely a spot when Ruffalo was in New Orleans standing street level among cars when I probably physically squinted and thought 'sweet lord, what is this film trying to do to me?'.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd say avoid this film. Weak writing, weak performances from great actors (who i don't blame), pointless plot. Worst film I've seen in a while. Sorry :("

All the magic tricks and illusions are very unrealistic. The ""romantic"" element of the story is incredibly forced; almost thrown in at the last moment because the producers were like ""oh ya! we forgot to add the romance"". <br/><br/>There's nothing subtle about the tone of the movie. You're constantly reminded that there is a mysterious element that you are not seeing.

I felt like it was condescending to me the entire time.

","I was given free advanced screening tickets to see this film, and being the film buff that I am, I took them and went and saw it.

The cast was great, the action fun, and the plot unique. I didn't see any of the twists coming and I found the film to be very entertaining. It doesn't get too convoluted at any point and is a great chase/illusion film. It's like a funner version of The Prestige, not that the two belong in the same class, just an easy way to quickly summarize what the movie is trying to accomplish (although Michael Caine is in both films!)<br/><br/>Go see it, as will I, again.

There are many twists and turns in the script, which I would normally approve of but I'm not sure that the lack of a story is the problem. The main story is unnecessarily convoluted with a condescending need to re-cap events and explain how you were misdirected the first time you saw this. When the director keeps showing me something and then saying that wasn't what happened it doesn't take long for me to stop caring about what just happened. The result is a film that's much too long and takes far too long to get to the point so that when the final twist did happen I just didn't care anymore.<br/><br/>I was intrigued by the great trailer for this film, but it over-sells the actual film which was very disappointing."

The missing piece of the puzzle? Character development. <br/><br/>That's not to say that there is any lack of interesting characters, each of the four horsemen bring a very unique style to the movie (besides Henley, she's rather weak as a character), and the sheer amount of Talent present in each scene guarantees that you'll be entertained. <br/><br/>10/10?

"tonyfor","1","66","115","15 October 2013"," Appallingly dreadful film
","If you're going to make a film about magic that at least pretends to have some relationship to reality (e.g. involving the police and Interpol), then why not try to make it very slightly credible? This was mind- numbingly awful, totally unbelievable on every level and an insult to the intelligence of everyone watching it. Total drivel. How established stars like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine (who usually appear in good films) were persuaded to take part in this rubbish is beyond me (although Ben Kingsley was recently in a worse one, so they are not the only offenders). I don't mind suspending disbelief when watching a science fiction or comic book based film, but not when watching one which tries to pretend to even a bit of reality. Complete garbage and a total waste of time."

","""Now You See Me"" came out of nowhere and became the sleeper hit of 2013, getting good word of mouth during its theatrical run. Having seen the movie for myself, I am kind of puzzled by its popularity. Certainly, the movie is far from the worst movies I have ever seen - it's colorful, and doesn't have a dead spot despite running almost two hours long. <br/><br/>But there were some things about the movie that annoyed me enough to prevent me from liking it. The biggest problem is with the characters. Except for Freeman's character, there is not one likable character in the movie. The law enforcement agents investigating the magicians are loud and obnoxious, and the four magicians come across as extremely smug. (Also, there is no attempt to give the magicians real and separate personalities - they all act alike.)<br/><br/>The characters were the main reason why I didn't like this movie, but there were other problems as well. One other major annoyance is the depiction of the magic acts. They have been jazzed up with CGI and other special effects so they don't feel like REAL magic acts - they come across as artificial. Also, as the movie progresses, the various feats the magicians pull off slowly become more unbelievable (and not fully explained) that eventually I wanted to cry out loud, ""Oh, COME ON!"" Less slight of hand and a more realistic approach would have been a much better approach.<br/><br/>(Note to Michael Caine fans: His role is really just an extended cameo appearance.)"

","Eisenberg, as I'm sure many will notice, is beginning to develop his own typical character: the quick-witted, arrogant-yet-jittery, young smart guy. But instead of running facebook, this time he's one of the top magicians in the world. And he's perfectly cast for it.<br/><br/>The movie follows 4 magicians or illusionists in various stages of their careers, as they all receive mysterious invites to join up. After meeting, the ""Four Horsemen"" go all Robin Hood, robbing banks and stealing from CEOs as part of their shows, and giving the money away to the audience. The Incredible HulkI mean, Mark Ruffalo, plays the FBI agent trying to lock them all up, while Morgan Freeman plays the narrator explaining everything to youI mean, the ex-magician trying to debunk the magicreally, that's just a clever way to get Freeman to narrate stuff<br/><br/>Pros: - Everyone puts on a solid performance. No weak points acting-wise, great job on casting. - It's fast-paced, the action never hits any dull parts. And even the small romance scenes don't drag on long enough to take away from anything. You're pretty locked-in from start to finish. - Particularly great scenes between Eisenberg, Ruffalo, and Harrelson in the first half of the movie. - Great ending, if you've been paying attention. <br/><br/>Cons: - You wish there was more dialog between Eisenberg and Harrelson. - The 2nd half of the movie might move a bit too fastagain, pay attention. - Somebody thought this was a Marvel movie for like 5 seconds, and had The Hulk fighting Gambitwaitis that a bad thing?...<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't feel that long at all."

Acting-lame Characterisation-one dimensional and fit for children Plot-more holes than a Swiss cheese grater and the 'love' interest/sub plot was the icing on this lame cake-seriously.<br/><br/>I get that some movies don't have to be believable and can transport us to an imaginary world where we are entertained and dazzled. This film tried so hard on so many levels but failed in every single way possible. With a movie this large and with so many people involved and so much money thrown at it to come up with something so dire highlights the sad state of a sector of the American movie- making industry.<br/><br/>Please do not make a sequel-partly because I will want to watch it to complete this review...<br/><br/>A score of 7.4-IMDB reviewers you should be ashamed."

The preamble is good: a group of mentalists and illusionists gets picked up by a mysterious third party who turns them into a team and turns them into a Las Vegas sensation while a secret plan unfolds underneath. But that's where everything stops making sense. From then on it's a series of car chases with the police, magic shows in prominent theatres around the world while a man tapes the illusionists to try and unmask their tricks. But why he does it is never clear and never will be until the cheesy, predictable finale. Besides the spectacular special effects and camera movements, there's nothing here.

","""Come in close. Because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you..."" Not only do the distributors of Now You See Me use this piece of gripping dialogue as the tagline for the film, but exhibitors will also utilise it to trick international audiences into delving into their pockets and wasting their time with this enormously disappointing and unexciting caper film. Now You See Me follows the story of four magicians, known as The Four Horsemen, as they captivate the world with 'magical', near inexplicable bank heists before rewarding their audiences and supporters with the money they take. The only trickery happening here is being hypnotised by the highly intriguing trailer, only to find you yourself have been robbed as you sit in disbelief that you paid to see a film that is about as unique and intricate as a card game of snap!<br/><br/>Despite the sensational ensemble of Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, they fail to assemble accordingly. They all deliver satisfactory performances but are not given the opportunity to flourish as we may have seen them do so in past roles. This is primarily due to the fact that director Louis Leterrier, along with the writers, attempt to pull too many rabbits out of the hat at one time and so rather than enjoy one bunny at a time, we instead see a ton of terrific actors be undervalued and restricted in showcasing their talents. Most oddly, The Four Horsemen (Eisenberg, Fischer, Harrelson and Franco) are even given surprisingly little screen time after their thirty minute introduction as the film begins.<br/><br/>In all fairness, Now You See Me does remain consistent. Consistently unintriguing that is. The film's aforementioned tagline, along with unsubtle hints scattered dubiously throughout regarding the illusionary concept of misdirection, completely ruin any surprise and twist that the 'suspense' film has to offer. By doing this the film leaves little to be unveiled during the climax, one would think, though time is actually wasted explaining all of the plot points you already guessed, while conjuring up new components to the story that remain unresolved and/or illogically explained to the extent that even in a film about magic/illusions, you fail to believe any of the tricks being performed. The illusion of cinema fails as much as the illusion of magic fails to prevail in Now You See Me.<br/><br/>Now You See Me is comparable to the student who believes they are the cool fresher on campus, the funniest, with a unique personality, and a mistaken sense of self-intelligence that causes them to continue to contribute to seminars despite the fact they never answer anything correctly. No, in fact, Now You See Me needs to be told by its peers (let's say that's us) that it is not nearly as intellectually gifted, cool, witty or exceptional as it pretends to be. You most certainly will not miss out on anything if you chose not to befriend this dull, generic and embarrassingly misleading film, that is posing as an intricate and sophisticated figure on the surface.<br/><br/>When the first thought on my mind after exiting my cinema seat after Now You See Me was ""I actually wish the film had been sold out so I could have returned home to watch The Prestige (2006) or see Man of Steel (2013) again"", it pretty much encapsulates my attitude towards the disappointing Leterrier film. While there is nothing necessarily evident to hate in Now You See Me, there is not a single component to commend as great either. Now You See Me is truly a forgettable 115 minute time thief, and though I have Seen it Now, I would have preferred instead to have missed it and been kept under the illusion that it was in fact an intricate tale, rather than a misdirected fail."

I'm usually a big Morgan Freeman fan, but he was just annoying and clearly overcompensated for something. The acting was good, but with terrible dialog and the worst plot in history, they can't do much to save this movie. The ending is just silly and confusing. They never explain anything really. so when the credits roll, you sit in your seat and wonder what the h*ll just happened.

"rannynm","10","111","212","3 June 2013"," Unique, Keeps You on the Edge of Your Seat with All its Twists and Turns
","I absolutely love this film. ""Now You See Me"" is like nothing I've ever seen before. ""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians called The Four Horsemen who use their skills to pull off some of the greatest international robberies of their generation. Featuring Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKenny (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), the Four Horsemen make a dream team of street magicians. Since they have made their stunts public, allowing the world to ""witness"" the robberies, authorities are in hot pursuit of the four, now wanted criminals. Detective Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is accompanied in his search for the illusive magicians by Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) and French detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). Will the Four Horsemen be able to pull of their final act without being caught, or will it be curtains for the criminal performers?<br/><br/>The plot is so original and full of fresh ideas and witty comedy. I love how fast paced this film is, I swear there isn't a dull moment from beginning to end. The plot itself has so many twists and turns it should be a pretzel, but it keeps the audience guessing the whole time and hits you with major shock factor. The acting in this film is incredible. It features a group of incredible actors - Morgan Freeman, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and many others. I love how each character has a unique quirk and personality that you can really see, but they all work together so well. The cinematography and special effects in this film are phenomenal. It is bursting with rich colors and textures, drawing you into the magic and making the illusions appear so real. The soundtrack is also amazing. It is suits each scene very well, while keeping a consistent theme and feel throughout the movie. ""Now You See Me"" is definitely not one to miss.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when the Four Horsemen have to escape from the FBI after their second robbery. Jack Wilder has to stay behind to burn secret files. When he has an unexpected run-in with Detective Rhodes, an action filled fight sequence and high speed chase follow. This scene is filled with suspense, action and incredible stunts and it shows that the Horsemen are always two steps ahead.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for ages 12+ because of violence and mild mature language. Overall I give ""Now You See Me"" 5 out of 5 stars. <br/><br/>See Raven's video review on kidsfirst.org"

","""Now You See Me"" is has a wonderful cast and story lines that surprised and charmed me. I already know that I want to see the film again to scrutinize the misdirection that pervades both the on-screen ""magic"" acts and the overlaying plot lines.<br/><br/>The film has three principal sets of characters--first, the illusionists who are brought together by an unseen force to build a spectacular act, including at least one bank robbery, played out on location in Las Vegas, New Orleans, and NYC; second, law enforcement, including the FBI and a lovely French Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent); and third, the observers, including Michael Caine as a financial backer and Morgan Freeman as a magic-act debunker. Caine and Freeman are their usual wonderful selves, each playing a superficially archetypal role which is then revealed to be not all that it seems as the plot unfolds. The FBI and Interpol are necessary characters for the plot, and Mark Ruffalo and Ms. Laurent do well considering their characters exist in part to be duped by the illusionists. The actors who portray the illusionists--Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco-- infuse their roles with great energy, charm, and wit, albeit a theatrically glib wit. I and others in the theater remarked that we would have liked to see more of them on screen.<br/><br/>The plot is too complex for me to do it justice before seeing the film again; suffice it to say, it involves four illusionists who build a complex act that seems to involve crimes which the FBI then investigates with comical frustration. <br/><br/>The movie is worth seeing for the actors, the visuals, the locations, and the misdirection and plot twists. I am sure that a careful scrutiny will imply some plot holes that will bother some viewers, but I also believe that an even more careful scrutiny would reveal that some 'holes' are not as deep as they seem at first. ""Now You See Me"" is a wonderful summer movie with great performances, surprising plot twists, and a ""feel-good"" energy."

","Now You See Me could have been a good movie if only the writers team, or should we say the lame duck team, took the trouble to do their job correctly.<br/><br/>The story is just a big, little clear catch-all, riddled, from end to end, with quite flagrant incoherences, and punctuated by, probably, one of the worst twists ever. Indeed, this twist is ridiculous because totally unbelievable, it doesn't produce any effect on the viewer, but most seriously it instantly annihilates the credibility of the film as a whole ! And it seems like a dream when, just before, Morgan Freeman serves us up with a totally absurd and unrealistic demonstration... having to explain an outcome, above all in such a didactic and unsubtle way proves well that the script doesn't hold water.<br/><br/>This quite incredible failure of the story inevitably cripples the movie, which anyway only possesses two assets that are its dynamism and its cast, except the unbearable Mélanie Laurent who makes one grammatical mistake every three sentences and seems to be reciting her lines more than anything else, and Jesse Eisenberg who seems stuck in his Zuckerberg role, mumbling all the time. As for the cinematography, it isn't fundamentally bad but very cliché — as the soundtrack — with, for example, a lot of circus shots, a technique Leterrier used and abused of, apparently as little inspired as his writers."

","This is a summer film with so low expectations of possible audience that every hoax (=the speculative magic trick done by four tricksters) is explained as soon as it's showed to happen. The old rival magician (Morgan Freeman) takes care of the explanations, but the final twist of the movie is so stupid and unnecessary that you start to think that maybe it's also part of the bigger hoax... how to get your money without giving really any substance to care for, not even the undercasted characters. After seeing ""Now you see me"" you will miss films like ""Prestige"" with real aura of enchantment. <br/><br/>Only good reason to watch this childish film is the pursuit sequence in NY. It's much more fluent in magic than any of the stage spectacles in this film."

But I am pretty sure now, that the story is simply bad on all levels: Acting, storyline, inner logic, conclusion, message, etc. etc. How is it possible that such a movie gets a 7.3 rating on IMDb?

","Part magic, part action, part plot twist, and 100% trash. This movie is a slap in the face to all movie goers. Ridiculous, sickening, arrogant, smug and zero substance. Scooby Doo's mysteries are far more engaging. <br/><br/>Plot holes abound. Average movie goers know you can't hypnotize people to be your slaves. How much money does the cop have to exact his revenge? And who didn't see Franco coming back? Et cetera ad nauseum. Good lord, I can suspend belief for Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Transformers and all sorts bad of horror flicks, but how dumb are we supposed to be? MacGruber was more engaging and believable.<br/><br/>A great premise and wonderful actors - completely ruined by poor script, smug characters, paper-thin plot and a romance sequence direct from the writers of Carly. Pure and simple BS.<br/><br/>This is the epitome of Hollywood shouting ""Look at how great we are!!! You will love us!!"". How many orbiting camera shots can one movie have? How far do we have to suspend belief? Here's a clue, if we don't care about the characters, all the cool 'movie shots' of the characters mean nothing.<br/><br/>I love every actor in this movie. I despised every character. As other reviewers have said: ""This is a magic movie for kids who don't understand CGI can be used to create anything"". Such a fun premise - such a sad waste of talent. I feel bad for all those who wasted money on prime ticket price for this crap. I wish I could pay you all back.<br/><br/>I watched it twice. As it was rated fairly high I thought perhaps I was missing something novel or just didn't 'get it' from the first viewing - nope, it is junk. The poster child for everything wrong with Hollywood.

","Showmen have no soul. This is a typical show-boating movie that has only one purpose: to look cool. The easiest way to do that is to turn the characters into some infallible ""winners"" who are always in control of everything. To me, all that control is seriously boring rather than cool. I like to see movies where the characters face challenges, have doubts, are faced with tough situations and sometimes fail. That feels real. This one felt like some perfume commercial where they're trying to sell you a cool image, rather than a product. It never had any soul.<br/><br/>I think it may appeal to some teenagers or people who are into ""reality"" TV and celebrity culture."

You are expected to love each character from the beginning, although its never really explained, who or what they are. The story itself has no realistic elements, i mean 4 magicians robbing a bank and the police (1 single man from CIA) cant solve the case. Oh wait and we have Morgan Freeman, playing God or something as usual, doing his thing ( getting Cash). The rest is the usual Hollywood plastic, boobs, and a story with a simple twist at the end. Everyone seems entertained, since people don't seem to expect much from movies nowadays. Its a good example of how stupid and dumb movies are getting, just as dumb as the people who like such movies."

","Awful, simply awful. Cheesy, predictable, pointless and with a plot ridden with holes. Like a real magician, this film was pretentious and obnoxious, however it lacked any ""magic"" or wow factor. The whole movie stunk of trying so hard to be clever that it forgot to be, well, clever. There is a build up throughout that what they're doing is for some greater purpose, something to make all their efforts and risks worthwhile. There is not. The justification was as weak as how everything was tied together. The romantic side story made no sense, there was literally nothing to draw the characters together. Mélanie Laurent and Michael Caine are the only positives, but weren't given much to work with. I will never watch another Jesse Eisenberg film. The most enjoyable part of this movie I found was pointing out all its flaws."
"Kevbo1985","4","10","16","26 September 2013"," Why? No Reason.
","It frankly doesn't surprise me that this film has received more positive than negative feedback; it gives an audience almost everything the trailers and cast lead them to believe they'll get. Plenty of twists, turns, face time with noteworthy actors and a story that doesn't force you to believe in magic in order to believe what's happening on screen. All that being said, there is a minority of viewers, myself included, who know they could have done much more with all the talent and potential lying within Now You See Me...or maybe they couldn't, and shouldn't have bothered to try.<br/><br/>I'm hesitant to say the movie is bad, because deep down it truly isn't. Everyone, from Woody Harrelson to Michael Caine and every name-drop in between does their job and fits in snug with what's going on. Somewhere between the intriguing first 20 minutes and the disappointing last hour or so, I kept asking myself, ""why am I not enjoying this?"" The answer? It could have been so much more.<br/><br/>Hasty references to the ""why"" of it all do nothing to satisfy the curiosity of the curious, and when the final credits rolled, I realized that this was the point all along. Even after the major reveal takes place and you finally understand the ""how"", the ""why"" never materializes. The introduction of the film makes that question the focal point, and the rest of the film does its best to make you forget you ever had the question in your head to begin with.<br/><br/>Again, I can understand the praise, but I felt as if left the theater having been cheated out of my money. Considering a couple of the main scenes in the film, perhaps this was the filmmakers' entire goal to begin with. It wouldn't surprise me in the least. Regardless, most people seemed to enjoy it, so there's no reason to bash it any further than by saying it simply wasn't what I wanted it to be. It happens sometimes."

","When I see that IMDb site has this movie rated fairly high I'm seriously wondering just what am I missing with this film.

What you get should you decide to waste your time, money, and brain cells watching this trite is long boring journey into a muddled inconceivable yarn about 4 magicians who thanks entirely to camera special effects bring the magic industry to tears. Every magic act is simply crap to be polite. The line up of actors who tied their wagon to this insipid hunk of junk is quite impressive, but don't be misled, they obviously did this movie strictly for the money as there is no artistic value anywhere to be found in this pitiful attempt at movie entertainment.

","Now you see me is a weak story that has you believing its gonna be good. That's the real trick i fell for. By the time this mish mash was over i felt like i just watched a whole series of xfactor for magicians back to back. The whole premise of a group of elite magicians drafted by a mysterious founder of a secret society to right wrongs and reap revenge using magic tricks is a bit of a stretch, and never really got off the ground. Even with the instant just add water hype i was bored. Morgan Freeman was pretty average and his character Thaddeus Badly was pantomimic. Woody Harrelson did his usual standard with his character of Merritt McKinney the master hypnotist who could hypnotize anyone. Seriously he could have just got people to hand over money instead of creating elaborate scenarios. Mark Ruffalo as Dylan Rhodes was the central character but is so weak it left the movie hollow and bland. If you haven't seen it than good for you.

","The 4 main magicians are unlikeable.<br/><br/>They clearly have stolen money from the French bank but are let go. They would have been at least told to not leave the state of Nevada.<br/><br/>The drugged guards from the French Bank are never found or speak up? Flash paper still needs an ignition source.<br/><br/>Merritt McKinney (Woody) can hypnotize anyone at will. How did Common get hypnotize? Over the phone? The New Orleans show was sold out in seconds after the Vegas show. How did the audience members all be victims of Hurricane Katrina? How did they get all the bank account numbers? Again, the magicians clearly steal money from Arthur Tressler's (Caine) account. This money would have been returned to his account if found to be transferred illegally.<br/><br/>When did Jack Wilder (Franco) become Jason Bourne? <br/><br/>How did no one see the bus have a car attached to the front? No other drivers would have reported this? What if the car flipped in the other lane killing a family of four? How could they not foresee that? <br/><br/>The mirror box trick only works if you are not in the box.<br/><br/>The case against Thaddeus Bradley(Freeman) would never reach court. Who has the money they supposedly stole fly out of their parked SUV when police show up. Where did FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) go at the end? Wouldn't his disappearance spark doubt on Bradley guilt? I thought Bradley was surrounded by his crew. When did he steal the money?<br/><br/>How did Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) make time to do his secret magician stuff? The FBI never notices he is missing? I though he was spending all his time on some big case.<br/><br/>They steal (phone switch, banks, etc) and assault Federal agents. In the end, they are not still wanted or sought after?

","Loved this movie. Gotta say the ""cool"" factor got to me in every crucial aspect of this flick. It is difficult to be ""cool"" without being corny or coming off silly. Even Woody H. is getting to be enjoyable to me and he's never been one of my fav actors. The storyline is simple and it moves fast with no time to get bored. Each character is acted out really slick, not superficially deep (although I would have enjoyed more character development) and kept my attention.<br/><br/>The two heavies, M. Freeman & M. Caine, were very good, of course, and give the movie two solid performances that complement very well the other cast members. Mark Ruffalo was spot on - gosh he's good, why hasn't he made more movies I wonder? (Love him as the Hulk).<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg is so dang believable that he better do something else quick or he's going to be forever etched in my mind as an illusionist! His character's glances and demeanor are great with, to me, an underlying sense of he can't believe how good he & the other 3 are at what they do. I loved that about each character - they weren't arrogant to the point of unbelievability or boredom. It's like they all were on a ride they could hardly believe. LOL, I kept looking at Isla Fisher and thinking, ""Is that Amy Adams?"" But I knew it couldn't be. And Dave Franco - the look-alike baby Franco brother did a good job with his smaller part.<br/><br/>I know I've said it already, but this movie is cool.

You're always wondering who's behind it all and in the end they just wrap it up and throw it all together and logically it makes no sense at all. For some reason the two investigators fall in love in the end even though throughout the movie there was no romance between them or relationship development - its like the directors just wanted to throw a romantic happy ending in. The magic tricks are all unbelievable and unrealistic; if you're going to make a movie about magic why not throw a bit of real magic in? The soundtrack is terrible its almost like its there to keep you excited but really it just annoys you. Things that happen in the movie just don't make sense; a number of things just wouldn't happen in real-life; certain characters don't have reasons for what they do; its all just thrown together.

","The film didn't interest me from start to finish mainly due to the fact the viewer was given no chance to develop empathy for any character. Each character is introduced in sequence but in an unsubtle, tasteless manner invoking cringey feelings from the outset. The opening was 'cheese' of the purest kind. Good actors namely Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine were wasted here. Many of the tricks and illusions, although quite lavish, were not inspiring and appeared quite unrealistic in the context of the film. There was no awe or wonder regarding the performance of illusions due to the fact I never became immersed in the film and always regarded the stunts as staged. In one opening scene I developed such a dislike for a character, in the space of just 2 or 3 sentences, it was my hope the actress would simply drown during her stunt and save everyone the misery of listening a moment longer.

","All I read in other reviews was how this movie lacks a coherent story, which is true. But that's not the reason I think the film was bad. At first I believed that it was just your average heist movie with the gimmick of the culprits being magicians. The finale however catapulted the movie down from being average to being atrociously bad. Of course I mean the reveal with Mark Ruffalo at the carousel. It came out of nowhere, it made no sense and it didn't contribute at all to the story. I watched it twice with friends to convince them and myself that it really was the worst plot twist of all time. Know any movies that are near masterpieces but contain one scene that ruins the entire experience? That's what this movie is, the only difference being that without the horrendous plot twist it still wouldn't be close to a decent movie."
"jonh1411","1","5","7","20 April 2014"," Absolutely terrible movie!
","I saw this movie not knowing what to expect, only knowing that it involved some sort of heist and magic. I thought maybe a mixture of The Prestige and Oceans 11. At any rate, I thought the movie looked like it could be interesting and fun.<br/><br/>It was NOT.<br/><br/>I'm not sure where to begin with this. The start of the movie seemed promising, if not a little cliché. We saw the four ""Horsemen"" characters doing their various magic tricks, or cons, in some cases, and being followed by a shadowy figure. They were each left with a card inviting them to show up at some place to be invited into some sort of special club. At this point, the movie didn't really show any signs of being too bad. From there on out, it was down hill. They show up at some apartment and we get some brief histories of the various characters. Not enough to know why they do what they do (I assumed this would come later, but nope - we learn next to nothing about them. We never learn what their motivation for doing anything is.). To sum up the characters: Wood Harrelson's character: Annoying washed up magician reduced to conning people in airports using ""mentalist"" magic and hypnosis. Jesse Eisenberg's character: Basically Zuckerberg in ""The Social Network"", but also does magic. Isla Fisher: Used to be Eisenberg's assistant. The other guy: Can pick locks and steals wallets.<br/><br/>So after that one minute introduction to the characters, the audience has found some connection with them, some way to empathize or at least root for them. Oh wait no we haven't. We just see four jerks enter an apartment, trigger some blurry hologram or something, that can't really be made out, and they're all saying ""Wow! This is awesome!"", I'm sitting in my seat thinking ""What? What are you looking at? What is so interesting?"".<br/><br/>Next shot the four horsemen have a TV show and it's one year later and their on stage in front of thousands and explain how they are going to rob a bank. Some French guy gets duped into thinking he robbed the bank, for some reason.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo enters the movie at this point and starts chasing the four horsemen down. Morgan Freeman is also up to something. Michael Caine gets duped by the Four Horsemen because he's rich. They con him out of lots of money. But it makes absolutely no sense. They steal his money and deposit it in his ""victims"" accounts, illegally. They do realize that the money will be put back into Caine's account the next day right? At this point I lost all hope that this film had any redeemable qualities. There's another robbery. Mark Ruffalo falls in love with a French woman for some reason. For some reason the Four Horsemen fill Morgan Freeman's car with money, and he notices just as the police arrive. We are perhaps supposed to believe he will go to jail for this, but if he as a lawyer with a functioning brain, it wouldn't even go to trial. The Four Horsemen as much as admit live on TV their crimes, so it's pretty obvious Freeman is being framed. And if he wasn't, why would he put all the money in his car in such an absurd way? Nothing makes sense! <br/><br/>The creme de la creme of drivel happens when the fourth Horseman gets killed in a car chase. His car flips over on a busy highway and explodes into flames, just as Ruffalo can reach in through the window and grab a McGuffin. I'm not sure if we were supposed to feel sad, or anything at the death of the guy who basically has done nothing for most of the movie. He threw some cards like shurikens and picked a lock - that's it. However, I remember thinking, ""I did see HIS car flip over and explode, so this movie will have a lot of explaining to do if he isn't dead."" But at that point I was so disengaged from the movie, and cared so little about any of the characters, that I could barely muster an eyebrow raise after the movie revealed that, yes, the fourth horsemen was alive. But how? As I said, I saw HIS car explode. Nope, the movie claims I saw another car explode. A car that was attached to the front of a bus on a busy highway, driven by Woody Harrelson. So the movie claimed I was a liar and that I saw some other car explode. So, are these Four horsemen omnipotent? How could they possibly guarantee that the chain of events would transpire exactly in that way, so that the dummy car flips over in just the right place at just the right time on just the right road and everyone (including TV helicopters) don't notice the big switcheroo? Are we really this stupid? Do the audience really deserve this? So after the shock of being called a liar by the movie, I then had to witness perhaps the worst ""big reveal"" in cinematic history. A reveal that made so little sense and threw out the entire story up to that point. It makes the entire movie pointless.<br/><br/>So the movie ends when the four horseman come together and put the cards that they were given one year ago (and they haven't even dog-eared the corners in all that time) together and some laser magic happens or some crap, and Mark Ruffalo appears and says well done, you can join my club, or whatever. Nobody cares at this point. They all get on a merry-go- round (I'm not joking) and the movie ends. My only advise is, if you are taking a film making course, you might as well watch this to see how not to make a movie. Otherwise keep clear of this toxic waste."

The first thing that struck me was the theatrical acting of the stars. You can probably put up with one or two and tolerate the overly pretentious acting of the minions for the magicians and the cop for a while but when heavy weights like Morgan Freeman and Michael Kane join the crowd with the same bad acting the movie becomes just unbearable. Everything about it; the french cop who fills up for the pretty brainy character, the car chase scenes, etc. so cliché, so cheesy that I can't remember a single scene which deserves a few good words to balance the score. On top of that, the never ending background music of the soundtrack is very distracting and annoying.

Honestly, there was no single magic trick that made my jaw drop or say oh my gosh I've never seen that before. All the tricks were stupid, and I didn't care for them, didn't even bother listening to HOW these tricks were done. If you want to be bored, please go watch. But if you really want to watch magic tricks that will entertain you, well, any magic trick on youtube is better than this cr*p. I know I sound harsh, but VERY disappointed in this movie Oh, the performances were not bad, I don't know names so I will call em as I see em, the blondie agent was trying to act like a badass agent trying to find out the truth but without forgetting the beauty of magic, well she failed, her sleepy face and lack of emotion didn't help her at all.. The Hulk's performance was actually weird, he just stares a lot and tilts his head and opens his mouth a lot, kinda uncomfortable to watch .. The four magicians acted nicely but the red head girl was way too cheery, like she should have been cast in glee or enchanted instead."
"Michael-96","5","9","15","19 September 2013"," Incredibly contrived, lazy script wastes the acting talent
","Now You See Me starts off promisingly, but sadly spirals downhill very quickly. Nonsensical ""magic trick"" after nonsensical ""magic trick"" goes completely unexplained, and save for one minor trick near the start of the movie, the explanations behind those few for which explanations are attempted become more and more nonsensical. Few films ask you to suspend disbelief to this degree, and the rare few which do are universally terrible.<br/><br/>There is a great cast in this movie, and although the CGI is often mediocre, the cinematography is of the standard you'd expect from a mainstream Hollywood film. And yet, all is wasted because of a plot with gaping holes in it, the size of the Holland Tunnel. No attempt is made to fill them in, either. You watch scene after scene, asking yourself why you're even continuing, and hoping above hope that all will resolve itself in the end.<br/><br/>It doesn't. The ending is even more childish and ham-fisted than the rest of the movie. Now You See Me is a staggering disappointment, and it all comes down to one of the weakest scripts in recent memory.<br/><br/>What a shame."
"mclaughlinconnor338","3","9","15","8 September 2013"," Lame and uninteresting
","This was a major disappointment. I really did not know what to expect, but it certainly was not this mess. The only things I did like was the acting of Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine, and I suppose Woody Harrelson did a pretty good job too. Other than that, this was just awful. The characters are all as shallow as a puddle, with all the likability of the drunk college frat boys across my street. Seriously, I was cheering for the Four horsemen to be caught and flogged in jail because they were all irritating, ungrateful, and nearly got several innocent people killed. Jesse Eisenberg's character and Franco's character and acting are very bad. Eisenberg is still the character he was in the Social Network, and I did not even like him or that movie then. I really do not see the big deal about this guy. And James Franco's brother has about as much talent as Patrick Wayne did in comparison to his father (I'll give you a hint; it is not a whole lot). The Story was rendered completely and utterly pointless by the stupid ""twist"" at the end, which to be honest was not that interesting, and was contrived and devoid of logic to begin with so it did not do as much harm as it should have. The effects were the final nail in the coffin, As soon as I saw the utterly cheap and shameless CGI I felt like leaving. It was a depressing experience to see this film literally butchered by crap CGI and cheesy cinematography within the first five minutes. This film, on the surface is close to a modern equivalent of Arabesque; a film that has as little logic as possible peppered with crazy cinematography. But Arabesque at least had Gregory Peck, and Sophia Loren who were better actors than any of the four horsemen here, are Sophia was easily better looking than anyone in this movie. Do not waste your time here, this was garbage. While technically a far worse film, Sharknado is easily better than Now You See Me, or any other film this year for sheer unpretentious fun. Aren't the summer blockbuster's supposed to be fun anyway?"
"doctaton","3","9","15","2 September 2013"," Absolutely pathetic!
","Well, how do I start? I really had a lot of expectations on this film, but unfortunately, I've been absolutely disappointed. I must admit, though, the first 5 minutes are promising, lol. As soon the 4 horsemen meet in the the ""boss"" flat, (let's call him like that), the movie starts it's non-stop-ravine-fall. The film has everything I hate on a film: a childish story, a hardly credible teenage storyline, a lack of suspense in the development of the plot, and a very predictable ending, which is absolutely embarrassing to the viewer. However, there is something you can save of this firing: the outstanding performances of Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Caine, even though they're not, by far, worth of swallowing this horrible sleeping pill."

","... that is perfect for a summer popcorn movie where you just want to sit and enjoy the on screen action and the theatre AC. Now You See Me is really well done, it's swiftly directed and there are no odd parts, and I knew what kind of movie I was going to watch so I am not disappointed.<br/><br/>On the other hand the movie did not surprise me, and the plot is mostly a gimmick you don't care about by the time the trick is revealed. The casting was great: gathering Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harelson... is a key factor of success here. These three are the most powerful and impressive performers of the lot, and Melanie Laurent comes just behind with a different kind of character that does help keep the story on track in between extravaganza scenes. Mark Ruffalo does the job but is not entirely convincing, yet I reckon the part was written in such a way that he must alternatively appear a funny fool and an a-hole, to end up looking a nice handsome dedicated copper... By far, not the easiest job on the lot.<br/><br/>I was surprised Jesse Eisenberg received top billing. He must really be hot property after the Social Network, but frankly Woody Harelson is by far the best of the 4 horsemen. Eisenberg looks as if he is not able to play something else than the Mark Zuckerberg type. Isla Fisher has little to play with and is thus underused, as always alas. And there's also a fourth horseman who picks locks but is quite pellucid.<br/><br/>All in all the movie runs very smoothly for its 115min runtime but it is mostly ""in your face"" entertainment and will leave no mark as a clever or intriguing movie."
"TheConnoisseurReviews","5","8","13","4 June 2013"," ""Now You See Me"" Review
","""Now You See Me"" is a enjoyable popcorn flick. However, it tends to be more flash than actual substance.The concept of the film is intriguing, but it isn't done in an all too interesting way. It's just a fast paced film that throws a lot of stuff at you, but never truly lets you absorb what is happening. The magic show scenes are one of the highlights of the movie as it's full of energy and the right amount of flash. My personal favorite moment is a fight/chase scene in the third act of the movie with Dave Franco. It's shot well and has some really nice fight choreography.<br/><br/>My biggest gripe with the film is the cinematography and editing. The camera is always moving, either rotating around actors as they talk or around the scenery. It's hard to focus and at times I became nauseated. Editing in the film is incredibly quick, which takes away from taking in some of these elaborate shots. On a positive note, it does get more tamed as the movie progresses mainly in the third act.<br/><br/>The cast is fine, but only two characters really stand out. Not that everyone else is giving a bad performance, but the characters they play lack substance or any really good one liners. The best characters are Woody Harrelson's and Mark Ruffalo's. Harrelson's character has the best lines and the best moments. He's funny, charismatic, and at the same time wise. Ruffalo's character is the most developed and intriguing. He's an FBI agent, who seems to have luck always against him and we can't help, but cheer for him. The rest of the cast is either throw away, like Isla Fisher and Dave Franco, or interesting, but underdeveloped, like Jesse Eisenberg and Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Now You See Me"" is an enjoyable film that chooses flash over substance. Characters are mainly paper thin as they're underdeveloped or pushed to the side aside from Ruffalo and Harrelson. The film has a nice soundtrack that gives it the right amount of energy. However, the dizzying camera work and rapid editing make it really hard to be absorbed into the story. I give it 2.5/5, an enjoyable film that doesn't always engage with it's high concept and original story."
"josebut8","Null","8","13","1 June 2013"," Tricked Out
","(May contain SPOILERS) One of the most annoying things about ""Now You See Me"" is lens flare. Lens flare is the current cinematic trick du jour, if not obsession of many directors looking to slick up their movies with a high gloss. Lens flare, you may recall, is when light enters the lens, refracts and creates a brief mini super-nova across the film frame. The cinematic equivalent of having a flashlight shone in your eyes, which this film does, on numerous occasions. It's an apt visual metaphor for a movie that proclaims itself to be about diverting the gaze in order to trick the viewer. But here, temporary blindness (like fake lens flare), is a cheap gimmick that is much easier to employ than true slight of hand. There's no real sense of magic in this movie that is about magic. The tricks along with the nature of magic itself are constantly being explained along the way draining the film of magic of any kind. The would be ""brainy"" complications of the plot are not brainy enough...the complicated bank account trick slogs on for what seems an eternity. Capers need to be plotted with air-tight precision that stand up to repeated viewings. The caper needs to be carried out by characters about whom you care enough to be invested in whether or not they get caught. The filmmakers here make the deadly mistake of thinking the tricks are more interesting than the tricksters. And present a series of tricks that are not really all that compelling. Shallow characters carrying out rather pedestrian tricks adds up to a movie that's rather shallow and pedestrian, no matter how much lens flare you throw at the camera. Which is a shame, because it's a fantastic premise which should have been developed for someone up to the task...a cinematic magician if you will. As for the plot, it gets loopier as it goes along, trying to explain itself because it really has no point. You never really know what anyone's motivation is...who is Morgan Freeman again? Why is Michael Caine in this and why is it okay to rob him? Which would be fine, except the movie is at such pains to keep explaining itself (literally) it starts to feel that the movie is explaining itself to itself. The actors were all wasted, trying desperately to impart some kind of character to their character (Harrelson is most successful, but his efforts are for naught. Eisenberg is completely wasted). There is one thrilling scene when the movie comes to life. A fight in a small apartment between one of the magicians and two FBI agents. The magician uses the magic from up his sleeves to fend off the two men. This scene, which approached a kind of magic, was what ""Now You See Me"" needed more of. But you'll have to settle for lens flare."
"beansproutlord","2","6","9","27 January 2014"," Awful movie, and it's awful that it scores so high on IMDb
","If you enjoy overproduced, brainless Hollywood fare that only has pointless glitter and brightly colored movement as its keystones, you'll love ""Now You See Me"".<br/><br/>Ostensibly a film set in the world of stage magic, it might as well be set in the land of Oz for all the connection it has to that most fascinating of arcane entertainments. If you want a film that explores magic, why not check out the quintessential The Prestige by Christopher Nolan, or even the slightly overrated The Illusionist with Monsieur Edward Norton. Don't look at this utter garbagefest.<br/><br/>This movie commits many of the major crimes of bad movie-making; clichéd stock characters, a lack of directorial restraint, a reliance on poorly integrated CGI and a very, very rudimentary and poorly realized plot. Scratch that, there were two plots in this movie... and at least one of them was totally and utterly redundant. Actually I think both plot lines might have been redundant.<br/><br/>The movie contained some very fine actors. In fact, it contains some of my favorite actors. By the end of the film, I pretty much hated them for appearing in this affront to my intelligence.<br/><br/>Like the infamous ""Uncle Boonmee Who Can Remember His Past Lives"" before it, I feel that Now You See Me has a mind-altering effect upon the weak-minded; I fear that all the IMDb reviewers that rated this above 5 out of 10 must have had their brains addled by the sheer horribleness and meaninglessness of this cheap, patronizing, irrelevant cavalcade of drivel. And they should all be heartily ashamed of themselves for showing that IMDb scores- long a useful method of telling good films from bad- are now totally unreliable."

","The first scene was great.

His 'grand scheme' is driven by this resentment which destroys the whole idea behind it.<br/><br/>Also there is no reason at all for him to be an FBI agent; his plan does not involve him in any way. All of his scenes are there only for us and the end. That is a really bad reason and destroys everything left of this movie.<br/><br/>This film has absolutely no prestige."
"shauni15","6","6","9","24 August 2013"," entertaining while you watch, but dumb when you really think about it.
","Now you see me, is a story about 4 magicians who are brought together by an unknown entity to do the best and biggest trick the world has ever seen. Involving a series of robin hood style ""rob the rich give to the poor"" tricks. And while it's a nice concept and starts off nice, hell even clever, it becomes entangled in it's own web of trying to make you feel stupid, or maybe make itself look smart?<br/><br/>The direction(by Louis Leterrier) is surprisingly good albeit shaky cam is a bit overused on the action sequences(oh god i hate shaky cam), but the magic tricks and all the quirks that come with it are very well done, and make you feel like part of them.<br/><br/>The acting is uneven to say the least. Jesse Eisenberg and Dave Franco play themselves very convincingly, Isla Fisher is basically playing a bland character with zero personality (mainly due to the writing to which ill get in a second). However Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent manage to make what little they have to work with pretty good. Michael Caine is pretty much wasted here, and Morgan Freeman unfortunately has nothing to work with thanks to the script(i'm pretty sure they only hired him to narrate the exposition scenes). which brings me to my next part.<br/><br/>The writing. Oh god the writing, it appears that the writers were so busy coming up with forced twists and complicated plots that they forgot about writing actual characters in the movie, every character is so generic and bland that it's not even funny. Yeah thats the guy who's annoying and cocky but we still love him, thats the guy that tries to be the annoying and cocky guy but isn't, thats the girl character, yeah basically thats it, she doesn't need a personality she's a girl! the only character that had even the slightest bit of depth was Woody Harrelson's and maybe Melanie Laurents but if i had to be completely honest i'd credit that to Harrelson's acting and not the writing. I mean there were apparently 5 guys that have writing credits, couldn't they have added at least a LITTLE character development instead of another stupid exposition scene? Oh that's another thing, i know this movie is supposed to be about showing us how the tricks work, but man do they spoon feed it to us, they could do it in so much less time and leave some to the imagination or you know... common sense. But i guess that'd leave them time to make characters that don't have the depth a muddy puddle and we just cant have that.<br/><br/>WITH THAT SAID THOUGH: I found it actually entertaining while I've been watching it, if there's one thing this movie does right, is that it's rarely boring. The action sequences were great (except for the car chase in new york, but i guess thats mainly due to my severe hatred towards shaky cam when its not needed), the visuals were spectacular, and while the movie is going it kinda manages to make you forget about how shallow and forced it is. <br/><br/>So if you want to watch a film you can forget right after you walk out of the theater then go ahead, it fulfills the role of a popcorn flick very well. But don't expect it to be smart despite looking smart, because it'll deceive you just like a true magician."
"brunorulez","2","7","11","12 February 2014"," A cool and easy premise, a really crappy movie
","The pacing is one of my biggest problem with this movie. It's supposed to be a Mystery/Thriller (according to IMDb) but it has an action movie pacing, which makes no room for any of the characters to develop or for the twist (believe me, i use some terms very loosely) to have any weight.<br/><br/>It's like getting a good movie like The Usual Suspects and trying to remake it in the pace of Crank. It will be a huge smoldering piece of turd.<br/><br/>The dialogue is just terrible, all of the characters lines are just thrown on the movie, with complete disregard for the last scene you just experienced, making the ""jokes"" (i did it again) so obvious and predictable that you are cringing in embarrassment even before the characters said them. The same happens with the supposedly cool or heavy dialogues, you can see them a mile away since most (if not all) the movie lines are a mashed disgusting brown paste of cliché and bad acting. The lines would probably be half bad if the rhythm of the movie wasn't so messed up, the movie will many times cut to a character just so he can say his ""witty"" line and them back to what was happening before the cut, making the lines not interesting to say the least<br/><br/>The magic tricks are just ridiculous, it's like the writers knew that they couldn't make interesting or surprising tricks so they just decided to make them obvious so the audience can feel like they are smart for seeing through them. And dear god they do waaaaaaay too many tricks during the movie, it's like if in Oceans Eleven they robbed the 3 casinos separately. By the time they reach the third casino, you just don't care anymore. Their magic tricks are so ridiculously dumb that you begin to think that their best magic tricks are the ones with no importance on the movie (like transforming the rabbit in a hat).<br/><br/>About the characters in this movie, they are so bad that is almost unfair to talk about them, but I will do it anyway. Ruffalo's character (and all of the FBI to be quite honest) are so incompetent that it's just sad, it's like the writers decided to ridicule them on purpose, reminding me of the police from The Mask, I was constantly waiting to watch them dance Cuban Pete with Jim Carrey but it didn't happen. As for the team of magicians, the Four Horsemen, their characters have no exchanges of opinions or ideas through the whole movie, they don't suffer any crysis or even have any lines between themselves, I laughed so hard in a scene that Jesse Eisenberg says to Dave Franco ""aren't you always complaining about wanting to be treated as an adult"", because that sort of complaint and behavior isn't shown on the whole movie as they rarely even talk to each other.<br/><br/>It's like The Four horsemen are just characters summaries, their personalities are so uni-dimensional and you don't see any character development or anything about them aside from their introduction in the movie. The trailers make it seem like they are the main characters of the movie, but instead of seeing a movie about a team of robbers, it's a movie about a shallow romance of an incompetent FBI agent.<br/><br/>This is possibly one of the worst movies i ever watched, it's just so flawed and it's supposed to be serious, i don't know how they could have made such a shitty work with such an cool and easy to do premise, almost any story that you can think about a group of magicians that rob a bank during a live show will be cool. It's a terrible movie, with terrible characters, terrible rhythm, terrible story with an easy and cool premise."

Too bad, because the photography, music and even some of the acting was just fine. The story should have been completely re-written. Film was also very choppy and it looks like scenes were filmed and cut or should have be written and filmed. Am tired of Jesse Eisenberg playing the same character in EVERY MOVIE IN WHICH HE APPEARS.

The writers/directors tried desperately to make more twists and turns than is possible in any realm of reality or fiction, there was little to no character development, and I was disappointed. You can tell that they spent a TON of money getting wonderful actors, awesome lighting and special effects, but it was wasted because even though we are pretty smart people, very little about the magic tricks and especially the ending made any sense whatsoever. I gave this movie 6/10 for its visual effects and camera work, but the story sucks.

Can't blame them though as the story must have been written by a 13 year old and directed by his classmate. Said story is so full of clichés, illogical scenarios, ridiculous turns of events and bad dialog that even Britney Spears Crossroads movie would merit an Oscar in comparison. Beware, anyone who like movies, do not let this movie ruin your evening like it did to mine, where it literally (in its right sense) turned my nose red from constant face palming.

"Afflock","10","13","24","31 May 2013"," Very entertaining with some originality
","Just caught the film on Friday opening weekend. To sum it up in one word is ""entertaining"". It has the special affects you would expect from ILM behind the scenes. While a few plot mechanism may seem familiar, there is enough original content and spin that it will keep your attention throughout. It has light humor throughout which keeps the experience light hearted. The strong points are the script, acting, directing, cinematography, and visual affects. Yes, it is about stage magicians, but movie magic is used to keep the illusion alive and not actual stage theatrics. The only noticeable weak point is it has potential to be a little bit better in execution of some of the plot twist and it keeps a few important details a little too subtle for one viewing for some viewers.<br/><br/>It is a story driven film and not so much a character driven story. There is enough character development to make sense but not balanced enough to feel as engaged to every character. You will understand the characters but may not root for them as much as I'd like. Morgan Freeman certainly holds the screen well and his lines keep people up to speed if they miss something. His character is something of an in movie narrator, but done well from a writing and acting perspective. Jessie Eisenburg's character is also entertaining and engaging as one of the Four Horsemen (the name of the magical stage performers).<br/><br/>It has multiple plot twist, some big and some small. These keep you engaged and trying to guess the next move or explain what just happened. A good film to watch with friends and talk about afterwards.<br/><br/>It has a good mass appeal and has only a little cussing (3 words I can remember), violence (from car chases), or intense scenes (magic tricks gone wrong where possible bodily harm is implied but not seen) to not keep the younger viewers away. The plot twist may be too complicated for non-teenager youth. Overall it is very entertaining."

","And I will not back up with this statement. It is a good movie, because it's not a boring movie, but it is that kind of movie that you watch once and walk away and forget all about it. <br/><br/>First off, let me tell you why movies involving magic tricks don't work. Because magic is for live audience and everything made on camera loses the main purpose of magic. In order to enjoy it, we have to subscribe to things that defy plausibility, we are obliged to take unrealistic facts for granted. But let's say we're OK with that. The Illusionist or The Prestige worked that way. <br/><br/>The real problem here is that the storyline is cynical and walks on a path of plain 'by the book' twist after twist after twist scenario, even though they lack of substance, motivation, trying to create an undeserved WOW effect. Plus, they forced in a classical fling to satisfy all viewers. There are major unrealistic events, but I guess the movie is not for us who try to find logic, but for those who just want to be entertained and see sparkles."
"frezeframe","1","12","22","21 June 2013"," The trick is on you if you pay 12.00 to see this movie!
","The movie is called ""Now You See Me."" And by that, I assume they were referring to the plot. Nice one guys- I was fooled! This is what happens when a screenwriter writes from the ""outside in"" instead of the ""inside out."" It's all about outside elements (plot plot plot, twist twist twist) and no inside elements (human motivation/emotion). Honestly, I couldn't give a spoiler to this movie if I tried, because I have no idea what it is about. No-one does. It was just the filmmakers making up whatever cliché was convenient for them at the time and trying to twist the plot so much that YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. Oh spare me that horse crap! It's always sad when movies TRY to be 3 steps ahead of an audience.<br/><br/>NEWS FLASH TO DIRECTOR Louis Leterrier. We're smart now. You know.. audiences. Maybe this flashy, celebrity packed mis-direction movie would have worked in the 90s, but unexplained magic tricks are boring to us now. We don't fall for stupid, predictable camera manipulation anymore.<br/><br/>We know you've been rubbing one out to The Illusionist and The Prestige every night for the lat 3 years, but let's be honest... you can't one up The Illusionist, or the Prestige. Those are masterful movies that should be left alone. You might have been able to pull this off had it been a TV series. But you had about 20 plot points that went nowhere, because you have no time to develop anything substantial with a feature film with 20 plot points (Cloud Atlas being the only exception). When you finally revealed the big secret, the audience I was in was disinterested and distracted by all the gaping holes left over from Act 1. Forget Act 3. Car chase sequence? Really? (no that's not a spoiler, because it was not a central part to the story). Speaking of story... It was interesting that the filmmakers choose not to include back-story- or motives- or subtext, or indications of character inspiration, or clues onto what certain symbols meant. It was just all one big, fat convenient mystery that ends in the most overdone Hollywood cliché one can imagine. We didn't know who to root for. Just because Morgan Freeman looks like he does and talks like he does doesn't give you a free pass to bukkake your action sequence fantasy all over the screen. Morgan Freeman is not Marlin Brando. His presence doesn't transcend the story. Even Brando himself couldn't have made this a good movie, because you wouldn't have time to invest in him because it's BAM BAM BAM, next plot point, next plot point, twist, twist, twist. The audience was thinking, ""Hold on! Slow down! Wait, what? Huh?""<br/><br/>Honestly, I don't want to waste any more of my time thinking about this turd. Just do yourself a favor and wait for it to come out on Redbox. At least then you'll only bitch about throwing away 1.50. (and you can get your grocery shopping done at the same time). <br/><br/>Oh and BTW... we get it Louis Leterrier; you're French. Thanks for ramming the French thing down our throats the entire movie in characters and location."

","""Now You See Me"" has such a great hook - an illusionist ""Ocean's Eleven"" - but it also has serious problems. One of them is that for such a sterling cast, there's very little in the way of likable characters. One, actually, and he takes the fall in the end. But it's hard to see good actors playing awful characters (Woody Harrelson's the one who escapes largely unscathed because he's Woody Harrelson) and it speaks to the flimsy writing. This movie plays fast and loose with internal consistency, straining credibility way beyond acceptable limits. I could even stomach the completely artificial ending if the rest of the movie was grounded in some kind of reality. But all of the tricks and sleights of hand are just flashy effects - these people are more superheroes than magicians.<br/><br/>It all really comes down to having a laugh at your audience, which this movie does with glee. Add in the intolerable smugness, A.D.D. camera-work and editing and this isn't an ounce of fun.<br/><br/>4/10"

","What if the American Dream was only money? What if the dollar bill, no longer based on gold, was the only measure of everything, and a grand illusion? Has one become too jaded after watching such blockbusters on end? Well, here we are. Watch my eyes, watch my eyes, don't look around my eyes!<br/><br/>Should we first go through character exposition? Please meet an illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), a mentalist (Woody Harrelson), a spoon bending sleight (Dave Franco) and an escape artist doing (or not) an Houdini routine with piranhas (Isla Fisher). Is that enough of a random crew for you? Good, let's proceed.<br/><br/>Teaming up through tarots (no, really!) our ""Four Horsemen"" (of what?) are confronted with a Jigsaw-like setup which, let's say it once and for all, is impossible to achieve without a hefty dose of CGI. Any magic which will follows will be equally impossible to achieve without a green wall. Consider yourself warned – and bored in equal measure.<br/><br/>One year later, they are onstage in Las Vegas, for a grand illusion performance that has nothing to do with their conjugated talents apart from throwing card decks to the audience and explaining where a bunny goes when it vanishes. The show is a decoy for an elaborate heist to rob the Crédit Républicain de Paris (again?) to rapturous applause. Morgan Freeman is in the audience, playing The Eye in the Sky with his trademark bonhomie.<br/><br/>Sir Michael Caine is there too, of course. Ah, Michael Caine, him of the endless list of cardboard characters requiring a British accent. So can we establish that Caine is evil and Freeman good in this movie narrative? Thank you.<br/><br/>Siphoning money through a conveniently placed air duct, the heist relies on CGI and Jose Garcia's innocent-abroad French idiomatics, from La vache to Oh merde. Interpol Agent Dray (Mélanie Laurent) flies in from Europe and is pitched against FBI's Agent Rhodes (Marc Ruffalo, awful as usual). The Four Horsemen are interrogated, leading to more impossible tricks which will be explained by surveillance cameras played in slow motion.<br/><br/>Excusez-moi, the French heist being debunked by Morgan Freeman by way of a trapdoor, should we move on? Caine says to Freeman he has little eyes; the plot hinges on who does/did not believe in magic during a money transfer scene shamelessly appealing to Katrina hurricane's victims before dragging forever on a protracted gag. Agent Rhodes reads with his fingers and Agent Dray knows everything as per the plot to progress.<br/><br/>Suddenly the Four Horsemen become fugitives and someone imperviously asks ""Now get me an airplane"", which one guesses is part of the perks of featuring in such big budget endeavours. Come on, how many times were you able to shout that, then get one?<br/><br/>There is a Fifth Horseman masterminding the whole thing. There is a not bad car chase, lifted from other movies from the most part, but one has no idea what it is doing there. One Horseman appears to be down, not that it affects in any way the somnolent viewer. There is also a red herring or two.<br/><br/>A safe full of balloon animals pops open, a scene glossily but ineptly made, and one's heart goes to the prop crew. Now, what could possibly be more insulting than a Katrina's ripoff? Well, a 911 light show of course!<br/><br/>No one barely educated in such big budget thrill rides will have any hard time guessing who's the Fifth Horseman: the only reason why being ""Because we say so"". Money IS magic. Everyone is dumb. The true marker of fame is Times Square. Oh la la.<br/><br/>A sequel is due in a couple of mouths. Same magical time, same magical place, folks!"

","As a magician myself, I love films that look in to a magicians world, The Prestige being one of my favorite films so Now You See Me really interested me. And in terms of showmanship and effects, it delivers, its a huge magical spectacle, but, just like the best of magic effects, the closer you look the less you see. <br/><br/>This film is all style and no substance. The characters are all paper thin, nothings clear about why they do anything they do, even at the end where we are given a conclusion that stretches your disbelief so far, that the mystery is shattered by just how far down the rabbit hole they go to try and fool you into thinking what you just saw was magic, when really, it was just a huge con job.<br/><br/>Overall, The spectacle of the show is what kept me involved, It made me smile because, even as a magician, the film feels like magic, it loves how it presents magic and thats what magic is about, presentation."

"slicedbread117","6","2","2","24 December 2013"," Now you see me, now you don't.
","The title of this movie almost sums up how the film is presented. All that's missing is the second half of the saying: ""now you don't"". It goes to say that at some points this movie is fun and entertaining, hence the ""now you see me"", and at other times it can become almost the opposite, ""now you don't"".<br/><br/>The movie presents an interesting concept from the start: a group of illusionists who perform bank heists during their shows and reward the audience with the money. The plot is interesting yes, but the amount of plot holes overall over-lap the amount of a well structured story. There are times where the movie simply makes no sense. I found myself struggling to keep up with the excess amount of twists thrown in, along with the brutally fast pacing of the film. On the plus side, some of these twists are exciting and lead to some great moments, and some of the ""action"" scenes, if you will, are fun to watch. The magic tricks and illusions are especially interesting. However, more often than not, the plot as a whole fails to deliver, despite the occasional exciting scene.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier's direction style didn't always seem to fit this movie. The pacing was way off, and there was little to zero character development, making it seem like a group of characters were thrown together for almost no good reason. Now again, there are occasionally parts where I felt the movie was moving along fairly well and it had me interested, but too often the movie lacked proper pacing, and suffered from non-existent character development throughout.<br/><br/>The cast ranges from the mildly to the highly experienced, with the likes of Dave Franco to Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg. It's a talented and diverse cast that is brought together, and each actor does a great job in their respective roles. Again, the one thing that hurt the cast was the lack of character development. Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, and Michael Caine round out the solid cast and to reiterate, all give great performances.<br/><br/>In Now You See Me, there was a great opportunity to create an interesting take on the heist-related genre. At some times, the movie is entertaining, showing off some fun, mind-stretching action scenes that leave you wanting more. Unfortunately, more often than not, the incomplete plot, under developed characters, overly fast pace, and misleading feel for the movie prevents it from being something bigger and better. <br/><br/>6.5/10"
"kingmasada","7","2","2","11 December 2013"," Expected more from the concept, didn't like to know I was being misguided
","I've heard some good things about this movie, seeing my brother told me it was something quite different and I knew it had quite the star cast, so seeing I liked the combination of Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson in Zombieland, I was very interested in seeing this.<br/><br/>At first I didn't know where this movie wanted to go. There was a lot of misdirection and blank holes to be filled. Figuring that they would be filled in on the course of the movie, I continued watching. (I'm a curious guy.) Step by step, more and more of the objective of the 4 Horsemen was revealed, learning more and more why they were doing what they were doing. Now, I like a bit of misguiding, but I don't like to know that I'm being misguided. It makes the movie progress slow and the tid-bits of action and special effects feel like they were included to up the pace. It's like watching a mediocre magic show, knowing you'll be misguided in the usual kind of ways.<br/><br/>There is nothing wrong with the acting, you can't go wrong with this cast. I just feel that there was more in this concept than there was done with and you can't only rely on the actors to fill that in. All in all, it was an entertaining movie and I gave it a 7 because the twist on the end surprised me. I had a feeling it would go in that direction, but I couldn't put my finger on it. So +1 point for that."
"Glock_Boy","5","2","2","20 September 2013"," Nonsensical fun that just doesn't compute
","With such a cast of characters, once can't help by being pulled into the movie at the start. It had great promise, and provided a nice alternative to the usual dreck spilling out of Hollywood these days. But as time progressed, it was impossible to stay connected to the happenings on the screen. Nonsensical plot twists, irrational logic, silly background music all provided distractions that made connecting with the characters and plot impossible. Not even the kids will understand what is happening, so prepare yourself to pause the movie frequently as you stumble through explanation after explanation. The ending seemed completely contrived and self-serving. As the film concluded I sat back and wished I had chosen a better use for 2+ hours of my life. It wasn't horrible, but it was pointless and a waste of time."
"Mandais","6","2","2","5 September 2013"," Missing the Magic
","Now You See Me is the sort of movie that relies entirely on spectacle and style without much of anything underneath the surface. The plot centers around a band of Robin Hood-esque illusionists with an affinity for robbing banks and the team of FBI agents tasked with bringing them down.<br/><br/>We are first introduced to our protagonists, a group eventually called The Four Horsemen, through a look at each of their individual acts. The movie fails, however, to develop any of them beyond these lifeless, cardboard cut-outs. The same is true for the rest of the cast as well. There's a pair of bumbling FBI agents, a washed up magician aiding the feds, and the Horsemen's benefactor who are never given enough depth to make for really compelling characters.<br/><br/>This movie does contain some relatively cool tricks, but some are a bit too grand to be believable. One in particular involving Isla Fisher floating above a crowd in a giant bubble is a tad ridiculous. All that being said, it's entertaining enough to pull you along for the ride and it can be a pretty darn fun ride at times as long as you don't look too closely."

","Besides the explanation of the magic tricks nothing else is interesting in this movie. The story is lame with a very disappointing ending. Another excellent performance by Woody Harrelson and again Mark Ruffalo playing Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>For the first 30 minutes, I thought this movie would turn into an excellent script, like the ""The Usual Suspect"" but the intelligence fell short.<br/><br/>Not a predictable ending but once again the same old explanation that the character's trauma in past is behind for the whole plot. We have seen it in many, many movies.<br/><br/>For sure this movie won't be on my blu-ray collection."

And, unfortunately, that's probably enough to rope most viewers in to thinking it was a great film.<br/><br/>Now You See Me is really nothing more than the plot of a Scooby Doo episode, and I say that without much exaggeration; it's that bad and that unapologetic in how it half-ass sets it up and throws together a conclusion.<br/><br/>There are plot holes big enough to drive an armored car through just everywhere. Inexplicable and illogical doesn't even begin to scratch the surface. <br/><br/>I have to admit that I was pulled in for awhile. But around the midway point, I was beginning to wonder how they were going to tie everything together and make it work. The more I think about it now, it almost makes me angry I spend nearly 20 bucks for this tripe. I might have felt a little better if the arrogant Jesse Eisenberg character had received the punishment he deserved. <br/><br/>The ""twist"" ending should totally insult your intelligence (unless discovering Mr. Withers was the phantom of the haunted amusement park totally still blows your mind).<br/><br/>Unless you're 13, or have the the mentality of someone that age, do not waste your money at the theater."

The ending will make you mad that you refused to stop watching this ridiculous travesty of a movie 5 minutes into it. I kept hoping it'd get better but it only gets worse. There is even a brief hint at supernatural forces but that plot line is left hanging. <br/><br/>What I don't get is why Freeman and Caine agreed to work on this turkey.

","I was expecting so much more from this movie. Good actors aren't always a sign of quality. The beginning of the movie is okay, but we soon notice that it is total nonsense.<br/><br/>Magic usually doesn't work in movies, and this one takes it to a new level. When you do magic with cgi-bubbles, you are doing something wrong. The idea in a magic show is to wonder ""I know this isn't what it seems, but I wonder how they do it"". When you see crap like that in movies, you know it is just a guy holding his hands out and a geek on a computer has made the bubble. Ther is no magic in that, just stupidness.<br/><br/>I think the director tried to get an ""Ocean's 11"" feeling to the movie. He failed. The music is that generic casino/Las Vegas swagger crap that is supposed to be just right for this movie. It is not, it is annoying.<br/><br/>This movie offers a surprise plot-twist. It's not enough to tell (smart) viewers that the most unlikely character is behind all this. They should explain even a little how that person made all that possible.<br/><br/>At one point in the movie we get the ""One year later"" routine. I wish this movie would have been about that year."

(where as the plot twist in the prestige was brilliant). <br/><br/>Don't let the ""high rating"" fool you. This movie is not worth your time.

","For all those insulting the movie saying it is impossible to re-watch obviously have not tried it, perhaps you'll catch more plot points that you thought weren't there or perhaps you'll listen to the characters when they say the closer you look, the less you actually see. So many details criticized over and over because people couldn't figure it out, but take a step back because I have all the answers to all the questions because if you watch it, if you listen, you can see all what is going on with no plot holes, no confusion. I watched it 8 times in 3 days because I loved it so much and the thrill is still not gone. Some may have seen the ending coming, some may call it an impossible, dumb twist and not know what's happening, but watch it twice and you will see you are both wrong. Spoiler: Dylan Rhodes was behind it all because his father was Lionel Shrike who died because he was debunked by Thaddeus Bradley and Dylan wanted to avenge him. The 4 Horsemen's motivation was becoming a part of the eye which requires you to blindly follow a chain of commands, and the carousel, it was all because Lionel Shrike performed his first great trick there which gave the first glimpse of what they mean by the closer you look, the less you see and all those lines.

","My son and I watched this movie and loved it! Some really funny lines and a good plot that does not truly unfold until the end.

After a bank robbery for which they have an air-tight alibi, they were performing in front of hundreds of fans at the time, they are brought in by the police to be investigated. Well, of course the magicians make a mockery of the police officers which only makes the police more determined to prove the magicians' guilt. There are several really good and well-known actors in this movie which only make it that much more enjoyable to watch. I don't know if the writers and producers are thinking of making a sequel but I sure hope they do. Loved all the actors/actresses and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

","We've come a long way from the unbelievable, magician-insulting crap that was the Prestige.<br/><br/>Where the Prestige got just about everything about magic and magicians wrong, this gets it right., There are one or two minor flights of fancy (I don't think the bubble levitation is workable, but I could be wrong.) but by and large it is very true to both the art and the ethic of the magician, <br/><br/>Magicians since the time of Houdini at least have been very aware that our dark cousin is the con man, and we hate them and seek to expose them wherever we can. In this day and age, the con men wear suits and run corporations and banks, and in spirit there is no netter group of people to challenge them then magicians.<br/><br/>In addition to getting the small stuff right, this movie gets it right in the large. Just when I was shaking my head and saying ""this can't be done, the safeties aren't there and it depends too much on people doing the right things at the right time"", the movie pulls out the ONLY solution that solves all those problems.<br/><br/>Like all great magic tricks, there is only one good solution, but the magician distracts from it to the point that we don't even realize its there.<br/><br/>Sadly, I think this movie suffered from the problem many really good movies about magic do... they are so faithful to the hidden art that no one but practitioners believe its real. Ironically, the more absurd a movie about magicians is, generally the easier it is for the audience to swallow. The more accurate, the less the common man believes it.<br/><br/>Which is probably why The Prestige did so well and this so poorly."

Even Morgan Freeman finds real trouble playing his part, which is very badly written.<br/><br/>There's no real plot by the way, it's just a succession of tricks and flashbacks and action scenes with no real connection. There's no drama, no intensity, and no point. This is a ""story"" that would require elegant and skillful writing : since it's clearly not there, the film fails completely. Oh and the music is horrid.<br/><br/>If you want a good magic movie, just watch The Prestige.

He relies on unnecessarily elaborate explanations for events in the story that depend on complex plots, mannequins, and unrealistic escape plans. <br/><br/>SPOILER: There is one scene, the car chase, that had me shaking my head at the sheer lack of imagination. Let me explain: Bad guy escapes in a car. Bad guy is pursued by good guys. Bad guy crashes on a bridge, bursts into flames and dies. BUT as it turns out, the OTHER bad guys had an identical car on the bridge that was ACTUALLY the car that crashed with a cadaver from the morgue inside, leaving the bad guy unscathed.

There is no real explanation given for the motives of the villain. Basically he says ""It was me"", and there is no discussion as to his motivation whatsoever. It was frustrating to watch it unfold. It was almost like the writer had painted himself into a corner and desperately tried to weave in the true villain at the last moment. <br/><br/>That being said, watching the mystery thicken is entertaining and will keep you glued to the screen, even if you are cheated of your time at the end it is a worthwhile hour and a half, much better spent than other offerings of 2013.

","In a rare lucky event, I won tickets to an advanced Screening of this movie yesterday. I was intrigued by the preview during another movie, but I certainly wasn't expecting such an awesome display.<br/><br/>The Plot of the movie is this: 4 street artists (Dave Franco as Jack, Jesse Eisenberg as Michael, Isla Fisher as Henley and Woody Harrelson as Merritt) with individual talents receive an invitation from a source with out much explanation, just a time and address. A year later, they are a successful group called The Four Horsemen, working together putting on the best magic shows on stage. Their biggest illusion is to rob a bank while never once leaving the stage and live audience. You can guess what happens next, as without being successful, there would be no movie to watch. Enter the FBI and a round of interrogations that have never been funnier. And, before you know it, you're on a wild chase and loving it.<br/><br/>The visuals and magic 'tricks' in this film were beautifully crafted without being over the top. The plot was fun and wild taking the audience on a crazy chase where it was hard to predict what was going to happen next. Just when you think you've got it figured out, they twist it.<br/><br/>The performances by the stellar cast were amazing. Even though the audience doesn't really get to know the characters well, the pace of the game moved so quickly it really doesn't matter. I was only mildly disappointed that we didn't get to see more of the characters in their starting points - how did they get to where they were before their source? There was some obvious history between Michael and Henley which was never explored. And, where did Merritt learn his techniques? Lots of questions which were left open - hopefully with a sequel or prequel in mind. It sure felt like there was more story to tell but as Micheal Atlas says in the beginning of the movie ' You're looking too close'. The bigger picture of the movie is what makes it so spectacular. I'll be back in line to see it again when it is officially released on May 31st. I don't think you'll be disappointed either."

","Now You See Me Now You See Me is an action and suspense movie. Is a movie about four magicians that came together to do magic tricks and be famous. The stars of the movie are Jessie Einsenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman and Melanie Laurent. The movie take place in 3 principal places that are Las Vegas, San Francisco and New York.<br/><br/>Now You See Me is a mysterious movie that starts with four street magician's name, Daniel Atlas, Merritt McKinney, Henley Reeves and Jack Wilder. A mysterious stranger slips to them a card with an address and that's when they met. A year later after they receive the card, the magicians did one of the biggest magic shows in Las Vegas and became known as ""The Four Horseman."" The magic show they did brought them to serious problems that made the FBI, and an Interpol from France to look after them. Not only the FBI was after them but a former magician named Thaddeus Bradey who makes money by reveling the secrets of magician's tricks. The Four Horseman did another trick and didn't care who were trying to put them on jail and who they will betrayed. This next trick included stealing, escaping, revenge, hypnotizing and lies. After that The Horseman made their final trick, the biggest trick. <br/><br/>As I wrote before Now You See Me is a movie that take place in different places for example Las Vegas. Their first show was in Las Vegas. In their first show they made it seem so really when they travel to the bank of France. They manage to disappear all the money from the bank of France and appear in France. Later on, when the police were chasing them because they stole bank,they travel to San Francisco for their second show. For their second show the illusionist give away all the money from their producer to the audience that have been victims from their producers company. After giving away all the money, again the police, their producer and Thaddeus Bradey were after them. <br/><br/>Now You See Me had an amazing cast. One of the stars of the movie Jessie Eisenberg known from his roles in Zombieland and Social Network now plays an action role as an illusionist. Also the actor Woody Harrelson known from his role as Haymitch in The Hunger Games made a great job playing a hypnotist and a mentalist. Woody is the one who gives a comedy touch to the movie. Dave Franco actuation was really good, he can really play a kick ass character and an illusionist. Isla Fisher, the only girl in The Four Horseman, did a great job giving life to the sexy magician Henley. I think the first trick Isla performed to the audience was really awesome and we can see how perfect she was for this role. In The Movie Now You See Me I would have like to know with more details about who The Four Horseman were before becoming famous magicians. Also I would have like to see the evolution of two of the actors love story. Also what I really missed about almost the end of the movie was the participation of the character Jack Wilder in their last big magic show. He would have be amazing performing one last time with the other magicians.<br/><br/>Now You See Me was the best second selling movie in the time it was released. Meaning many people liked the movie. In the movie all of the actors made an amazing job. Something that I really liked about the movie that every time they played incredible tricks, they used distraction. Distraction was the main element of the movie. The Four Horseman always did something to distract the audience while the real magic was happening in other place. One of the lines that I really like about the movie and that was basically what the movie was about, was the line said by Daniel Atlas at the beginning of the movie. The line says: Daniel Atlas: ""Come in close. Closer. Because the more you think you see the easier it'll be to fool you."" In my opinion I rate this movie with 10/10. I really recommend this movie not only to the action audience but to everyone because it is full of suspense and excitement. I know you will enjoy it."

","I've just read a review on this film that says they wished they'd turned off after 15 minutes and gave it 1 out of 10 because they couldn't give it 0. Obviously they were looking out of their window when the film was on and maybe watching a pigeon fight or something. This film is a good bit of fun with a good bit of action in it. The movie is about illusion, and of course the whole premise of illusion is, 'You can do anything'. It's actually very cleverly woven together with enough twists and turns to highlight the distractive techniques used in 'Magic'. There is a great twist at the end, which some people may have got, but not many. So, yeah, I'd say to the reviewer who says 1 out of 10, stop reviewing films because you're not good at it."
"this_is_really","3","7","12","11 September 2013"," So disappointing, such a pity!!!!
","I was quite excited about this movie after seeing the trailers and to be frank, it started rather well but that's it! I'll admit, the film is quite entertaining till the abominable twist (which isn't even one) and a totally cliché ending. Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent's romance is totally unbelievable. But if only that was the only problem: the writers cheated all the way, I mean, the culprit cannot be the culprit, it's just not believable. And the fact that the culprit, imagines such an elaborate plan to frame the man that he hates and who could have been framed simply by planting some drug in the trunk of his car seems so far-fetched. After watching it, I was upset because I felt like I had been cheated. Come the end of this disastrous movie, the whole story seems totally stupid and unbelievable. A lot of reviewers compare this film to The Prestige (which was great by the way) but if you look closely, you'll see that it's just a bad copycat of Usual Suspects (which was over excellent IMHO): 4 crooks/magicians recruited by a mysterious person who wishes to exact revenge on someone and who is all along under the nose of the very people he is manipulating. Except that in the Usual Suspect, the twist was amazing, the quality of the overall film excellent, the exact opposite of this poor production. Well, at least the producers made big money. There was therefore a point to this whole mess. Good for them.<br/><br/>Finally, Mélanie Laurent's part is totally pointless, she's just there to help the writers to cheat us the best they can and again, the fact that she falls for a guy who played her and treated her like rubbish during the whole time they spent together just baffles me. But again, this is due to poor directing and a weak script."
"Remy_Azhary","Null","7","12","6 June 2013"," A complex brain twister that is fun, brilliant and stylish
","WOW!!!<br/><br/>That's exactly how I feel about NOW YOU SEE ME. Frankly, I don't see why many dissed the film. Perhaps, because this one constantly urged them to actually use almost 90% percent of your brain to decode the tricks in the entire movie from start to end.<br/><br/>No doubt the movie is a mixture of numerous tricks ranging from optics to numbers to common logic. And there were also some that still remained to be explained; supernatural maybe. Nevertheless, the movie was both totally mind-blowing and mind-boggling.<br/><br/>To be honest, I'm not all too crazy with Louis Leterrier as the director. I mean his take on the 2010 remake of CLASH OF THE TITANS was quite a disappointment.<br/><br/>However, the ensemble cast was amazing, cool and slick; just as I had expected them to be. But the intricacies of panning out the plot was a complex one. So much so that there was an essence of solving a mystery a la the Nicholas Cage's film, NATIONAL TREASURE. There was also that essence of Dan Brown's ""Robert Langdon"" style which we saw in THE DA VINCI CODE and ANGELS & DEMONS.<br/><br/>However, the more intriguing charm about NOW YOU SEE ME is that it actually compels the audience to think as to how the ""magicians"" were able to literally trick the audience. In other words, it's like watching that TV show, ""Secrets of Magicians Revealed"" with Morgan Freeman played its TV-equivalent of Mitch Pileggi who revealed how each of the tricks were pulled off.<br/><br/>No doubt there is a twist to this one and you would constantly try to figure out who was behind the whole grand plan. At times, I was convinced that it was Freeman himself but he was none other than a red herring.<br/><br/>I mean the plot got so twisted that I simply gave up and chose to sit through the movie as the end revealed the real mastermind. In actual fact, this person was right under our very nose that we didn't see it coming.<br/><br/>I'd see it again."
"manuscriptna","Null","25","57","20 May 2013"," Magic and Character development were lacking, but surprises entertained
","It is very important to realize that this movie must not be spoiled. I will not be discussing anything not shown in the trailers, and I ask you not to go looking for such secrets online, but only by watching it yourself. This movie is designed to entertain, and to a degree it does just that.<br/><br/>I haven't seen many of Leterrier's films, but I enjoyed this about as much as The Incredible Hulk, but more than Clash of the Titans. There were still disappointments. Magic movies have been a great interest of mine, and from the trailer I had to wonder, does Michael Caine + woman in a tank = The Prestige? Truthfully, the similarities stopped there, including magic's screen time.<br/><br/>Despite magic taking up most of the trailers, it was too scarce in the film itself. I wanted more magic. I know that doing so would take screen time from Ruffalo, but he wasn't the best of the bunch. In fact, they were Freeman, Caine, and Laurent, respectively.<br/><br/>The screen writing didn't allow for many to develop character well. The Four Horsemen were usually smooth-talking brick walls. And was that Dave Franco I saw? He had no screen time! (except for brief fancy dodging falling fighting)<br/><br/>These character holes would be acceptable if the movie were a large show. But as mentioned before, magic only came in smaller pieces, when at all. Some were amazing, some were old already, and some were hilarious.<br/><br/>It seems like I didn't appreciate the movie much, but I could only talk about what I didn't like. The rest, the secrets, I loved but can't talk about. Suffice it to say that many surprises are in store, and they're worth watching the movie for. That said, it's best to go in without guessing and predicting, because seeing the many reveals is where most of the entertainment lies. Don't spoil it for yourself.<br/><br/>This is a film some would be happier seeing in theatres, but if you don't think you'd spend ticket money for this, you'd probably regret it, so wait for DVD.<br/><br/>As a warning, there is a suggestive/inappropriate scene near the beginning that ends up going nowhere, but children's eyes should be turned aside. Also, there's a moment in a Mardi Gras parade that needs to be avoided, and minor language throughout. I'd recommend this movie for 17+, not only for these, but for the understanding of the secret material I can't bring up."
"Lesego-Madisa","10","6","10","10 December 2014"," It will go down in history as the best movie of 2013.
","A lot of people also think there is no real magic in this movie. Since the condescending black guy, Thaddeus, debunks just about every magic trick in the movie. <br/><br/>Well, there is a lot of magic in this movie. One of them is the building leap where the 3 Horsemen turn into money. How does one explain that?<br/><br/>How did the 30-year-old New York Post paper featuring a two page article on Lionel Shrike get inside Alma Dray's Liberation newspaper in Paris? How did Dylan Rhodes escape the locked prison cell when he visited Thaddeus from behind him and then appear in front of him where the door is at? <br/><br/>In the interrogation room Merritt informs Alma about Dylan having daddy issues and that it's her first time off the desk. So he is a real mentalist. He can also feel energy through closed doors and glass when he acknowledges Fuller and Dylan looking at him in the room. Jack disappears from inside the curtain when Dylan grabs him at the joint. And appears on the other side. It's unexplainable, so it's magic.<br/><br/>And also, how did Atlas get the SUCK IT card inside Thaddeus' velveteen pocket before their second show?<br/><br/>We may never know whether the story of the cheating husband at the beginning is true or not. But we do know about Dylan having daddy issues and Alma being her first time off the desk. No one told Merritt. Well, least not about Alma. This is magic.<br/><br/>Thaddeus knew an unusual amount of information about the Horsemen plans and The Eye. So The Eye is real, or was real. He knew about the book Alma was reading called The Guardians of Horus. He even tells Arthur that whatever the grand trick is was designed long ago. How does he know this?<br/><br/>Another clue is the first meeting with Thaddeus when he tells them that they are being played because it's a game. Only Dylan can understand him.<br/><br/>Some people claim that there is no growth in the characters and that they are shallow. Again, not true. They had a start as individual acts, Merritt was successful at one stage, even had a TV show. He was trying to do a comeback with a book he wrote about hypnosis. <br/><br/>Before they leave the joint, Henley wonders who they are working for and Jack doesn't want to go to jail. Or get killed. Merritt is expecting a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Henley reminds them that they must stick to the plan and Merritt will get to do whatever he wants after.<br/><br/>Jack, since he is the youngest, is often treated unfairly. Even in the engineered Jet scene when he wants to speak about his part on the show. He is dismissed. Atlas and Henley used to work together back in the day and went their separate ways as Atlas was a control freak. <br/><br/>When they post a video on Youtube about Jack's death, Merritt also says they have started something bigger than all of them. And they have to finish it. In the lift at 5 Points Henley comments that she had a year of fun even if she goes to jail. This is character development.<br/><br/>At Central Park Merritt celebrates Jack for being 'a big boy now'.<br/><br/>The story is NOT about the Horsemen. It is about Dylan Rhodes. He is the one that grows throughout the movie. He is the one who is satisfied at the end. He is the one who had a goal. He is the one who knows what was happening and what to do. <br/><br/>After the inciting incident, Dylan gets a call from Fuller. He accepts the opportunity and goes to his office to start with the case. When he gets there, to cover his tracks, he acts like he doesn't want anything to do with the case. His plan did not or would not involve anyone outside the bureau, much less an agent from Interpol. He didn't see this one coming.<br/><br/>He later changes his mind when they let them go, confusing the agents. Again, to cover his tracks. When Fuller tells him about Thaddeus being in the show filming the Horsemen, he, to us, did a terrible job when he denies ever having any knowledge about the magic debunker. And only we can see this. Even when they meet Thaddeus at his offices, he had to convince everyone that he doesn't know anything about magic or his own father, Lionel Shrike. He acts like a dummy. We are the only ones who can see this.<br/><br/>At the empty Las Vegas theater, he did an excellent job when he 'pretended' that he didn't know how they stole the money from Paris. For Alma. He had to keep up with her for most of the movie because she was onto something. She's a researcher. A desk agent like Merritt said.<br/><br/>Of course Thaddeus won't last in jail. And yes Arthur's money is gone. Merritt can hypnotize people over the phone to get them to do whatever he wants. Even if Credit Republican of Paris gets its money back since the bank money is probably insured and the Elkhorn money inside the safe at the warehouse, the whole point was for Dylan was to humiliate his victims. Arthur Tressler's insurance career is over. After they exposed his company it will be done away with.<br/><br/>Thaddeus Bradley's ego is busted. He'll find it very difficult to return into the business after what Dylan did to him."

"secondtake","6","6","10","25 November 2013"," Wow, such pizazz and showy stuff, and such a thin veneer of a plot
","Now You See Me (2013)<br/><br/>The entire movie is about pulling wool over your eyes—as clever as you might be, you'll never figure out what's happening. So you just have to rush along for the ride. And quite a ride it is, filled with legerdemain and fireworks, sleights of hand and feats of prowess. People disappear and people get out of and into handcuffs with one frame of the movie camera. You want to look one way but the camera looks the other and wham, another surprise.<br/><br/>Yes, it's the movie the wins, without quite succeeding as a movie. It's like someone winning at a game by cheating. Impressive—not! And yet it seemed like fun for awhile.<br/><br/>There is quite the starry cast here, though two of the biggest stars have only a few minutes (literally) of screen time, sprinkled throughout the film. Michael Caine is shown as the money man behind the hiring of the four magicians in their sudden rise to the top. And Morgan Freeman is shown as the hunter of magic charlatans. (And no, there is no connection to Batman here.)<br/><br/>The four magicians are kind of a Dream Team pulled together in the first twenty minutes of the movie, and at first you think you'll see more of their individual acts, which are kind of fun. And different. One is a shyster on the streets, another a kind of trickster mind-reader hypnotist (played beautifully by Woody Harrelson), another a showy big production woman, and the fourth a wizard with cards. After they get together, however, it becomes a version of ""Oceans Eleven"" with magic thrown in. The big sham even starts in Las Vegas.<br/><br/>If all you want is pizazz, this movie is for you. It's nothing but! And it's quite well made technically and very fast paced. But if you want to get in on the tricks and be not only surprised but also held in suspense, there are too many easy twists and tricks of cinema illusionism at work. In fact, a key problem with magic in the movies is that you can't quite believe it because you can't trust the camera-work and editing. And there are certainly many tricks here that are only possible by splicing one piece of film to another—you know that seeing it on screen, and just have to say, ""It's a movie, it's okay.""<br/><br/>One final element is the convincing, hard-boiled detective, played by Mark Ruffalo. He seems to be the dependable thread a viewer can cling do amidst all the swirling and disarray. A necessary element. Never mind his Interpol sidekick from France, which is meant to add a love story to the whole brew. This movie isn't a mess. It's just a shame because it is so close to having the stuff of a great (entertaining) movie. Even so, though, it's quite entertaining. Quite."

Here I must also tut in dis contempt to the London Philharmonic for contributing to this insult to film and magic. <br/><br/>If you want a magician film, go see, ""The Prestige"" Much better, and a great watch. this however is not.

"Bruce722","4","6","10","8 September 2013"," Very disappointing thanks to a sloppy script and misleading previews.
","Now You See Me might have the most misleading trailers of all-time. The previews make you think that story follow the four magicians, played by Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco. However, the characters with the most screen time are actually an FBI agent played by Mark Ruffalo, an interpol agent played by Melanie Laurent, and a washed up magician played by Morgan Freeman. Guess what? I didn't know any of those actors were even in the movie. The movie also didn't seem to have an identity. It constantly jumped back and forth between magic not being real and then certain things not being possible without magic. This constant uncertainty from the film's perspective created a lazy feeling in the script. As for the individual characters, Woody was hilarious, Isla was absolutely gorgeous, and Eisenberg was, well, the same character he always is. Which reminds me, can we stop calling Jesse Eisenberg a great actor? The kid plays the exact same role every single time and that's who he is in real life. He isn't ""acting"", he's just playing himself in different situations. Back to the movie, it had decent plot development but with so many characters involved, none of them were really fleshed out properly. Lastly, it had the typical twist in the end that's become almost clichéd where it wasn't written into the story well but just forced on the viewer. All-in-all, if you want to be mildly entertained with over-the-top magic tricks and a chaotic story and then toss in a romance for no reason, this is the movie for you."

","You just saw me but thankful next time you won't<br/><br/>Before I die, I know I will look back at the various times that I wasted. This will be a low light. <br/><br/>*CONTAINS SPOILERS*<br/><br/>I understand the concept of ""suspension of disbelief"", but this movie has abused any semblance of that concept.<br/><br/>The direction, production, and acting short comings are too numerous to address, but let me highlight a few.<br/><br/>Not since The Blues Brothers (1980) has a director asked the viewers to believe in the incompetence of the Federal Police to such a point. They were constantly misdirected (the old ""capture one of their walkie-talkies and imitate their boss to give them misleading instructions"" bit... I was waiting for them to cue the Benny Hill theme).<br/><br/>Casting Mark Raffulo as an FBI agent is preposterous. In the history of the agency I don't believe there has ever been a FBI agent allowed to come to work with such disregard for a barber's work. Let's be honest, they mostly resemble Ty Burrell at best. I think they were confused, and understood James Garner was an FBI agent in The Rockford Files. <br/><br/>Mélanie Laurent (also known as France's answer to a modern day version of Michelle Pfeiffer; a cutesy, short blonde actress with a flat line acting ability) again provides a forgettable performance.<br/><br/>The movie score lead me to believe I was watching a Starsky and Hutch episode at times. <br/><br/>Sadly I understand that a sequel is already being planned. This is a clear indication of the sad state of modern cinema. <br/><br/>As former NFL coach Dennis Green once said, ""The great thing about America is that everybody has a right to an opinion. The other great thing is you don't have to listen to it."" I wish I would have taken that advice. Unfortunately I didn't, I listened to others' opinions, namely others' here at IMDb. How this movie received a rating so high I can only assume, but in future should know better. <br/><br/>At the final scene, Laurent and Raffulo are at the infamous Pont De Arts where people lock locks to the bridge and throw the key in the Seine River as symbol of keeping an eternal secret. <br/><br/>I wish they, along with the makers of this movie would have been so kind to us, and kept this a secret from us all."

"rparham","6","13","27","31 May 2013"," Caper film that is a little too dependent on surprises
","Now You See Me is a film that is all about obfuscation. Focusing on four magicians that perform feats of wonder first separately and later together, from the first frame on, the film engages in cinematic sleight of hand. However, that formula backfires on the film: by constantly trying to engage in trickery, the audience finds itself always on the lookout for it, and by the time it starts winding down, most of the potential surprises are rendered moot by the fact that we were looking for and expecting said surprises. Thus, while Now You See Me is fun and engaging at times, as a twist-filled surprise machine, it falls flat on it's face.<br/><br/>As the film opens, we are introduced to four illusionists: fast talking street-level card sharp Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), ""mentalist"" and small-time con man Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), spoon-bending junior magician Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and show-stopping high-thrills Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). All of them are given a special card with an address and time on it, and when they all show up at the prescribed time and place, a small apartment in New York, they discover what appears to be a quite elaborate set of plans. Flash forward one year later, and the four magicians are performing as a single act under the moniker The Four Horsemen and are being bankrolled by millionaire Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) During their debut performance in Las Vegas, they close their act with a rather spectacular accomplishment: they transport a French audience member to his bank in France and proceed to steal several billion dollars from it and magically transport it back to the Las Vegas auditorium where they pour it onto the audience.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, this gets the attention of the FBI, and agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is assigned to the case. He teams up with Interpol agent Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent) and interrogates the Four Horsemen, but with nothing to pin on them, is forced to let them walk. Rhodes seeks the counsel of former magician Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who now spends his time debunking magicians, revealing what is ""behind the curtain"". With Bradley's help, Rhodes is able to unravel what happened at the first performance, but the Four Horsemen are already moving on to New Orleans for their next show and Rhodes and Dray are trying to stay one step ahead of them.<br/><br/>Now You See Me is a film that is intended to keep us on our toes, to leave the audience guessing and wondering what the next revelation is going to be. Sometimes these kind of films can work well, engaging in misdirection and providing red herrings and dead ends for us to believe in before showing us what is really going on. Where Now You See Me missteps is that, from very early in the proceedings, the film telegraphs its intentions so loudly that most of the enjoyment of being caught up in twists is lost. That the twists are such a central part of the film is obvious from the start and makes them less engaging than if they evolved more naturally out of the narrative. Now You See Me is designed and built almost exclusively to keep us guessing but by focusing almost exclusively on that, it overreaches.<br/><br/>Now You See Me isn't helped by the fact that the main characters are, save for some quickly introduced character moments and a few exchanges of witty dialogue, almost completely ciphers. Atlas, McKinnney, Wilder and Reeves are barely developed at all, and frankly, excepting for the moments they are performing their stage acts, are not even afforded that much screen time. The screenplay does play a bit with the intentions of the characters, but it is obvious that we are supposed to be rooting for them at times, and it makes it difficult to work up much enthusiasm for them when we barely know them. More screen time is afforded to Rhodes and Dray, and the two develop a romantic chemistry that is palpable at times, but, much like the other characters, they are largely pawns of the screenplay, but they are at least given more to work with than the magicians.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier films Now You See Me in Michael Bay mode: the camera rarely stops moving for more than a few seconds. During the magic acts, especially the first one in Vegas, this does bring a degree of style to the proceedings but at times the over reliance on an endlessly moving camera can prove distracting. However, Leterrier does keep the pace brisk and the energy level high. Now You See Me certainly can't be called boring.<br/><br/>If Now You See Me succeeds anywhere, it is in the casting. Leterrier has pulled together a strong set of performers and, especially regarding the Four Horsemen, what is sometimes lacking in the screenplay is made up for by likable actors. Eisenberg makes Atlas a fast talking smart alec with a nice streak of charisma, Harrelson gives some fun wisecracks and Fisher is, once again, a strong sensual presence with a degree of toughness. Morgan Freeman can't help but class up anything he appears in and his turn here is no different, his Bradley is nice mix of arrogance and charm. Ruffalo is also at his dependable best, a man fighting to stay with his fugitives while barely managing to stay on top of their capers. <br/><br/>It may sound like I am down on Now You See Me, but that isn't completely true. By the time the film was over, I found myself pleasantly engaged and entertained at times, but so much is wrapped up in the film's obvious Rube Goldberg plotting that you can't but help feel disappointed when the film doesn't really deviate from where you expect. Now You See Me is like sneaking a peek at your Christmas gifts: knowing what is coming isn't as much fun as not knowing."

I gave it a 6/10 for some entertaining bits, and because I did like the characters, but the overall storyline was very annoying and *tedious*. A movie should be enjoyed, not tedious. And I think the reason it was hard to figure out what was really going on was because the explanations for so many things were just not plausible or believable. Also, I would have liked for the story to give more time to the skeptical side of magic and skepticism in general. The story alludes to the reality that magic is just distraction and illusion, but it doesn't tie that deception into life in general—that we should be more skeptical in all areas of life, for example."

","While I have marked this commentary as may having spoilers I will assure you that it does have spoilers, and quite a lot of them at that. Unfortunately my analysis of this film makes it necessary to do so, so if you do want to see this film, and it is an enjoyable two hours out of the house (not counting the time to get to and from the cinema), then please don't read any further.<br/><br/>This movie seems to have brought out some conflicting views, suggesting that the major twist that occurs at the end is either to do with the major theme of not looking too close, or simply really bad. I am tempted to fall into the really bad category, except that if the idea of looking too close ends up throwing you, then watching the movie again is not going to do any good because one usually watches a movie again so as to look closer to try and see why something turned out the way it did.<br/><br/>Basically the movie is about how four street musicians are brought together by a mysterious stranger (who they never meet) and go on to perform three sell out shows. However it is indicated (at least in the first show) that the huge audience is merely illusionary and part of the overall plot (which, as it turns out is a revenge plot). While at first it seems as if this magic show is simply that, a magic show using mostly sleight of hand, they end up robbing a bank, once again using sleight of hand. In fact, sleight of hand is used throughout the film to make what appears nonsensical, or impossible, to actually seem possible (though some commentators seem to think that they have gone a little overboard).<br/><br/>However, the problem comes out with the mole working within the FBI to throw the FBI off of the trail. To me that does not make sense at all. In fact, for most of the movie, until he is revealed to be the mole, it seems as if he is working with the FBI, and that he is being used and tricked as is the rest of the FBI. For instance, he had a bug in his phone, and he seemed to be surprised that there was a bug in his phone. Secondly, he gives chase to the magicians, and does little to actually lose them. However, that could be suggested that he was going this because he had an interpol agent tagging along with him, and he had to show himself as being a loyal agent not to tip any of them off. Still, the fact that they (1) chained him to the desk and (2) switched his mobile phone (which we see happen in a video) suggests otherwise (though we should remember that none of the magicians actually knew who he was until the end of the film).<br/><br/>As I said before, this film ends up being what one would call a revenge film. Basically the child of a father whom he believed was unfairly killed, and then jilted of any money he might have inherited, decides to go after all of the people who were involved in that scam. I can understand the safe making company, the insurance boss, and the guy that likes exposing magicians, but I am still unsure as to why he went after the bank. However, the whole Eye of Horus thing and the fact that he was simply a vengeful kid, didn't quite work for me either."

","What You Should Know – Look closely because the closer you look the more you'll ignore this film's foolishness. Like most summer blockbusters it doesn't make perfect sense, but that doesn't stop it from being a fun film to watch especially with that incredible, though unbelievable, ending.<br/><br/>What Works – The misdirection is impressive. The story isn't about the four magicians or the heists they ""magically"" perform. While that would have made more sense this movie moves in cheap tricks and clever nonsense.<br/><br/>What Doesn't Work – All the unanswered questions. There is a scene where a romance is sparked, but it never ignites and another scene where they argue about where they will go once they perform their final trick, but they don't actually go anywhere. There are a lot of missing parts that leave this puzzle filled with too many holes to see the big picture.<br/><br/>What I Thought – Wait for DVD Now You See Me is what any magic act should be – fascinating to figure out and tricky when revealed. Mark Rafflo stomps around most of the movie so upset at any moment you'd expect him to turn into The Hulk and Jesse Eisenberg plays the same smart and smug ""genius"" he did in The Social Network. That's not a great mash-up – at least not great enough to see in theaters. Instead of having audiences leave in awe and applause, there is a residue of deceit and dissatisfaction."

","Most people love illusionists and magicians, arguably making something of a comeback in the entertainment mainstream thanks in part to people like UK based Dynamo.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier has crafted a thriller come caper movie that wants to be the ""The Prestige"" but set in modern times.<br/><br/>We meet the four performers, street card sharp J Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harelson), not adverse to uncovering secrets and erasing them for a suitable fee. Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) robbing people blind whilst performing his magic tricks and finally Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), an escapologist with a penchant for the macabre.<br/><br/>This eclectic band are pulled together as a group following the receipt of the mysterious Taro card requesting them to meet at a certain time and place. Unbeknown to this merry band, they are being played but by whom and why? We then jump forward in time and the group are performing sell out shows on a huge stage at Las Vegas as the ""Four Horseman"". The act is all about illusion and after showing their appreciation to their benefactor Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the grand finale showcases a multi million dollar fake bank heist. The group then distribute the ""proceeds"" to a highly receptive and appreciative audience.<br/><br/>Following the realisation this may not be an illusion but a bank robbery hiding in plain sight, the FBI are called in. Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo), who looks like he slept in his clothes, gets to meet his classic mismatch partner in the form of Interpol agent Alma Vargas (Melanie Laurent).<br/><br/>The couple then attempt to track and unscramble what is real and what is not. They are aided and not so much abetted, by another shadowy character Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). An ex-magician for hire who now earns a crust unmasking magicians tricks by explaining how they are performed, which seems a real killjoy way of earning a living.<br/><br/>The set up is good and the cast list has great depth of experience to call upon. However, despite this fertile ground many opportunities are wasted. Freeman and Caine get very little to do, Ruffalo and Laurent have zero screen chemistry with the former giving every appearance of needing to phone his agent to ask why he is involved at all The four horseman actors acquit themselves well enough but the whole enterprise is let down by a very weak and implausible story which does not hang together or stand up to scrutiny. A bit like the art of illusion itself, distract the audience with lots of shiny glitter and movie stars and maybe they will not notice the plot makes no sense.<br/><br/>I suspect when all the reveals are complete many will ask, really was that it? The film did well at the box office so we may see another go round, lets hope the next time they pull the rabbit from the hat, it's clutching a better script.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Fun on a very superficial level but overall with so much talent available and an exciting premise, this is disappointing and could have been so much more.<br/><br/>As the tag-line says ""The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see"", which is very apt for the film."
"jimbo-53-186511","5","3","4","12 November 2013"," Great cast, interesting premise; but there's not much else good about it
","When I first saw the trailer for Now You See Me it got my interest straight away. I thought to myself it's got a great cast and an interesting premise that made it look to be a cross between the Prestige & Ocean's 11. Whilst this film has elements of these 2 films, it completely fails to be anywhere near as good as either of these films.<br/><br/>NYSM starts off interestingly enough; we begin with 4 magicians; J Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) Merritt McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher)& Jack Wilder (Franco) who are all working as 'small time' magicians. They all find themselves drawn together when they each receive a card telling them to meet at a specific place at a specified time. At this stage, they are unaware of who has brought them together and why they have brought them together. We then jump forward 1 year and the 4 magicians are now working together and collectively they are known as 'the 4 horseman' (which is strange as one of them is female). They quickly find themselves being pursued by the FBI and Interpol when they discover that they are pulling off bank heists during their performances. FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) and Interpol Agent Alma Dray (Laurent) are sent into investigate the magicians and try to 'expose' their magic and ultimately bring them down. They also receive valuable assistance from Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman), a former magician who is paid substantial amounts of money to expose magician's tricks.<br/><br/>I think the main problem with NYSM is that there was a distinct lack of character development. We get next to no background information on any of the magicians (the only thing we learnt is that Reeves & Atlas used to work together). This meant that I was unable to connect with any of the characters and meant that there was no-one that you cared for or felt sympathy for. The story wasn't particularly engaging and at times I felt rather bored. The acting also wasn't great and I must admit I expected more from veterans like Caine & Freeman - they were both OK, but I've seen better from both of them. I found Eisenberg to be annoying more than anything else. Fisher was OK, but nothing more than that. I was however impressed with Harrelson & Ruffalo and felt that they gave the strongest performances.<br/><br/>There were a couple of twists in the film which at least kept this feature slightly interesting. Also some of the visuals were great and I even enjoyed some of the magic tricks. However, for me, I need a film to be a bit more engaging, I need characters that are properly developed and characters that I'll care for. Sadly, you don't get any of that with Now You See Me.<br/><br/>Overall, it's OK, but it pales in comparison to films such as The Prestige & Ocean's 11. My advice would be to watch either of those films and skip this one."
"bob the moo","Null","3","4","26 October 2013"," Slick all-star nonsense is still nonsense
","Now You See Me starts out really well. A group of illusionists are brought together and within a year they are playing Vegas together and appear to rob a bank in Paris remotely. This draws in the FBI and Interpol but how can they prove anything when it all seems so impossible and so hard to prove? This setup offers a twisty and engaging plot but sadly it is one that never gets delivered upon. Instead what we get is a constantly moving film that is loaded with stars, money and special effects but nothing of nay real substance.<br/><br/>This approach works really well when it comes to the slickness of delivery and how polished it all feels, but it is so very unsatisfying as a whole product. The twists and turns of the film are almost all nonsense – slickly elaborate and delivered with pace for sure, but with nothing behind of any substance. As a result I stopped caring about the plot or about working out what was going on behind the theatrics. Movement appeared to be the all and after a while I tired of it. The slick delivery is all well and good and it is added to by the cast – so many faces, so many quality actors all getting handsomely paid but doing very little. It felt like a waste.<br/><br/>It isn't a terrible film by any means; the pace and slickness makes it work on that level but it does very little else which is engaging or memorable. It is fluff that fills the time but leaves you with nothing after that."
"dashielle89-425-132181","6","3","4","22 July 2013"," I liked it, but still disappointing
","So the idea of this movie had a lot of potential, and in some ways it exceeded my expectations. There were a lot of things that could easily be done poorly with this idea, and they did a good job in those areas, and that was surprising. However the general story was not done very well, and I'm not sure why. I still give the film a pretty decent rating because it was entertaining and did well with the magic, atmosphere, and payoff, but focus and the characters were off.<br/><br/>Don't read if you don't want spoilers.<br/><br/>To sum it up- what was done well was really good. The magic shows were pretty awesome. They were suspenseful, they seemed almost believable, they left you thinking about their tricks, and when they were explained, it was well thought out and interesting. The general ideas of the characters were pretty good, it's hard to really dislike any of them. The side characters and antagonists are especially likable. And the end reveal was cool. It's unexpected, it makes sense when you think about it, and complicated plans are sometimes good just because you have to think a little more. And none of the motivations were too expected or cliché, which I like in a story.<br/><br/>But that said, it has too many flaws to be considered anything better than good. It is not a great movie, it is only slightly better than mediocre. Here's, in my opinion, why: First, the focus was not a great idea. The focus should have been on the horsemen (it wasn't at all)rather than the agents trying to catch them. They are following someone they don't know at all, they haven't even met him, for reasons they are not sure of. They do not even know if their end goal exists, and at any time they could ruin their whole lives because of the scheme. Yet they continue to follow the plan. This would be interesting to follow, what is going through their minds through everything, how much do they trust it, how are they setting everything up. But that is pretty much ignored, instead a stereotypical romance between the agents is the main subplot other than them trying to stop the horsemen. And it was okay, but it was nothing special. <br/><br/>The reveal, while I thought was a good surprise, the way it was executed wasn't great. The first half of the movie didn't really hint to it at all, you don't even know most of the story behind it. The whole thing (which was complicated) was explained in about 30 seconds. God forbid you had to go to the bathroom, you would be lost if you missed it. There was not enough set up for it. And the end was lame. We find out Rhodes is the leader and his motive, which was fine. But then his entire romance and relationship with the other agent was still pursued. Everything he said to her was a lie, as was his entire personality he made up, but in the end they're still in love without a second thought and he's going to make serious sacrifices for that? NO, just no. Which is also why the focus didn't hold up, because it was mostly pointless once you find this out. And plus, the ones who seemed like they should have been the main characters, the horsemen, are just dumped. Yeah, they get into the organization Rhodes leads, but then what? Nothing about what they do next is explained. Does this organization do anything or did they ruin their life for revenge that is irrelevant to them? Are there other members and if not will there be? This is all made unimportant, and the end just follows the shallow romance. Which is done in just about every movie, so not only is it dumb, but it's incredibly bland and typical. They didn't even try to set up for a sequel, they just ignored the magicians.<br/><br/>Oh, and this is probably just nitpicking, but there was a lot of unnecessary and distracting use of cgi. It just wasn't needed, and it didn't look very good. People could have easily done the majority of those effects for real rather than using computers.<br/><br/>I did like this movie. However it could have been so much better that in the end it feels hollow. The premise was good, the story throughout and plans were good, the characters were good, and they didn't use it to its potential at all. All movies have flaws, but these ones were too big to be able to love the film. It's fun to watch, I guess it's worth it, but I wish it had been better."

","I would love to know the production history of this one. It feels like it was conceived as a Jonathan-creek or The Prestige-like story where the plot is enriched by real behind-the-curtain knowledge of how magic works, then got handed around until someone with no knowledge of or interest in magic got a hold of it and let their right-brain go wild. Instead of a clever insight into how misdirection and trickery could be used for crime, we just get magic that can do anything and therefore is a very convenient and unsatisfying plot mechanic.<br/><br/>We step entirely outside of reality and rely on CGI to make props appear, even in a supposed stage show. Fortunately you only have to watch the first 20 minutes or so to know that this is not going to satify magic geeks or people who enjoy realistic characters or a coherent plot."

"MartinHafer","6","4","6","27 May 2014"," Turn your brain off and enjoy...
","At this time, there are already 530 reviews for ""Now You See It"", so I'll try to be brief. The film is about a group of four magicians and mentalists who have been given a brilliant plan by an unseen genius. Again and again, the quartet perform seemingly impossible stunts and always seem many steps ahead of the police. And, in the process, they do HUGE magic tricks that are pretty much impossible. The presentation is VERY smooth and very slick and the overall production looks great. It has great music and effects. But, on the negative side none of this really makes a lot of sense and there is no way you can enjoy it if you think. This is especially true at the end (where there is a profession of love that comes from absolutely no where!!)--which is a gigantic cliché and made no sense whatsoever. The bottom line is that if you turn off you brain and enjoy it on a very superficial level, you'll enjoy it. If you try to make sense of it all, your head will explode. 'Nuff said."
"jdesando","Null","4","6","31 May 2013"," A bit of summer magic
","""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room."" J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) <br/><br/>In the case of the magical little entertainment called Now You See Me, you don't have to be the smartest person in the audience to be charmed by the illogical ""magic"" of the tricks or the script. In a takeoff of traditional heist films and homage to recent films like The Incredible Burt Wonderstone and The Prestige, with a smattering of smart, sometimes humorous chatter, this film moves at rapid pace (French director Louis Leterrier knows how from his Transporter films) with a lack of seriousness about the tricks, which are mostly explained as the film moves on.<br/><br/>Those revelations will bother purists who don't want to know the secrets or critics who demand a reasonable arc for the story. Like the magic itself, the film eventually captures the imagination enough to suspend disbelief and just go with the fun.<br/><br/>The ""four horsemen"" (Atlas, played by Eisenberg; Merritt by Woody Harrelson; Henley by Isla Fisher; and Jack by Dave Franco) create three successive magic shows, one in Las Vegas, a second in New Orleans, and the third in New York. The stakes rise incrementally as they appear to be playing Robin Hood to their large, American-Idol type audiences by showering them with money from their magical heists. The FBI with Agent Dylan (Mark Ruffalo) is in hot but bungling pursuit.<br/><br/>As in most thrillers, there are minor twists, and the final one that stretches credulity, or that some will see coming, along with a hopper full of smaller ones even naïve I could see from far off. Besides, like the Oceans films' heists, it's not about the heist or the magic. It's about the slick magicians, their easy banter, and comeuppance for the real baddies.<br/><br/>Outrageous set pieces like the car race will disconcert those looking for a tightly-told narrative. The magic is as always questionable because film deals in magic with practically every frame. However, the cast is delightfully comic, the direction speedy and tricky, and the entire film wants you in on the magic. For a summer film, that's a magic formula."

","'NOW YOU SEE ME': Four Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Heist film about a team of four magicians who rob banks while performing shows and then disperse their loot to their audiences. The film reunites stars Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson (who also co-starred in the popular zombie comedy film 'ZOMBIELAND') as well as teams them with an all-star cast including Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Melanie Laurent, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine. It was directed by Louis Leterrier (who also helmed such action films as 'THE INCREDIBLE HULK', the first two 'TRANSPORTER' movies and the 'CLASH OF THE TIANS' remake) and written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt. The film is a very fun, fast-paced and clever caper film that I had a blast watching (for the most part).<br/><br/>The film centers around four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Franco). As the film opens they're all called to the same location by mysterious cards left for them. The film then fast forwards to a year later when the four are working together as a team putting on an elaborate magic show where they apparently rob a guest of all his money (seemingly in a bank they transport him to at another location). An FBI agent, named Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo), and an Interpol agent, named Alma Dray (Laurent), are then teamed together and assigned to the magician case as the illusionists get ready to pull off another big heist.<br/><br/>The film is packed with clever magic tricks and witty lines. It's extremely humorous at times and the elaborate schemes are very involving. It's a little far-fetched and perhaps overly complicated but it's still extremely entertaining. I was blown away by the smart script, stylized directing and exhilarating pace. It's also highlighted by a great cast. Eisenberg is one of my favorite actors and seeing the normally really insecure nerd playing a cocky and overly confident ladies' man is kind of interesting for a change. Pairing him with the always fantastic Harrelson is cool once again as well. The rest of the cast are all adequate in their parts too. The movie does get a little bogged down at times, which is a little startling due to it's normal fast pace but those scenes are few and far between. For the most part it's a very well made and entertaining film.

The movie focuses too much on Mark Ruffalo's character and oddly incorporates Morgan Freeman too much, then makes him out to look like a bad guy.

IRL someone would probably have even tried to jump in- you just don't try to get the audience to stuff like that. Basically the writers never ever tried to rule out anything because it was implausible. If the writers had said ""Let's show her severed head get tossed out of the tank, then have it do a wink and disappear"" then they would have done it! It's like they think that since they can edit the film any way they want, they can make the characters appear clever or skilled by doing impossible things. There were lots of things that were just obvious lame CGI, like flying bubbles and stuff.<br/><br/>The big things. They break into the warehouse with the safe.............. in order to put up a giant piece of glass...... so they can break through it later to open the safe in 10 seconds. The whole car chase thing was so convoluted as well, with like 30 ways it could have gone wrong and/or killed other people. Knowing the security question answers to a rich guy's bank account letting you steal all his money...<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's car being full of money which makes him go to jail forever, even though he was obviously framed... Ugh I mean this movie is constantly winking at you, saying ""you see what is happening!"". Like immediately after the four Horsemen performance he is leaving, then his car pops out fluffy CGI money everywhere, then the cops pull up 0 seconds later. I wouldn't have been surprised if a fake dollar bill immediately floated in front of him with Jesse Eisenberg's laughing face and ""SUCK IT"" written on it.<br/><br/>In summary. Magicians become stunt car drivers so they can fake a guy's death for no reason. Everything is convoluted and filled with after- the-fact explanations. Oh yeah, the actors are good, I like them. The writers obviously think that having super powers == being clever. If one of the characters had fire powers, there would have been a scene where they say ""I bet you 20 dollars I can light this candle using nothing but my bare hands..."" then the other person would have said ""No way, I'll take that bet. Haha. Looks Like I'm gonna make some easy money"" then the fire guy would make fire come out of his hands and light the candle, and the other guy would say ""Awww man"" while simultaneously handing over his $20. AHHHHHH."

","I have to say this was one of the worst movies I've seen that actually had a very promising 'idea'. <br/><br/>The music is atrociously bad. It's like one long TV commercial. I just can't believe that anyone thought that this score/music was 'good'. The female lead (i don't even care who she is) is terrible. My mom could act better. It is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Watching (especially the non-ending) this movie makes me question what kind of world am I living in. Are people really that stupid? There's even famous actors in this so-called movie. Who really thought that this was worth showing? I can understand that sometimes people make bad movies.

It shouldn't have been entertaining as it was, but I was able to suspend my disbelief for two hours and I was able to be transported into some sort of fun alternate reality. But the CGI is great and it was used at the right times instead of just constantly.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier's film is about a group of magicians named The Four Horseman who are magicians on the outside, but on the inside they are actually bank robbers. When FBI and Interpol catch their scent, this ensues a thrilling chase where the Horseman must stay one step ahead of the FBI.<br/><br/>This film boasted a nice set of attractive actors and actresses. Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson were excellent, proving their A-list status. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were great supplements to the previous two. Franco actually had a great scene involving a tense car chase. Mark Ruffalo was really good as the lead FBI agent. Finally, who can forget about the great Morgan Freeman and the great Michael Caine?<br/><br/>Overall, Now You See Me is a really fun movie and I was certainly dazzled. The CGI and the set pieces were great. I can also say the same for the acting and the directing, which makes up for the lack of a good screenplay and characterization. It is action-packed and it is funnier than I thought it would be. Out of the two films based on magicians that came out in 2013, this film is the better one. Sorry Jim Carrey!

","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), one of the most superfluous characters in a long time, is introduced showing a magic trick to some tourists. As someone exposes his trick he stops the show and robs him instead. Now You See Me is just like that: you expect a nice show but it leaves you disappointed instead.<br/><br/>Given the premise of the movie one would expect an interesting plot, but after the first half hour sets the stage the movie develops into a sequence of action scenes and chaotic chases. Too much of the plot is either given away or too predictable to keep the story intriguing at this part, but the action and snappy dialogues are entertaining nevertheless. The problem is you can't fail to notice the focus is too much on the action and not on the characters, which remain superficial and don't show any development during the movie. Even the obligatory love story subplot comes like a plot twist rather than natural character development. <br/><br/>The final conclusion also arrives as a rabbit from a magic hat. Unlike a movie like The Prestige, which gives enough clues to be convincing, the great plot twist in Now You See Me feels just as unlikely at a second viewing. Together with the fact that all mysteries are revealed this unsatisfying ending leaves you with nothing else to think about than how much more this movie could have been."

Nothing about the plot, the plot twists that are simultaneously preposterous and expected, people's motivations, or the magic holds up to even the slightest scrutiny.<br/><br/>1 star (mandatory) + 1 star (for the rabbit--the movie's only believable character) + 1 star (since it didn't preach racism or advocate polygamy or anything weird like that) = 3 stars."

","I really wanted to see this movie because i have heard that it was good, but again, as many of Hollywood movies, it left me disappointed. At the start of the movie you still have some hope because the characters are introduced, but they are not given much personality(except maybe Mark Ruffalo and in some dose Jesse Eisenberg). I liked the idea of a magicians movie, but somewhere in the middle of the movie(when the big act is being performed) i could not restrain myself from laughing at how ridiculous it looked because i felt like i was accidentally watching an SF film, due to all the light and high-tech used in magic tricks. The movie is ambitious and its fun watching the magicians while they are outsmarting the detective during the movie, but when they got to a point when it was time to include some car racing on the bridge it was so confusing to watch because the camera was shaking and showing the faces of the cast instead of the actual car racing. The worst thing in the movie was definitely the forced chemistry the detective and the french woman had and it was painful to watch how they were somehow falling for each other. The end is somewhat unexpected and unrealistic but i guess the whole story then made sense."

","We begin being introduced to four modern magicians, Jesse Eisenberg is J. Daniel Atlas, a sleight of hand artist who specializes in close-up magic. Woody Harrelson is Merritt McKinney, a mentalist using his talents to con people out of their money. Isla Fisher is Henley Reeves, an escape artist on the rise and Dave Franco is Jack Wilder, a pickpocket magician with street ninja abilities. The four find mysterious cards that summon them to an apartment in New York. One year later they are working together as a team known as The Four Horsemen, performing at a sold-out show in Las Vegas, where they apparently rob a bank and reward their audience with the money. The film then shifts as we follow Mark Ruffalo, as FBI agent Dylan Rhodes, and Mélanie Laurent, as Interpol agent Alma Dray, as they try to figure out how the trick was done while tracking the Four Horsemen with the help of Morgan Freeman, as Thaddeus Bradley, a professional illusion exposer.<br/><br/>Now You See Me starts very strong and is highly entertaining. Jesse Eisenberg is perfect as a young magician and Woody Harrelson's mentalist is great fun to watch. These two actors have always been great working together and their characters in this film just don't get enough screen time. In fact, they deserve a film of their own as we're left wanting to see more of them. Mélanie Laurent stole our hearts as Shosanna Dreyfus in Inglourious Basterds and it's great to see her back on the big screen in such a big movie.<br/><br/>As the story races forward, it takes on too much for it's own good. The plot only continues to get more complicated and the more it tries to explain itself, the more questions rise that the film doesn't seem to have the time to explain or answer. Instead of slowing down and proving the story isn't full of plot holes for it's more observant, intellectual viewers, the filmmakers seem to assume that we are just going to trust them. The problem with this is that neither the writers or the director have produced anything in the past that suggests we can trust them. Screenwriter Boaz Yakin past credits include co-writer of Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and wrote last year's Jason Statham action flick, Safe. Screenwriter Ed Solomon co-wrote Super Mario Bros, Men In Black, Charlie's Angels and the 2009 Eddie Murphy family comedy, Imagine That. The film is directed by Louis Leterrier, who has also directed Transporter 2 and Clash of the Titans. Enough said.<br/><br/>What really ruins the fun is the final twist. This time it isn't just sloppy writing as it was made clear though-out the film, even from the very beginning, that someone else is involved with the Four Horsemen. When the reveal happens it's unexciting and the performance from the 5th horsemen comes off lazy. It's very anticlimactic for such a fast-paced film that was racing towards a climax that was promising us greatness.<br/><br/>Now You See Me is just another Hollywood thriller that starts out strong with great characters, performances and promises much but leaves us feeling cheated. Another magic trick that for all it's elaborate and exciting build-up, leaves us with no sense of awe. This is one illusion you'll wish you never knew how it was done."

","I went to cinema to see this movie knowing nothing about it. The first 10 minutes already annoyed me A LOT, mainly because all the characters try to be smarty pants most of the time. The magicians are very arrogant, and so is Morgan Freeman's character, which also makes the movie tiresome. I may admit that acting is professional, and so is directing. However, the plot is extremely Hollywood and there are lots of incongruence, which only pop corn fans will accept. In fact, the final twist is one of the few acceptable scenes, whilst the rest of them are filled with people trying to be better than the other. About the exploding car scene, it was OBVIOUS that it wasn't Jack in there. About his fight against some cops, it was totally unbelievable-- I thought I was watching Kung Fu Panda instead. It's a proper popcorn flick that many will enjoy, but I sadly did not."
"estebangonzalez10","4","5","9","5 July 2013"," The trick is on you!
","""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room.""<br/><br/>The latest film directed by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, and The Transporter) is probably one of his weakest efforts, only competing against Clash of the Titans. If the first rule in magic means you have to be the smartest person in the room, then the first rule to enjoy this movie is that you have to be one of the dumbest persons in the audience. The movie tries to make us think that the more we look the less we will see, kind of like telling us the more we think about the movie the less we will enjoy it. So it is trying to keep our mind centered on the nice tricks and great cast, but trying to keep us away from thinking too deeply at the absurdity of the plot. Now You See Me is all an illusion and the more you think about it the more you know that the tricks and twists are a bit beyond belief. It is a pity because I really like this cast (seeing Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine back together after the Batman trilogy was something I was looking forward too) and they aren't bad in this movie either, but the problem I had with it was that the screenplay was pretty weak and the tricks were unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I'm not against smart heist films that use magic and illusions, but this doesn't even deserve to stand against other films in the genre such as Oceans 11 that accomplishes this feat way better than this. The characters could have been developed so much better, but the film introduces them in such a lazy way that I didn't really get emotionally involved with them. I know all the movies don't have to be smart and believable, but at least those that aren't manage to engage and involve the audience in an entertaining way. I didn't feel that way about this silly movie. I didn't feel tricked either, I felt cheated on with such dumb twists. <br/><br/>The film begins by introducing us to four different magicians that are all being recruited by some sort of mystery man. First there is J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) who is doing a classic card trick in front of an audience in the street and picking up a girl while he's at it. Then there is Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), who is hypnotizing a woman while blackmailing her husband. The third magician is Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) who is performing a dangerous stunt involving a pool and piranhas. And finally there is Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) a con-magician who distracts people with cheap tricks while stealing from them. These four magicians are all recruited by a mysterious man who gives them a blue print of some great tricks they can work on together. The film then jumps a year forward where we see these four magicians working on an act together in Las Vegas. They are known as the Four Horseman and they are about to pull a live bank robbery from the stage. This is where the FBI comes in as lead investigator Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) begins to pursue the case along with his assigned partner from Interpol, Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). With no definite proof to arrest these magicians they must work together before their next heist takes place. For this, they enlist the help of Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a professional illusion exposer and former magician himself. But be warned, nothing is what it seems in this film as the twists begin.<br/><br/>I had high expectations for Now You See Me because it had an interesting premise and the cast involved was excellent. They are all really talented and honestly they did a good job with the weak script they had to work with. My biggest issue was the story which didn't make much sense. I won't mention the issues because I don't want to give away spoilers, but everything pretty much seemed false. I didn't believe the twists and turns the film took. I also thought the entire hypnotic sequences were kind of a cheat to explain how they could perform most of the tricks. The film really defies logic and I had a problem with that considering I never got emotionally involved with the characters in order to forgive those faults and simply enjoy the movie for what it is. I can forgive films that don't make sense as long as the audience is allowed to have fun with the premise and be entertained with what is going on, but that didn't happen with me. I won't be recommending Now You See Me to anyone, but I know some fans will have a good time thanks to the illusions and tricks that the director plays on us."

The ""magic performances"" are lack luster on the big screen. I'm not saying I can't suspend belief but in this film anytime something ""magic"" was happening it was rather underwhelming. The rest of the film you are following a cop that has no idea where he is going or what he should be doing next. If the director was trying to invoke emotions of pity and boredom then job well done. In the scene where the 4 horsemen are in New York worrying about being caught made me realize that I knew nothing about them besides they are magicians and they don't have the best group chemistry. So who cares if they get caught? At this point you have invested more time with the cop and you begin wondering who this story is really about.

Amazing. I realize you have to concede something inside a dream palace but this is not worth it.

","Now You See Me is basically a heist film which involves magicians, and it seems like it's going to be one of those illusion themed films that adds mind tricking elements throughout the plot. It begins featuring impressive magic tricks before it proceeds to its intriguing premise. It works best as a fast paced thriller with all the crazy action and ideas it brought, but as a clever mindbender, it effects rather differently than what it wants. The good thing is it's just simple and fun for embracing its own magic. Some tricks may get out of hand, but Now You See Me is a film that is easy enough to be charmed.<br/><br/>The plot sounds silly, but it's hard to not feel the excitement behind these illusions. No matter how dangerous it turns, it's still all about the magic. The most fun parts are when they're performing their thing. The whole merit of the film is its heart to show that these tricks are actually entertaining. Even the simplest ones like the deck of cards and hypnotism are still fascinating to watch. The cast keep these acts alive. Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher seem to have the enthusiasm of performing these tricks. Woody Harrelson is always a joy to watch. Mark Ruffalo, Dave Franco, and Melanie Laurent also made their roles a bit memorable, while Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are just sitting around doing their fine usual thing.<br/><br/>When it goes to the second act, they should be cracking the code of the illusions. It's ought to be a thought-provoking mystery, but it disappointingly over explains every detail. Even at every twist it reveals, they have to talk it out how the entire set up was built plus flashbacks to be clearer. The concept of being mind boggling is compromised and now stays to the comfort zone of bringing typical action set pieces. Some of the action can be whimsically inspired which fits to this environment.<br/><br/>The result of Now You See Me is not ""Pure Magic"" like what the tagline says nor genius, but it's an honest piece of cinema that offers real thrills even without the over-serious tone that moviegoers today suggests. The film still needs to be trickier. It started out overwhelming then slowly becomes the opposite later on. Despite the missteps it makes, the experience is undeniably endlessly entertaining, thanks to the enthusiasm for magic and delightful performances. Now You See Me didn't apply as being cleverer, but it's still a good blockbuster anyway."

""Now You See Me"" tells the story of a group of magicians that call themselves ""The Four Horsemen"". The group consists of (big surprise) four people: ""Daniel Atlas"" (Jesse Eisenberg), ""Henley Reeves""(Isla Fisher), ""Jack Wilder""(Dave Franco) and ""Merritt McKinney""(Woody Harrelson). They all possess very colorful and somewhat obnoxious personalities. Before banding together to form their group all of them were either street performers or rogue magicians. After each of them receive a mysterious card that leads them to a dingy apartment where they are given access to blueprints depicting amazing magic tricks they establish ""The Four Horsemen"". We then fast forward a year later, they have all become accomplished magicians and are pulling off mind bending performances together. During their show in Las Vegas they claim that for their final trick, they will rob a bank. They pick an audience member ""randomly"" and supposedly teleport them to a large bank in Paris. Inexplicably, they manage to steal the money. Soon enough FBI detective ""Dylan Rodes"" is teamed up with a young ""Interpol"" agent named ""Alma Dray""(Melanie Laurent) and are assigned to capture ""The Four Horsemen"", but they just keep slipping through his fingers.<br/><br/>Whilst undoubtedly being fun and entertaining, the story of ""Now You See Me"" is so over the top and ludicrous that at times it feels a bit insulting to someones intelligence. The magicians pull off stunts that could only be described as ""paranormal"" and since this movie is supposed to be grounded in reality, it seems rather silly. The acting is..alright despite being overly comical that comes off as being pretty obnoxious and annoying. The visual effects aren't great, but they're not bad either. The problem with them is that it is extremely obvious that everything is computer generated. The best part of the film has to be Morgan Freeman. He can always make a film feel entertaining and always brings life to the screen. The greatest damage to the film has to be the utterly stupid plot twists. Although everything seems to add up and come together, the plot twists feel childish and unnecessary.<br/><br/>The film is entertaining, but chances are that you will forget it in a few days. The characters are shallow, the plot is ludicrous and the twists are childish. The best that ""Now You See Me"" provide is some good popcorn entertainment that you can watch with your friends.

It was evident throughout the movie, and the audience never gets a true look into the protagonists' personalities, which could be argued 'adds to the elusiveness of the magicians' but it was definitely lacking in that department. This is partly due to the writing. The writing could have been better, but then again no writing is perfect. <br/><br/>However, the film was a solid 8 overall for me.

Everything that was done was based on actual magic tricks and could have been done with real effects but a lot was done with editing or CGI. This was done because the amount of time that all the actor/actresses would have had to put in to be able to pull off the effects would have been almost a year. No one has that amount of time to put in for a single movie. I enjoyed the movie a great deal. I thought the writing was tight, the acting good, I have two problems with the movie. One the editing, the fight scenes are editing so badly you cannot understand what is going on.

","This film was absolutely amazing. I simply cannot describe the emotion I felt while watching this. I especially loved the romance between Isla and Jesse. If they ever make a sequel, they should include more romance between them! I highly recommend watching this film. I have watched this thrice already! Jesse Eisenberg also did a wonderful job! This truly is my favorite movie. I would rate this a solid 9.5/10, which rounds off to 10/10. I hope they make a sequel focusing more on the 4 horsemen instead of the FBI. The effects were fantastic as well. I also loved the unexpected plot twist at the end. The first time I watched this, it left me a bit confused, which is a good thing. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I had to watch it another time to fully understand everything, and even so I still couldn't stop thinking about it.

","Just saw this movie on Pay per view. It is one of the most interesting and entertaining movies I have seen in a long time. The acting is wonderful-especially Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman. Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher are the perfect ""Four Horseman"", backed initially by an enigmatic Michael Caine. Melanie Laurent adds a nice touch as in Interpol agent who may (or may not) have her own agenda. The plot is intriguing, with many twists and turns that really surprised me-and my son-in-law-who was watching it with me. I just wonder what kind of mind can come up with all the twists.

","One of the absolute worst movies I've ever seen. Now You See Me is a convoluted gimmick that thinks it's smart but really it's laughably bad. The story is a complete mess, and it's so predictable that when twists are revealed you either rolls your eyes or just yawn, I did both. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but the tagline ""the closer you look, the less you'll see"" screams out the obvious pretty much the whole time, it's so blatant which character is behind the whole trick. I'll admit it's got a flashy cast, but the real shame is that their performances aren't that great. Eisenberg's nerdy charm is starting to wither away, Harrelson's comedic timings are poor, but Isla Fisher boasts the strongest stage presence as one of the four Horsemen. The real shame is that Dave Franco is severely underused. It's actually Melanie Laurent that delivers the best though, as a French interpol agent who is very witty and smart, and her character arouses suspicion as the camera seems to focus on her quite a lot hinting at something. The police in this movie are portrayed as complete idiots, always one step behind the magicians, and the cat and mouse elements really suck. The action is vapid and boring, the only decent scene is Franco and Ruffalo's fight which only lasts for a minute or two. This movie disguises itself as clever spectacle, when really the awe of seeing real magic is taken away by the CGI which makes all the tricks feel even more fake than they already do. Seriously, you're better off watching an episode of Dynamo. Now You See me stretches out it's ending and fills in even more twists making it more preposterous and mundane, and Letterier's constantly spinning and panning camera-work is just a filler to disguise the fact there is nothing to hide. What an load of rubbish."

I normally love finishing a movie riddled with twists and turns, foreshadowing and clues inter-weaved with red herrings and deceit, as everything is slowly pieced together following a big reveal. To my disappointment I ended Now You See Me with the thoughts - ""That was just dumb"". Now You See Me falls dreadfully short of its potential but still however may to entertain younger views that are content with the big budget feel and sparse scenes of interest.

"osman-youssef","9","3","5","31 March 2014"," Review:""Now you see me""
","The Thriller movie, ""Now You See Me"", is an ingenious film that has stunned many of its viewers. Its director, Louis Leterrier, should be proud of this masterpiece as the movie's great plot, which always has its audience foreshadowing but left disappointed. Although the movie runs for about two hours, the mystery and the suspense don't make it feel that long.<br/><br/>The plot starts off with the gathering of four different magicians, forming ""The Four Horsemen"", a team that is following the plans of an unknown leader. Actors, Dave Franco, Isla Fisher, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson are the magicians that have been chosen to act out some schemes that will stun the world. Morgan Freeman, who happens to be an ex-magician himself, and the cast that play the FBI like Mark Ruffalo try to stop these magicians and catch them robbing banks and stealing from CEOs as part of their shows, giving the money away to the audience. The fast-paced flow of the movie as well as the remarkable acting brand the movie as one of my all-time favorites."
"BloodyPool","2","3","5","22 February 2014"," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","Not sure there is a single positive thing I can say about this film. Absolutely horrible in spite of the string of stars involved in its creation. Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman are all talented actors but what a waste of creative juices. If you must watch this then be forewarned that it lacks any substance whatsoever. The acting is minimal. The writing and dialogue are amateurish. It's billed in the crime category but it falls way short of that. It's billed as a mystery but twenty minutes into it, I didn't care whodunit, I wanted it over. Drama? A big miss there, too. Thriller? Don't get your hopes up. So what does it offer? Not much. It wasn't even entertaining as I lost total interest very quickly. It's this kind of film that has the viewer wondering who in their right mind decided to throw money at this project. At some point didn't anyone look around and say, ""Wow, this is total crap!"" 115+ minutes I'll never get back. The way the film ended it was almost as if the director dabbled at making a sequel. Please, please, I beg you to reconsider. In other words, viewers, do not waste your time."

","Right, were to begin? How about the fact that there were both good and bad things about this movie, yes despite my tight rating. Good: What a cast! Isla fisher, Jesse Eisenberg, Michael Caine, Morgan freeman and mark Ruffalo. They are usually good actors but they turned in average performances. The tricks are really quite clever and entertaining- for a magic show NOT a movie! The locations are cool? Nah I'm pretty much scraping the barrel here. Let me launch into the negatives: 1. Isla fisher and her character's annoying voice. 2. Morgan freeman should not have lowered himself to this movie, he plays a debunker of magicians called Thaddeus Bradley..WHAT??! 3. Michael Caine makes the exact same mistake. 4. If Ruffalo was in on the magic the whole time why was he such a maggot to the French girl? Asking if she was really who she says she is...have you looked in the mirror lately? 5. Plus why did Ruffalo risk climbing into a burning car to check on what he knows is a dead corpse? Was he trying so hard to convince his people that he is a cop that he felt the need to risk imminent death?! 6. What do they do when the carousel ride ends? 7. Common is in this movie...gets hypnotised...plays imaginary violin when a curse word is said. Need I go on? Do not see this movie....

"hudini669","4","3","5","21 December 2013"," A great illusion
","I expected much from 'Now You See Me'. Just one look at the cast was promising enough, but most of all I was intrigued by the film since it seemed to deal with magic. I guess I wanted to be fooled, as they said in another (excellent) movie about magicians. Being fooled was pretty much everything I got out of seeing this one.<br/><br/>'Now You See Me' is all style and no substance, a Potemkin village of sorts. It looks great, has great cast and great special effects, all built to hide the fact there's a key ingredient missing, namely a story. The plot raises a lot of questions which remain unanswered (or get an answer in a ""because-I-said-so"" fashion), and is generally inconclusive, naive and unbelievable to the point where no great names or great acting can save it from wreckage.<br/><br/>Some people may mistake this film's incoherence for intelligence and I firmly believe that those people are its target audience. I don't take myself to be any smarter than anyone else, but when I watch a film and see half the things from way too far ahead but can't understand exactly why the other half happens, it's clearly either not a film for me or I'm not the right audience for the film. I could be wrong, but I guess it was made primarily for the people who didn't understand the other (excellent) movie about magicians I mentioned previously. I did find some enjoyment in this one, mainly from an aesthetic point of view, but, honestly, the only thing that kept me watching it past one hour mark was simply gorgeous Melanie Laurent.<br/><br/>I read that there is a sequel already scheduled. I don't know if it's going to be called 'Now You Don't', but I for one know I surely won't.<br/><br/>4/10"

"rgblakey","Null","3","5","2 June 2013"," Things are not as they seem in Now You See Me
","One genre that can really entertain when done right is the heist flick. For them to work one of the most important things is to have a creative approach to the heist or the heist itself. Lately there have been very few adding anything new to the genre, but with Now You See Me they look to have tried to add a bit of magic to the struggling genre literally. With a great cast including Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine does it create the spectacle it promises or are the trailers all an illusion? <br/><br/>Now You See Me follows an FBI agent and an Interpol detective track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money. For once a film got the heist element right and delivered a clever and engaging story to go along with it. This isn't a perfect film by any means, but thanks to the magic element, which is usually a film killer, it takes it to a level that keeps things moving in an interesting direction. While the trailers showcase the magicians as the leads, this isn't quite the case. Make no mistake they are in the majority of the film and deliver the best parts of the film, but this movie follows more of Mark Ruffalo's detective as he is obsessively trying to solve this case. Typically Ruffalo is great and he is decent here, but just not up to par of his normal performances. Most of this is due to the character not being all that interesting and the attempt to thrust more depth into it that was really not necessary. The rest of the cast have great chemistry and chew up the scenery around them with Michael Caine really the only one with very little to do. The heists are fun to watch and ponder how they pulled it off even though some of them are predictable, but for the most part create a great presence on screen. While not a lot there are some great action moments here and there that were pretty surprising featuring Dave Franco that probably were not all him, but still fun to watch none the less.<br/><br/>With the exception of some of the useless character elements to the Ruffalo character the rest of this movie is pretty entertaining adding a unique twist to the heist genre that has been missing. It probably would have been even better if the main focus had been on the magicians also known as the Four Horseman, but who knows maybe the less is more approach is why it worked so well."

That ambiguity could really be an interesting approach, you say, but it only manages to distance us from the boring set of characters and shamelessly unfolds into a predictable ""reverse psychology"" conclusion.

","after hearing different reviews from this film i had no idea what to expect but unfortunately i did not like it.<br/><br/>To me this film has far to many ""magic tricks"" that didn't make sense and didn't need to be there and at the end of this movie rather than thinking about all the twists i only thought about these moments. The other part of this movie that bothered me was the cast. Whilst you may think it has a stellar cast for me the characters lacked depth and interest, i couldn't find myself engaged with any of the characters and to be honest i thought the acting was poor. If the director cut down on the long meaningless trick scenes and instead built in a story and a background for the characters i would have been more interested.<br/><br/>To wrap up my analasys i would say that this film was poorly executed. i think the basic idea for the story was quite good with the twists that it produces but somehow the makers got caught up trying to make an ""epic mindf**k"" movie they forgot to add a story. throughout the whole film i didn't have any emotional responses and quite simply couldn't wait for it to end."

","Now You See Me. The title says it all. At the end of the movie the title will make sense. Throughout the movie we see bits and pieces of a bigger picture. And at the end(Now) it's revealed (You See Me). The point of this movie is not what everybody thinks it is. The movie is not about magic or magic tricks. It's about one man(Dylan Rhodes) looking for revenge for the murder of his father. And doing it in an unusual way. A way that honors his father. Through illusion. And while doing that he got four street performers off the street and on a stage. Through the whole film everybody has been repeating one thing: ""The closer you look, the less you'll see."" It's not about how they did the tricks(although it's interesting) or even if they are possible in real life. The people responsible for the murder of Dylan's father got what they deserved. The audience got money just for being there and four illusionists found a purpose in their life. And all that through ""magic"". On top of everything the main character (Dylan) found love.

","Not rehashing plot summary. There's a reason why I haven't watched it all this time. This was released over a few years ago and it looked interesting I guess because it seemed distinctive in comparison to what was being released at the time. I basically think that this is a standard action movie. It tries to present itself with having an intelligent storyline and what little there is, is glossed over by nonstop commotion. Not surprising since it's from the same director who did The Transporter -- another movie I didn't like. I suppose I was expecting something.....perhaps.....with a little more depth? A little more development? Although the movie is almost two hours, it goes by in a brisk pace. The problem is not the acting, which I thought was altogether good. I just found the whole movie pretty ridiculous. Some of the setups were quite extravagant for me such as the scene on the bridge, another is when the three magicians jump off a building and by the end when the FBI agent was in on the whole thing, and also when Morgan Freeman's character was locked away at the end. The ending especially felt very similar to an overrated film called The Usual Suspects. It's inconceivable how it all comes together. The biggest magic trick in this movie is the art of distraction into thinking there is any plausible story. These films that center on magicians i.e., The Illusionist, The Prestige, etc., I just don't find particularly intriguing. I am not sure if I would bother with the sequel, ""Now You See Me, Now You Don't."" Haha."
"soup_cans","3","2","3","4 July 2016"," So so bad
","I can't believe people gave this movie a higher than mediocre rating and it really mystifies me that they made a sequel to this piece of dog doo. The direction is terrible, the acting is terrible, the entire plot is hinky and doesn't make a lot of sense, the dialog felt artificial, and every plot development was predictable except for the big reveal which felt like a last minute decision and could have applied to anyone in the story. Added to that, I was often bored to tears during the magic shows scenes which went on and on needlessly. The special effects were okay but since the invention of CGI, I don't particularly think the effects in the film were all that impressive. If you enjoy good film this is definitely not for you. But if you like simple films that you doesn't make you think, then you my love it."
"cheighlee","4","2","3","21 April 2016"," Lazy and stupid
","Among the stupid movies, Now You See Me is a certain breed of stupid. It's a dumb and lazy movie trying hard to look smart for dumb people.<br/><br/>Tha cast is stellar but it doesn't matter because plot is stupid, tricks are plain bad and overuse of CGI to make those tricks look cooler is even worse. It's almost as if it was created by someone who never saw a magic show in his or her life.<br/><br/>Photography plays a huge role here, because with those constant moving, circling shots, movie tries to make everything look cool and grand and whatever but it just makes everything look even more fake and stupid. It visually tries to hide it's stupidity behind dynamic camera work and lots of CGI.<br/><br/>Characters are dumb, cheap and not interesting. Even if he's first billed, the main role isn't actually Eisenberg, however hard promos for this try to make you believe that. It's Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent, everyone else are side characters. Motivations are dumb, plot goes nowhere.<br/><br/>There is a reason why Prestige is considered on of the best magician themed movies and Ocean's Eleven as one of the best heist movies. Both movies primarily wanted to tell you a story, a cool story in a smart way. Now You See Me does the opposite, it tries to dazzle you with it's hollow and cheap jewelry, hoping that you're too dumb to think about it, care or see through it. It's like you have two dumb persons of the same level of dumbness but one is dressed in fancy clothes made of white, shiny paper and tries to impress the other dumb person, that also has poor vision.<br/><br/>Usually movies like this are around 5/10 because they have the cast and it looks like a movie and it has some OK parts but just because it also made me groan in small fury at moments I'm giving it 4/10. And that's mercy."
"Leofwine_draca","4","2","3","17 April 2016"," Great, if you like ridiculous films
","Hollywood seems obsessed by making films about magicians where the magicians turn out to have real magical powers. I've seen a certain mainstream film in the past that did the same thing and I hated it for cheating the viewer. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't as blatant as that, but it still has one ridiculous scene after another which would have been physically impossible in real life, thus making this a delusional fantasy of a film. Having all the magic done in-camera without cutting away would have done much to remedy this situation.<br/><br/>A problem of having an over-confident group of protagonists in a movie is that their characters are all annoying, and that's the case here. A smug Jesse Eisenberg is the worst, but Woody Harrelson is little better. Isla Fisher only seems to be around so she can show off her body in tight clothes and push-up bras. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent do better as the cops investigating the cons, but it's left to the seasoned old-timers Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine to give the most professional performances.<br/><br/>In any case, NOW YOU SEE ME is an unlikeable film. There's a lot of incident going on here, and with it a lot of cheese. The CGI effects of fire and the like are very disappointing. Throwing in random car chases and fight scenes is over the top and doesn't work very well at all, as by the end it all seems rather overblown and pointless. Needless to say that this was a hit in America and a sequel has followed. Great, I can't wait."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","2","3","17 February 2016"," Only good if you see it as a fantasy film
","""Now You See Me"" is a French/American co-production from 3 years ago and probably so far the most known work by French director Louis Leterrier. He sure got a whole bunch of big names lined up for this project, including Oscar winners and Oscar nominees. The outcome is not a failure, but still disappointing. Films about magic are not too frequent these days, even if there is Brody's ""Houdini"" and Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" of course. And you could call this film here a poor man's ""The Prestige"". Not only does the cast have Micael Caine in common, but it also tries to be controversial and mind-blowing from start to finish, but almost never succeeds. One main reason for this may be Jesse Eisenberg, who is probably the lead actor or at least the one who fits the description the most. In 90% of his films he plays a super-smart, smug young adult and his shtick has really gotten repetitive by now. I wish he would take other paths again like in ""Zombieland"" for example. By the way, it's a ""Zombieland"" reunion with Harrelson, who is fun as usual in here. Unfortunately the other 2 members of the gang are very forgettable too. Isla Fisher only stands out because she is the only woman from the quartet and Dave Franco, brother to James, proves that he is not even close to his famous sibling in terms of talent. Then again, the way the character is written was pretty disastrous too. He is totally irrelevant for pretty much the entire film and when we are supposed to be shocked he is alive, I honestly couldn't care less.<br/><br/>Finally, the story: There are a couple good scenes, but the longer the film goes, the more it loses itself in the makers' clumsy attempts to make this as surprising, mind-blowing and fascinating as possible. It really is none of all this. It is also way too long for its own good and they certainly could have cut out 20 minutes perhaps. These 20 minutes should come from the second half though as the movie was decent until the moment the quartet took the money from Caine's character's bank account. After that, it turns into a forgettable action thriller, before it desperately tries so hard to get back to the magic storyline and make this the center of the film again. I find it very irritating to see that this film is guaranteed to have not only one, but probably two sequels as there is hardly anything in here that makes me curious about a continuation of the story. And what can they do? Perhaps bring in a new cop that goes after the illusionists? I don't know. I can only say that I don't have much interest to see it and it would be almost painful to see Eisenberg('s character) for another 2 hours as I am sure he will bring absolutely nothing new to the character. I did not really guess the final plot twist as I thought Laurent's character may be the 4th Horseman, but obviously they had to go out the most spectacular way possible. A lot of the film can be described as style over substance. If you want to watch it nonetheless, you can turn it off after the first hour. It gets bad really quickly after that."
"serpent_coil","1","2","3","27 September 2015"," All style, no substance. All smoke and mirrors. All surface, no feeling.
","So what is there to say about this movie? What we get is a vague, overarching background plot, a contrived love-story that just kind of pops up for no apparent reason, a few predictable plot twists, a huge plot twist pulled out of thin air and some really overdone CGI magic. For a film boasting such a strong cast it falls surprisingly flat. I suppose someone has a lot of dirt on the main cast, or maybe they didn't read the script before signing on to this Titanic of a movie. <br/><br/>First of all, there is no of urgency or excitement what so ever. The four horsemen are certainly closer to being super villains than actual human illusionists. The FBI and Interpol are no more than comic sidekicks, never ever getting close to catching the bank robbers/magicians/demigods. I get the feeling the writers want me to root for Jesse, Woody and the rest of the illusionists but they just come off as being so ridiculously overpowering and vastly superior to the police it's like rooting for a UFC fighter beating up a puppy. <br/><br/>The would be heroes are at best people who the movie never tries to make the audience care about, at worst they are smug and utterly unlikable. There is no back story worth mentioning, all we get are some short intro sequences. The main characters meet and then the main plot just kind of fast-forwards off into action without any further explanation. The character development is so insignificant it cannot even be measured. There is no change and nothing is leaned. At the end of the film the characters are exactly the same as when we started. Yes, there are some references to a back story but that never effects the plot besides setting up a few one-liners and in a clumsily thrown together ending twist. <br/><br/>I read quite a few reviews saying this movie thinks it is much smarter than it really is and I think that sums it up quite nicely. This movie is like a pompous street magician with a self satisfied grin, quite certain he's got the audience in awe when in reality everyone in the crowd has seen that he's got a card up his sleeve and that his fly is undone. <br/><br/>I gave this movie 1/10, if only to balance the notoriously generous IMDb-crowd and lobbyists that for some reason beyond think this movie is worth 7.2/10. If I was drunk while watching and feeling particularly benevolent I might give it a weak 3/10."

Now You See Me attempts to be Catch Me If You Can, The Illusionist, The Prestige, an ensemble-cast vehicle, an FBI-chase thriller, and a tacked-on romance all at once.<br/><br/>Unfortunately it is not clever enough to carry so much dead weight. I had already solved the tricks, guessed the back-stories, and knew who was behind everything by the halfway point of the film... which is remarkable considering how absurd and inconsistent much of the writing and editing were.<br/><br/>I spent the latter half of the film simultaneously rolling my eyes and cracking my knuckles... so badly did I want to punch each of the smug characters in the face.<br/><br/>How can a film ABOUT MAGIC feel so tight and restrained?

"MarumeChiisa","1","2","3","13 January 2015"," This Movie is an insult to ""Magic""
","A friend of mine recommended this, saying the movie was cool and all that with the magicians as Robinhood-wannabe. My first impression upon hearing the word 'magician' was the movie I've watched prior; ""The Prestige"", but then, I was utterly disappointed after finding out that the movie mistook 'magic' with 'sorcery'.<br/><br/>Someone must tell the movie staffs that there are stark contrasts between 'magician' and 'sorcerer', seriously. Sure, both words might sound similar, and maybe even some children classified them as the same thing. But I believe they didn't hire 6th-grader to make this movie, did they? Flying and swirling curtain? Flying deck of cards? A magic show involving a whole city of extras, or maybe the magic was a magic show of car accident involving a whole city of innocent peoples and somehow managed to pull it anyway? What the hell?<br/><br/>And by the way, what was with the plot twist saying that the character Ruffalo's (didn't even bother remembering the character's name. He was basically just running around the background like some stupid chasing after the wind) were playing was the actual mastermind or something like that? That came out of nowhere! Hey, director, if you want to give a plot twist, give the viewers some more hint so that they could think, not just watching in awe with the sorcery-practitioner magician acting all Robinhood, dulling their (viewer) brains.<br/><br/>The actions and the CGI were awesome, sure, I would love it if the magicians were replaced with sorcerers or something equally 'magical', whoa, there comes the word 'magic' again. Whatever. The rating of the movie in this site was good, but it seems like they (the staffs) didn't read the review carefully. Most people were saying that the movie was basically cool with the actions and all, but most of them ALSO said that the movie lacks depth and plausible story. And now, they're currently working with the sequel. Okay, good luck, then. That's all I wanted to say."

'when is it OUR turn?'<br/><br/>If you just want to watch (preposterously absurd) CG-eye candy and ignore the dialogue - all of it - then by all means, sit back with the beer and pizza.

","With a splendid cast of actors and with a story hanging on the unbelievable, Now You See Me is quite the entertaining film and one which truly pulled me into it. Needless to say I've already read some of the hate posts here on IMDb, and while on a reasonable note, these complaints don't actually resonate with me, as I found the movie to be great and exciting, despite its flaws. The basic premise is that a group of former solo magic performers, team up at the request of a mysterious figure, and end up robbing banks during their performances as The Four Horseman. This action quickly gathers the attention of the FBI who assign an agent who, along with an Interpol detective will try to decipher the ultimate trick. As was said, the plot execution is borderline insane and one can see the problem some of the viewers had with the film. Also the four main characters seem to act merely as plot devices and lack any real development. As far as my view is concerned on these points, my conclusion is that it doesn't really matter to me, since I watched this movie to have a little fun and to enjoy being tricked, as is the case here. As much as I enjoy a well crafted movie, Now You See Me is a perfect example of a movie that has worrying flaws, yet achieves what I wanted from it, and that is top notch entertainment.

","Because I've already wasted my time to the point of no return with this movie, I will also review it. This is the worst movie I have probably seen in a couple of years. Not entertaining, no substance, I don't care about any of the characters and I'm just mad at this point. The movie started out promising with an interesting set-up and characters that could have been deep with a real and emotional background. However, the characters only had this background in my imagination, as there was literally nothing explained about the story of these characters. It was not possible to form any bond with the people in this movie, as there was nothing to bond with. It could have just been empty shells performing. Performance of the actors wasn't bad, but with this cast it is almost an achievement how bad the movie turned out to be. The plot twists can easily be seen beforehand by a blind man with a hearing impairment. The action made no sense and the acts of ""magic"" were pure coincidence, although the directors tried to package the whole thing as an amazing magic trick. It wasn't. All in all, the movie was the biggest disappointment I've had in a long time. The 7.3 on IMDb is probably a bug and should be changed to a 3.7 (or worse if I would have anything to do with it). Don't watch this movie, unless you really have nothing else to do in your life. Watching grass grow is more interesting and fulfilling than watching this movie."

"paul2001sw-1","5","2","3","13 October 2013"," Too much
","In theory, a thriller about magic should be a winner. The illusion of magic is achieved through confidence and misdirection, perfect ingredients for a tricksy plot. Yet many of the best thrillers are also already confidence and misdirection without the aid of magic; confidence tricks within plots, but also, the guile of the film-maker in misleading his audience. And there's even a further layer – one watches a fictional story on an implicit assumption that it obeys a set of rules implied by the way that the story is told – but the film-maker can break this compact. In extremis, magic in movie can actually be real.<br/><br/>Which means that the film-maker has many layers of illusion at his disposal; but also the temptation to over-egg the pudding. The set-up for 'Now You See Me' is corny but brilliant – four cocksure, mainstream, Las Vegas magicians may (or may not) have engineered a real crime under the cloak of their magic. To work, such a film needs to have a theory of how this could be done that is both cunning and plausible, one that can trick both the victims within the story, but also the real world audience. And if the film seems to hint that there's real magic behind the trickery well, that only adds to the atmosphere. But the power available to the film-maker can also be abused. In this film, as in Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige', a character ""disappears"" by falling through a trapdoor. I have no idea whether real world magicians are sufficiently skilled to distract their audiences from noticing. But I'm sure that in neither film was an actor filmed falling through the door, but rather that the disappearance was conjured only in the editing room. The director could defend himself by claiming to be showing what the in-story audience believe they are seeing (as opposed to what they really saw), but this means that the film's real audience have no independent appeal to their senses, have to take it on trust even as they're being deceived. Although it's not a magic film, the plot of 'Now You See Me' has elements that resemble 'The Usual Suspects',- a film whose final plot trick was both breathtaking and inane (with the appearance of a character the film had just explained to us did not actually exist in a layer outside the story in which he had been created).<br/><br/>'The Usual Suspects' was, nonetheless, well done in a way that 'Now You See Me' is not. The tricks in this film might be technically explicable, but they're so over the top, so sophisticated, so contrived, they're not remotely plausible – indeed, they seem to have been conceived by the scriptwriters mainly because they make for good cinematography. And the plot's final bait and switch, and revealed revenge motive, are tired devices. One thing I did like, though, was the swaggering stage personas of the magician-criminals – you could certainly believe that such a crew could pull something off, though sadly not this – a more modest affair might actually have been good."

Found themselves due to a superior strength and magical (that after revealed-if be more surprising and Funny), that the joined, forming the Four Horsemen. So far, nothing mysterious, just a beginning of film to know the characters, so one filled to go to the main story.

The chemistry between the actors is very entertaining, the action scenes are visually impressive, and the film moves along at a brisk case. Those watching it in theaters were likely consuming a lot of popcorn and getting a large number of thrills from the experiences.<br/><br/>The trouble is (and what cements this movie as decidedly average) that the flick promises far too much than what it can actually deliver. For example, ""The Prestige"" promises to bend the mind but then actually does it. Here, director Louis Leterrier promises similar things (he sets up the movie like it will amaze you in the end), but instead just provides a ho-hum ending.<br/><br/>Thus, it isn't so much that the film is bad, per se, but rather that it promises the world and only delivers a sliver. You might like it for the pizazz and crackling dialogue/action, but don't expect anything mind-blowing (confusion is more of the end result)."

","Four magicians –all with distinctly different abilities– are mysteriously invited through Tarot cards to an apartment building. Once there, they meet each other while waiting in front of the locked door. However, the door doesn't stay locked for long, as one of them opens it with ease. Inside the seemingly empty apartment, they set off a series of events which in turn shows them blueprints.<br/><br/>They are put together to perform a series of shows as 'The Four Horsemen'. They're the shows of a lifetime, where they'll rob a bank while life on stage in the middle of a fully packed hotel, treating the audience to the stolen monies.<br/><br/>After their first show, in which they stole millions from a bank in Paris, while performing in Las Vegas, they are arrested in their hotel room, yet are all let free due to a lack of evidence. With Interpol now high on their heels, they manage to evade and escape the detectives with their tricks.<br/><br/>The film includes comedy, mystery and action. All in all it makes for a fun and intriguing watch, and I'll definitely be watching the second and third instalments.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert! In reality, the four magicians are actually just very clever con-men/woman, with incredible capabilities of fooling everyone right in front of their faces. Still, it doesn't matter knowing they're conning everyone, you're still pulled in to watch every new trick to see what they'll pull off."
"classicalsteve","8","1","1","21 June 2016"," Sort of Ocean's 11 Meets Houdini: An Enjoyable Flick About the Power of Illusion
","Is magic real? Maybe. However for centuries there are those who don't have one ounce of true magical ability in the literal sense of the word but are able to convince others they do, usually audiences willing to suspend their ""disbelief"". These people are called ""magicians"", and magicians have been performing before amazed crowds since Antiquity and the Middle Ages to the present. The film in question ""Now You See Me"", the first half of the phrase ""Now you see me, now you don't"", takes us into the world of magicians. The main performers, four diverse magicians of mediocre talents, have been brought together to become the Four Horsemen, I assume their name deriving from the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse as labeled in the Book of Revelation.<br/><br/>Four different magicians have been summoned by Tarot cards for an unknown purpose: Merritt McKinney, whose card is the Hermit, a hypnotist and mentalist (Woody Harrelson), Daniel ""Danny"" Atlas, whose card is the Lover, an arrogant illusionist (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves, whose card is the High Priestess, an escape-artist similar to Houdini (Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder, Tarot card Death, a sleight of hand illusionist and street magician (Dave Franco). At the beginning of the film they were magicians who performed spontaneously for small crowds. Through the Tarot cards, they are summoned by an unknown ""benefactor"" and eventually financed by Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), an insurance magnate. In a year, they evolve from unknown street magicians to a nationally-known headline act, the Four Horsemen. They perform in large venues in Las Vegas and New York. <br/><br/>Their escapades catch the eye of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and U.S. law enforcement when they appeared to have enacted a magical heist from a bank in France. Interpol in Europe also gets involved, and they send a young inexperienced agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), a French criminal researcher who has interest in the occult. As the stunts of the Four Horsemen keep getting larger, involving ever-larger sums of money, Alma and Rhodes find themselves battling a formidable foe. The Horsemen use their magic ""act"" as a kind of misdirection, and the FBI and Interpol always seem one to two steps behind them. The FBI starts to question the motives of Alma in part because they wander if there is a ""fifth horseman"" as yet unknown but pulling many of the strings.<br/><br/>Also on their trail is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a modern-day skeptic whose show and DVD's expose ""magic"" fraud, similar to Houdini's exposing of séance frauds in the early 20th century. Thirty years previous to the events of the film, Thaddeus exposed another magician, Lionel Shrike. His career was all but ruined at the hands of Thaddeus, until he decided to engage in a comeback by attempting to escape from a safe thrown into the Hudson River. He never escaped and was presumed dead. As a result, the ""magic"" community has had an adversarial relationship with Thaddeus. FBI agent Rhodes tries to ingratiate himself to Thaddeus, hoping the exposer of magic fraud will help them capture the Four Horsemen. The game becomes a kind of cat and mouse in which Rhodes is bent on exposing and arresting the Four Horsemen and using Thaddeus as a kind of double-agent. However, Thaddeus appears less than impressed with the FBI, and although he's not entirely on the side of the Four Horsemen, he seems to admire their tricks. He also has his own agenda, wanting footage for his upcoming show.<br/><br/>A fun-filled, action-packed heist-thriller with a certain amount of intelligence. The acting is superb, and the cast of the Four Horsemen are diverse enough we buy into their little eccentricities. Freeman makes an excellent Thaddeus Bradley, constantly pointing out the ineptitude of the FBI. And Caine is a good billionaire magnate who stays somewhat behind the scenes to finance the money-making endeavors of the Four Horsemen. During the film, different miss-directions are explained by Freeman which is half the fun. A good escapist film. But don't try the stunts at home!"

","Everyone loves magic tricks. The wonder has been ingrained in us since our childhood. And movies about magic are usually just as enjoyable. This one is no exception. <br/><br/>Four individual magicians--each with a different specialty--get summoned by some mysterious master magician to join together and perform ""tricks"" to steal from the rich and give to the poor. Meanwhile, a frustrated FBI agent, played by Mark Ruffalo, can't seem to figure out how it's all happening. He teams up with a female Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) to put a stop to the madness.<br/><br/>The dynamics among the magicians are fun and kept very light. The tricks they perform are, at times, very fascinating to the point that we wish we could go to Vegas to watch their show. We become invested in the lives of these people because the writers let us. But then something happens--our focus is forcibly changed.<br/><br/>For the last 60-90 minutes we are pretty much solely focused on Ruffalo's character. We don't want to be, but we are. And as we travel deeper into the story, the befuddlement steadily increases. Luckily, the film makes itself fairly easy to focus on to somewhat help negate the convolution. <br/><br/>It helps to rewatch this movie. But then again, seeing behind the curtain--which is the ending-- may cause you to feel like you've been manipulated. Realizing the filmmakers trick you into seeing what they want you to. And depending on how much you like magic tricks, you may or may not be happy about it.<br/><br/>But see, putting together a movie is different than live magic tricks. Filmmakers can make up their own rules, using cuts and edits to change your perspective--not slight-of-hand--making much of it feel contrived. Personally, I wouldn't say that it bothers me. It just feels too easy here.<br/><br/>We do get a good bang four our buck with plenty of subplots. There is one about Morgan Freeman who plays a magic debunker smugly trying to crack these elaborate tricks. He has a rivalry with Michael Caine, who acts as a financier for the magicians' performances. Caine exits about an hour in, but Freeman has much left to accomplish. And amidst all the action, there is an obvious romance building between Ruffalo and Laurent.<br/><br/>But all of the story-building amongst the characters only helps to thin them all out in the process. There is little depth. And the depth that's established feels forced.<br/><br/>Mind you, none of this changes the fact that this film is wildly entertaining. How can you call it anything but? It's gripping from beginning to end, and the way it's set up, you will probably end up wanting more. Give it huge points for that. Beyond that, though, I can see why people feel slighted.<br/><br/>Twizard Rating: 84"

Great twist! My only criticism is that it could have been even better. The idea of Magicians using their skills to commit crimes could have had more mileage and maybe an even more ingenious ply along the lines of Mission Impossible ( the TV series not those awful TGom Cruise films )<br/><br/>However I enjoyed the film and would even watch it again."

Actors fit very well into their roles.<br/><br/>I loved the vibe of the movie. Fast paced, interesting, funny, entertaining. <br/><br/>I loved the INTRIGUE this movie makes. It keeps you on your toes!<br/><br/>I loved the MAIN IDEA and how it was used on a smaller and bigger scale of the movie: Main idea = Magician's tricks use ""DISTRACTIONS!"" to perform the real trick.<br/><br/>""YOU ARE LOOKING TOO CLOSELY"" to catch it..<br/><br/>What I love about this idea is, that I am certain at the end THEY FOOLED US ALL! They fooled us with exactly the idea they planted in the movie! With the idea that they have been telling us they are actually doing and going to do! INGENIOUS! We focused on the movie we focused on the distractions (oh is Freeman actually the guy behind it all, or maybe the assistant cop..!?) <br/><br/>And that takes us directly to the NEGATIVES of the movie, because weirdly enough this DISTRACTION thing is also where the movie is the most UNDERDEVELOPED!!!<br/><br/>****NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>You can not make such a TWIST at the end and not account for it! YOU HAVE GOT TO EXPLAIN! Use the look-backs, flashbacks, explanations.. that would account for the twist we just witnessed! <br/><br/>You have got to make us go WOOOOW , so that is what was really going on!! It was kinda done in a way, but it wasn't enough! Not even close.<br/><br/>The ending really takes away from the movie's quality. Because yes, it would be way harder to make a movie that could explain itself in the end whilst still keeping us fooled right till that point. But that is what you GOT TO DO! <br/><br/>This was more like watching the Matrix and at the end finding out Morpheus was the bad guy all along. WHAT?!?!<br/><br/>OK it wasn't that bad, but it wasn't like Prestige, Fight Club, Memento, or any other great movie either.<br/><br/>**** CONCLUSION ****<br/><br/>Still a lot of positives!! <br/><br/>And 7 is actually a pretty good grade in my books.

"perkypops","6","1","1","24 July 2014"," Enjoyable in parts but somewhat overrated
","There is entertainment and action in abundance in this colourful, glossy and, at times, highly enjoyable, film centred on the world of illusion, deception, and the magician. And, at times, we appear to be treated to explanations as to how tricks were done, but sadly, in doing so, many important pieces of the descriptions were simply ignored because they were inexplicable. It kind of takes the biscuit when you explain the easy and, perhaps, most dramatic parts of trickery but fail on the subtleties where the real tricks occur. But the context of the film is how trickery can be used to fool us all via the many diversions the film uses along the way.<br/><br/>Of course you have to suspend reality watching this film or it can get a little tiresome, which is probably why I found it enjoyable but only in parts. It is a good twenty minutes too long and kind of waffles it way through the final five minutes or so. The actors seem like they're having a good time and the sets are fabulous. But the whole seems to add up to something a little less than satisfactory.<br/><br/>Six out of ten."

","A bad film. I had high hopes for 'Now You see me', as it had an all-star cast and the great theme of magic. The opening scene made me believe I was indeed about to see a great movie. Alas, about 20 minutes in...I asked myself 'do they ACTUALLY still make this kind of movie?'. There were 45 minutes to go and I was struggling to finish...I did it just for the sake of it. What I disliked most: The scenes involving money, and when the audience goes crazy about money. Also I read on another comment someone mentioning the movie is 'left-wing', indeed, are we supposed to cheer on as the four magicians rob the man of his 14 million or so? The character played by Mark Ruffalo. He didn't really suit this character... and the revelation at the end... one of the most laughable and cringe worthy moments. The character of Melanie Laurent. Are the film makers trying to make her into a 'cute/blonde/French character' or something? She's a bit of a space filler. And in the end an opportunity to add a romance element to the film. The kiss with Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo).. please... really? Throughout the film there is almost no depth of any of the main characters.. let alone a romance between these two. It was such a cliché thing to do. This film was plain bad and completely lacking in personality. A real waste of time. It seems really good in the beginning and gets your hopes up but in fact you do feel insulted watching it. No continuity, the film pick and mixes from various genres, no depth in character. Just an empty shell of a movie. A shame because the actors are good and acting itself isn't bad at all."

So 'Now You See Me' was a movie that I wanted to see from the first time I seen the trailer. Not only is it a high class heist film, but it also is starring Jesse Eisenberg (Who reallllly impressed me in the Social Network), Morgan Freeman, and Mark Ruffalo. Needless to say the star power is there. With that said, it's an entertaining movie, however I was extremely disappointed.<br/><br/>OK honestly there is more character development in the trailer of World War Z than there is in this movie! You gain ABSOLUTELY NO connection to any of the characters. I mean in the first 4 minutes of Superman there is more character development than there is in this whole movie. (Oh yeah superman review coming shortly after this one.)<br/><br/>The story was OK, they didn't go deep enough into the actual motive. The tricks were cool, actually I am convinced Jesse Eisenbergs opening number was a real trick, because I even picked the same number that shows up on the tower. The story took the easy way out at the end, and makes the whole movie feel somewhat pointless, and the journey to the end wasn't very fun because the lack of connection, or feel of motive.<br/><br/>Overall<br/><br/>As A Heist Movie 1/5....This is a tough category for me because of other heist movies, and this one DEFINITELY lacked.<br/><br/>Entertainment 3/5 It was entertaining, It was bearable.

"dfranzen70","9","5","12","2 June 2013"," Now you should see it again - what did you miss?
","Don't overthink it. That's my first advice to those who watch Now You See Me, an otherwise-terrific psychological thriller with a magical theme, in at least one sense of the word. The movie relies on the staple of the magician's act, the sleight of hand, as it repeatedly tells its audience that the closer one looks, the less likely they are to discover the secret. It's an axiom that can be applied to the movie as well. It's fast moving, competently acted, and contains genuine twists - especially the last one, which is a doozy.<br/><br/>Our story begins with the solo acts of four magicians: the mentalist Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), the showman Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), the spoon-bender Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), and the stunt specialist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher). After each concludes a performance, he or she finds a Tarot card directing them to a particular apartment building in New York. Behind that door, the fun begins.<br/><br/>Some time later, the four - christened The Four Horsemen - perform a most unusual act in Las Vegas. Using a volunteer from the audience, they somehow manage to rob a bank in France. Ridiculous? Yes, of course it is - but there you are, nonetheless. The money is missing. What's more, it suddenly rains money into the crowd. Crowd goes wild. This, of course, gains the attention of not only the FBI, in the person of Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) but also Interpol, in the person of Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). How in the world did the money get from Paris to Vegas? Oh, this is only the beginning.<br/><br/>Next up is New Orleans. This time, McKinney plays a fun little trick on the group's benefactor, Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine); he has everyone in the audience write down the amount that's presently in their bank account. Then he has the audience look at the number using a flashlight from under the seats. Meanwhile, the group brings out a giant check that lists Tressler's bank holdings. As time passes, the amount on Tressler's check declines, while those of audience members increase. How is this possible?<br/><br/>Each time the FBI and Interpol think they've grabbed an ankle of the magicians, they've grabbed nothing more than thin air. Atlas and company are at least three steps ahead of everyone. But why? What is really behind all of this? What's the endgame?<br/><br/>The key - and this is not a spoiler by any measure - is to bear this in mind: watch everything, but not too closely. There are clues everywhere. And when all is said and done, the last trick complete, the final twist may well shock you into silence. And I sort of like that. I love a movie that can pirouette from one direction to the next, a bit of sleight-of- hand, if you will, with the new direction just as plausible as the first. Misdirection is all afoot in this caper. It's all about what you look at but can't see.<br/><br/>Now You See Me was cowritten by Boaz Yakin. Don't know the name? Well, he also wrote such luminous films as Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights, Prince of Persia, Safe, and From Dusk Till Dawn 2. Not quite the pedigree you'd expect for this quality film. Maybe it's the artful direction of Louis Leterrier, who helmed the first two Transporter films and the Clash of the Titans remake. Not a lot of pizazz in that list, is there? Still, somehow, it works. Everything seems to click. The cast has great chemistry, and the performances are (mostly) nuanced just enough to stay out of the path of a gripping script. Eisenberg's Daniel is essentially the same as Eisenberg's MarK Zuckerberg - smug, cocky, supersmart. Harrelson's Merrit is condescending, a has-been with little going for him. Fisher's Henley, though underdeveloped, adds needed estrogen to the quartet - with the undercurrent of having worked with Daniel as his assistant. And Dave Franco - yes, Dave - is good as the youngest of the bunch; Franco is basically a clone of his older brother James, who I swore up and down this was. Huh. Ruffalo, Laurent, Common, Caine, and Morgan Freeman (as a professional debunker of magicians) round out the cast.<br/><br/>One final note about this. Even after the all the magic, the heists, the twists, and the reveals, the very ending is ambiguous. It's like watching someone walk through a doorway without letting you see what's ahead; something has happened, something beyond the powers and will and even imagination of the magicians: something wonderful."

Boaz Yakin Edward Ricourt have written a phenomenal story that is among one of the greatest films I have seen. It is definitely worth watching! It's great for the whole family."
"stuartcork7","10","4","9","6 July 2013"," Thank you for not being a Hollywood ""lowest common denominator"" flick
","For those movie critics who did not like this film I can only assume that they were looking for a typical blockbuster film servicing the lowest common denominator. Namely graphic sex, physically impossible action scenes and just for shocks violence.<br/><br/>Well I do not think it is a spoiler to say that this film has none of those.<br/><br/>This film is directed with sensibility and intelligence. The actors play the characters with believable sentiment. And the script does not treat the audience like idiots- constantly spoon feeding exposition.<br/><br/>All of this comes together in a way which endears the viewer to the characters, you don't pity them and you don't fear them- they are just people you might call friends if they existed in the real world.<br/><br/>The direction is crisp and keeps the story flowing, the cgi is both believable and awe inspiring at the same time. Allowing for the belief that you could be watching a real magic show.<br/><br/>If I was to pigeon hole this film to recommend it to a friend then I would say- think of a movie inspired by 'The Hustle' (BBC television series), but with the following characters- David Copperfield (Illusionist); Derren Brown (Mentalist); Houdini (Escape artist) and Dynamo (Magician).<br/><br/>Separately these are five big draws for my tastes, but bring them together and you have something special.<br/><br/>So ignore the critics and trust your own fancies."

","I love this movie! Kept me interested the whole time. Some said the twist at the end was bad, but it was actually pretty nice, I liked it, it was not ""predictable"". The beginning when the four street magicians were introduced one by one as they did their tricks nicely hooked me in. I was continuously intrigued by each of the shows these ""Four Horsemen"" performed. And Morgan Freeman coming out from time to time definitely made the movie even more funny. The police pursuing the Four Horsemen was thrilling yet humorous. Then a surprising twist along with a little touch of romance perfectly ended this movie. People who did not like this movie probably did not even understand what happened. If you don't get it, just watch it again. It's a great movie."

","its an awesome movie, you walk out of the theater and try to learn the tricks that are done in there, has suspense and is exciting,has a element of surprise, you should watch it at least once or you shall die. I love magic, and films about magic, like 'Houdini,' 'The Prestige' and 'The Illusionist.' This is a film about magic. Although it is pretty high tech, a lot of the magic tricks in it are very traditional, based on trickery and misdirection. While it runs a little long, the fine acting by the outstanding cast and the high production values make this an entertaining trip. The brilliant heist caper and the fascinating realm of illusion blend flawlessly in the summer's most intelligent film.."

Sure, the tricks are spectacular, but there is an underlying storyline that provides for a complete movie, not just a collection of flashy moments.<br/><br/>if you enjoyed The Prestige and Oceans 11, then this has the best of both and will be one for you.<br/><br/>See it now before too many people spoil the plot for you and you might just get to the end without guessing every twist."

","All in all, it was very very sad.
Pros:
it was watchable. it had an ok pace, ok music, ok acting, and was interesting enough to keep me watch till the end
Cons:
Fisrt of all we dont get to know the characters at all. The movie fails to cutivate any kind of empathy towards their main characters.
Backstories are mostly non existent, dialogue is bland and consists mostly of pointless threats, cliche ironic comments, and friendly insults which are totally awkward since we never get to see the group actually bond.
The plot, especially anything concerning the actual magic/tricks, was completely inconsistent and full of holes and was the mst dissappointing part in my opinion.
The movie promises magic and tricks and crime and instead we get to see the Hulk be sad and whine for 2 hours.
And the ""plot twist"" is so poorly executed and unecessary.<br/><br/>Dont waste your time here. Go watch something worth your time."

","Against my better judgment (what with such a bad title), I saw a cheap showing of this movie, and woe is me for not heeding my gut-feeling - it was a complete waste of my time. Directed (atrociously) by Louis Leterrier, ""Now You See Me"" is the worst movie I've seen in theater since ""Australia"". It is has no characterizations, a vapid and ridiculous story, and video-game editing and content. There is so much babbling and incoherence from scene-to-scene, you keep having the feeling as if you've just walked in on a movie in the middle of the movie the WHOLE MOVIE. Most of the ""magic-show"" scenes are like watching bad television reality shows. Dialog is juvenile as is the supposed romances. You could care less about any and all of the characters. This is a steaming turd of a movie - so far the worst of 2013. I wish I had rent it to be able to have turned it off early-on. 2.5/10"

","This movie is not bad, but not epic. Upon viewing the previews, I just knew this film would cast a web of deception on it's viewer eyes and keep you guessing from beginning to end. Sadly- I just wanted to know how it would end. The visuals were cool, the breakdown of tricks were good, the police chasing was good- but there was just something missing. Perhaps it lacked character relations. There was no in dept story behind the characters, nor was there a clear cut idea of why they were doing what they were doing. It just seemed like a lot of fast pace needless action. The big twist was forgettable and the ending was just, ""eh"". I would matinée this film or wait for video. The title was stronger than the film. Sorry."
"JohnRayPeterson","8","4","10","11 September 2013"," Spectacular! How can you NOT love it.
","No one can deny Louis Leterrier's knack for exciting audiences and his flair for blending smart screenplay with dialogue to fit, but it's his way of delivering spectacular images onto the big screen that has made me a fan. He did it again here and is even about to follow through with a sequel currently in development. With the cast that includes Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, the lesser known Dave Franco, Isla Fisher and, one who is not less known to me certainly, Mélanie Laurent whose two performances in 2009 movies 'The Concert' and 'Inglorious Basterds' have made me pay attention, the film 'Now You See Me' was bound to deliver top notch performances for the characters they played, and it does.<br/><br/>I was happily surprised that both Freeman and Caine were made the victims of the group of illusionists calling themselves 'The Four Horsmen'; I bet the audience did not expect them both to have such a fate. Eisenberg, Harrelson, Franco and Fisher play the members of that group, characters who are all very good performers in their own right, they are selected by an unknown master wizard to join the elite membership of 'The EYE' and complete a mission, neither of which, wizard or mission are divulged before it's time; so you will enjoy plenty of twists and turns.<br/><br/>Not since the two 2006 magic motif movies, Chris Nolan's 'The Prestige', which also featured Michael Caine and Neil Burger's 'The Illusionist', had I relished watching the spectacle of illusion on the big screen. I loved the lines/quotes delivered by Eisenberg and Harrelson the most. For example, when Woody says to Isla Fisher, ""...if I stay out of your head, I'm never gonna get into your pants."". Harrelson's role is that of a mentalist/hypnotist. Ruffalo and Laurent, who has a subtle allure, are likely going to be featured prominently in the sequel, given the romance seed planted in this movie.<br/><br/>The movie has plenty of fast paced action, slower scenes that highlight terrific dialogue and of course a mystery that will leave you pondering until the end. This movie is the most fun you'll have in a dark room with all your clothes on. Have I convinced you?"

I have said before that expectations have a huge impact on how much you enjoy a movie. If you have high expectations you are usually disappointed and vice versa. This is a rare exception where I had high expectations going in and still really enjoyed this. The movie has all the fun of an Ocean's movie with the writing of a movie like the Prestige. While this is pretty much a heist movie it has an original twist on the genre and the movie sucks you in right away and keeps you watching right up until the end, which seems to come too soon. The cast is perfect and the movie is very entertaining. I highly recommend this and it is one of the best I have seen this year.

"ferguson-6","5","4","10","2 June 2013"," The Closer You Look ...
","Greetings again from the darkness. Come on ... who wouldn't get excited about a movie that mixes magic with the heist genre, and fills the cast with stars old and new? Director Louis Leterrier (The Transporter) is clearly engaged with the material, and maybe his vision of ""just one more twist"" is what keeps it from reaching the next level.<br/><br/>Magic is inherently a very difficult subject for movies. Why? Because with magic, human nature is such that we are always trying to ""catch"" the sleight of hand. With movies, we have come to accept the fact that any special effect is possible. We rarely ask ""how"". That kind of takes away the mystery, eh? Maybe the best magic movie to date is The Prestige, but even that movie was made stronger by the story of its characters ... something this latest lacks.<br/><br/>Heist movies, on the other hand, have historically produced some of the most fun and thrilling times on screen. Everyone loves a clever caper ... so long as we aren't on the wrong end. What doesn't work in either genre, and especially when they are blended, is a story that defies logic. We don't mind being tricked. In fact, it's kind of fun getting to the end and realizing you are part of the ""gotcha"". What we don't like is being cheated.<br/><br/>The premise is terrific. An unknown benefactor secretly assembles The Four Horsemen - a hand-picked (by a hoodie dude) group consisting of Jessie Eisenberg, the smug super-illusionist; Woody Harrelson, the wise-cracking mentalist; tart escape artist (think Houdini with piranha) Isla Fisher; and street-hustler pickpocket (Artful Dodger type) Dave Franco. The group is bank rolled by industrial tycoon Michael Caine, and is soon enough headlining a giant Las Vegas extravaganza. Their trick is to rob a French bank vault by transporting an audience member, video streaming the job, and showering the audience with the stolen cash. They do this under the watchful eye of magic naysayer Morgan Freeman, a huckster who earns a buck exposing the tricks of magicians.<br/><br/>Soon enough, an FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) are working together trying to stop the next job, which Morgan Freeman has warned them is really a set-up for a huge finale. The movie has some really fun moments, but with all of Morgan Freeman's warnings that we (and Ruffalo) are always a step behind, we can't help but think ahead ... and there is only one super twist that makes all of this click.<br/><br/>In fact, I would argue that there are too many twists here. The basic story was enough and would have benefited from us getting to know the main characters. Instead, they are merely chess pieces who spout one-liners in order. In particular, the characters of Woody Harrelson and Melanie Laurent could have gone much deeper. But that clashes with what the filmmakers were after ... big, fast, wild, glitzy, cute, clever, and twisty. So don't be tricked into thinking. Turn off your brain and take in the wild, twisty ride ... even if it does defy logic, and we know ""it's all part of the show""."

","This tells you how unsatisfying an experience watching this film last night turned out to be: About halfway through I'd figured out who the 'mastermind' might be. But at the end, when it was confirmed, I felt no sense of elation at all. Compared to, say, with The Usual Suspects, when I figured out who Kaiser Soze had to be and it was revealed, I was absolutely euphoric in the theatre. I excitedly nudged the person I was with and said, ""I knew it!!!"" It didn't work with Now You See Me because it had no weight; it was totally unearned.<br/><br/>Movies about magicians have to have some semblance of believability at the core; I'm thinking of The Illusionist and The Prestige, for example - both brilliantly realized films that manage to walk the tightrope between wonderment and plausibility. This piece of garbage takes the opposite route: it insults its audience in so many ways that I couldn't even begin to mention them in a decent-sized review.<br/><br/>Can't believe they're actually doing a sequel, which I will NOT be seeing.

The magician sees a horse as well, since the spell affects him too, but he knows it's not real, and doesn't believe in it. The latecomers neither see a horse nor believe that one is there.<br/><br/>The spectators are like a person who has not yet seen emptiness directly, since they see things as self-existent and also believe that they are.<br/><br/>The magician is like a bodhisattva who has seen emptiness directly but who is not now in the direct perception of emptiness: things still appear to them to be self-existent, but they don't believe what they see. <br/><br/>The latecomers are like someone who is not a Buddha but who is in the direct perception of emptiness: things neither appear as self-existent to them, nor are they believing them at that time to be self-existent."

I really like Jesse's style of acting - fast talking, great sense of humor - and Woody is always a great supporting (or even lead) actor. Spoilers coming - The objective of the magicians' illusions were not completely altruistic, but pretty close. While Ocean's 11 was fun because of the interaction between the characters, the illusion was for profit, for themselves. The fast pace of 'Now you see me' was good at keeping you from guessing who was 'good' vs who was 'bad'. I'm pretty good at these and I didn't guess it until about 2/3rds in. And I wasn't sure. I like the energy of the characters and the way revenge was metered - which is what it was all about. It wasn't about money - it was about knocking down arrogant, egotistical know-it-alls, which - admit it - feels really good when done right. And since we can only get that satisfaction from movies (not in real life), this is a good movie to see. There's no torture like some revenge movies - this is all pretty tame stuff.

","Hi, so I just watched this movie and to be completely honest I absolutely (without cursing) loved it! It had amazing acting and a lot of cool well known people, personally I am a huge fan of Jessie Eisenberg, and I also really like Dave Franco so I was really excited to see this! The story was very well set up and had a lot of surprises and some plot twists, so if your a fan of plot twists I suggest this movie. But there was one thing that wasn't very clear (WARNING- may give away a plot twist or may be a spoiler so caution if not wanted anything spoiled.)<br/><br/>So while I was watching everything was fine and I didn't really think of this until I looked back on it and someone pointed it out to me, Dylan the main FBI agent who first had the case was Lionel Shrike's son or whatever, and he wanted to get 'revenge' on some certain people, now I only thought he wanted to get 'revenge' on Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman's character) but my dad pointed out to me that it was more than just that, it was the insurance company, the French bank, the safe company and Morgan Freeman's character. So that was the only thing that was a little unclear.<br/><br/>But besides that I loved it! It was funny, suspenseful, questioning, thought provoking, action filled, interesting movie. And I liked how it had some fiction added into it, and the special effects and animation was great, the whole ending I had my mouth open and was saying ""oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.""

","This film that begins with shots of four different people performing some sort of ""magic"", mostly on the street (one in a theater) and being brought together for some unknown purpose, winds up mostly being about two police agents (FBI and Interpol) trying to stop this foursome from stealing more millions of dollars than they did in their first heist. The chase leads from Las Vegas to New Orleans to New York and the action is non-stop.<br/><br/>We are never given any characterization to cause us to like this foursome, we know nothing of their backgrounds. This is simply an action piece where we are on a non-stop chase to try to stop their crime spree. Throughout the film, we are given whirling and spinning camera shots that can easily make some viewers feel vertigo. I didn't react that much, but was very bored with the fact that almost every scene had us spinning around the room.<br/><br/>If you think about all that happened after its over, it is impossible to find more than a tiny bit of logic or believability in the entire script. There was no need for the mastermind to bring these four people together, and no reason to think they would happily agree to become wanted fugitives, particularly since they kept giving away the millions that were stolen.<br/><br/>The magic tricks could not really happen on a stage, as shown, but are only workable through the magic of Hollywood.<br/><br/>We never have any reason to care about any of the four ""magicians"" nor their pursuers. I think the only way to leave feeling it was a good movie is to think no farther than to say, ""Wow, they had a lot going on in that one.""

","Quite a nice looking premise set up in the trailer regarding a bank robbery elsewhere done by a group of magicians. However, I found a lot of the tricks, and actions taken in the heist very foreseeable - the others were unbelievable (Meaning not realistically possible) The ending was similarly disappointing. I found the acting fine but no one seemed particularly pushed as actors. The four main magicians were pretty unlikeable, and I didn't particularly care about anyone. I don't particularly need a good guy and a bad guy defined for me - but I'd like someone I could empathise with a little. What we have are the usual heist stalwarts: cocky thieves, frustrated detectives, stupid shouty cop's bosses, and a token love interest. This film is as smug as Eisenberg's character.

"phanfinger","5","2","4","14 November 2013"," Four magicians do anything to become part of a secrete society of magicians.
","This movie was a giant middle finger to the audience. <br/><br/>Spoiler: Mark Ruffalo was behind the whole thing<br/><br/>Okay so I liked the actors, nothing wrong with them. They were funny and developed enough to make me not want to stick needles in my eyes. <br/><br/>So it starts out with introducing the four magicians and we see that their careers are going nowhere but suddenly they all get a card from this hooded figure and the cards lead to an apartment where they find plans. They join forces. It jumps forward to the future when they're doing their first show. They do magic and steal the money and Mark Ruffalo is called in with this french chick and they're like ""WTF? Let's put these people in jail"". Since they can't really charge them with anything they let them go. And Mark Ruffalo is like ""I gonna get them. Sometime. I really hate those guys. They're filled with injustice"". <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Morgan Freeman is another magician who now makes money off of telling the secretes of magicians so his job in this movie is tell the audience what just happened in case anybody is lost. <br/><br/>Sidenote: Not hard to get lost with the constant ""Here's what happened"" kind of thing. <br/><br/>Anyway there's two more shows and more frustration from Mark Ruffalo as he tries to both conquer the magicians and his feelings for the french chick (because you know, nothing says 'Good movie' better than obvious sexual tension). At one point Dave Franco's character dies and you, the audience, can totally tell that he's not dead and that it's part of their plan. <br/><br/>At the near end (after all the shows), Morgan Freeman lands himself in jail and Mark Ruffalo visits him asking him what happened. So Morgan Freeman figures it out a little and the camera panes out to reveal that Mark Ruffalo was behind the whole thing, is the son of Lionel Shrike (a magician who drowned, it doesn't matter), and planned everything except for falling in love with the french girl (which he tells her at the very end of the movie).<br/><br/>And that's when I felt like crying because it was like I was taken on an interesting journey and then shoved down a hole to be bitten by snakes. <br/><br/>Other problems with this movie: The magic. It was movie magic not stage magic. I don't know, I wanted it to be somehow believable enough for me to buy it if I was at their performances. <br/><br/>Michael Caine isn't in this movie enough and his character is boring. <br/><br/>Their plans are long and so heavily involved that you start to think what is the point of them if Mark Ruffalo was behind the whole thing. <br/><br/>So yeah, not a good movie if you want a good ending."

"callanvass","5","2","4","18 September 2013"," I found it to be pretty uninspiring. It's glossy, Hollywood nonsense in my opinion.
","How did this movie become such a big hit at the box office? It's far from horrible, but it definitely doesn't warrant the success that it got. There are magic tricks here, but I didn't feel any of it. Magic should not have such a dull aura surrounding it. Heck. Even the Incredible Burt Wonderstone was more entertaining than this movie. This movie is propelled by such an amazing cast, that one might be willing to overlook the lack of substance. I'm not one of those people. We don't know all that much about The Four Horsemen. We don't know what makes them tick, or what flaws they have. I'm more than capable of ignoring stuff like this, but it was really needed in this movie. It can throw all the flash it wants at me and it tries to do just that, but I didn't buy into it. I get the feeling they went out of there way to show the impossible instead of focusing on engaging their audience like they should have. It's just way too cute for its own good. You can only throw so many fancy escapes at me before I get bored. Am I being too harsh with it? Maybe, but with this amount of talent it should be much better than it is, and there is no excuse for it. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe in this movie is the huge twist ending. It angered me in a big way. I actually yelled ""OH, COME ON!"" out loud as soon as they revealed it. Not only does it lack logic, but it didn't make much sense. I do like twist endings. They often knock me on my ass, but this one was just needless. Other people may feel differently, but I was already unimpressed with this film. The twist ending made it worse. Jesse Eisenberg is simply OK. He's proved to be very talented in the past, but he came across as arrogant with no depth here. It's not a great performance. Mark Ruffalo delivers a very good performance. His frustration is deeply felt, and he probably gave the best performance in this movie in my opinion. Woody Harrelson is always solid no matter what he's in, but he's also a victim of circumstance. He lacks depth like the others do. Isla Fisher is sassy and great to look at, but that's about it. Dave Franco is the younger brother of James Franco, and shows plenty of potential. MÃ©lanie Laurent has her moments, and had decent chemistry with Ruffalo as his partner. Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine add class to the proceedings, but I just wish they were in a better movie. Freeman's part is a big bigger, whilst Caine's is rather inconsequential for the most part. <br/><br/>Final Thoughts: I didn't hate this movie, but I was so disappointed with it. It's typical Hollywood. After I heard what a hit it was with audiences, I was actually excited to watch it. The lack of substance is too much to ignore. A sequel has been green-lit. I just hope they put a little more effort into the sequel than they did with this one. <br/><br/>5.2/10"

","""The closer you think you are, the less you see.""<br/><br/>Oh, right, Mr. Morgan Freeman. If you say so. But seriously! Whatever the actual heck is that supposed to mean?<br/><br/>It's this type of smugness and self-arrogance of the film that makes it a bit distracting to enjoy. It thinks itself as too intelligent and smart, but in actuality is a bloated excuse to make a mediocre story around mediocre twists. Not a single character is worth remembering.<br/><br/>In short, the film is fun while you're watching it, but when you stop and think about the story, it comes up being really dumb. And that's a cleaver illusion the film creates for itself. I'll give it that."

","I wanted to like this movie. I EXPECTED to like this movie. I love caper movies, I love magic and I love the ""Robin Hood"" effect. It simply wasn't lovable. The female Interpol agent was totally useless. So much so that I can't even remember her name or almost anything she did in the movie despite having just seen it 4 hours ago. Had she been cut from the movie completely, it would have lost nothing. The 4 horsemen were a little flat - they don't really go anywhere. Since most of this movie is from the FBI point of view I guess that's to be expected. It was a real waste of a really talented cast though. Things felt a little choppy throughout as well, but I chalked that up to the nature of the movie - distraction and misdirection. On the upside, I did LIKE the movie. The tricks really carried it and made it entertaining to watch despite the flaws. Or at least, they did right up until the last 15 minutes. I don't want to provide spoilers, you can hit Wikipedia if you want to know the plot. However, be prepared for a MAJOR splash of WTF water at the end of the movie, and not in a good way. Yes, you find out the ""big reveal"" and that's okay. But then you find out the WHY behind the whole thing, and it make absolutely no sense at all. It includes facts that completely contradict earlier points of the movie, as well as random factors that come out of nowhere. And then roll credits.

","""Now You See Me"" is a brilliantly imagined plot line where a group of low-level magicians who call themselves ""The Four Horsemen"" pull off incredible heists during their own live shows, then reward the audience with the money. The crazy heists lead to a game of cat and magician with the F.B.I. It leaves a lot of space for a good story, but does it work? The cast's great chemistry, the film's one-of-a-kind plot and the tension between the feds made me think, ""Now You See Me... but am I glad I did?"" This movie will surely make you watch with wonder, weary and woe.<br/><br/>This film is a playful mystery thriller that won ""Favorite Thriller"" in the People's Choice Awards USA back in 2014. I definitely enjoyed the film but it was lacking in a lot of places. It almost seemed forced after the first heist and began to get repetitive. I also felt it was empty, flashy on the outside but just empty; it lacked character development and serious thought after the first heist. By the time we get to the final heist and the end of the film, there's just so many unanswered questions, you're thinking more about what happened in the previous scenes than what's actually happening now. This really made me<br/><br/>""The Four Horsemen'', Daniel Atlas, Henley Reeves, Meritt McKinney and Jack Wilder, each answer a summons to a mysterious location before they knew each other. One year on and they appear in Las Vegas doing a sold-out show sponsored by the rich Arthur Tressler where they rob a bank in Paris, live on stage in Las Vegas. The characters work well together but it can seem forced with them at some points (but I suppose when you rob banks, things will be stressful). The film overall needed to slow down, if you blink, you miss it. Going side by side with it not being paced the writers obviously liked leaving the audience wondering which is normally a great aspect but I'll say it again, too many questions were abandoned. Which made the film somewhat difficult to watch.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg (Daniel Atlas) has starred in many other films, such as ""Zombieland 1 & 2"" and the animated ""Rio 1 & 2"" I liked the character he portrayed and believe he and actor Woody Harrelson (Meritt McKinney) carried the film. Harrelson has also been around, appearing in movies such as ""Semi-Pro"" and yes ""Zombieland 1 & 2"" alongside Eisenberg. His character is sarcastic and witty which brought the funny element to the film. The final character I really enjoyed was ""Thaddius Bradley"" played by the famous Morgan Freeman. He was the intel for the F.B.I. but was careful not to tell too much about everyone's favourite horsemen. From what I could tell, the camera work was excellent, and it really does have to be when you're filming magic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the idea. The thought of magicians, robbing stores and causing absolute chaos worldwide is just a cool and fun idea to work with. It had me laughing and smiling but also had me intrigued and captivated. Out of the whole film though, one scene, in particular, stood out, at a show they were doing. The Horsemen were doing simple and low-level tricks until Reeves began doing acrobatic style moves inside a floating bubble, it was a really neat scene that stuck with me. By the end though, it felt unfinished, but there is a second film so that explains that feeling. Throughout the film, I definitely had ""Oceans 11"" in my head because of the similar cast and plot (not the magicians!)<br/><br/>The film would likely be enjoyed most by young adults and adults because it is the sort of thing I can imagine my grandparents complaining about throughout, so I'd steer clear of the older generation. It has been rated PG-13 due to mild sexual references and mild violence. Overall I do recommend this film but it won't be for everyone. Now You See Me? I'm glad I did."

It is not a clever use of techniques or age old illusions, it's CGI and totally unrealistic ""tricks"". This movie would have been amazing if the magic was something that the actors could actually perform, something clever, with thought and actually use of illusionism. Here, the plot is so unbelievable and unrealistic, that to me, it lost a HUGE edge and didn't realize it's potential. I know many people who loved this movie and are confused as to why I dislike it so much.

No. This film tries to be a lot more intelligent than it actually is. Like Atlas (Eisenberg) says, ""Always be the most intelligent person in the room"" or something similar, this film thinks it is being intelligent but actually it's not challenging enough. It gives too much away, isn't as unpredictable as it should be (really, you couldn't see that ending coming?) and just isn't as clever as it promises. The tricks I really wanted explaining weren't... the ones that were more obvious, were explained. The ending actually isn't a denouement, as it's been laying clues all along - and anyone who's seen a lot of films can see the ""twists"" coming a mile away. I focus on the twists and reveal because as a heist movie, the end is the big reveal. But it has more or less handed it to you on a plate already.<br/><br/>The actors were good. Morgan Freeman and Woody Harrelson stealing the show, of course, with Dave Franco doing a bang up job with some incredible physical acting, stunts and so forth. I'm afraid Jesse Eisenberg didn't convince in his character and was annoying after a while, Franco rather underutilised really. Isla Fisher was good but clearly the ""glamour"" rather than a serious character, which was a shame as she was good."

Yes, I've criticized the casting a bit, but Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt's script is very entertaining. It's fun and flashy, with surprises you'll never see coming.

","A movie about illusionists pulling of bank heists during their performances, well that could be interesting! And with such a big cast it's bound to be good right? <br/><br/>Now you see me starts with introducing four street performers (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco and Isla Fisher) doing cheap magic tricks in front of an audience to earn money. They all get summoned to an apartment in New York by someone in the form of tarot cards. After they get together we suddenly jump to Las Vagas one year later were the four of them (now called ""the Four Horsemen"") perform a big show on stage. During the show they rob a bank in Paris by randomly picking a Frenshman from the audience and 'teleporting' him to the vault of said bank. Robbing banks during magic shows draws attention from several big people, including the world famous Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who debunks magic tricks and insurance magnate Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) who sponsors them. To investigate the theft FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is given the case and is teamed up with Interpol Agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent). During questioning the four horsemen, they react incredibly arrogant and claim that they will always be two steps ahead of the FBI. Because they have no proof they have to let them go, but will Dylan with the help of Thaddeus Bradley and the lovely Alma Dray be able to stop them before they pull of more heists?<br/><br/>I have to admit I'm not the biggest fan of heist movies but with well crafted characters, exciting action and a solid plot with believable twists it's possible to make a good movie. Unfortunately, apart from some good action scenes, this heist movie falls flat very quickly. Lets start with the characters: they are all very hollow, very little background is given for the four horsemen and they act so annoyingly arrogant (for unknown reason) that I started to hate them very quickly and was hoping for a scene where they get punched in the face. There is no motivation given for their actions and they can all unbelievably easily break into banks, FBI phones, steal top secret data and what not that I assume they just have superpowers! For example, the fight scene between Dave Franco and Mark Ruffalo had me believing he was the X- Men mutant Gambit, how else could he fight like that being just a stage artist? And normally I like to see Freeman and Caine in movies but here there characters are given so little that they seemed lost and just reading there lines. I only liked Mark Ruffalo but his character was given proper motivation (catch the thieves) and he acted like it. <br/><br/>A good plot is what usually drives these movies but after the credits rolled I discovered that there simply was no plot here. No reason is given why the heists are done and there is no character development or chemistry going on. Yes there are surprises and 'big reveals' but they are so far fetched and rely on unbelievable 'one in a million' shots that I started to feel insulted. No I didn't see it coming but if you give your street artists super powers instead of using skillful misdirection in your movie, you can pull of everything and just force me to roll with it right? <br/><br/>I also think the movie was given more money then they needed with all those ridiculous special effects and over the top sound editing. The sound effects used here made it feel like your watching the Rohan army charging down on the Pelenor fields but on screen you just see two people doing a 'make the rabbit disappear in a box' trick. Was there money left over or something? Added to the super sounds is the annoying moving shots and shaky cam, it made me feel dizzy at times. I think those moving shots were used in abandon to cover up the fact that there is nothing to see in this hollow movie. <br/><br/>I really disliked this movie and felt insulted by assuming I would swallow all the ridiculous things happening on screen and not questioning anything. I think it had worked better by just saying the magicians where REAL magicians who can do as they please. Or if they said ""FOOLED YOU!"" in big letters before the credits rolled. Maybe if you don't mind lack of intelligence in a movie and just want to see some cool effects you might enjoy it. But there are a million other movies that have that so I see no reason to watch this one."

"ChristianLeFeuvre","9","0","0","23 May 2017"," A terrific caper movie
","'Now You See Me' is a great caper movie, in which mega-money heists are committed in plain sight through inexplicable circumstances to be stylishly explained later. Magic is both motive and modus operandi for a quartet of illusionists pulled together for a mysterious purpose. The main protagonists are introduced by tricks they pull. Street illusionist Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) turns that forced card into a seduction. Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) is a glib mentalist shaking down a bad husband. Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) uses sleight of hand to pick pockets. Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) specialises in grand stage illusions. Once brought together, they perform as the 'Four Horsemen' in Las Vegas with a spectacular show bankrolled by entrepreneur Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine). The illusionists become a sensation when one of their stunts leads to a French bank robbery, the loot shared with their audience half a world away. Watching with great interest is Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), who gets rich by debunking hoaxes. Tracking with great confusion is FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and Interpol cop Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent). The trail leads to breathless chases through Mardi Gras crowds, a decent car chase and twists deserving not to be spoiled, and a final reveal that lived up to the movie's tag line 'Come in close, because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you.' The dialogue is sharp, the heists clever, the effect were stunning and the plot and twists were brilliantly executed. Critics have tried to say that 'Now You See Me' is trying too hard to be another 'Ocean's Eleven' but it's not. There are similarities, it's a caper movie, the plot revolves around a huge money steal, but it's so much more, maybe nowhere near as good but it's definitely an entertaining film and well worth a watch."

","I enjoy magic shows. Penn & Teller, Magic secrets exposed, etc. And the Prestige is without a doubt one of my favorite films(top 20). I seen the trailer for this film back in 2013. Never gave it a shot, because it looked to much like a Oceans/Italian Job/Prestige all thrown in together. It was unfortunately, but hay! I enjoyed the hell out of it.<br/><br/>The plot is no different from something like your typical heist movie, comparably Oceans franchise. Throw in some magic and you got yourself a unique narrative that should be blockbuster worthy? Yes, and no. Yes, because the magic of course drives this movie. No. Because the twist to me was way to out of left field(and that's all I'll say). But me loving the Prestige so much, I have to say I can't deny this movies charm and fun. I embrace a movie that holds to true to exposing the art of magic for all it's glory.<br/><br/>The script could of been better though. The characters where not to fleshed out(especially the Daniel/Henley relationship). Woody Harrelson did a fine job again(playing the hermit/Merritt) as he always does. The only flaw of the cast would be Jack played by Dave Franco. He didn't have much screen time to deliver his dialogue, and for the most part was just there. But overall, the casting was on point.<br/><br/>I love movies about magic, and the art/science of it. It's the oldest spectacle in human entertainment.

On their tail is cliché-cop FBI agent Mark Ruffalo, dishevelled, maverick, mildly sexist, you know, the stubbly, tie-needs-straightened type, always apparently three steps behind the criminal gang and a specially assigned, equally stereotypical ice-maiden French Interpol agent whose detective instincts outshine her boorish colleague. From there it's a harum-scarum catch-as-catch-can race onto set-piece number two in New Orleans before climaxing in a predictable big-finish in New York, where all is revealed including the identity of the controlling Mr Big.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Michael Caine gets another of his blustering, needless cameos, Morgan Freeman is even more improbably cast as a TV star magician-buster trying to catch up with the group. Ruffalo blusters along gamely however, Woody Harrelson is the leery elder-statesman of the four and I liked the three other younger team-members too.<br/><br/>Of course it's all unbelievable nonsense, with a predictable car-chase, martial arts fighting and from-nowhere romance between the seemingly unmatched cops but if like me you go for out-size magic stunts and an outlandishly twisty-turny story, it will happily eat up two hours of your flight time as it did mine."

"Pjtaylor-96-138044","5","0","0","12 July 2016"," Ridiculous, clichéd and unrealistic, this action thriller is largely forgettable but occasionally enjoyable.
","In preparation for it's sequel, I decided to re-watch 'Now You See Me' for the first time since it's initial release. To be honest, it doesn't hold up and isn't a very good movie. It's alright, but nothing special. It thinks it's way smarter than it actually is; the direction is pretty bad and disorientating; the plot-twist makes no sense retroactively and is unneeded; the characters aren't developed enough and the magic (as well as the film as a whole) is so painfully fake and unrealistic. There are a couple of good scenes, but I wouldn't watch it again and the experience was largely forgettable.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of magicians who rob banks during their live stage shows, and the FBI agent tasked with bringing them down. This is a fairly interesting premise, I admit, but the movie fails to deliver on the potential of the story. The 'Four Horsemen' are initially all low-level street performers, before they are each given a tarot card by a mysterious hooded figure which leads them to discover the blueprints to a series of high-end magic tricks. All of this takes place before the opening title (which appears around thirteen minutes into the picture), setting up the rest of the plot. Unfortunately, the 'Horsemen' are largely excluded from the rest of the picture. By that I mean that, aside from a select few scenes, they are seen mainly on stage and we instead focus on the people trying to stop them. This weird perspective shift starts off slowly, but then builds to a point at which the 'Horsemen' are no longer the centre of attention and therefore no longer relatable. Since we are mostly at a distance from them, it makes it hard to care what they are doing and even harder to root for them. I think that the filmmakers were trying to instil a sense of awe, like we are literally in the audience of one of their shows, but that isn't the case. It doesn't help that their motivations are very weak, as they are simply blindly following the instructions given to them. The plot takes a few twists and turns but none of them truly amount to anything. The main twist, revealed at the end of the movie, makes absolutely no sense what-so-ever and is totally superfluous. It feels incredibly redundant, and it's no where near as clever as they think it is. It feels very unearned as there are no clues during the film - thus the reveal is impossible to predict. It is genuinely pointless and stupid, making no sense retroactively. The scenes involving the character in question all fall apart, it's completely nonsensical that they'd even be involved in the events of the plot. Their motivations are somewhat clear, though their actions are improbable and contrived, and in the end the twist tears the logic of the movie apart.<br/><br/>The direction is pretty bad here, too. I don't understand why the director (Louis Letterier) felt the need to be constantly moving the camera. He almost always spins the camera around his characters, to the point where it is nearly nauseating. It really gave me a sense of motion sickness, comparable to a Michael Bay flick, and made the film very hard to follow visually. It also cuts incredibly often, and each of these cuts feels very jarring. The average shot length must only be a couple of seconds at the most. The action scenes rely on shaky-cam and even quicker editing to make them work. Another thing that stated to annoy me was the lack of practical magic on display. Sure there are a few tricks here or there, but the majority are absolutely ludicrous. One trick involves the 'Horsemen' creating giant bubbles with their hands, with a member then diving into one - causing them to float. The picture takes liberties with the power of mentalist and hypnotism, too, often relying on suggestion and preconditioning for some tricks involving 'randomly selected' people. It also makes the FBI look pretty incompetent, as they fail to see through some ruses which would be very obvious upon closer inspection.<br/><br/>The acting here isn't terrible, though they do have to work with the material they are given. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are great as always, a scene involving the two was one of the highlights of the flick, but they are bogged down by a heavy-handed and on-the-nose screenplay - not to mention that Caine's character disappears from the movie for no real reason. Freeman's character is largely there to provide exposition, explaining to the audience how some of the 'magic' was done in brief flashbacks, though he often feels omniscient. Mark Ruffalo does what he can, bringing the best performance from any of the leads, but his character is quite unlikable and fairly clichéd. The 'Four Horsemen' (consisting of Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson and Dave Franco) are criminally underdeveloped and stereotypical. Each of them is an archetype commonly seen in film, and commonly seen in their own filmography. The first twenty to thirty minutes were awful, as the scenes were all conventional and the dialogue was tiring (it was attempting to set up a history, and several personalities, but ended up feeling quite trite.) There are a couple of entertaining chase scenes, though, and a fight-scene that is as enjoyable as it is dumb; plus, some of the middle act is actually engaging.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Now You See Me' is a ridiculous and largely forgettable film that tries to be too smart for it's own good. It's twists and turns are irrelevant and nonsensical, with the characters being stereotypical and underdeveloped. The film isn't terrible, it picks up a little in the second act and maintains a fast pace, but it isn't great either. I'd say it is alright, enjoyable enough to warrant a watch if it sounds interesting to you but nothing to intentionally seek out otherwise: 5/10"

","Big, shiny and dumb. It's also moderately entertaining. Four great magicians are chosen by a mysterious benefactor to become the Four Horsemen. Their goal: to astonish with spectacular tricks and, Robin Hood-like, rip off the criminally rich. Their first big trick involves robbing a Parisian bank from a Las Vegas stage. This puts detectives Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent on their tails, along with famous magic debunker Morgan Freeman. Very little in this film makes much sense, and I think it makes zero sense after the huge twist it ends with. It moves along so fast it's hard to care too much. Director Leterrier is a very good action director, but this isn't really an action movie. The movie's best sequence, though, is an action sequence and involves Dave Franco, one of the Horsemen, using his magic to dodge and trick the cops who are after him. The Horsemen (besides Franco there are Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher) get very little characterization and they probably have less screen time than Ruffalo, Laurent or Freeman. Michael Caine also co-stars. There's a lot of talent here and it's all wasted. Still, not a bad time waster. I saw it because I thought the trailer for the sequel looked even better. I'm not convinced by the first installment, but if reviews are good enough I may partake. I'll probably do so on video at any rate."

","In the opening scenes of this heist film we are introduced to four magicians; Danny Atlas, a street magician who entertains people with card tricks; Merritt McKinney, a hypnotist who uses his skills to blackmail people; Henley Reeves, an escapologist and Jack Wilder another street magician who uses his tricks to distract people while stealing their wallets. We see each of them perform a trick then find a tarot card; the messages on the cards bring them together in a New York apartment. Who brought them together is a mystery but one year later the four of them are putting on a show in Las Vegas under the name 'The Four Horsemen'. Here they perform an apparently impossible trick they use a member of the audience to rob a bank on the other side of the world! FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes is soon on the case alongside Alma Dray, a French Interpol agent. They are also being followed by Thaddeus Bradley, a former magician who now debunks other people's tricks. Their next trick involves emptying the bank account of their sponsor, millionaire Arthur Tressler and putting the cash into the accounts of the audience. After this they announce one more spectacular event which will take place in New York.<br/><br/>If you are looking for anything vaguely realistic then this isn't the film for you. Like many heist movies we are invited to sympathise with the criminals; not only are they likable it is made clear that the victims of their tricks a getting what they deserve. The pace is fast enough for us not to worry too much about just how implausible it really is. The cast, which includes some well-known stars, do a solid job and work well together. Like most good magic tricks this film relies on misdirection; while the viewers are concentrating on the Four Horsemen and trying to figure out how they are committing their crimes and how they will evade the authorities they won't be thinking about who is behind their operation and even if you are thinking about it suspicion is pointed at several possible characters and it obviously isn't anybody too likely. Overall I'd say that this is a fun, inoffensive heist movie that passes a couple of hours nicely."

No one seems to click with anyone else – certainly not Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent. The only charisma on display comes from the two screen legends, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman, who are really only playing variations of themselves.<br/><br/>Whenever a long car chase is included in a film as there is in this one, I often wonder if it's to give the screenwriters a rest or because the filmmakers were worried that if they didn't charge things up the audience would lose interest and start text messaging. No matter how well filmed, automotive carnage, with a few classic exceptions, tends to relegate a movie to the by-the-numbers category.<br/><br/>Despite all the hidden clues in the film, the filmmakers opted for some easy formulas and off-the-rack characterisations. Take away Merritt McKinney's quirky hat and Danny Atlas' full hairdo, and the characters seem to have about the same personality. Possibly a calmer approach would have allowed a little more depth to the characters, and made the film a worthy companion piece to ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"".<br/><br/>However, it looks like everyone gets to have another stab at it; a sequel is now in production with the same actors, but a different director.

","I had really big expectations for this movie. A number of good (if not very good) actors, a plot revolving around a series of heists, and an impressive trailer meant that I started watching it knowing that no matter what, I wouldn't leave disappointed... <br/><br/>... and I was wrong. I won't get too far into details, but this movie has many wrongs. <br/><br/>First of all, though the actors are all pretty good (I liked Zombieland and The Social Network a lot, and am usually not disappointed by Morgan Freeman), they only play themselves. Jesse Eisenberg is a stereotypical pretentious-yet-unsure genius, Melanie Laurent a Frenchwoman with secrets, Morgan Freeman is the old-wise-dog, you get the idea. This creates two problems. The first is that this make it very hard to bond with the characters, but the biggest problem is the other one: the actors never actually play together. It's like seeing several one-man-shows mixed together.<br/><br/>Then there's the plot. I promised IMDb I wouldn't include spoilers, and I won't, but let's say that in addition to chasm-sized plot holes, it appears that whenever the storyline seems stuck, we get a one-liner from an actor, dramatic music, and suddenly the plot has changed and the intrigue is back on the move. This would be disappointing if used once, and it just gets annoying when used multiple times. Probably to cover the fact that the plot is indeed not very good. <br/><br/>I can see what Leterrier was trying to achieve by giving the movie its fast pace, but this also just leaves the impression that he's actually trying to confuse us so we don't see the movie's lack of actual interest. <br/><br/>I'll give it 5/10 stars for its overall slick visuals and because it still didn't bore me enough that I wouldn't get to the -below average- ending.

I just adore Laurent, and have seen her in everything from 'Basterds' to 'Beginners' to 'Le concert' to 'Je vais bien...' to 'Paris' and she's been mesmerizing in each and every one of those roles, even where she had (relatively) limited screen-time. Then she did this. Even so, for me, she was one of the bright sparks of the whole thing.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson stands out, as always, as he re-teams with his 'Zombieland' sidekick, who's just here for the paycheck, much like Freeman, Caine and Ruffalo are. Ruffalo gets a meaty mainstream role after a while and he digs into it with glee (as does the other Franco), though he does look befuddled as well, perhaps rightfully. 'The eye' is never fully released, and IMHO, it should have occupied the bulk of the movie, not needing the 'too-pat' speedy denouement it finally receives. Fisher is miscast - 'nuff said.<br/><br/>I missed the relevance of all the plot's twists and turns during the final 20 minutes, and had almost given up on trying to catch up, until the exposition-laden final 6/7 min. Somehow, though it is usually a good thing ('Fallen', 'Frailty', 'Primal fear', 'Fight club' spring to mind), in this case, I did not really care.<br/><br/>However, this was just what the doctor ordered 'After Earth'....."

"oh_no_mrbill","5","0","0","10 March 2014"," What a gyp.
","I went into this movie honestly expecting to enjoy it. It looked like a fun thriller-heist kind of movie, with all kinds of twists and turns. Maybe it wasn't Scarface, but at least fun to watch. But roughly an hour into this movie, I realized we had left the concept of ""twists and turns"" behind long ago. In its place was a series of slaps to my face, one delivered after another, that I apparently earned for thinking I was beginning to have even an inkling of what was REALLY going on here. Black was suddenly white, then it was black again, and then it went polka-dotted, and up was sideways and then became Tuesday.<br/><br/>This movie thinks it is a hundred times more clever than it is. By giving us absolutely no information until key moments, it makes its own riddles impossible to guess. Then the movie laughs at us for trying to figure it out. The young magicians in this movie -- initially no more talented than knockoffs of David Blaine and Jonathan Edwards -- suddenly become godlike and inscrutable when chased by all the combined efforts of FBI and Interpol, who are made to look about as foolish as us, the audience. And the twist in the final twenty minutes nullifies literally EVERYTHING that came before it. <br/><br/>Throughout the whole mess, I was left grasping for a single character to sympathize with. The ""Four Horsemen"" were all arrogant, unlikable con men. Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman had some truly fantastic scenes together, but their characters were literally a corrupt insurance salesman and the taunting sprite of the screenwriter laughing at us, in that order. Mark Ruffalo was great as usual. I was fully in his corner (spoiler) until the final fifteen minutes absolutely pulled the rug out on any shred of believability for his character. His chemistry with Melanie Laurent was the only thing I could legitimately root for in the film. And of course they're given a rushed, pat ""happy ending"", presumably for some kind of closure for us, the paying audience. But we've just been punched in the face by the plot of this movie. It wanted to be Ocean's Eleven, and it was barely even Spy Kids. Five out of ten is generous."

","I came on here to find out other peoples views on a movie I couldn't quite work out. Was I missing something? <br/><br/>Firstly the casting was very good for the most part. The opening scenes showed off some really talented actors, the magicians. Jesse Eisenberg can't seem to do any wrong and is destined to greatness. Woody Harrelson, brilliant as ever, Isla Fisher pulls off a strong confident role coming a long way from 'Home and Away'.<br/><br/>I feel it was let down by it's two main actors, firstly Mark Ruffalo, he was out of his depth in the company of the magicians, coming across a little sloppy and uncomfortable. <br/><br/>Then Mélanie Laurent, the accent was the strangest French accent I've heard, I don't know why but she sounded like an American trying too hard to sound French and making a bad job of it. She is French, I know, it really annoyed me. As beautiful an actress she is, the camera shots directed at her were trying too hard. That combined with the dodgy accent was a little off-putting.<br/><br/>All the scenes were shot well, the magic was a little unbelievable at times, but that didn't matter, hey, it's the movies and it has to be entertaining. It's obvious this is a 'big picture' movie, the quality of the stunt scenes are great and you can't help but be sucked in wanting and looking forward to what happens next.<br/><br/>I don't want to be a spoiler, but the reasoning for the help from others seems unbelievable, are they happy to live on the run for the rest of their lives? And for what? It was nearly a great film and enjoyable, and shall watch it again to see if second time around it will sit even better. I feel the end production was a bit out of place, Ruffalo's epilogue storyline was too thin. To me it seemed to have very little to do with the actual movie and the quality of the performance for these scenes, Freeman included was poor. I was left feeling they rolled this out too quickly, a promising film which fails to deliver the all important end result. A shame, as for the most part, it's very good."

","The film was presented as something exciting and full of adventure. However, apart from the first part, which was promising and interesting, the movie wasn't something special. The plot seems nice enough : Four magicians are selected to become the four horsemen, who follow instructions from a source they don't know, in order to fulfill a plan. After a magic trick, where they rob a bank in France, the FBI and the Interpoll are sent to investigate them, taking advise from a former magician and current host of a show which reveals the magicians tricks. At first, the clever lines and the whole atmosphere are creating mysterious and exciting scenes that keep the interesting high. Then follow the action scenes, the chasing and the police reaction and finally the big revelation, which is not so great after all. The actors are pretty good acting as magicians, and the scenes are nice, but the plot is not supporting the movie and what it wanted to come through from the story. In the end there are many questions unanswered. All in all, a nice idea, but not a great result."

","Now you see me is a fantastic movie. Action, mystery and crime until the end.<br/><br/>The special effects were amazing, and so were the actors/actresses and their performance. The story had me intrigued throughout most of the movie. and I found that, as the movie progressed, the story line kept improving and kept expending.<br/><br/>But than, they decided to make the FBI-agent involved in all of it. This they should not have done, as the story suddenly died in seconds. It just didn't add up. Where other movies managed to give you such a amazing and overwhelming feeling at the reveal, when suddenly everything falls in place, this movie gave me a overwhelming confusion. It was as if they had finished the script and decided to merge it with another, because they felt it wasn't spectacular enough.<br/><br/>To be fair, I must say they could have gotten away with it, and it would have met a nice twist, if they hadn't focused on agent Rhodes so much throughout the movie (for instance if they used agent Fuller, they could have blew my mind). But upon choosing agent Rhodes, the whole ''serves him right'' feeling fell apart. For example, the scene where the hypnotized ''footbal'' crowd tackled Dylan Rhodes (and I was at the tip of my chair, nearly jumping from excitement), was rendered worthless, because it didn't have any purpose anymore. Besides there where a lot of scenes where agent Rhodes was furious, and incredibly stressed over the situations they were in, and suddenly i'm forced to believe this was all an act?<br/><br/>It's just a shame, and a enormous disappointment. But apart from that I still enjoyed the movie. And I must say that the incredible action sequences do compensate tremendously. It is still a amazing movie and it is definitely still worth watching. 6/10"

","I thought the plot was really interesting and I thought the acting was great, but something was just missing. I believe this movie would have been phenomenal if it was directed by someone like Christopher Nolan. One thing that was disappointing was how there were some great magic scenes that just went by too quickly. Like, when Franco's character broke that glass wall, that should have been in slow motion because that would have made the scene more intense. Also, I thought the scenes between the two cops were just too long and made parts of the film drag. <br/><br/>I could see the film being more entertaining to an average teenager but to me or an adult it was just an OK film."

"Vartiainen","Null","0","0","30 December 2013"," Tries to juggle one too many balls, but otherwise fine
","Yet another heist movie where the con artists pull of frankly speaking ridiculous games in order to further their own agenda. This particular one throws in the magician angle, and it works surprisingly well. Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco all do a great job as The Four Horsemen, the magicians in question, and I really enjoyed them. They all have a clear identity, even if Eisenberg's J. Daniel Atlas does get the most screen time, but then again every group needs a face. Would I have preferred for all them to be on the screen equally? Probably, seeing as Harrelson especially was a bit underutilized, but the movie works as it is.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo also does a really good job as the FBI detective trying to catch these four. Usually in a caper or heist movie such as this one, you can either have the despicable mark that everyone loves to see fooled, or you can have the sympathetic mark, but in that case the actor has to be charismatic enough to pull it off. Luckily Ruffalo is just that. He's angry and arrogant enough that you don't feel bad when he gets fooled, but he's also nice enough that you feel for him and don't mind following him around.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the movie is a bit crowded with unneeded side characters. And as much as it pains me to say this, Morgan Freeman is the worst offender. He's a fine actor and literally oozes charisma, but his character has little to no point being in this film. He's mainly there to spout exposition that could have easily been relocated to other characters. Mélanie Laurent has the same problem, though her character might have been bearable if it had been just her taking up precious screen time.<br/><br/>Aside from that I can say that it's an okay film. The first half, when we get introduced to the characters and the mysteries, is easily the best part of the film. All the Horsemen are given a really good introduction, the first two show scenes are phenomenal fun and it feels like it's building up to something great.<br/><br/>That something turns out to be something of a letdown and I cannot say that I enjoyed the final third or so all that much. It's passable, but when my friends and I discussed this movie afterwards, we very quickly came up with numerous ways it could have been made better. Mark of a poor film writing. It's hard to write a good ending, I know, but at least some effort should be involved.<br/><br/>Still, all in all this is a good film. It's fun to watch, the characters are enjoyable and the magic tricks are both pleasing to witness as well as imaginative. The ending isn't the greatest one possible, but it doesn't ruin the film. Give it a watch if you like heist films or stage magic.<br/><br/>One question though. Why wasn't the name of this movie The Four Horsemen?"
"Kcpjhp","6","0","0","30 October 2013"," Tricks are new, plot .....aged
","I was drawn to rent this film based upon the trailers and TV spots. I'll confess a slight aversion to the work of Mr. Eisenberg, who inexplicably annoys me. The movie also stars Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman in supporting roles.<br/><br/>My reviews will never give away significant plot twists or spoilers but you might want to know what the movie is actually about.<br/><br/>Four moderately successful (depending on your measure) street magicians are summoned by an unknown party for initiation into ""The Eye"". ""The Eye"" is an ancient secret society of magicians who ""protect real magic from those who would use it to rob, steal""....vote the wrong way...etc. In order to be accepted, you must follow instructions with blind obedience and be a pretty talented illusionist. The rest of the plot centers around a series of high profile robberies and pursuit of the magicians by the FBI and a professional ""de-bunker"" of magic (Freeman).<br/><br/>Where the film works: A very talented cast. James Franco's younger brother Dave does very well. Harrelson is great and ended up with most of the movies funniest lines. As the group's ""mentalist""/hypnotist, he is also arguably the most dangerous. Caine & Freeman could bring complexity and depth to reading ads for the 64th street Hy-vee meat counter, so you know they are always solid. Obviously the movie is going to contain some wild and exciting stunts that stretch the SOD (suspension of disbelief), but they play well. Where the film let me down a little: Since ""you've gotta put a girl in it"", Mélanie Laurent, is cast as a French Interpol agent. She is sent to America to work with the FBI. Ruffalo plays the FBI agent, but his performance is lacking in depth. ((Hmmmmmmm .... man.....woman.......I wonder what is gonna happen with that.....)) Honestly, what I disliked the most was that I was expected to root for criminals. Not a new plot line, but I didn't particularly find the justification for larceny that compelling and a number of hi-jinks they pulled in order to escape capture (in the real world) could have easily led to the harm of hundreds of innocent people. The ""sexual content"" referenced in the MPAA rating relates to a couple of brief non-explicit comments. There is profanity/vulgarity and a couple of fight scenes (very well choreographed, I must admit)<br/><br/>My wife only said ""Come on.....(side eye)"" a handful of times, so it isn't entirely preposterous. My rating : 6.5 out of 10 (a little better than average, but just ""ok"")"

","Now you see me is what I would call a ""sunday evening"" movie. It's fun and flashy enough to be entertained for a few hours but lacks more substance to be memorable. It's the kind of movie you can have fun with for 2 hours and then forget the next day.<br/><br/>With a cast of well known actors and a plot about a group of people pulling off what seem like spectacular robberies it's clearly that it is aiming to be a ""Oceans Eleven"" kind of movie, but it dosen't quite get there.<br/><br/>My main problem with this movie is that the basic idea here is that ""you think it is magic but it actually isn't"", and that would have great if they would have shown them use clever and creative tricks to fool people. But ,sadly, more often than not we see the main characters use tricks that seem too fantastic to be true, and it dosen't help that most of them are done using CG animations and special effects. All the magic they use is just taken too far to be believed, not only in the illusions but also the fact that one character seems to have super human hypnosis abilities and others can pull off crazy tricks with no preparation.<br/><br/>Movies like Oceans Eleven are more enjoyable because even though you know robbing a casino is hardly as easy as they make it look... almost all of what they do has some form of rational explanation backing it up. I don't know if you can Robb a casino making the stuff they do, but I do know that at very least that stuff can be done, and that just isn't the case with ""now you see me"" as only a handful of tricks are explained and the writers want the audience to just believe that all the CG/FX tricks going on have a rational explanation.<br/><br/>If you take what I've already said into consideration and add the fact that there is little to no character development (we hardly get to know them)and a ""shocking"" ending that feels so forced that no one will be ""shocked""... it's easy to see why this movie is nothing more than a fun and flashy flick to watch and forget the next morning.<br/><br/>I have been told that there will be sequel, and hopefully they manage to make a movie that is as clever as what they think this one was"

","This opened as a very low key movie release locally. However, I kept reading praises about it from social media, I resolved to give it a try and see for myself. I had a lot of fun watching, and I believe, so will you.<br/><br/>The fascinating premise of the film begins even before the opening credits. We meet four talented magicians who had been summoned by a mysterious hooded stranger who left them each a invitation card marked by an eye design at the backs. A year later, they were the toast of Vegas, calling themselves the Four Horsemen, staging big elaborate magic shows. One performance, they picked a Frenchman ""randomly"" from the audience to create the illusion that he had robbed a bank in Paris. Police and Interpol get involved when money really disappeared from that bank! <br/><br/>That incredibly staged heist is only the beginning of a puzzling roller coaster ride of a film that will keep you wondering to the very end. Director Louis Leterrier (whose debut was ""Transporter"" in 2002) has executed a very energetic, intelligent and most importantly, entertaining film. <br/><br/>The actors were all so eager, smart and funny in their roles. Jesse Eisenberg is believable as a control freak street illusionist. Woody Harrelson was a down-on-his-luck mentalist is outstandingly hilarious. Isla Fisher has gone a long way from her awkward debut in that Scooby Doo film. Just when you thought Dave Franco is just a minor player, he will surprise us with an exciting fight scene and car chase. And on the other side, Mark Ruffalo is just so right as the harassed police officer who always seemed to be two steps behind the magicians. Veterans Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman add their cool credibility to the mix, as they always do to any film they are associated with.<br/><br/>While it is a pity that we do not get to meet the four magicians more in depth, and some of the illusions and action stunts were too impossible (and too CG), I think we can overlook and forgive those little quibbles. Do not think too hard and over-analyze about the twists and turns this film takes you on (especially in the final minutes), just sit back and enjoy the fun ride while it lasts. It is, after all, all about magic."

","When I first saw this movie advertised on television I thought to myself, ""Is it worth it? There aren't too many magician movies that are good."" The only reason why I watched it to begin with, was that Morgan Freeman is in it. I know that's a lame excuse to watch a movie, but if you think about it, Morgan Freeman has played many magnificent roles. He was God for crying out loud in Bruce Almighty and Evan Almighty. Bruce Almighty being better of course, but the point is Morgan Freeman is a magnificent actor and he always does a great job in all the movies he makes an appearance in.<br/><br/>In Now You See Me, Morgan Freeman is different. He did do a good job, but so did all of the other actors (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco). Everyone did a magnificent job putting this movie together and I saw a lot of teamwork make this movie ""blow my mind."" Yes, I just used that saying, ""blow my mind."" There were a lot of amazing magic tricks performed like the robbing of the bank. That involved a lot of work and it was complete amazement.<br/><br/>I am not saying that this movie is amazing, but I am saying that this movie itself is a magic trick. It is to make you believe that the movie is indeed amazing because of all the amazing tricks that have been done. That is the cover of the whole movie to hide the fact that it lacked a good story line. They made you think there was something worth watching and kept you watching it with the magic tricks and the action. It did keep me interested and I did enjoy the movie because it pulled me in enough to watch all the way until the end.<br/><br/>I did read through a lot of these reviews already and many stated that the ending isn't good and that you shouldn't watch the movie because the movie ends with no real ending. That is what the movie wants you to think. If you think about it the movie title is missing part of the classic saying. It is missing a, ""now you don't."" You may wonder, ""Why am I reading this review? What are you getting at?"" I am saying, this isn't over. There is more to come. Does that mean there is going to be a sequel to this movie? Not necessarily. I sense that may be possible, but more probable of a children's television show with more adventures to come among the four great magicians.<br/><br/>Like I said before. This isn't an amazing movie, but it is amazing at the same time. I rate it 10 stars because it did blow my mind and because it showed me what real amazement is. It's not about how good of a story line or how the acting is. Well, it sometime is about the acting, but everyone did do a great job, plus there is a surprising turn on Morgan Freeman in the movie that will blow your mind also. You should always remember to watch a movie with low expectations and be honest to yourself on how good it really is."

They give away the money to the audience, making them an overnight sensation. It also thrilled me to see it, as it is refreshing to see a heist in Robin Hood style! All the magic involved in the heists is explained, with credible explanations as to how they did a seemingly impossible thing. I like this a lot, as it is easy for a film to fall victim to movie logic, i.e. it's magic and therefore it can be ridiculous and non-sensible. The constant cat and mouse game is thrilling, and the end gets even better. When a group of people seem to be two steps ahead of the game, they are in fact three steps behind. Nothing is as it appears, echoing the theme of magic.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" is a visually stunning, mind boggling, magical extravaganza. It kept me amazed and engaged throughout, and I enjoyed every second of it."
"bm2759","8","3","8","18 June 2013"," Refreshingly fun
","How refreshing it is to see a film where the child in you is brought out and bewildered. I found myself smiling from start to finish in awe of the magic and suspense.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is the magic or rather trickery that had me smiling; you don't know how they do it and a part of you thinks it is magic. But of course you know it isn't there must be a trick. Either way you have a good time regardless. I found myself agasp much in the same way someone would be if they were personally tricked by a magician.<br/><br/>It is cleverly written, humorous, and has action. What more could you ask from such a fun movie?"
"yusufmotiwala","5","3","8","11 June 2013"," Overrated movie, go with low expectations and you should be fine
","Good Plot, bad execution... <br/><br/>I went with high expectations after reading all the great reviews. In fact, movie indeed starts on a high note which further raises expectations. Unfortunately, ""Now You See Me"" fails miserably after first half and director seems to had no clue how to end this movie so he turns four smart magicians who did great in their first performance and police interrogations into four ordinary criminals that runaway after their second performance..Phew! I realized, movie was going down-south from this point and it indeed never recovered. <br/><br/>I am not saying that the movie was bad, but if you go with high expectations, you will be disappointed. It's easy to build expectations with cast like Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, one of them had literally no role. <br/><br/>Go with low expectations and keep your brain at home and probably you will enjoy it more."

It's one you have to pay Attention to so you will know what is going on and were there going to next. I'm seriously in LOVE with this movie it's freaking awesome..

I don't wanna spoil it cause I want y'all to see it for Y'all's self.I need to shut up or I'll go on and on and on about how much Im in love with it and how amazing it is."
"aldri-feb","5","3","8","9 June 2013"," Fun, but fails to amaze
","""Now You See Me"" started quite convincingly that makes audience curious of how they did that trick. Their first show at Las Vegas as The Hourseman when they rob a bank is really interesting to see and I thought this movie would be promising, complicated and mind blowing. But unfortunately after that scene, this movie becomes slow and tries to be smart for audience which is actually not. I found myself bored and exhausted watching half of the movie. There are many questions to this movie that has no answer to be explained. The trick itself is kind of impossible and not makes any sense that only could happen in a movie. In other words, audience is forced to accept that the concept of the movie is brilliant. The chemistry between characters here are also poor development, chemistry is one of the most important aspect if people want to create this kind of movie. It's too shamed, they have so many talented casts here that should be exploited. Compared with what ""Ocean's Trilogy"" had done about their casts, ""Now You See Me"" not even close with that. Overall, ""Now You See Me"" is an enjoyable movie to see and quite fun. But don't expect this movie would make any impacts like their magician predecessors did in ""The Prestige"" and ""The Illusionist"""
"Christian_Dimartino","8","3","8","4 June 2013"," It's a lot better than it could've been.
","I don't know about you, but I like a movie that can make me think. Hence, my love for Christopher Nolan movies. One of Nolan's best movies is The Prestige, which is a twisty tale about magicians. As a huge admirer of that movie, I have been anxiously awaiting the next great magician movie. The latest is Now You See Me, and it isn't great. But it is a great amount of fun. There isn't a boring second in the whole two hours, and in a summer filled with big budget blockbusters, it's nice to see something with a bigger brain.<br/><br/>The film revolves around a group of magicians called ""The Four Horsemen"" (Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco). During one of their shows, they somehow steal millions of dollars from a bank in France within the course of about ten seconds. How? Well, don't ask me. But that is a question that both the F.B.I. and Interpol are interested in. The two main agents following them are played by the wonderful Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent, two actors I really like. Michael Caine also stars as the Horseman's financier, and Morgan Freeman also shows up as a former magician determined to bring the Horsemen down.<br/><br/>Going into Now You See Me, I expected it to be either really terrible or really good. With a cast as golden as this one, I would've hoped it wouldn't go wrong. It doesn't. All of the actors are having a blast, and we are with them. This is nothing but a good time from start to finish, and it will leave you guessing until the very end. The twist is impressive, even though I'm not quite sure I fully understand the motive in it.<br/><br/>The actor that probably stands out the most is Harrelson. Here is an actor that will always have your attention no matter what he does. Harrelson is there basically for comic relief, even though most of the actors get good lines. Eisenberg's character is a good one, even though he is basically Mark Zuckerburg in magician form.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't even the best movie of the summer, so summer has been pretty good. I actually do prefer the bigger budget movies like Iron Man 3 and Star Trek Into Darkness, but this is good escapism. Don't let the critics or your feelings towards the trailer fool you. You will be pleasantly surprised. It's a lot better than it could've been. It could've been disastrous, but instead it works well on the summer line-up. Go see this, and ignore that Will Smith movie. I haven't seen it yet, but I think we can all imagine how that will turn out.<br/><br/>B+"
"zizumia","9","3","8","3 June 2013"," Just like in magic, this movie is unexpected
","Great movie. I didn't expect to like this movie just for the fact that I am not a big fan of magic. I expected a lot about this movie, which I can say led me to loving it. Like saying, it's unexpected. Most parts of the movie, as I watched it, I played in my mind trying to figure out how they did this and that. The thing that killed magic for me, is my curiosity on how magic works led me to knowing how it actually works. Now, during the movie, Thaddeus (Morgan Freeman) does give away how the tricks work, because that's what he does. And even before he explained it, I thought I knew how it was done, but I was completely wrong. There are so many schemes here and there that make you believe this and that, but it just twists stuff around, which is what makes me like this movie so much, they did an amazing job tricking you.<br/><br/>I suggest watching this, yes. It's quite well made. You may go in expecting you will figure out the magic, but then again, you could be completely wrong."

","I went into this movie not to sure of what to expect. I knew the basics of the plot and I knew I really liked the cast. Going in I really wanted to like this movie and I'm happy to say that I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I love Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg in everything I've seen them in and this movie was no exception Between them the other 2 leads a great supporting cast and a surprisingly smart and funny story this movie was a really fun ride. I really loved Mark Ruffalo in this movie especially his twist at the end. Having loved him in The Avengers I was really happy to see that he was not just the cop who could not keep up and do his job as you are made to think throughout the movie.<br/><br/>There is plenty more detail I could go into but I'm gonna keep this review short. So in short go see this movie if you think it looks cool it won't disappoint. I personally would really like to see a sequel seeing as how the ending was left open for one but given the box office numbers so far i'm not sure i see that happening but oh well <br/><br/>I give Now You See Me an 8/10"

","If you're the kind of person who is entertained by having your intelligence insulted non-stop for 115 minutes, then this is the film for you.<br/><br/>Scene after scene after scene adds further insult to injury. You can actually see the fear in the casts eyes as they realise that jumping aboard this clapped out bandwagon has been a colossally bad career move. <br/><br/>Michael Caine once famously said ""You get paid the same for a bad film as you do for a good one"", and that has always been his professional ethos so for him this is par for the course. But I can't imagine where the normally sound judgement of Mark Ruffalo and Morgan Freeman was when they signed up for this dreck.<br/><br/>The implausibilities pile up one on top of the other like the collective product of a faecal incontinent donkey and then, just as you thought you'd suffered enough, the big reveal at the end is the final cock a snook to the demoralised viewer.<br/><br/>I won't give the end away. Suffice to say that although it is intended to make the audience gasp in shock, by the time you reach this point you have already had to suspend disbelief to such an extreme you'll think that maybe Donald Trump WOULD make a good President.<br/><br/>Yes, the ending is THAT ridiculous."

I am more in the way that it needs a good storyline, that is what makes this movie so good, it has it all! I will buy this movie and watch more times.

","I like movies with magicians, as I like The prestige 2006. Michael Caine was involved in this movie as well, so I had my high expectations. This movie could not live up to them.<br/><br/>Yes the movie is entertaining, it surprises the audience from time to time. Mark Ruffalo, Harrelson and Franco were awesome. Sorry, I'm just a Harrelson fan. But Eisenberg and Fisher were way too overconfident. Due to their way of acting, I guess Eisenberg was still stuck in his Zuckerberg-character, I did not believe in there characters. That's why I could not relate to them or care what would happen to the team of illusionists. This movie just did not blow me away.<br/><br/>This movie has no deep layers like we already saw in movies like The prestige or Inception. I guess we have to wait a year if we want to see a high level movie like these two when Interstellar will come out."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","5","16 June 2013"," The most entertaining, sheer-fun movie so far this year
","Critics that jump on the bandwagon of faulting the recreation of magic in a movie as superfluous and redundant are missing the point. Every fool knows that whatever can be done in a live magic show can be replicated much more easily with a movie camera. But here, the point is not magic show, but movie-making. The magic is not the recreation of an impressive illusion, but the capturing of it on a movie screen in a most appealing way.<br/><br/>Now to a different angle. Some time ago, there was a TV show that purportedly reviewed all the secrets behind the magic trick we see. Many, professionals and general audience alike (and not without reason), regard professional magicians that review their trade secret for personal gains the most despicable of human species. This movie touches a little on this theme.<br/><br/>The keyword to this movie, however, is entertainment. On this, this movie score on several fronts. One is dialogue, in both its above-average verbal melee between the various characters and the cryptic delivery, most notably by Jesse Eisenberg who has distinguished himself in that sort of thing in ""The social network"". Another is the delivery of the movie, lavish set pieces and crisp pacing, among other things. As one prominent critic aptly puts it, this is a movie more about journey than destination. Casting is another bright spot, but I'll come to that later.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is something you have seen in many other movies – a team of different individuals being rounded up for a ""project"". In this particular case, it is four not-so-successful magicians each getting a mysterious Tarot card and converging at a mysterious meeting place, with some mild persona clashes thrown in along the way for good measure. We never get to see the mysterious individual (and this would predictably be the object of the final twist), as the scene cuts quickly to ""a year later"", when the four have become ""The four horsemen"" (nothing to do with Apocalypse, not even a hint) putting on a world-class show in Les Vegas. The show, briefly, is about teleporting a volunteer from the audience to the vault of a bank in Paris and ""funneling"" back 3 million Euros which shower on the cheering audience back in Vegas. A card signed by the volunteer somehow finds its way to the now empty vault of the bank in Paris.<br/><br/>Four more characters are introduced along the way: Michael Caine as a multi-millionaire purportedly the mentor of this show; Morgan Freeman as an ex-magician now turning against the profession with his TV show to expose their trade secret; Mark Ruffalo as a blundering FBI agent assigned, quite against his wishes, to handle this ""case""; Melanie Laurent as the French Interpol sent from Paris to ""assist"" in this case. Well, I hope it's not too presumptuous to interject at this point that things may not be what they seem.<br/><br/>I always believe in describing only the beginning of the plot and leave people to enjoy the unfolding and therefore, just two more things to mention. The ""mystery"" of the first magic act is quickly revealed to the movie audience who, however, do not have much time to ponder its credibility as the movie drags them along in a whirlwind of occurrences. It's essentially a three-act show: Les Vegas, New Orleans and New York. The other thing to mention is ""The Eye"", purportedly an ultimate elite group the membership to which every magician covets. Admission, however, is extremely difficult to earn.<br/><br/>Finally, to the casting – first the Four Horsemen. Mentioned earlier, Eisenberg puts his persona to best use as the ego-abundant, charismatic classic sledge-of-hand magician. Ever attention-commanding, Woody Harrelson is the all-wicked-looking ""mentalist"" responsible for the hypnotizing department. Radiant with sunny charm is Isla Fisher (best known of course as the ""Shopaholic"" and also recently as Myrtle Wilson in the new ""Gatsby"") as an escape artist. Lower in profile (to balance off the other three, I suppose) is Dave Franco (you may or may not remember him in ""Warm bodies"") as the designated pickpocket (locks too) of the group. These four deliver their roles splendidly.<br/><br/>Among the four ""other characters"" already mentioned, the ""Batman dual"" of Caine and Freeman you would welcome in any movie, in any role. Ruffalo, as versatile an actor as you can find today, can handle just about any role thrown at him. On Laurent, I only need to refer to my user review of ""Le concert"" (2009) which had as its summary line ""Melanie Laurent shines"" and concluding remark ""(the audience will) leave the cinema in an uplifted and happy mood, and forever in love with Melanie Laurent"".<br/><br/>To conclude, I can do no better than reiterate my summary line ""the most entertaining, sheer-fun movie so far this year""."
"elykron","8","2","5","10 June 2013"," Way better than people say.
","The movie was extremely entertaining. I have seen many reviews that were complaining about plot holes, but I have none of the ""plot holes"" that they were complaining of did not actually exist. There are some unanswered questions, but none that I thought were overly important. The ending was slightly disappointing and a few of the relationships between characters seemed a little forced, but the strengths of this movie outweigh its weaknesses. It has a fantastic plot and lots of great lines. Most of the questions I had throughout the movie were answered, or clearly intentionally unanswered to be mysterious. Some other people seem to have confused style choices of the movie with plot holes. I have no idea why so many people have been so harsh about this movie. This movie is extremely fun, and very interesting."
"tharindu-ssl","7","2","5","6 June 2013"," Exciting and well paced
","I was so excited by the trailer although I thought the trailer revealed more than it should.I had high expectations for the movie and it delivered more than I expected except for the ending.Different people will feel differently about the ending but in my opinion it was not much convincing, need to have more proof on how it happened. But apart from that, the movie had a good pace where everything is happening at quick sessions where you don't see scenes wasting time. Jesse Eisenberg was great again,I was so impressed with his arrogant character in ""The Social Network"" and he has actually inherited some of those characteristics to his character in ""Now You See Me"" too. His style of speech gives a great personality to the character he plays. In stories like this, (like Italian Job, Ocean 13) although our story leaders are robbers or con artists, we want them to win. We like them to succeed. But will NYSM story leaders win their game against the determined FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo)? What is Thaddeus Bradley's (Morgan Freeman) role behind all these? Fascinating and exciting movie ""Now You See Me"" is worth to watch as you don't know how the time pass by until it ends."

","If you're are looking for entertainment and you don't really care about the depth of the plot then this is the movie for you. The cast was really great especially Jesse Eisenberg,Woody Harrelson, Mélanie Laurent (Melanie was really sexy), Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. People who were just looking for pure action and thrill have really enjoyed this movie but those who wanted more said the plot is lacking and there was really no development in the movie. I didn't even know where the climax was. It has aerial shots that was used in big budgeted movies and you can see the modernity of the visuals used. Some parts were really corny like Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent's love affair and the time Isla Fisher went inside a big bubble and just levitated. It's not an analytic movie, I thought they were a bit trying hard if they were aiming for that. SO AGAIN, it's up to you if beauty is external or more of internal."
"dmurilloroman","8","2","5","1 June 2013"," The Closer You Look, The Less You'll Actually See
","This film surprised me not only with it's intense action scenes or the originality of the plot but by the comedy being able to co-exist with all other elements. My attention was immediately captured by the film's energetic intro which will not lose you through the entire movie. This isn't a type of flick where you really need to turn off your brain, at times it has mildly ingenious tricks which will easily please you. The main thing this film exceeds at is the way it keeps the audience guessing the conclusion/twists, it will work your brain actually tricking you in the process. The movie takes advantage of Eisenberg's usual ""smart-ass"" character, Woody Harrelson also shines, raking in most of the laughs. It truly is magical, in it's twists and action sequences. This is really like a 2 hour Las Vegas show without the Las Vegas cost. As a comedy it meets expectations as well as a thriller, it keeps you at the edge of your seat ultimately deceiving you with it's unique yet realistic twist. Overall, this is a fun summer flick that doesn't go for any cheap laughs."
"Al_The_Strange","8","2","5","2 June 2013"," ""The closer you look, the less you see.""
","Any show you go to see, whether it be magic shows or the movies, rely on dazzling and guiding the audience to a surprising and enjoyable outcome, ultimately making the audience believe that what they see is real. In Now You See Me, the principles of magic are used in this interesting premise: magicians who use their skills in deception and illusion to stage daring bank heists in front of the eyes of their audiences and the police.<br/><br/>This film is not as deep or thoughtful as other magician-themed films, like The Prestige or The Illusionist. As a heist film, however, it's phenomenally entertaining. The film sets up the cop and robbers characters with playful energy and chemistry, before breaking out the visually-impressive theatrics and action scenes. It's not big on action, but the film does move fluidly, and above all, the characters are fun to watch. I'd say it's every bit as enjoyable as a film like Ocean's 11, The Italian Job, or The Thieves.<br/><br/>Critics will likely find fault in the plot, which requires some huge suspension of disbelief to accept. Given the twists and the liberal use of magic tricks, plot holes are bound to be present. It might be especially frustrating to watch the more fantastic moments and wonder how these characters could pull off such trickery; the film does reveal the particulars of what's going on with the overall heists, but there are other moments where the film seems to assert that magic is actually happening.<br/><br/>However, there is a certain theme to the picture, stipulating that ""the closer you look, the less you see."" Indeed, if you scrutinize this plot too closely, you'll miss out on the larger experience. The film practically implores you to just sit back, take it as it is, and enjoy things as they are. If you can suspend disbelief and go with the flow, you'll find that the plot is structured in wild and unpredictable ways. There are certain things to the story that could have been explored more, but perhaps a sequel is in order. Critics would say that the characters are all unlikable, and it's hard to know who to root for: I was personally enthralled by the whole cast, and was actually rooting for the magicians, for I found them all to be lively, rounded, and surprising at times. They aren't terribly deep, but they have surprises of their own.<br/><br/>Some of the film's action scenes get a little jittery, but most of it has solid photography and editing. Acting is superb all around: everybody puts on a playful and energetic performance. Writing is not bad. This production has good-looking sets, props, costumes, and okay special effects. Music is really hip.<br/><br/>The film asserts that magic is not about understanding how tricks work, but in making audiences believe in it, and making them smile. If you're the type who wants to look closely and find something deep, artistic, or even logical about Now You See Me, then the less you'll see. I was able to accept the film's illusion, and it made me smile at times, for it is an enjoyable show. If you can accept the film's illusion, then you might find it enjoyable as well.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Very Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"
"rgkarim","Null","2","5","31 May 2013"," Magical Fun and Clever Schemes
","Abra Kadabra my friends, and like magic another weekend is upon us and another round of movies. This week I start my reviews off with a Crime/Thriller that chooses to use stage performance, illusion, and trickery to pull off the heist. That's right I'm reviewing Now You See Me, a movie that promises to be magical, just not Lord of the Rings magical. So put away your wands and spell books, and get out your deck of cards as I give my two cents on this movie.<br/><br/>Let's get right into some of my likes for. First thing has to be the clever plot/execution of this movie. Now we have seen plenty of crime movies over the last decade that use the same stale plot of a highly skilled team pulling of an impossible task of bringing a corrupt man to justice. Now you see me takes that stale plot and reconstructs into something that seems fresh and new. Instead of an elite band of mercenaries, we have four misfits who practice different tricks of the magic trade. They are pulled together by some mastermind who opens the door with a rather shady invite and a year later the adventure starts as the Four Horsemen are forged. Cue the Vegas scene, made famous in the trailer, where the audience, both fiction and real, are dazzled by an elaborate show where the eyes are fooled by the sleight of hand. Only rather than making a simple toy appear, the result is money robbed from a city bank miles away. This allows me to transition into another aspect of the movie, the design of the tricks. In this film, many things were planned out, every detail intricately laced into an adventure that is both intense and impressive. While there are some classic magic tricks done, pick a card and making rabbits disappear, there are some other acts that have more complexity to it. Although these CGI heavy stunts are a bit fake and far-fetched they still were creative enough to wow me. Even more impressive to this reviewer, was the fact that the tricks were linked to the master plan, many specifically chosen for a purpose other than entertainment, cleverness at its finest.<br/><br/>Another trend you might notice in other crime movies, is that nine times out of ten the police force are either ignorant or idiots. Well good news, they still are, but this time there is a little more ingenuity to some of their force. Led by Mark Ruffalo, the police actually learn a little from their mistakes and with a little guidance from an outside source, attempted to change their strategy. Ruffalo and company not only bring on the opposing force to the Horsemen, but also provide an opening for other characters to enter into the movie, often to explain how the tricks work. You heard me right, the magicians' secrets are revealed in this movie, but done so to help tie together the loose ends left behind after the excitement has passed. How could this explanation get any better? Simple bring on Morgan Freeman, an actor whose voice and talent bring the retired magician bent on deciphering secrets to life. Like many of his roles, this character has humor, wits, and a little input into helping with some of the shallow character development. With this in mind, if you don't want to find out how the connections fit you need to either leave the theater at points in the movie, or avoid seeing it altogether. Bottom line the movie is connected and all the characters are involved in some form or manner. <br/><br/>So with a bunch of characters you may wonder how the acting is in this movie. In a nutshell most of the actors are playing the same roles we've seen in other films. Jesse Eisenberg still plays the arrogant jerk, who is incredibly clever and gifted, and insults everyone else. For some reason though, I do like his character in this movie, as the attitude goes with the theme of the movie. Isla Fisher is still bubbly, but this time she isn't some shallow air head who only cares about sex and shopping. Ruffalo does a good job as well, acting as an integral cog for most of the movie. Similar to what we saw in Avengers, Ruffalo has quirky one liners, a smart ass attitude, but still retains a serious demeanor that rounds the character out. My favorite actor of the night though is Woody Harrelson, who has all the qualities from the Hunger games, minus the drinking and add some running. Overall there are really no surprises when it comes to acting, I enjoyed all of them and I am sure you will find someone to latch onto in this movie. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely a fun summer movie with creativity bursting at every seam. Yes the plot is fairly predictable, and I do agree the plot is a bit old. Yet this movie has many good things about it that makes it worthy of taking a trip to the theater. It is exciting, with a plethora of chase scenes and fight scenes to keep the pace going. Although some of the mystery is ruined by Freeman's deductive reasoning, there are still some underlying secrets that keep you intrigued into the movie, like who the mastermind is and what are the motives for pulling off the pranks. Yes there is a bit of cheesiness in the plot, and some of the stunts they pull are again a bit far-fetched that some people may roll their eyes, but for those who like a lot of imagination and clever execution, this movie is for you. So what do I give this movie? My scores are Crime/Thriller 8.0 Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5"

Eisenberg was, of course, given a snarky, arrogant personality with witty lines and the magic tricks to back it up. I felt that Ruffalo was taking to much time away from the amazing magicians, but he also did a good job. The only downside is that Dave Franco had almost no speaking lines and little screen time. All in all, the film was excellent and full of FUN."
"Coneydogg","Null","3","10","5 June 2013"," A genuine disappointment any way you cut it.
","Yes, a genuine disappointment any way you cut it. There's nothing clever or even very fun on display in this movie. You spend 95% of the film wondering why an actor as great as Mark Ruffalo agreed to play the dumbest cop/federal agent ever put to film. When you get the answer, it validates the film's own shallow stupidity. What a waste of a great cast. Morgan Freeman is useless and absolutely wasted in this effort as is Woody Harrelson. None of the Four Horsemen magicians are fleshed out at all and the narrative shifts suddenly between Ruffalo's character and brief peeks in to the actions of the four magicians. It just doesn't work at all as a compelling story."
"Kernimal","6","3","10","5 June 2013"," Definitely wasn't what i was expecting
","The most I can say about Now You See Me is that it was okay. I don't think that it was spectacular like many critics are saying. Now don't get me wrong, this movie had one of the most interesting ideas I've seen in a while. The idea of magicians using their act as a front to rob banks and give some money back to the little guy was what drew me into this movie in the first place. But once you're sitting there watching its just kinda like ""eh"". I don't mean to sound snobby, I just think that maybe the movie talked itself up to much and it suffered because of it. For one thing the movie moves really fast for itself. By this i mean that once the horseman acquire their act in Vegas and Mark Ruffalo is called in to catch them after the bank robbery it just feels like i'm already in the middle of the movie. As the movie progresses it eventually catches up with itself, but regrettably this made it hard to watch. Also i felt like the protagonists didn't get enough screen time, I get that if we saw too much of the 4 horsemen it would have given away the secrets to their tricks and such thus sort of ruining the twists at the end but i felt like they could have given them a few more scenes that didn't exactly inform the plot but kind of provided some fan service. I think the thing that baffled me the most though was how supernatural the film got. I was expecting the usual magician tricks or y'know things that seemed a bit believable. But after the scene with the curtains and Isla Fisher floating in a giant bubble, all preconceived notions of reality sort of went out the window. So in conclusion i give ""Now You See Me"" a 6-10 it was so-so."

","""Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see"" - while the makers of this movie have been pushing this message ever since the trailers came out, even after walking out of the theater, it has been hard for me to figure out what kind of a movie this is - no matter how closer (or farther) I look at the issue!<br/><br/>Alright, this is a movie about magicians (who call themselves The Four Horsemen, no biblical reference intended). But, is this a movie about magicians performing magic? Please stop thinking on the lines of Nolan's ""The Prestige"". It is hard to look at the movie from this ""magic"" perspective because magic does not form the essential crux of the story. Well, there is magic throughout the story, some of which well explained and some of which totally bizarre and unexplained, but the magic is simply not the central theme of the story. Of course, towards the end of the movie, people disappear in carousels, and re-appear in France; however, a simple climax twist not-so-well connected to the movie proceedings does not do enough justice to the infinite number of unexplained magic tricks throughout the movie. It would have been amazing had some of the mind blowing tricks been explained; the only plausible answer to the question: ""Why were these tricks not explained"" is that the story is simply not related to those magic tricks. Is this a heist movie? It started looking like one initially; though there is some stealing involved, it did not feel like one at the end. Wait, is this simple, plain revenge? Ah, the final minute of the movie conveys this idea, but at that moment, the viewers can definitely figure out the answer to the million dollar question: ""What type of a movie this is?!"", with the answer being: ""Who cares!""<br/><br/>""Now you see me"" is a perfect example of taking a good story, getting an amazing cast to work for you, but spoiling the fun for the audience with some poor screenplay writing and direction. For most part of the film, the story does not seem to head to any particular direction or with destination in mind at all. The magicians are supposed to perform three acts - first in Las Vegas, second in New Orleans, and third in New York City - and each act is supposed to top the previous one. While the first act sets up the stage for the movie, the second act creates so much excitement for the audience. Unfortunately, the final act along with some preceding and succeeding scenes is mostly responsible for the letting the entire movie, and hence the viewers, down!<br/><br/>It is easily possible to write pages after pages praising for the entire cast, and they actually deserve it. Be it Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco who star as the Four Horsemen, Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent as the policemen who try to catch up with the magicians' tricks, Michael Caine (who, I thought, did not have much to do!) or Morgan Freeman, all of them have performed extremely well. Halfway into the movie, I started thinking whether Mark Ruffalo or Jesse Eisenberg was the main character, especially since Eisenberg appeared so sparingly after the first fifteen minutes of the movie, and it was a full Mark Ruffalo show from thereon. However, what was supposed to be a cat and mouse game between them did not create sufficient tension to captivate the viewer.<br/><br/>The real problem lies with the script and direction. Though the first half of the movie sets up the stage well, it drags between the first and second act, and right immediately after the second act as well. Good writing should have upped the ante after the second act, but the movie sets off as a torn kite without a clear direction. May be that's why when the final twist - which is supposed the awe the audience - appears, the viewer is already frustrated with the one million unresolved plot holes, and hence, the reaction to the twist is: ""Oh, OK! The movie is over, let's get out of the theater!"" Worse, if somebody were to try to make some sense out of it, there are a million questions about the story, particularly regarding the fifth horseman whom Mark Ruffalo has been searching for throughout the movie - very contrived, the entire episode looked.<br/><br/>In all truth, I liked the overall story and in parts, the movie was fun. Even the climax twist was not a let down, only the events that culminated in it were! If alone, they concentrated some more on those plot holes, if alone they had a more taut script to tie down the viewers, if alone the movie had a clear destination instead of the dumb third magic act, if alone Louis Leterrier and co. had steered the ship better, the film would have turned out to be an amazing heist-cum- revenge-cum-magic movie! Unfortunately now, the movie is none of the three!<br/><br/>What I saw:<br/><br/>Direction: 3.0/5 Writing: 2.5/5 Acting: 3.5/5 Music: 3.0/5 Cinematography: 3.5/5<br/><br/>What I felt:<br/><br/>Degree of Tautness: 2.5/5 Emotional Quotient: 2.5/5 Intelligence Quotient: 3.0/5 Entertainment Quotient: 3.5/5"

The elements of screen writing, directing, cinematography, and special effects came together in a flawless union that was carried out by irreprehensible performances from the cast. Humorous, quick-witted, and as delightfully entertaining as a Las Vegas magic show, Now You See Me clicks along at a thrill ride pace that is sure to please.

","This was one of the best mind benders since The Usual Suspects. Four magicians brought together to pull off one of the biggest heists in history using what else - - magic. Yet to make it work, they each needed to work together as a whole to make the illusions happen. Armed with various tools of the trade including technological they begin to mesmerize the audience with their craft. In the middle is an FBI agent along with a french girl from Interpol. Now the case becomes more complex when a dubious, yet audacious ex-magician is put in the melting pot (Morgan Freeman) to help debunk each trick the team dreams up and pulls off.<br/><br/>With the first trick that has a man from France in the audience in Vegas no less, was to partake in one heist. And that is to rob the french bank of Paris. Pulling off that stunt was sheer genius. I like the fact that although the FBI were involved, I never dreamt that our FBI agent himself, Dylan (Mark Ruffalo), was the son of a famous illusionist who died earlier in his career pulling off a dangerous stunt.<br/><br/>The complex scenes of each robbery, the ways the team used the environment to make causes and effects was enough to blow me away. If anything, whoever thought up this movie was on the ball. A great story, some villains (Freeman, Caine) to show us how bad they really were in in front of the public. Meaning how they used the public's confidence to having each one believe that magic is not real. Plus the fact how the story meshed into itself from directions of the compass.<br/><br/>I really liked Caine's role though. Having been exposed as the man behind the insurance fraud which made a lot of people destitute from Hurricane Katrina. Used in the act by none other than his team of magicians to show the audience the real culprit against him. <br/><br/>I have to give this movie ten stars, I absolutely enjoyed this film. Highly recommended to those over 14."

"jan_kalina","8","2","6","30 August 2013"," ""First rule of magic: always be the smartest person in the room.""
","Louis Leterrier is a very smart director. Since my first encounter with Leterrier's work (Transporter 2) I was looking forward to his upcoming projects. Clash of the Titans was a well made summer blockbuster with one condition: you have to tun your brain off before watching it. It got a lot of hate but the problem wasn't with the director. Then came his best movie yet and that is the kick-ass The Incredible Hulk. A film with great characters and great action scenes. But after these movies Louis Leterrier had a problem: he was typecast in Hollywood as an action director. When he showed interest in making Now you see me, the studio didn't want to let him direct this movie since they were afraid he wouldn't handle the characters well. No one thought that he could tell stories. But Leterrier proved them wrong once again. Now You See Me is a great very fast paced heist movie where the crew pulling off the heist consists of magicians. There is plenty of action, magic and the camera has no time to stay in one place. That is probably my favorite aspect about this film the camera work. There is no shaky cam in this film despite that being Hollywood's biggest trend in movies. Yet still the camera is never static, it is always moving. Circling around the characters,spinning or zooming in and out.<br/><br/>The cast assembled in Now Yoou See Me is truly marvelous. Jesse Eissenebrg who has two on screen personas - the shy stuttering neurotic or the cocky and arrogant smart ass. Here he plays the second one. And well he is pretty good at it. Woody Harrelson is always a fun addition in any movie. Mark Ruffalo who probably has the most screen time is becoming more and more likable in recent films and here he does a great playing the FBI agent who is incapable of catching the Four Horsemen, the group of magicians. Seeing Morgan and Michael Caine is always a pleasure and just seeing these two act is a joy for a every movie fan. Isla Fisher plays one of the Four Horsemen but she serves more as a distraction for the audience so you pay attention to her and not what is happening in the film. Dave Franco once again gets his chance to shine. He has proved he can be very funny in 21 Jump Street and here he shows he can pull off a serous role too.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a well made suspensive heist movie with some action or just looking to cool yourself down in the cinema I believe that you can't go wrong with Now You See Me.<br/><br/>P.S. Solid cast, original story and a good word of mouth helped to make this film one of this summer's biggest surprises. When something has success in Hollywood it gets a sequel. Even though the film is a wrapped story. Not sure where they want to go with these characters next but I'm cautiously optimistic about the next film."
"thesar-2","8","2","6","29 August 2013"," Now, Why Didn't I See this Sooner?
","I don't what took me so long. I really like Jesse Eisenberg, Morgan Freeman and pretty much the rest of the cast. I love caper tales, super human (and smart) character films and any movie dealing – even a little bit – with Vegas. Boy, was I wrongnot to see Now You See Me opening night.<br/><br/>This movie was fantastic. Fun dialogue, adventurous scenes, great twists and served all my personal needsmeaning, I love fantasy films with incredibly smart characters – à la super human – that are always 3-5 steps ahead of their enemies. 2001's Ocean's Eleven has to be the king of all of those movies. While this one was a thrill ride and it's under that masterful film, it's still highly entertaining.<br/><br/>Basically, four street magicians are ""mysteriously"" brought together and band the enormously successful ""The Four Horsemen"" magic show on tour. After a year of being a huge hit, they begin robbing places using their talents, which, of course, leads to being eyed, and chased, by the authorities. What's worse, if it could be for them, is a truly bad guy – Morgan Freeman's Thaddeus Bradley, who's stalking them and loves to expose and reveal other magician's tricks on DVDs for money.<br/><br/>(Truly, this character is despicable. I know people do things for money all the time that's truly wrong – buying politicians, running cigarette companies, drug dealers, etc, but magic is for fun, the shows are deep and lasting amusement and you only hurt those who are trying to both make a living and entertain. This man is just plain wrong.)<br/><br/>The nice thing – for me, at least – was that these four always ""appear"" to be ahead in the game and smarter than the average beardetective (Hairy Mark Ruffalo's agent Dylan Rhodes.)<br/><br/>Sure, these can be considered clichéd and stereotypical smart-ass characters, but I love to see super human characters on screen. James Bond has to be one of the more famous of them: Always invulnerable, always comes out on top and never ceases to throw good lines at the bad guys, lovely interests and superiors.<br/><br/>I won't rate the movie as perfect, or even near-perfect, but I did have a great time. Even though it's magic they perform, some of the tricks even made me say: HmmmReally? And the further you get into the story, the more you can predict what the outcome(s) will be. All but one, that is. One major and final twist made me literally floored when revealed. In addition to loving super human characters, I adore at least one huge twist I never even thought about. I guess it's like being at a real magic show.<br/><br/>Not really to be taken seriously, but just to have a great night with the moviesI thoroughly recommend this caper. See Now You See Me."
"rahuljonathan-nair","10","2","6","28 August 2013"," Simply wonderful! Blowed my mind!
","The film has a novel and promising premise. The gang's cat and mouse game with the FBI, their display of magic tricks, fluid stunt scenes and Mark Ruffalo's banter with co-cop Melanie Laurent keeps you engaged. The film works as a crime-thriller. However, it's unconvincing when it comes to dissecting the magic. As the film progresses, the antics of the law- defying 'famous four' start defying logic as well. The scattered plot runs out of steam eventually. The film goes into a different tangent altogether in order to be unpredictable, leaving you more perplexed than pleased. The filmmaker sends out a similar message to the audience - don't dig into every aspect of the 'tricks' and you will be entertained."

A positive thing was that each character was interesting in their own way and it was also amusing to see their relationships develop as most of the main characters only meet as we the viewers meet them too.<br/><br/>There were several twists throughout this film, most of which I didn't see coming at all and each new revelation made the film even more exciting.

With the exception of the last quarter, the movie is actually surprisingly smart, and entertaining. While there are let downs within the filmmaking (The amount of CGI they use for the magic is baffling), the narrative is smartly weaved throughout.<br/><br/>The cast work well together, and as soon as we pass the ""catalyst"" moment, the characters stop being quite so annoying (and... shouty... in Isla Fisher's case), and settle into their roles quite well to the point that they're all very likable. Eisenberg in particular was a standout to me, I was very happy to see him play a more confident character than we've seen of him.<br/><br/>As for what didn't work... The ending was stupid. That's all I'm saying about that, because that's all I could work out.<br/><br/>I would recommend the movie, but I'd also advise the viewer not to raise their hopes too high. It's a very good and very smart movie, but it slips off into something much more disappointing and sloppy near the end."

","Film opens and introduces us to three male street-magicians, in reality just street hustlers, and one female, who at least has the distinction of performing her tacky show in a proper venue. They meet up. They know each other, at least by reputation, although two have worked together before on magic shows. Together, they create a magic show that takes them to Las Vegas. Here they perform their magic show with a magic act that teleports a member of the audience into a bank vault, then transports the money to the show. Yes!, the bank has really been robbed!, by magic! Enter, the forces of law and order, who then arrest our magicians. The rest of the film is a battle of wits between the magicians and the forces of law and order.<br/><br/>The early part of the film has our street magicians working their magic while engaging in fast, and smart, patter. A little irritating, but not half as irritating as the always moving, spinning, and swirling, of the camera. Thankfully, this calms down somewhat after a while. So stick with it in this early phase because viewing will become more comfortable, although the pace does not slacken during the film.<br/><br/>There are car-chases, and other chases, fights, magic-fights, funny magic-fights, funny scenes and magic scenes. Enjoy the magic. Enjoy the magic show. 10/10."

","Before I even walked into the cinema I knew this would be a great film because of the great actors and original story. I've always been a fan of Jesse Eisenberg, and I don't think the movie would of worked if he wasn't cast in the main role, and the same goes for everyone else in this movie. Each and every actor brings their A game from start to finish. Dave Franco and Mark Ruffalo are good actors but neither really made me think, 'Wow, they're good freaking actors!' But after this movie I can say that about both of them.<br/><br/>The story is original and fresh with some mesmerizing action sequences and some even better thrills! All of my respect goes to Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt, if this was just a movie about four young bank robbers it wouldn't have blown me away as much as the magical element did, even with these actors. <br/><br/>Now much like this movie, the title of this review could be deceitful, there were a few moments where I found myself thinking 'Really? He just turns every light bulb he comes across?' (You'll understand about 15 minutes into the movie). Some of the audience at the magic shows didn't impress me either, but they're minor speed bumps on an otherwise fulfilling, truly beautiful film.<br/><br/>I can tell you that this movie will most definitely take your breath away. Some have complained about the four horsemens character development, don't let that throw you, they're probably just angry that they couldn't work out the twist, which by the way, was also a beautiful moment. <br/><br/>Overall, this is an amazing movie, with awesome action, great actors and characters, a nice soundtrack and a brilliant script. Woody Harrelson had everyone in the room laughing. But maybe I'm biased. There is nothing I love more than a great heist movie."

"s_campanale","8","2","6","22 June 2013"," Magical Mystery film in a 60s Euro-Romp tradition that may not bring out the child in you but will sometimes treat you like one!
","We caught this movie at a special ""advanced screening"" this week in the UK, though it has been out for a few weeks in the States.<br/><br/>Four street magicians (Harelson, Fisher, Eisenberg and Franco) are hand picked by a mysterious hooded man to follow a grand plan, using incredible magic tricks to help right some historic wrongs centring on a once great magician who died attempting a career reviving ""underwater safe"" escape trick years earlier. They hit a French bank, an insurance magnate, a Safe manufacturer and a slimy professional ""magic debunker"" who destroys careers for his own profit - All LIVE on stage. An FBI agent (Ruffalo) and a sexy French interpol officer (Laurent) try to track them down but are always one step behind ""The 4 horsemen"" and their mysterious leader.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" is an interesting little film, if only for what it tries, or THINKS its trying to do. The movie is a would be mind-frakk puzzle picture using the ever popular ""magic"" cover to play with ideas of perception and comprehension, giving us false leads and upside down pictures all the way. It is easier said than done however, and to be honest it doesn't quite make it. The puzzle elements seem rather underwhelming, as if written for and by 8-10 yrs olds, and many adults in the audience may feel their intelligence being slightly insulted at many points. Also the ""power of Magic"" idea running through it doesn't really translate to the modern cynical world. Is there ANYONE who DOESN'T know its all being done with smoke and mirrors and misdirection? Can a person become a multi-millionaire downloading programmes exposing Magicians as fakes? Would we even WANT to know how its done? Doesn't that ruin the magic of Magic?<br/><br/>Not in this world, where people, even intelligent ones, remain goggle eyed in awe at even the simplest street conjuring tricks, and four rather tame (even slightly lame) street magicians can become national sensations overnight as ""The Four Horseman"" even though in the real world such fame and sensationalism nowadays would come largely from driving kebab skewers into your own liver or setting yourself on fire whilst suspended naked over the Washington Memorial (""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" had the same conversation earlier this year) Indeed there is a rather retro feel to the whole project, with those sort of happy go lucky, gay spirited Euro romps of the 1960s like ""How to Steal a Million"" ""Gambit"" and ""Topkapi"" being its obvious inspiration. Problem of course is that this is a new world now, a more cynical and unforgiving one, and its light playfulness and easy ""magic"" feel doesn't really translate well. <br/><br/>The director is of course Louis Letterier, the French man of action from the Besson stable who gave us ""The Transporter"" movies and more recently the successful updating of ""The Incredible Hulk"" and the less successful updating of ""Clash of the Titans"". He channels not only those easy Euro comedies ( a very popular genre in French cinema of the time) but also an earlier Gallic series ""Judex"", the masked magician who righted the injustices done to his family by the rich and powerful men of finance, as well as fighting the liars and oppressors of all classes and castes in the name of the innocent. He used magic to overcome his enemies, and also recruited a circle around him of hand picked assistants who had the heart and skill to become part of ""Team Judex"". It became a successful silent series in 1914-15, and also a very lovely film in 1961 by Georges Franju (now on DVD) The identity of this latest incarnation of ""Judex"" (nowadays sporting a hoodie rather than his old uniform of fedora and face scarf) is revealed at the end, Who it is it would be wrong to say, but the field of suspects is limited, so a random shot may easily pick the right one.<br/><br/>The show scenes are OK, if obviously done with CGI rather than any practical magical tricks. There is some action, including a crazed fight between the FBI and Danny Franco in his apartment, where magicians tricks are used as weapons as much as martial arts moves, and a tyre screeching car chase with a very unusual conclusion which reminds us this was made by the guy who brought you ""The Transporter"" series.<br/><br/>Acting wise everyone is good, especially Ruffalo, a great actor finally getting some of the recognition and kudos he deserves, who shows the frustration and rage of a professional trying to bring down something he cannot understand nor fight in the traditional manner. Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Basterds' plucky Jewish cinema owner) is perky and French as the perky French Interpol agent sent to work the Paris connection in America, becoming Ruffalo's partner, magical consultant, ""find the magic in your heart"" cod philosopher and eventual romantic interest. Michael Caine does what he used to do very well, take a big cheque and coast in light material of this kind, while Morgan Freeman, another actor of stature who never let a poor script get in the way of an easy pay day, gives just enough to be convincing as the slimy professional ""magic debunker""<br/><br/>Not the edgy dark drama it seems from the trailer, nor alas the brain- teasing puzzle picture ala ""The Game"" or ""House of Games"" or ""Inception"" that they would like it to be. It is best enjoyed a breezy, fun picture which is different enough from the other movies around it to be a breath of some fresh air in this summer season. Just don't get offended when it talks down to you!"
"cioccolato_purple","10","2","6","17 June 2013"," A great Movie
","When it comes to summer movies, this is about as good as it gets. We got to the movies to be entertained and lose ourselves for 2 hours for a price of an admission ticket. I can say without flinching that this was totally worth it. <br/><br/>It's hard for me to pick a favorite character because I love all of the Horsemen, but when it comes down to it I have to say I like the characters Daniel Atlas and Jack Wilder. Daniel, played by Jesse Eisenberg, often tries to assert himself as the head of the Four Horsemen. He is controlling, very specific and difficult to deal with, but he is also the funniest character which is attributed to all of his demanding qualities. I love every film Jesse Eisenberg is in and I think he is perfect for the role of Daniel Atlas. I also like Jack Wilder, played by Dave Franco, because he is the craftiest of the magicians. He isn't the ""card trick"" or ""read your mind"" type, he's just a good old fashioned pick-pocket for whom no door is ever locked.. He is sort of the ""muscle"" to the operation because he is able to help the horsemen get out of tight situations and he is also very funny.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is a solid flick with some great actors that you shouldn't sleep on. It clocks in at just under 2 hours, but it won't feel that long"

And you do! There were more people in the audience than usual for this one, and they were all as happy as I was, evidently, with the way the film went because a good half of us applauded the end. If you want action with a pretty fair plot involved – which is so often rare in the land of action films – and a picture that will keep you guessing all the way through, this is the one for you."
"StevePulaski","8","2","6","3 June 2013"," Magic in one era, blasphemy in another
","Magic in cinema has lost a lot of its, well, magical qualities due to the fact that special effects and visual wizardry can be pulled off by even someone so much as a common man. Considering film was founded on the principles of perception, illusion, and amateur craft, it's a wonder why it's so rare we get a modern picture exploring mentalism in a greater sense. Finally, there's Louis Leterrier's Now You See Me, a film centered around magicians and magic that examines the world in such a style that it should be taken in carefully and with a potent sense of admiration. It's easily one of the more surprising pictures of the year, combining effective mystery with plot-twists to make for a ravishing experience.<br/><br/>The plot: four crafty magicians, Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) and Merritt Osbourne (Woody Harrelson), are united by an odd-force and a year later are seen as the ""Four Horsemen"" by a sold-out Vegas crowd. For their final act, they decide to summon an assuming audience member to state the name of his bank so that he can be teleported through time to rob it accordingly. The bank is in France and in mere seconds is the man transported, given instructions about what to do when there, and finally, the money begins to rain from the ceiling of the arena. Of course this summons national attention and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is soon on the case trying to infiltrate the Horseman and discover what the underlying secret is to their tricks.<br/><br/>Leterrier's directorial game has always been in the field of slick action productions, such as the first two ""Transporter"" films and the recent remake of Clash of the Titans, which he later apologized for. His talent for directing a picture that relies heavily on visual trickery and giving the audience the idea they are ""getting it"" when they aren't even close is meticulous and surprisingly precise. An interesting footnote is ""Now You See Me"" was shot with an anamorphic lens on film in order to make the effects appear not too hokey but not too realistic as if they were showing them done with certainty and complete accuracy.<br/><br/>The trio of writers — Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin (Remember the Titans), and Edward Ricourt — however, encounter one issue and that is the issue of greater emphasis on plot and twists as opposed to character and development. The film features such an ensemble cast that does wonders making the material accessible, interesting, and immersing in the first two acts that, by the third, the events and twists have almost overwhelmed the picture to the point of the actors having to run to catch up with the pace of the film. This isn't a huge issue, but it isn't until the final twist is explained – that does feel a little rushed and sketchy – that you begin to realize you really know nothing about these magicians besides they each house enough cockiness to make up for two stubborn hockey teams that are entering Game 7 in the playoffs.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Now You See Me is a good film, but due to the cinematic mastery of special effects the power of magic and perception inevitably feels tainted. I'm reminded of how cinematic shorts got by in the late 1880′s when all auteurs had were cameras and the power of illusion; not slickness, shock, and trickery all created by a hefty budget. How would pioneer filmmaker Georges Méliès view Now You See Me? He'd probably dismiss it as blasphemy before getting back to work.<br/><br/>My video review of Now You See Me, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9Rceapdsz4"

The first time viewing this film without having any expectations going in was definitely a a film that impressed but upon re-watching it gradually wears down to a feeling of something that gave you a feeling of amazement of once upon a time.<br/><br/>The films magic scenes were definitely something that stood out. Although CGI was noticeable it didn't take anything from the scenes. They ventured into their imaginations formulating these types of tricks that were well presented. Obviously they weren't really done to a realistic tone, but the scenes made you feel like you should believe.<br/><br/>The character development lacked heavily, giving the magic tricks on screen more character than the characters themselves. You're introduced to an array of characters immediately with them all impersonating a certain cliched stereotype, leaving the audience to decide the rest.<br/><br/>Timing was an element that could have been worked on a bit more, with lines and certain parts of speech being overlapped by others saying their lines, with the main contributor being the incessant overacting of the few actors.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo does a brilliant job expressing his character, making the audience take in every breath and every bit of frustration he lets out.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was promising, and did deliver up until the end. If there is anything that needs to be known prior to the film it should be some certain things about the Magician world."
"yeolit","6","1","2","23 October 2019"," Smoke and mirrors
","Well this movie started out interestingly like one of those thrillers, a bit like Ocean's Eleven but with magic and hypnosis. However, the execution and the way the characters move are really strange at times, with no explanation. Like how does this person know a certain matter? Why does this person suddenly do that? How to a lot of questions?<br/><br/>Ironically, this movie is indeed what the premise is about, basically magic tricks. Smoke and mirrors. Deception but to entertain, as one guy in the movie indicated.<br/><br/>The greatest question though, is that if the mentalist is so amazing, why does he not simply use mass hypnosis on everyone? Or are all the ""hypnosised"" people stage actors? There is just so much plot holes and fantasy involved that even the supposed climaxes seem anti-climatic, some scenes were also incredibly predictable."

The idea of a mix of personalities coming together to form a team is nothing new but it definitely works here considering the different skills that each character possesses. Morgan Freeman plays a good character and Mark Ruffalo plays a terrific bumbling antagonist. But the best part of the movie is that it is basically a magic show but in higher quality and much more exciting. In many ways it reminds me of Ocean's 11, not just in heists but in the characters that pull the m off."

"tabuno","8","1","2","17 January 2019"," An Exciting Rare Use of a Magic Theme in a Movie
","3 June 2013. Magicians don't seem to have played much of a major role in the history of movies, outside the world of fantasy such as The Wizard of Oz (1939) or the Anthony Hopkin's occult Magic (1978) that earned him a best actor Golden Globes nomination. This rare resurgence this year of magic with the beautiful 3-D fantasy film Oz The Great and Powerful (2013) or the less than well received hokey comedy movie The Incredible Burt Wonderstone (2013) along with perhaps never to be released comedy Desperate Acts of Magic (2013) brings along with it this rare crime-thriller movie where magic forms the basis of the storyline of Now You See Me.<br/><br/>The screenwriter's seem to have taken a lot from the television series Leverage (2008-2013) which itself won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Cable TV Drama (2013) and oddly enough that show doesn't use magic as its theme but uses creative deception and misdirection like a grifter in all its episodes for rebalancing the scales of justice. The most comparative magic-themed movies would include the more personally involved competition between two rival musicians in this psychological thriller between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in The Prestige (2006) and the period crime psychological, mystery thriller without the action The Illusionist (2006) which included its own powerfully surprising twist both which focused more on the human drama rather than on the spectacular crime mystery action thriller or even the more poignant and perhaps even more emotionally, more intimately personal and bitingly delightful performance of John Malkovich in The Great Buck Howard (2008).<br/><br/>Now You Can See Me suffers somewhat with its omission of a flashback at the beginning of the movie that sets the basis for this story and instead uses a present time narrative to eventually flesh out the back story which is a crucial element of the emotive humanity of the entire movie. Overall this movie is fast paced, with at least three major plot twists along with others and seemingly magical sequences that sometimes are rather predictable and at other times unexpected, but none that exceed that of the television episodes from Leverage or perhaps even the old Mission Impossible television series (1966-1973). This fusion of magic, crime, and psychological gaming becomes a who and how done it audience game on the big screen, even the opening sequence of the guessing the playing card number and suit by the theater-going audience gets them ooh and awe. It's hard to disassemble this movie from many other clever action thrillers because the use of the magic theme is new and exciting like a new Disneyland ride and rarely used, if any on this level, as the actual part of a movie as opposed to actually making the movie. Nevertheless, the movie is refreshing and entertaining, keeping the audience interested and guessing throughout."

","The four magicians respond to mysterious calls to arrive at a certain place at a certain time. A year later, they are ""The Four Horsemen"", the world's greatest illusionist attraction. The grand finale of their most spectacular performance is to perform the illusion of bank robbery from the stage. It turns out that the bank is really robbed and the police, with the help of the former illusionist, who has reoriented to exposing the illusions of others, is trying to find out what happened and catch the mysterious four.<br/><br/>This film does not possess depth, philosophy, and hidden messages, nor aspire to some sort of artistic value. This is an illusionist action movie, whose purpose is to entertain, and in that purpose, it succeeds. If you're not a film snob and enter this adventure with realistic expectations of this genre, you can expect an awesome ride and you will not lack the adrenaline. Although not comparable to the greatest cinematic achievements, within the framework of its genre and goals it is trying to achieve, this film is perfectly executed and deserves the highest rating. In addition to the other qualities, there's really exceptional cast, among which are Mark Ruffalo (three Academy Award nominations), Woody Harrelson (also three), Morgan Freeman (one Oscar won out of five nominations) and Michael Caine (two out of six).<br/><br/>10/10"

As for Isla Fisher, her portrayal of an illusionist is so contrived that she just wasn't convincing.

It seems like the actual performances they were doing started out good but then just became spectacle with no real point.<br/><br/>I was also a bit annoyed that the magic was special effects and not actual stage magic, and some of it was implausible, in particular the mesmerism: They describe a full _superpower_ like The Shadow, not a stage mentalist.<br/><br/>But DO watch this one.

The eye of Horus can be joined by performing tasks, the team used what seems to be real magic bubbles and fire balls yet shows how it can be rationality explained. Still it boggles the mind on how Herly falling from the sky wouldn't break Jesse's small body or the group transforming into counterfeit money floating like confetti to the ground below. <br/><br/>For this reason alone it felt lacking on certain areas like what the eye entitles, Jack faking his death to perfection in a car chase with the others helping in synth and the reveal of the fifth horseman who went through his whole life to plan revenge on a man not even responsible for his family's tragedy. More time and care should've been spent on ironing out the details or plot devices in order to make the last minute revisions work.<br/><br/>Besides the minor convinces I enjoyed the trippy experience as the characters transform into selfless anti heroes only trying to make the world a better place. <br/><br/>Now you see me has the glitz, glamour and prestige missing from modern day cinema.

It is frothy fun as the Four Horsemen use all manner of trickery to evade their captures but you kind of guess who the real mastermind is going to be.

I wished housemen were real (lol).<br/><br/>There are so many plot twists and unexpected turn of event. The fake death of jack wilder was a real twist.

The stars are playful and relaxed (Harrelson and Fisher are particularly good), the constant twists are fun, and the movie moves like lightning and plays like opening a series of Christmas presents.<br/><br/>But yeah, it's stupid. The stupidest thing is probably Morgan Freeman's character, who exposes magician's secrets. It's an odd premise, in that he acts like he's on a mission (think The Amazing Randi's attacks on psychic fakery), when no one thinks magicians are terrible tricksters who must be exposed. It's just bizarre. And while Freeman is, of course, great, he cannot make his character's actions or attitude make any real sense.<br/><br/>So yeah, dumb, stupid, irretrievably ridiculous movie. I loved it."

I enjoyed it a lot and I would like to forget the film to can see it again having a first impression. After several fun scenes and a promising opening sequence that made me care about the characters I was very interested in the movie. The twists and the reversals weren't just surprising, they were completely unbelievable. You didn't see it coming, but not because of skillful misdirection (the art of magicians, so often implied) but because of Evidence: (For example, Danny, Merritt, Henle and Jack become the ""Four Horsemen"" and at the end of stage the death of one of their own by perfectly orchestrating a high-speed traffic accident on a crowded bridge. It was imperative that the car he was ""apparently"" driving flips and tumbles several times and ultimately bursts into flames. But it's as equally important that the pursuing detective can retrieve a stack of papers from the wrecked car. Apparently he ""must"" be able to retrieve the papers but not the body, all while getting away with his own life, or else the plot begins to unravel)"

","This started out with promise and ended flat, lame, hollow and just pointless. Rather than list the MANY awful gaping holes in the plot, the awful errors of continuity, the nothing attempt at romance, I will summarise my feelings about this movie simply.<br/><br/>Unlike the Prestige, The Illusionist and Oceans Eleven, which remain some of the best magic / heist movies ever made, and which this director possibly hoped to emulate (and failed abysmally), the NYSM director takes a lot of fairly decent ideas about magic and heists, waves them about tantalisingly in front of the audience with flashing lights, sound effects and lasers, and then sits down and says, ""OK. It's over now. You can go home."" There is no decent, fulfilling conclusion. The movie just ends with a limp attempt at resolution that fails utterly.<br/><br/>All of the stupidly impossible plot twists, the simply ridiculous car chase and coming back from the dead, the absurd misdirection, the lame romance, and the directorial hand-waving end with nothing more than a puddle on the floor.<br/><br/>The characters are flat. The plot absurd. No-one cares.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time."
"bryank-04844","8","1","2","23 August 2015"," 'Now You See Me' is one hell of a fun movie and definitely invites a second viewing.
","Mixing parts of 'The Illusionist', 'The Prestige' and a healthy dose of 'Ocean's Eleven', director Louis Leterrier's 'Now You See Me' is a heist movie involving four magicians. The illusions in the film are over-the-top but incredible, and despite the film's flaws, its super fast pace helps its problems vanish from memory. With an all- star cast and decent dialogue, this magical caper might be one of the summer's biggest surprises.<br/><br/>Getting things started quickly, we're individually introduced to our four magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), a cocky sleight-of-hand illusionist who could put David Copperfield to shame; Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), a beautiful escape artist who can slip out of a glass box full of hungry piranhas; Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), a hilarious and quick-witted hypnotist; and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), who's basically the equivalent of Matt Damon's role in the 'Ocean's' movies, a terrifyingly good pickpocket.<br/><br/>All four characters are first brought together by an unknown person to pull off a high-tech illusion. Fast forward to their first heist. Now dubbed the Four Horsemen, the team somehow manages to rob a bank in Paris, France while live on stage in Las Vegas, then makes the arena rain with cash over their audience. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is hell-bent on taking down this band of thieves with the help of Interpol detective Alma Dray (Melanie Laurent), who seems to have a few secrets of her own. On top that come Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a television personality famous for debunking magic tricks, and Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine), the financier for the Four Horsemen.<br/><br/>These characters move quickly from state to state performing shows that draws hundreds of thousands of spectators. Meanwhile, several law enforcement agencies track their every move and Bradley tries to cash in on their mistakes. A car chase and a decent fight scene later, the film climaxes in New York with a twist ending that would put M. Night Shyamalan to shame. I can't wait to watch this movie again to see if I missed any hints to the twist along the way.<br/><br/>The illusions are such an unbelievable spectacle that you have to watch the movie with a childlike sense of wonder and fascination. Much like the audiences seen in the film, you too will turn to putty in the Four Horsemen's hands. This incredibly fast-paced movie succeeds with fun banter between the actors. It's like a 'Zombieland' reunion with Harrelson and Eisenberg, and a 'Dark Knight' homecoming for Freeman and Caine, complete with witty insults and threats. It's a real treat.<br/><br/>'Now You See Me' is one hell of a fun movie and definitely invites a second viewing. I don't think this will win any awards, and maybe it has a few issues here and there, but as quickly as this picture moves, you won't pay attention to the problems, because there's a bigger surprise up its sleeve."
"PeaceGuard","6","1","2","13 August 2015"," A six for entertainment value, but no more.
","For a long time during watching the movie it had it's chances to get, let's say 8. But in the end I can't give more than 6 and I treat everything below 7 as not exactly worth watching.<br/><br/>But why? We have an opportunity to watch a VERY unrealistic movie. At the end we here that the man behind this was ""planning every smallest detail"" for years. Yet something like this could happen only in a movie. Let's look at only a couple of examples. The chance that Jack Wilder would reach the bridge at the exact minute or even second (if at all) to switch the vehicles would be zero in reality. The tricks with ""teleportation"" near the end were, of course, not possible. You can't just relocate tens of meters within three seconds or to the roof of a near building just like that. There are limits to what illusion/magic can do and that's why these things are not explained in the movie. The police arrest Thaddeus Bradley only because his car is loaded with loose banknotes, which could have been placed there but anyone. Yeah, let's hope police won't ever work like that in real life, because throwing a murder weapon through your window by a criminal would equal you spending rest of your life in prison, and packing a car with loose banknotes under the roof isn't exactly the best way of stealing money. There are many moments like that. There's just a difference between believing in something you don't understand how it was performed, but it was possible by the laws of physics and probability, and believing something that just didn't pass the laws of physics and probability.<br/><br/>Another huge flaw is the morals in the movie. The main character pursues Thaddeus Bradley and puts him into prison for probably many years for a crime he didn't commit in revenge for what? For exposing his illusion/magic tricks, which he believes led to the death of his father. Yeah, it's like you insult some guy, he commits a suicide and you're supposedly responsible for that. It's like some law from third world country where you're sentenced thirty years of prison for lèse-majesté or religious feelings offense. If the main character really believes that Bradley is responsible for the death of his father then it means he's mentally ill and should spend the rest of his life in a mental hospital, for the sake of other people's safety.<br/><br/>It COULD have been a good movie, really. It's just a pity it is not."
"kboote","4","1","2","11 June 2015"," The magic has gone.......
","Wow, a re-paring of Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg following the successful chemistry they generated in ""Zombieland"", a key role for lovable, modern day everyman Mark Ruffalo, support from saucy minx Isla Fisher and gravitas provided by the old pros Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman all wrapped up in the mind-blowing setting of modern magic. What possibilities and sure to be an enjoyable film? Well actually no! The film makes lots of references to ""misdirection"" and that in an entirely different way can be applied to the hapless Louis Letererrier a director who would block any street if he was assigned the traffic duty. Wooden acting, no chemistry, no atmosphere, no rhythm, the crowd scenes flat and lifeless, dull and clunky action sequences ( quite surprising from the director of the first 2 ""Transporter"" films ) and an overall inability to present anything but a glossy empty shell of a movie. I can only assume he must be able to come in under budget. The script is lousy too and Ed Solomon the genius behind ""Charlie's Angels"" and Boaz Yakin creator of a series of wholly underwhelming scripts, produce a convoluted mess that at no point is clever or thrilling. At the start of the similarly themed film ""The Prestige"" Michael Caine's character carefully outlines how a magic trick works and the structure of the film cleverly mirrors that introduction. This script rips off that concept but fails miserably to pull off the same ""trick"" and simply produces a lumpy unresolved hotchpotch of nonsense about the ""The Eye"", moral rectitude and modern magic. The script is full of holes and a failure to develop characters. Thus the twist ending is telegraphed from the beginning by the simple minded logic of applying the laws of ""the least likely"". The specific magical talents of the 4 Horsemen - is Isla Fisher a man? - are not incorporated into the subsequent capers - although at one stage I was sure that Woody Harrelson was using his mind control powers to silently signal to the audience ""get me out of here"". Most nonsensical of all just how does an FBI agent actually fund the 3 elaborate schemes in the first place? The principle actors, especially Jesse Eisenberg who has very little to do, look extremely bored, mirroring the expression of any intelligent person who had to watch this movie. What a terrible waste of talent and heaven forbid there is actually going to be a sequel..just remember to suspend belief and active brain activity as you enter into the cinema and you'll all love that film as much as you clearly did this one."
"erhen-o","2","1","2","9 January 2015"," Entertaining but doesn't make sense at all, pure fluffy fluff
","I think the writers thought, hmmm let's list all the ""must be in a movie"" patterns and write words around them: car pursuit and crash, I give a watch to my little boy so he can tell the ""watch story"" next to the fireplace (what was that), two agents that don't like each other kissing in duty (what can she possibly see in that guy), authoritative idiots everywhere, supposedly powerful men who are rivals over who knows what.<br/><br/>The magic tricks were cool and Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher were cool too, I watched the movie because Jesse was in it I admit. But Marc Ruffalo was such a pain, he plays really badly, he was a douche towards his female colleague, ""i didn't ask you, I asked him"", ""stay in the car"", ""doing a little sight seeing?"" -> massive douche!, yet she's kind of a possible romantic partner, we don't know. But he was just really bad in his role, I didn't believe any of it. Also you are left with many questions: why did he do all that? ""welcome to the eye"" -> what? What happened to the insurance guy? Why did Marc Ruffalo try to stop the Jake magician if his partner was already blocked? In the end, what was the purpose of it all ??? Also the end... did you get it? Nothing adds up really. All the magic books thing, and the eye stuff, and the Interpol woman saying ""some things are better left unexplained"" -> what ?! why are you even an Interpol agent ??? Pure fluff.<br/><br/>When I watched the trailer I thought the movie would be very sophisticated, kind of a mind game mixed with interesting strategies a bit like ""21"". But it wasn't, it was really just fluff with added ""to do scenes"" and sometimes funny lines: <br/><br/>""I'm touched. But I didn't tell you where I was touched"".<br/><br/>Also I would have renamed ""horsemen"" into ""horse-persons"", there was a woman with them, good golly!<br/><br/>""The 4 horse-persons"" so chic, isn't it?"

","The movie beautifully depicts the revenge taken by Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) against Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), a former magician. He reveals the secrets behind other magicians' tricks, for having humiliated his father (Lionel Shrike) and forcing him to try a risky stunt to revive his career. He also extracts revenge against the insurance company (Cr?dit R?publicain de Paris and Tressler's company) who had refused to pay money on his father's death, and the company (Elkhorn) that produced the sub-standard safe used in the trick that led to its failure. The movie is a great combination of mystery and thriller with four illusionists working for Dylan robbing the bank (Credit Republcain de Paris) in France only to shower it onto the Las Vegas crowd using magic tricks. The movie revolves completely around the criminal acts of the four Horsemen namely J. Daniel ""Danny"" Atlas (Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Fisher), and Jack Wilder (Franco). Though the ending seems to be incomplete. I feel that those street magicians needed be arrested to prevent people from getting inspired from such acts. However, the movie is a great example of a son taking revenge of his father sacrificing everything in his life. It's a must watch for anyone that has a defined taste for thrillers."
"thedudeabides-2","5","1","2","31 July 2014"," Instantly forgettable with a ridiculous end twist
","Have you ever been to a magic show and been so amazed at the feats being performed that you absolutely must know how it was done? Remember the crushing feeling of disappointment as it is revealed that the trick is nothing more than smoke and mirrors? You will experience a very similar feeling after watching Now You See Me.<br/><br/>Louis Leterrier's 2013 thriller follows Jesse Eisenberg and his band of magicians known as The Four Horsemen, as they perform audacious crimes disguised as tricks, all whilst being followed by Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent. It all starts off very promising, as the horsemen rob a bank in Paris from their stage in Las Vegas leading to a cat and mouse chase in which we are not quite sure who is the cat and who is the mouse.<br/><br/>Leterrier adopts a fast paced, dynamic style throughout the movie, meaning we never really have a chance to get to know the characters or their motivations. There are a few action set pieces which, whilst impressive, feel slightly out of place. We are asked to suspend disbelief a little too much, as we see this band of magicians using fighting skills more commonly associated with Jason Bourne. But perhaps the biggest issue with Now You See Me is the lack of character development. Despite gathering a cast which includes Micheal Caine, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson and Mark Ruffalo, the movie never really explores these characters, they are merely tools used to enhance the story which isn't strong enough. <br/><br/>As the movie progresses, a feeling of disappointment begins to seep through. The running theme of misdirection often leaves the viewer unsure of anything that is happening and you find yourself second guessing every plot turn. This wouldn't be a problem if the movie had a satisfying resolution but, unfortunately, this does not prove to be the case. Answers often fall flat, plot twists feel predictable and by the time you reach the end, you realise that it is nowhere near as clever as it would have you believe. Much like a magic trick."

","""Now You See Me"" (2013) is a tremendously fun film starring Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine.<br/><br/>Four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) are invited to an address. Inside, they encounter a few tricks. A year later, these four have become The Four Horsemen and are doing a show in Las Vegas. They end the first performance that we see with a bank robbery that doesn't look like an illusion.<br/><br/>The FBI gets right on it and sends in an agent, Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) and Interpol sends one as well, Melanie Laurent (Alma Dray). Rhodes is arrogant and thinks figuring out how these four did it is going to be easy, but it isn't, even with the help of a big-time illusionist exposer (Freeman). Of course, that robbery isn't going to be their last as the agents become more and more frustrated.<br/><br/>Be ready for the twists and turns, distractions, and sleight of hand. Nothing is as it seems.<br/><br/>Highly entertaining film, with good performances from the young cast, working alongside two major pros, Caine and Freeman. I know the film is preposterous but so are a lot of plots. When a film is well done, I say just relax and go along with it.

"littlebyaku","5","1","2","7 June 2014"," Very disappointing and boring in the end.
","I was so excited for this movie when I first heard about it and saw the trailer but was I wrong about that. It's hard to pinpoint where the movie hits all the wrong spots but my personal issues were the lack of likable characters, lack of character development, the mediocre plot and the overall execution of the movie. <br/><br/>Of course this is my personal opinion but the 4 ""main"" characters in the movie appear to be the 4 horsemen. They are not. The only time you'll really see them is during their show and a few short scenes here and there, the rest of this 2 hour long movie isn't about them. That's first. Second is the fact that I was completely unable to like any one of them. They are arrogant and are just s uninteresting because they have no personality, no sympathizing or deeper moments at all. And the half attempted ""budding romance"" moments feel so out of place and forced, the movie would've been better off without them. But the worst thing is that I can't even properly dislike them as ""persons"" because there are almost no personal moments with them. They're just so uninteresting and cast aside that I couldn't feel anything watching them. There have been a few background story hints/mentions but really, not even close enough to begin character development, which doesn't happen anyways so no loss there I guess.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the police guy (whom seems to be the main character according to the screen time he gets) or the woman he works with. What is she doing, especially at her final scene in the movie? What the hell man. Anyway it's ridiculous and not in a funny way, the whole police force and their inability to capture these 4 guys is just painful to watch. It gets old so quickly and painfully predictable that our magicians will pull a trick out of their sleeve to escape. I quickly started rooting for the FBI because I couldn't fine even a small reason to like these guys but the FBI was so damn incompetent it made me want to fast forward thorough the entire movie.<br/><br/>Another major point is the plot. Or perhaps lack thereof. Yes you do wonder; ""where does this all lead to"" but really, the ending feels rather a anti-climax and I didn't even care anymore at the end of the series since you can guess what happens. Yes. The plot is so freaking transparent that you can literally guess the ending after watching a third of the movie. Maybe not the entire thing or all the elements but for the bigger part you can. And that's not a very good thing if you ask me. There are also a few plot holes/ridiculous things that really bother me that you can't cover up with ""it's magic"" that make the whole thing even more ridiculous.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil to much and yes, some complaints can be rebuked after watching the whole movie but it's not a good movie. So freaking much wasted potential, flatter than cardboard characters and in the end it's nothing more than a C-rank action movie ""thrilling chase"" that keeps dragging on for over 1.5 hours. <br/><br/>To summarize; is it a good, well thought out movie with in depth characters? No way, not at all. Is the movie entertaining? Kind of, it's dragged on for way too long but it's not bad. Should I expect something of this movie? No. Don't. Do not watch the trailer, it's several times better than the actual movie. But the movie is time killing and in the end it's not bad. It's just not that good, not that good at all..."
"vipcorp-954-708527","2","1","2","1 April 2014"," Real magic is getting high ratings for this waste of film
","So sorry I bothered to keep watching after losing interest about a third of the way through. I almost always keep watching bad movies just to see what happens, but after this one, I may change that policy.<br/><br/>First of all, this movie should be categorized as fantasy. It is not a crime story or thriller at all. I went in thinking it was going to be a real heist flick. This was more along the lines of an after school special or a ""Shark-nado."" <br/><br/>What was with the carousel? ""Real"" magic? The Illuminati? Yawn. A major cheat for the audience that insults the intelligence. I feel raped. Where did they go and how could they ever show themselves again? The four protagonists would have been arrested and prosecuted after the very first theft. Plenty of evidence and there is no way they would ever get back on a stage. They really get out of a surrounded building? I think not. The old ""handcuff swap"" in an FBI interrogation room, ah...no. Suspend disbelief? Gladly, I do it all the time, but the story has to be plausible on some level.<br/><br/>Hmmm...what else? Having the magicians be the actual people doing the real French bank/armored car robbery? Why? I would think they would have used real bank robbers - you know, people with experience and expertise at that kind of thing? But that's just me. Might also keep them off radar when the FBI starts checking into passports, alibis and other trivial stuff like that.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman's case would never be brought to trial as they had much less on him than the other four and besides, the way his car was overflowing with money....would anyone believe he was smart enough and skilled enough to pull this off, but plans to get away with the dough like that? Please. He gets out, fingers Ruffalo, end of story.<br/><br/>Just about everything in this movie was boring and predictable - except the ending which would have been impossible to predict because it was absolutely ridiculous.<br/><br/>I was starting to believe that every single robbery was faked with the original French bank in on it, all of the audience that received money from Michael Caine's account, etc. This would have at least made some sense and been a great twist of misdirection - perhaps aimed at Morgan Freeman, perhaps to fool the FBI, to commit another robbery altogether or simply as as a means to fame.<br/><br/>Near the end, I figured Ruffalo was the mastermind, using previously faked robberies by the magicians to cover the real, final robbery. If the previous robberies were proved fakes, and with no physical evidence for the final heist, it would have been nearly impossible to convict them. Perfect misdirection. <br/><br/>At one point I thought Morgan freeman was the leader, doing these fake robberies to swindle Michael Caine out of the ten million, but it was far too early in the film. Had they waited with that, it would have made the most sense - get Caine all bothered by misdirecting him with fake robberies? They could have temporarily faked the bank computers, so Michael Caine and his bank wouldn't immediately know. Perfect swindle and no real robbery ever gets committed. Hey, I'm not upset that my scenarios were wrong - the movie just sucked. I would have accepted almost anything but the path they chose. Jeeeesh.<br/><br/>This was an interesting premise and although the actors and dialog were obnoxious, I was willing to roll with it and enjoy. Too bad it got so lost on its way to the absurd ending. <br/><br/>I almost always root for the crooks and criminals in movies, but these guys were so damn smug and annoying, I was begging for them to be caught. I would rather root for bad guys who shoot bank tellers than these spoiled brats.<br/><br/>Now You See Me makes Tower Heist look good. Tower Heist isn't so full of itself and its not even half as silly.<br/><br/>Think I'm going to stop trusting the star ratings and start looking for specific, competent reviewers on this site. Far too many bad films with over seven stars."

","Although this movie has no spectacular elements in it, it was overall entertaining. With a fun plot and premise centering around four street magicians united by a mystery character, the movie moved at a quick pace. These four main actors were well casted and likable, with memorable quips and sarcastic retorts. Albeit, that's really all they were: likable. They were not developed at all, but rather introduced quickly to set up the plot of the movie. The movie lacked any real conflict for these main characters that would take them from flat descriptions to more dynamic people. They conveniently eluded the police at every turn; they all survived; and they all were happy. You couldn't help but root for them, but something felt like it was missing.<br/><br/>Aside from the four magicians, Melanie Laurent, Mark Ruffalo's love interest was almost unbearable. I couldn't help but cringe each time her and Ruffalo interacted; it was beyond corny. At certain points, I was admittedly even laughing at it. Furthermore, at the end of the movie, the ""surprise twist,"" was so unrealistic and impossible that it made the rest of the movie slightly more absurd. The cool plot and idea of a hidden player who united them became droll because it lost all believability with this ending. And when the characters got onto a magical merry-go-round at the end. I mean come on, really?<br/><br/>Take this movie at face value, and know what you're paying for. It's no cinematic genius by any stretch of the imagination, but it is a fun, light-hearted action with likable and interesting protagonists. All these elements combined to make this a nice, feel good movie. I was entertained and distracted for a solid two hours, and hey, I think that alone is worth something"

","I was hyped for watching Now You See Me. And for the first half of the movie i was enjoying it (even though there were a lot of plot holes). But what this movie does wrong is that it tries to be something more than what it actually is. I expected the magic to be clever and based in reality. Some of it was - but some of these tricks were just so fancy that they were boring.<br/><br/>Example: (MINOR Spoiler INCOMING, SKIP IF UNWANTED) At one point in the movie they are doing magic with bubbles, and one of the three horsemen jumps into a giant bubble and starts floating around over the audience. Now don't get me wrong - seeing this in real life would blow my mind. But it just seems impossible to explain and that just makes it boring in a way, and i takes me out of the movie. Every magic show always has that one final trick that blows everyones mind. Its like this movie tried to make every trick be that - but it just doesn't work that way.<br/><br/>(SPOILER OVER) The movie over does many magic tricks, and also ends up over doing the entire plot. The plot twist in this movie has so many holes in it.<br/><br/>Lets set up pros and cons<br/><br/>PROS - entertaining and sparkling! there is almost no points in this movie where you are bored.

","it's a movie not very impressive but not boring neither. From beginning to the end it successfully attracts the attentions, also the appropriate using of couple of magical shows do contributes a little bit. The only thing maybe impressed is the end that the stupid cop is the guy behind. It has some attractive scene like car chasing run cool etc. The main line seems reasonable as well. And one thing I have to say is the Franch blondy acts very well although her character has little chance to express. Comparing with these old famous Freeman and Tressler the youth do a better job, but I'm not here suspecting there acting skill maybe it is because the wrong character. Especially that I have to say Morgan you are too calm sometimes, you can't be that peaceful all the time for this character and the only moment you are dismayed is apparently pretend. Mark did a pretty good job at least in my opinion it is as till the most end I still can't say he is the guy behind. The other thing is for Isla she is still like 20 that's amazing."

","I'm not sure what I was hoping for with NOW YOU SEE ME, but I should've known going in that I shouldn't expect a real tight, suspenseful heist film. That might be what I wanted, but director Louis Leterrier was more interested in putting out another flashy summer action movie. The movie's not much more than a flashy spectacle that attempts to shoehorn a big ""twist"" into the end of the film, but it all left me feeling a little disappointed at the end. As a big fan of THE PRESTIGE, I have a nasty tendency of going in to movie's centering on magicians with high hopes that it will strive for that level of drama in the world of magic. This year I've been let down twice: this and THE INCREDIBLE BURT WONDERSTONE. Though Leterrier's magical heist film is nowhere near as derivative as that Steve Carell dud. Instead, it's just your average ""turn off the brain"" summer entertainment. NOW YOU SEE ME opens with introductions to four low-level magicians: J. Daniel Atlas (Eisenberg) is a semi- successful street magician, Henley Reeves (Fisher) is Atlas's former assistant who's gone on to create her own act, Merritt McKinney (Harrelson) is a mentalist struggling to regain his former fame, and Jack Wilder (Franco) is a street-level sleight-of-hand artist. Each of them receives a mysterious invitation that soon leads to an immensely successful show together as the Four Horsemen. When their show in Las Vegas concludes with the seemingly magical theft of millions of Euros from a bank vault in Paris, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Ruffalo) is assigned with an Interpol agent (Laurent) to put an end to it before the Horsemen strike again.<br/><br/>There are a couple problems I have with this movie. I was hoping, if nothing else, that it would treat the magic in the movie as true illusions. I loved the idea of stage magicians using their craft to dazzle audiences with their show while baffling the authorities with their crafty heist jobs. The movie abandons any hope of that by incorporating CG effects into the illusions, giving them an otherworldly appearance and ruining any feeling of grounding in reality. During the first Horsemen show in Las Vegas, Leterrier uses some horrible CG effect for some floating black clothes in the reveal of the ""transporter"" and reinforced it in New Orleans when Henley takes flight in a giant bubble over the audience. Feasible? Maybe, but it felt like a little too much and suddenly the magicians didn't feel real. Next is the whole concept of ""The Eye"". The Eye is some secret society of magicians dating back to ancient Egypt that was dropped into the plot as some sort of motivation behind the magicians' heists. I don't know about anyone else's opinion, but personally I would've enjoyed it more if the magicians weren't supposed to be anti-heroes but really were just incredibly talented thieves that used their shows and complex illusions to get away with incredible robberies. The Horsemen's selfless acts are secretly manipulated and funded(?) by an unknown fifth figure a fifth Horseman. The reveal at the end of the film of the fifth Horseman's identity is one I saw coming but also hoped I was wrong about because it was just too lame. In addition to being somewhat disappointing, it also raised a lot of questions/problems about everything that had preceded it. Not to mention all the logistical problems behind it.<br/><br/>But, if you're ready and willing to shut down your brain, NOW YOU SEE ME is a decently fun two hours. There's a fair bit of action in the film and director Louis Leterrier has proved skills in the genre (yes, I liked THE INCREDIBLE HULK). There's a pretty wicked fight scene about halfway through the film between Ruffalo and Franco that ends with the obligatory overblown car chase every successful summer blockbuster needs. And the glimpse into the Horsemen's more grounded illusions and how they pull off some of their heists is pretty cool. Plus, you really can't complain with such an awesome cast on hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, and Melanie Laurent. It's a pretty stacked team here. If the material were stronger, we'd probably have a real killer movie. The material doesn't live up to the potential of bringing all these choice actors together. Still, they bring their usual quality performances to the game and that alone is enough to earn the movie some brownie points. All things considered, NOW YOU SEE ME balances it strengths and weaknesses to be a serviceable summer action movie. Set your expectations to mid-level and you'll be fine. With a sequel on the way and that lame fifth Horseman reveal finished, maybe the filmmakers can wow us with the next inevitable movie."
"Koodle0101","5","1","2","31 October 2013"," Not Exactly What You Think It Is
","I give this 5/10 (Okay but not great) for the humor and visual effects. If you like flashy CGI, lights, and effects then you might like this movie. If you are like me and watch a movie for the plot, story, character, and creativity you'll be disappointed. Simply, this an ""illusionist"" type movie. Dealing with ""magic"" and ""illusions"" is a very tricky business. Mainly because we all know that it is not real magic... or not supposed to be. Everything HAS to be possible and explained at some point in the movie for it to be brilliant and creative. Sadly it isn't true in this movie. Many times I shake my head at how shallow the explanations were (for the sake of explaining) for how some things worked. Keep in mind that no one has real magic, only ""illusions"" supposedly. Some examples: Woody can literally control people. Snap a finger and make people remember/forget/believe what he wants. Snap them to sleep, snap again to awaken. He made a group of people tackle Mark. Made an important man stand there playing ""air"" violin while they stole money in front of him. Read a husbands personal life, muted his wife, made her unable to walk, then made BOTH the husband and wife forget things, then made the wife able to speak/walk again for some easy money... if this isn't real magic I don't know what is. Because Woody has this ""ability"" it made the whole movie possible. Nonsense.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffallo turns out to be this ""secret man"" in the end after spending time acting like an idiot through the whole movie trying to catch the ""bad guys"" when he's the one who planned everything. Falls in love randomly with his partner for no reason. They're only in a few scenes together and not any of them were personal/touchy in any way.<br/><br/>No one understands the four horseman and where they came from, how and why they got into or chose to be a magician in the first place. Why they decide to follow through with magic acts planned out by some random person they've never met. No character development at all.<br/><br/>How they made a speech near the end of the movie on a rooftop, then run and jump and become money in thin air...<br/><br/>All of these things would be mind blowing if there was an explanation. The movie itself calls everything ""an illusion."" Failing to explain all these random and super convenient phenomenon just so the movie can happen makes it that much less of a quality movie. This would be a great movie if it was Harry Potter or a magical fairy tale movie. But it isn't. It is a movie about real magicians without real magic doing magical things..."

"bob-larrance","5","1","2","24 October 2013"," Some nice camera work but overall very shallow
","I got two things out of this film that I didn't expect at all. First, a good performance from Mark Ruffalo, though I remain skeptical of his 'talent'. Second, a very bland sense of boredom by the time it all wrapped up. I had hoped for a bit of The Prestige, just a little bit, but that wasn't there at all. I was ready for some fascinating tricks on screen, and got none of those either. Most of the acting is more like overly confident mugging for the audience. Woody, in particular, never seems to become all that engaged in his part. He moves from scene to scene beaming as if he is actually doing something when the only something there for us is his half sneer/half grin over and over and...then there is the Morgan factor. Mr. Freeman is in yet another film playing the same Morgan Freeman character you are already bored with. Over the years the cinema industry has always had a few aging stars that are inserted into way too many films. Thus, the Morgan factor. Think of him as the new Wilford Brimley. This is the sort of movie that most will soon forget, if they haven't already."

","'Now You See Me' is occasionally fun, and at times even clever, but it's also vapid, pretentious and too often stretches credibility to the breaking point—and then way, way beyond. Even a movie about magic has to be grounded in reality, and every trick must have some sort of explanation or it's a cheat. 'Now You See Me' tries to ""Abracadabra!"" its way around this fact once too often. <br/><br/>At nearly two hours, this act threatens to get old long before the end credits, but a really good cast and energetic direction hold it all together until the final twist puts a satisfying(ish) bow on the whole thing."

"clarne","5","1","2","19 September 2013"," Unfocused, and not as smart as it wants to be.
","There aren't too many good magic-movies. Besides The Prestige no movie has really captured the (in lack of a better phrase) magic that a good illusion possesses. ""Now You You See Me"" does not help change that fact. <br/><br/>The premise is rather enticing. 4 magicians/hustlers are brought together by an unknown player who apparently has seen something unique in each one. One year later they're a rather successful magic act, and in their grand finale one night they apparently rob a french bank from the US. They get arrested, but for some reason the FBI lets them go despite the fact that they left a calling card, and surely had to be at least accomplices. But still it does create some fascination. How did they do this? Who are these magicians? Who is this secret character whose brought this rag tag-team together? Unfortunately the answers are less than satisfying.<br/><br/>In a rather sudden switch of focus, the movie from there on in mainly follows Mark Ruffalo's FBI character. It tries to build up a cat-and- mouse game. We're introduced to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine who basically just takes up time in the movie. Which, considering the caliber of those two actors is no small feat. Freeman is supposed to be a successful magic-debunker, but his only real function in the movie is to move the plot along. Caine's character is mainly just a gruff businessman who for some reason uses most of his time jet-setting with his magic act. <br/><br/>The movie's biggest weakness is its utter disregard for character and plot focus. The premise is okay, but from there on in it's basically a ""Let's throw ideas at the screen, and see what sticks"" kind of movie. None of the characters get any kind of development. An example is the introduction of a romantic past between Eisenberg and Fisher's characters. This is actually given quite a lot of attention throughout the movie, but it's at a total standstill. Basically, the characters are cardboard-cutouts whose only function is expository speeches.<br/><br/>The movie tries hard to be a kind of Ocean's 11 for magic, but fails where that movie triumphs. In the former you always get a feeling that the parts of the team need each other. The heist will fall apart without it. This element is totally absent from ""NYSM"". The characters are given some idiotic cards which is supposed to ""define""them"". Harrelson's character is supposed to be some kind of mind reader, but only seems to be there for comic relief. Isla Fisher's use is also not clear. Furthermore the twists and turns in Ocean's felt somewhat believable, this is not the case in ""NYSM"".<br/><br/>That being said the movie does keep a quick tempo, and should be commended for some set pieces. The acting is rather bland, but that's mostly because of the characters. I'm sure the movie will entertain quite a few viewers. Unfortunately this movie seems to believe that it's a lot smarter than it is, and for anyone looking for satisfaction in that regard will be thoroughly disappointed. An okay popcorn movie, but riddled with so many plot holes, and disappointing pay offs that anyone looking at it with a critical eye will tear their hair out."

","Four magicians and illusionists each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman, big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Melanie Lauerent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see.<br/><br/>First, I thought it was going to be a character piece about these four master craftsmen, but it quickly turned into a heist movie. The CGI trickery, illogical setups and thinly sketched plot makes it kinda hard to appreciate it though. The revelation isn't a big surprise, but is contrived and the tricks that you don't want an explanation for are explained in detail, while the more outlandish tricks are left for the imagination since there's no possible way to explain it in the real world. It tries to come off as more clever than it actually is. There's no way the money they transferred from Arthur Tressler's (Michael Caine) account will stay in the people's accounts for long before the bank rectifies the problem. Still, it is very entertaining. The Prestige (2006) and The Illusionist (2006) are two actually great movies that you should check out if you're into magic and trickery. Doesn't matter if you love or hate this movie, you'll appreciate those two. <br/><br/>Eisneberg is doing the same old Social Network routine here. Harrelson was frankly awesome. Ruffalo and Fisher were fine, though Fisher was greatly underutilized. Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine reunite outside of the Dark Knight trilogy and they're kinda wasted really. French actress Melanie Laurent's naive Interpol character is hard to believe, but she is absolutely lovely and little things like her - 'Is this your card? Yeah? Kool' - makes the movie so much more endearing. Do not watch the movie expecting it to be an intelligent caper. It just comes off as stupid and pretentious then. This is nothing more or nothing less than a fun ride. Just for the sheer entertainment value and for the charming Melanie.<br/><br/>7/10"

"athena24","4","1","2","27 July 2013"," Lacks a tight grip.
","Incoherent and pointless. That's the two words for me to describe this movie. Absolute lack of charm in a movie demanding one. A 75 million dollar budget spent ridiculously. Both me and my girlfriend left the theater with a bad taste, feeling we have chosen the wrong movie to watch. <br/><br/>I was deceived by the trailer, the relatively good IMDb rating and the majority of good reviews. I didn't expect a masterpiece (based on the reviews), but it turned out to be much worse.<br/><br/>The plot has some originality and it's mildly entertaining throughout but never lifting, never intriguing and never building real suspense. So when the end came there was almost nothing to look for. The resolution was quite bad, very loose, having a weak logical connection to the rest of the plot. Unfortunately, because earlier parts of the movie never built any suspense, I wasn't even disappointed.<br/><br/>I think the director is to blame for all of the movies' faults. First is the lack of details. Sure, some of the tricks are shown, but some are not (how did they have access to bank accounts? how did they show immediate change of numbers on paper?). Some of the scenes look very awkward and very unrealistic (the chase part, all the last show). The second fault is the focus on the characters. Upon reading the plot and seeing the trailer, I expected the magicians to be in the center of the plot, but the focus is clearly not on them. Their characters lack substance and I ended up not caring about them throughout the entire film. The third fault is the CGI and the flashy lights. There is not much of them, but when they are present, they are boring and redundant. They didn't try to make them interesting, but to fill some space. The fourth issue is regarding the plot. There is no clear balance of power between the characters. What are the motives of each characters? What stands behind their actions? And the one-line explanations at the end to those question is just not enough. <br/><br/>There is a good amount of reviewers here praising the movie, and so the score is probably representing the average. However, in my opinion, anyone who likes the movies to have a strong logic, with down to earth approach and with things to be explained (and not just happen somehow), should skip this (at least at cinema). To make my point, I loved 'Prestige' and 'Oceans' 11' and I didn't like 'The Illusionist' for the reasons above."

","I am a 16 year old girl and truthfully I HATE crime films and predictable twists drive me up the wall. (oh I am an insane film nerd.....just so you know :P) When I first saw the trailer for this film I actually wrote the date it came out in Britain on my calendar for about 5 reasons. 1- I LOVE Jesse Eisenberg SO much....I've seen Zombieland about 10 times and I am still amazed by Colombus (his character) each time. 2- Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg together...is such a brilliant combination. 3- The concept of the four horseman intrigued me...you see I enjoy films based around more than one person. The dynamic from what I saw in the 30 second trailer was amazing and flawlessly acted. 4- Once again, what I determined from the trailer, was how amazing the script was....""Rule number one of magic: Always be the smartest guy in the room."" I still love that line :-P 5- Magic. The idea of a crime drama based around 4 magicians just sounded awesome! Anyway, I went to the cinema with my best friend Nicole to see this film and truthfully some of the twists were a little obvious but I'm willing to bet that it was planned that way to ensure ""dramatic irony"" like the final part of their plan where they used the mirror box trick which they previously used to hide a rabbit in a box in the show, that Jack Wilder was still alive and the linchpin of the plan after that HUGE car crash scene (which was SO greatly filmed...the way they switched from long shot to over the top shot and from close shot of each car made us see exactly what the FBI saw during that scene which was Jack Wilder crash and die in an explosion when in reality they'd switched the cars and Jack Wilder drove off to break into the hospital and drop off the corpse which they stored in the car that crashed and then crack open the safe) Truthfully I didn't see the big twist coming at the end, I don't think anyone did. Mark Ruffalo I have got to say was GENIUS in this film. Flawless acting. Flawless chemistry with the French girl (I do know her name but I can't spell it :S Anyways she was the PERFECT character to contradict Mark Ruffalo's fake ""I don't believe in magic"" attitude) He should be SO proud of his performance in this film as I believe he was the centre of this film.<br/><br/>Dave Franco was SO brilliant in this. Jack Wilder was actually my favourite character. His trick where he bends the spoon in the first scene he's in amazed me and the scene where he beats up Dylan Rhodes was actually really really cool. The camera shots in that scene were also amazing actually.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman was also AMAZING! I know he was the bad guy but he was SO cool and collected. He's such an amazing actor. I really wasn't surprised at how great he was.<br/><br/>Isla Fisher was SO amazing in this film. Flawless acting, amazing character and perfect amount of chemistry between her and Jesse Eisenberg's character. That scene where he catches her actually gave me goosebumps. They could not have picked a more perfect actress for this part.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson brought comedic effect to an otherwise crime/ fantasy based film. The interrogation scene where he mocks an FBI agent and psychoanalyses Rhodes and his partner actually made me cry with laughter. Once again the perfect actor to play this part. He was hilarious and brilliant.<br/><br/>And....finally Jesse Eisenberg. As I've said I do love him. He's such a BRILLIANT actor and should be SO incredibly proud of how he portrayed ""Daniel Atlas"" in this film. Nicole truly loved this character and the fact that he looked amazingly cute in this film also added to his amazing portrayal. I really can't fault his performance. He was....just....well the fact that I am speechless still and it's been about six hours since I've seen the film is a great sign.<br/><br/>I really can't find a fault in this scene and there's SO much more I could mention like Michael Caine was also amazing and the flawless camera work and effects and lighting and sound and I REALLY don't see how anyone can find a fault within this AMAZING film. Flawless lovable characters mixed with amazing twists and flawless camera work and scripting.....I am actually racking my brain trying to find a fault to make it seem like I am not biased but I REALLY can't. I was never bored, I was always on the edge of my seat. Let's just say I have a new favourite film and anyone involved within this film should be SO proud."

","When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I was immediately captivated and wanted to go see it on the opening weekend. It didn't disappoint, but there were still some missing pieces.<br/><br/>First off, the characters. While watching the movie, you don't quite think much of them but once the movie's over, you realize that you don't know much about them. It's hard to find a character likable when you're not sure what their background check is and if they're not given enough screen time. I would've liked for the writers to embellish the Four Horsemen characters, especially Dave Franco's. He was barely given any screen time and I found it interesting that his character wants to be treated like an adult and not like a kid. I would've also liked to get to know Melanie Laurent's character better. The acting was good, but not Oscar-worthy.<br/><br/>Also, the 'romance' part between Jesse Eisenberg and Isla Fisher's characters. That was never continued and it left me hanging with a question mark as to how that would turn out.<br/><br/>The plot was interesting, the fight scenes and the car chase scene was gripping. There weren't many magic tricks but there were plenty of clever twists.<br/><br/>The ending was surprising. It was a bit strange when you first find out because it felt to me, a bit awkward as to how the Detective could've kept his cover as the Fifth Horseman all that time. But, when you start going over the movie afterwards, it fits well in to the plot and it didn't come out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a really fun and gripping movie. Even if the characters were not that memorable, I enjoyed the plot twists and the clever tricks. If you like movies that make your brain work just a little bit, you will like this one."

","Whoa, this was painful. With a cast like that (Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine) and a promise of magic, mystery and a heist, you'll expect a great, cerebral plot, and a nice surprise at the end. Sadly, the plot is equivalent of getting spinned in a swivel chair while getting hit in the face with a sack of bricks.
The amount of holes this script has is insane. Most of the situations are completely unbelievable, considering it's supposed to be ""real"" illusionism - here, a guy can hypnotize people at will in a matter of seconds, and force them do pretty much anything, and that's just one example of how ridiculous this movie is. The whole death fake scene is another major offender, totally bonkers.
Every single character is awfully annoying and has close to zero development. When the two previously mentioned actors show up, it's nothing but a cameo. Characters like the Interpol agent are there just to pad the film, because they bring nothing to the table except a forced romance that's tellegraphed from the beginning.<br/><br/>The ending is simply stupid. I actually thought of it halfway through the movie, but discarded it because it made no sense at all. I was surprised at the revelation but for all the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>Movies like THE PRESTIGE, which I thought it was ruined with the sci-fi concept, and THE ILLUSIONIST, which I hated because of a justified murder, at least had the decency of showing actual real tricks, in front of the camera. NOW YOU SEE ME uses CGI almost in every trick, making them impossible to perform in real life, and therefore, ruining the whole concept of magic. It's nothing but a flashy show of cocky people and a story in which rich people are bad because they have money.<br/><br/>Avoid at all costs unless you want the lose two hours of your life, and end up really angry at yourself.

Magic is bad enough to watch live when you at least have some mild curiosity about how it's done. But to make a film about it with cgi and impossible stunts! This film is so very bad. AbrakaBADra!"

","Movies like James Bond or Jason Bourne ask you to suspend your disbelief to the limits. Movies like this just insult your intelligence insisting we're gullible enough to suspend disbelief to the clearly impossible. And worse, it pretends to preach that the illusions are really possible if you have the skills. This is Hollywood movie execs believing we're all too stupid to know better and that we'll be amazed, not disgusted. Apparently it worked for some of us.<br/><br/>In short, a couple of very unlikable, arrogant mentalists and magicians are summoned by an unknown person to carry out the most incredible magic tricks of all, with each show upping the ante. Who is behind this show? What is the ultimate gain as some huge dollar amounts are affected? Will our smarmy mentalists get caught? Unfortunately the tricks are incredible because they just aren't feasible. And the explanations provided and the reveals told as this movie goes on become incredibly insulting in the final third of the movie. And since virtually none of the characters are likable, it's difficult to know whom you hope comes out on top. And in the end, the real magic trick is that you were just separated from a lot of cash for what amounts to a fraud. And they are going to try this trick again in a sequel, so I hear. Fool me once, shame on you..."

","This is one of the worst movies I have ever watched, purely based off of the hype, people actually told me this movie was smart, I now seriously doubt their intelligence. If you want to watch a movie about magic, please watch ""The Prestige"" and see what a Film made by someone whose main concern is the quality of the picture. I especially dislike a movie when Mark Ruffalo is garbage, this is one of his worst movie, and I feel that he is an actor smarter than the script of this movie, so I do not know why he did it. I guess it can be good when a movie leaves you with questions, but my questions were Why did Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Mark Ruffalo, and Woody Harrelson do this lump of crap? The younger Franco brother has a good screen presence about him, but this movie really did stink, if you like the Fast & Furious franchise and are up to date with that series, this film just might be for you."

Funny moments were tastefully thrown in, and high stake situations were well played out. I personally liked the twist ending, I wasn't expecting it but it was satisfactory. I would definitely watch it again just to see all the subtleties and pay attention to how Mark Ruffalo's character acts with that new context. Great film, I would highly recommend seeing it.

","You should see it!<br/><br/>""Now you see me"" is a thriller directed by Louis Leterrier who has already directed blockbusters like ""The Incredible Hulk"" and ""Clash of the Titans"". The cast is formed by well known actors as Jesse Eisenberg, famous for his performance as Mark Zuckerberg in the movie "" The Social Network "", Mark Ruffalo again impressing everyone with his excellent performance after ""Hulk"" and the eternal Matt of "" 13 going on 30"". Among the writers Ed Solomon stands out, more famous for his work in ""Imagine that"" with Eddie Murphy.<br/><br/>As a plot that leaves no loose ends ""Now you see me"" tells the story of a group of FBI agents running after four famous magicians who use their tricks and illusionism to rob banks and all the money is given to the viewers of their own shows. However, there is much more beyond this abracadabra, because before the four magicians reach the high position they are in, they were recruited by an entity type called The Eye, which selected them, but never introduced itself. Moreover, they do not know The Eye's purpose, motivation and goals. In the middle of the trajectory the magic four - titled as The Four Horsemen - Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg ), the leader of the group, illusionist and showman ; McKinney (Woody Harrelson ), the mentalist ; Henley ( Isla Fisher ) the escapist; and Wilder (Dave Franco), illusionist, street magician, and pickpocket, are faced with Thaddeus ( Morgan Freeman ), an ex-magician who earns his living revealing the other magicians' tricks. In addition he is willing to help the agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo ) and Alma Dray ( Mélanie Laurent ) reveal illusionists' tricks.<br/><br/>Most of the scenes take place in an amazing setting that is Las Vegas, where bright lights, many special effects give the movie an extra shine. Very well built, as already said, the plot leaves nothing without fit. The actors are perfectly engaged and each of their character makes the whole thing seem somehow real. The end is surprising, and unusual, apart from an interesting scene after the credits. Rating: 9"

","The critics, and others, point out that the characters were 'thinly developed' and that the movie lacked substance. It is true that the characters are rather thin. But they, the actors/actresses, are just stage props.<br/><br/>The stereotypical magician is frequent;y assisted by an attractive assistant. In such shows, the magician is the main character and the assistant distracts the audience. Here 'the magic' is the main character and it is the qualities of magic that are developed throughout the movie. The 'human characters' are the stage dressing - the 'attractive assistant', for the magic.<br/><br/>Viewed in this way, the plot is not scattered but flows from one aspect of magic to another throughout the movie and does not lack substance.<br/><br/>The tag line in the movie says it all - the closer you look, the less you see.<br/><br/>My conclusion - good entertainment."

Well I'm not sure what the tagline is getting at, other than a possibly general warning about magicians. The plot is a lot of smoke and mirrors, rather like the tricks the magicians play, and apart from the major twist near the end, is confusing. It was all rather like ""Ocean's Eleven"" but with a weaker cast. Having said that, the script was pretty good and the actors carried it off very well, Woody Harrelson probably being the best of them. Jesse Eisenberg brought the same smug confidence he brought to ""The Social Network,"" Morgan Freeman was excellent, as ever, but Michael Caine was underused. The tricks themselves were impressive, until you remember that Hollywood can do anything with special effects anyway. There looks as though there may be a sequel, but I'm not sure I will bother with it.

","In this movie about the world of magicians, the illusions presented are suitably spectacular. I felt the movie was slick and modern; something suitable for young Americans who have grown up watching these shows on TV.<br/><br/>I think this mildly entertaining movie will have limited appeal to people from countries where programs showing mentalists, illusionists, hypnotists, magicians and so on are not often aired on television. <br/><br/>Those of us who have occasionally enjoyed these shows on TV in the the US and UK may be able to understand the American pop cultural background behind this movie. This film takes this entertainment phenomenon and elevates it to a whole new level by presenting it as something more than it actually is. <br/><br/>My real problem with the movie was that I did not feel like I was watching true ""mentalism"", ""hypnosis"", ""illusions"" or even ""magic"". With CGI special effects and so on, you can essentially show anything on film nowadays. I was not amazed by any of it, because I assumed it was all just movie magic, not real magic.<br/><br/>It also bothered me that most of the illusions would have required hundreds of technicians, builders, etc. to construct and mount.

With the cast that the movie had I guess my expectation was that I would get more, I had hoped to leave feel as I did after see the Prestige, I didn't.

"KineticSeoul","7","1","3","20 June 2013"," Has it's flaws but watchable and entertaining
","Now I wasn't sure I was going to like this flick after seeing the trailers. I don't know it just reminded me of the movie ""Jumper"" except with teens that do magic instead of teleportation as the primary focus. And has a badass black guy that is on their trail, except instead of Samuel L. Jackson it's Morgan Freeman who is always awesome on screen whether he be the good guy or the villain. In fact he is the show stealer in this movie in my opinion, his on screen presence always absorbed me into the movie. Magic is basically the art of being quick, swift and clever enough to trick the human eyes. And maybe a bit of mind games thrown in there to divert the attention from how the trick is really done. But it can also just be an optical illusion. It's kinda like pulling off a heist in a lot of ways, except it's legal. Except in this the team is really pulling off heists. While cops on on their traile, including Morgan Freeman's character who is a magician himself. And knows just about all the tricks of the game. Although this is watchable and entertaining the main flaw is how stupid it becomes. Despite few clever moments. And it's not really all the magic aspect of this movie, things just become really dumb to the point it gets kinda irritating since it just doesn't make much sense. And the plot seems to be all over the place, I am not sure if it's to give off an illusion to make it seem more clever and intelligent than it really is. But it just didn't seem coherent. After the long build up the ending also seemed a bit rushed. Despite the flaws this is a watchable movie that is actually worth a matinée price to go see. In fact this movie got me into doing few magic tricks of my own.<br/><br/>7.4/10"
"williamhume","7","1","3","19 June 2013"," Oh No You Don't
","Review: I believe anything is worth seeing at least once, especially so for an original idea; magicians that rob a bank, how has this not been done before? Which is why I was particularly excited to go see ""Now You See Me"". However, I am somewhat superstitious when it comes to watching movies in theatres, every time during a movie when someone leans over and whispers to me something like ""this is actually pretty good"", my expectations start to dip, and with that they are met. It's almost a self fulfilling prophecy I think a film is about to head down hill and it does.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"", is a perfect analogy for Common's film career, as well as his starring role in the movie. The scenes that lead the audience through the first two acts of this movie are all very enjoyable. The action is of course fun to watch and well staged, and the characters, though all mostly one dimensional are played by good looking (the women anyway) and very charismatic actors, and the film has many funny moments. I felt duped though as the magicians themselves are pretty much sidelined, and the majority of the screen time is given to Mark Ruffalo. It's the Ruffalo show! His romantic sub-plot with Melanie Laurent really doesn't go too far or is that compelling, which is ridiculous. Because it seems Mark Ruffalo phones it in here, yet how can you not fall in love with Melanie Laurent? (shown below) In short on that matter, I'll just say its not on the ""13 Going On 30"" level of romantic tension.<br/><br/>Oooh stop it! Melanie Laurent you are too cute! The Director can't quite pull all the threads in this film together. The whole film hypes up its ending as something to amaze, but it seems to lack any meaningful resolution or conclusion in my opinion. I mean it all comes together, just not with much sense A lot of it just kind of happens, entertaining but meaningless. As the credits suddenly rolled I was left disappointed and bewildered knowing the marketing team got the slight of hand on me. Overall Scale: +1"
"CourtneyCaballero","5","1","3","18 June 2013"," It was somewhat enjoyable.
","I really enjoyed this film...until the ending. I liked how the characters interacted with each other and how there was a sense of mystery the whole time, but I became disappointed once the ""big reveal"" happened. I was hoping for something worth being dramatic over, considering that's what you were kind of being prepared for. Without giving any spoilers all I have to say about the ending was that it just seemed to happen a bit quickly and I didn't feel that it was believable. Although I do have to say it was worth watching once, but I won't be going out to buy the DVD or anything, and at least Dave Franco was an attractive face to look at for some time."
"ihatespike","Null","1","3","31 May 2013"," A very fun, slightly flawed movie
","First of all, let me say that this film does not break your trust by tossing out some deus ex machina explanation at the end or plot-twist you so hard your head falls off. The threads of story, while somewhat outlandish, are well-woven and resolved almost totally satisfactorily. That's basically my fancy way of saying I didn't guess the ending, it did make sense, and the journey there was fun.<br/><br/>I wouldn't say that this is a highly intellectual movie with layers and layers of philosophical questions to ponder over after it's over, but it isn't stupid either. You're not bored by over-complexity or insulted by the inanely simple. I appreciate that balance.<br/><br/>The cast is solid but the characters could (and should have) been explored more without any worry over the plot getting spoiled. Because of this missed opportunity you may question the overall motivation of the antiheroes, especially since your first impression of the four magicians is that they are selfish and have no grandiose plans for their lives. This doesn't mean they aren't easy to like, but I feel it does clash with the story later on.<br/><br/>The visuals/camarawork are nice (although occasionally too spinney and maybe just a little too glossy), the humor and the romance are felt and enjoyed- no baggage, no complication, no melodrama, and the magic is explained. In real life, we know that commercial slight of hand needs to be left unexplained otherwise it loses its worth, but the makers of this movie know that film must tie the loose ends because the satisfaction is the conclusion, NOT the mystery in and of itself.<br/><br/>That being said, I will admit the overall conclusion was left just a tiny bit blurry, which may be due to the hope for a sequel. I'd honestly be okay with that as I feel this film earned it. Moviegoers may begrudge it that open-ended feeling though, if they felt that the explanation was not a justifiable payoff. My advice is to go see it, have fun, and let your belief be suspended. At worst the hypnotism will leave you disoriented and grumpy, at best you'll have a blast and come back down as soft as a feather."

Okay, they've explained all that, and yes, it was obvious and done before but looks like they got that out of the way, and maybe there's something more to come. 4.

Wow, in addition to being magicians, hypnotists and sleight of hand experts, these guys are also frickin Ninjas. 6. Jesse Eisenberg is playing the same character he played in that Facebook movie, and I'm perplexed as to how Mark Zuckerburg developed those ninja skills. 7. Two Words: Far. Fetched. 8.

","Sometimes I'm the guy in the room that has no idea what's going on in the movie, and this is one of those cases. Now You See Me brings out the magic of illusion as a group of four small time magicians make a mysterious visit to a meeting and a year later become the Four Horsemen - Daniel, Merritt, Henley and Jack. The Four Horsemen perform a big stage wonder in Las Vegas where the grand finale is a bank robbed from Paris and the robbed money is given to the audience. This show is funded by millionaire Arthur Tressler. What seems like illusion turns out to be completely real, the bank was really robbed. The Four Horseman perform another act in New Orleans and this time it's Tressler they rob. Dylan (FBI) and Alma (Interpol) take on this very interesting case and get lost in the world of illusion. Dylan seeks aid from magician Thaddeus who can help unmask how the events took place, but in this work of illusion is everyone who they say they are? This movie has an unexpected twist at the ending and it is very dazzling and brilliant and so much fun to watch the magic acts.

","""Now You See Me"" is a good movie and is definitely entertaining. There is not a whole lot else to this, though, other than those two things. I do believe this film has substance, but not too much. It is mostly just an entertaining crime thriller with some comedy and romance mixed into the equation, which spells out 'fun' for me.<br/><br/>I like this movie, but it is not the best. Sometimes, the movie felt somewhat contrived, trying to be really smart and unique, when it really does things that have been done hundreds of times before. Now, this movie does it all fairly well, but like I said, it feels a tad bit forced sometimes. The ending had a huge twist which I sort of saw coming, because as I have said, it has been done before. It could have been done a little better, I must say. Also, I do think the film might have been more interesting had it been a more science-fantasy-like film, although that is just my opinion. The film presents an interesting concept, but the twist ending tramples on that concept a bit. Maybe I set my expectations a little too high, but whatever the case is, it is a fine flick that is great for watching with family or friends.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" has a great cast, consisting of mainly big-name actors and actresses. I enjoyed their acting very much. Plus, the film's special effects were superbly done, and some of the more action-like moments were very thrilling and kept you close to the screen, wanting to see what happens next. That is saying a whole bunch, considering I am not even a fan of action at all.<br/><br/>Maybe a second viewing will change my perspective of this film, but for now, it is a solid 7 out of 10.

Most of the magic/illusions and tricks were no great surprise and were fairly predictable. Although Disappointing in this area, the movie was actually very entertaining. Jesse Eissenberg has proved that he is no ""flash in the pan"" and really shone in this movie proving that he can handle a sizable role. Isla Fisher was as gorgeous as ever but with no real meat to her character she was there more for the aesthetics.

It is simply fantastic entertainment that keeps the viewer glue to the screen trying to figure out the impossible things that are happening to a superlative groups of actors playing well written roles (written by Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt) and directed with aplomb by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk, Transporter 2, Unleashed, and the soon to be made Now You See Me 2!) whose imagery and imagination is endless.<br/><br/>The story is simple but inordinately complex in the way it is shared. Four magicians each answer a mysterious summons to an obscure address with secrets inside. A year later, they are the Four Horseman (Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), big time stage illusionists who climax their sold out Las Vegas show with a bank apparently robbed for real. This puts agents Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) of the FBI and Alma Vargas (Mélanie Laurent) of Interpol on the case to find out how they did it. However, this mystery proves difficult to solve even with the insights of the professional illusion exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). What follows is a bizarre investigation where nothing is what it seems with illusions, dark secrets and hidden agendas galore as all involved are reminded of a great truth in this puzzle: the closer you look, the less you see. Add to this rather amazing cast the talents of Michael Caine, Michael Kelly, Common, David Warshofsky, José Garcia, and Elias Koteas and the talents of Brian Tyler, musical score and the cinematography by Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong and this film becomes addictive. How to spend a summer evening! <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","First of all I want to tell you that I am really hard to be impressed by the movie, but this one makes me say..YES this move is masterpiece!! First it has good actors, I like them all in their roles. Morgan Freeman is outstanding as always. Second this movie is incredibly intelligent and has a good story, unpredictable ending..it is very exciting to watch from the beginning to the end. The third is music , I really liked the main theme which goes throughout whole movie.. music is glamorous so as they are the shows from ""Four Horseman"". It seems that this movie will have a sequel I know it will be hard to beat first one but let see and wait for another advantures of the ""four horseman"" and the ""eye"" I give this move 10/10 best movie in 2013 so far!!

","The movie has an interesting screenplay that keeps you on the edge of your seat through out the length. Its not boring at any point which makes it a movie worth watching. <br/><br/>Coming to the story part, it is just another revenge movie, flavored in magic and illusion. Four selected magicians are grouped together to put up a big stage performance. Initially it gives a sense that they are working for a big purpose but later we get know that even 'The four horsemen' do not know who hired them and on what purpose and the climax reveals that its simply one man's revenge on a bank and an insurance company but helps out all the victims in the process. But the hidden motive was to take revenge on an illusion exposer (a person who exposes other magician's logic and earns money) who was indirectly responsible for his father's death. <br/><br/>The revenge achieved through four enthusiastic youngsters who wanted to achieve something big in life makes it interesting and keeps the audience connected. <br/><br/>In all, it is a movie that provides the entertainment when not looked much into logic or morality, because everything that is happening is an 'illusion - a planned distraction with a hidden motive'. Don't look at it too close, ""the closer u look, the less u see""...Thanks for reading, Have a great day!!"

","The only bad thing, which is a big one, is the dialog style. Maybe the editing had to do with it sucking big time. Other than this, Now You See Me is a shocker!<br/><br/>Why? Because it has twists, turns, chase sequences, betrayals & most importantly, revenge juxtaposed into its screenplay. The story is nothing to boast about, but the plot definitely cracks a punch. Writing is fresh, like I said.<br/><br/>About the staleness, performances are tad cringe-worthy. Mark Ruffalo & Jesse Eisenberg are what I'm talking about. Maybe it had to with their characters; that is the point - lots of maybes here! So, 7.3 out of 10 for this surprising attempt by the guy who gave us the Transporter series.<br/><br/>Music is gold, cinematography is silver while CGI & VFX are platinum.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Recommended to people who love caper stories, with Hollywood smeared onto it.

","Wow! very entertaining from start to just before the finish. I loved the complexity of the story and the ability for the magic to still amaze even through the screen. However the ending fell flat. While i did not see the detectives character to surprise us with his involvement in the ploy how the story wrapped up lacked the level of surprise and whit shown throughout the film. I wanted an ending that was as smart as the magic shows not the regular old ""surprise its me"" that so often happens in ending twists. I wanted an ending that was so full of magic that i would have to think it through two or three times to get it. This was no ""The usual suspects"", the depth of the detectives character did not run far enough into the story for us to truly be amazed. They could have made any one of the characters the secret magician for example the female detectives character or Thaddeuses the hidden magician. It felt, for me, that this was where the story fell flat. The depth and meaning behind the reason of why Agent Fuller was in the end the key eye magician was just not there. Laying over the story of his passed away grandfather felt like a band aid solution for what is a very cool and unique movie that had the intention of a cool and mind blowing ending."
"tradewinds68","7","1","4","17 August 2013"," High Grade Acting Low Grade Chemistry
","Now You See Me is an interesting movie based on a unique concept. The plot was quite good and the acting, for the most part, was also good. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Woody Harrelson, as usual, did not disappoint. The chemistry, however, between Mark Ruffalo's and Melanie Laurent's characters, FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes and Interpol Agent Alma Dray, was seriously lacking. This lent little credibility to the budding relationship and was a poor mix of dynamics for a love tryst. Having said this, the little twists and turns throughout the movie were intriguing and kept me guessing as to the identity of the person behind the four horsemen. All in all, it was enjoyable if you can sit through the moments where Rhodes and Dray are forced by the script writer into trying to look as if they're interested in each other. I've given it a 7 out of 10 for managing to keep me in the cinema and genuinely surprise me at the end."
"rubenm","7","1","4","10 August 2013"," Mainstream Hollywood, but in fact quite good
","I mostly watch art-house movies, but once in a while, Hollywood surprises me in a positive way. I really enjoyed watching 'Now You See Me'. Amidst the mindless violent crap and the overdose of special effects that Hollywood usually produces (I admit, perhaps I'm a bit prejudiced) this film stands out. It's a fast-paced, well-acted and original film that doesn't give you a chance to get bored. Of course, It's light-hearted entertainment and nothing more, and in some scenes the Hollywood predictability gets the upper hand. The car chase is a tired cliché, and the developing romance between two detectives is out of place in this film. I would also have appreciated a less cheesy ending. <br/><br/>On the other hand, the start of the film is wonderful. In four short, fast scenes, the leads are introduced. Each of them is a magician and we see them performing their tricks. It's exciting, it's funny and it's spectacular. The scene introducing Woody Harrelson is the best: he is great as a mentalist who can blackmail his adulterous victim in a few seconds, while his wife is standing by. <br/><br/>The film is essentially a traditional heist movie (think: Ocean's Eleven, Reservoir Dogs, The Italian Job) with a bunch of specialists who come together for a huge bank robbery. Only this time, the specialists are not professional bank robbers, but magicians, who call themselves The Four Horsemen. And they rob the bank while performing their show in Las Vegas. <br/><br/>This original concept is worked out very well. The tag line 'The closer you look, the less you see' is not just a phrase, but serves in fact as the main theme throughout the film, even up to the last surprising twist. <br/><br/>I was also pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack. For a change, it is not full of rock songs or spectacular sound effects, but has a nice, catchy orchestral theme that is being played during the magic shows of The Four Horsemen. A little detail I didn't like is the title. It's bland, forgettable and not related to the theme. Why not 'The Four Horsemen', or 'The Eye'. Something more intriguing would have fitted the theme of illusion versus reality."

","I was looking forward for this movie for months, and finally yesterday I was able to watch it and I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Let me tell you this just straight up, ""Now you see me"" its no a cinematography achievement by any means. The story might be pretty straightforward, nothing special in the acting department, decent visual effects, but the whole assembly works great, this is a fun an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>This movie is far superior than ""The Incredible Burt Wonderstone"" ( really bad by the way) don't watch that, this is the magic movie of this summer<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this flick to any magic enthusiasts out there,"
"filmtrance","7","1","4","29 July 2013"," A modern day Prestige? Not quite the Nolan masterpiece, but has a lot of qualities.
","Now You See Me, the latest film directed by Transporter director Louis Leterrier, brings the extravagance of 21st century 'magic' to the screen in this modern crime/thriller held together by an extremely talented ensemble cast including Morgan Freeman, Michael Cane and Mark Ruffalo.<br/><br/>The magic is the distraction in what is a film that turns out to be a highly enjoyable revenge flick. The plot involves the 'four horsemen' J. Daniel Atlas (Jessie Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), who are four extremely talented magicians hand picked as part of a mystic cult led by an unknown entity. The opening of the film sets the characters up well, each exposing their talents in the field leading them to come together with one thing in common: they each possessed a mysterious tarot card that led them to become the 'four horsemen'. From then on without knowing whom they were working for or why, the four magicians set upon amazing acts of illusion that left both the country and more importantly, the FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) mystified, including the first act: robbing a French bank. As an audience you will be led down a path of mystery. Are they acts of greed, defiance, or for a greater good? This is what Leterrier does so well in transcending to the screen, as in not just the mystery surrounding it all, but displaying it in a very modern, extravagant and high-tech way.<br/><br/>The film has been dubbed by some as the new 'Prestige'. Although it is not in the same class as Christopher Nolan's fantastic old school magicians tale, it shares similarities in its mysteriousness. Jessie Eisenburg and Woody Harrelson steal the show performance-wise. Despite their individual screen time decreasing as the film goes on, both demonstrate their ability to hold an audience with ease, adding wit and charm to their characters so comfortably. Now You See Me is more than a magic film. Some viewers may get lost behind the bright lights and glamour of it all, but this has more depth to it than that."

","Is there anyone who doesn't like good magic show? Few years ago I witnessed one of most amazing magic show at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. Sitting in a theatre at the very first row and wondering all that magic and how it's done just few meters away from my eyes. The magician was David Copperfield and show was pure magic and at the end of the show magician shook hand with all the peoples at the first row. I was sold. Maybe that is the one reason I liked this movie very much. It started at Las Vegas in MGM Grand hotel. This movie is great illusion entertainment, almost perfect. This is visually and fantastic movie. Four magician works together perfectly and Brian Tyler's music full fill excitement. Viewer is constantly derived to think what happens next, just to see that you were wrong. That is why the end of the movie is too annoying and frustration. With better ending it would be perfect for five stars, now we have to acquiesce for four star. It is great entertainment anyway.<br/><br/>****"
"noahsmyth98","8","1","4","15 July 2013"," And Now You Go See It
","I just returned with a family visit to watch the much anticipated film for a clan of us magic- adorers. With the classics such as Prestige backlogged and the disappointing Burt Wonderstone washed away from our minds, we ventured to view this.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenburg is as great as always. Similar to a Mark Zuckerberg, he plays a quick-witted, fast-talking ace who lives in a very controlling mindframe. The beautiful Isla Fisher, his glamorous past assistant determined to prove her excellence. The great Woody Harrelson as the mentalist, often the two phrases for the word flickering between his character. And the young Dave Franco as the young, loyal member of the troop.<br/><br/>The film is overall very clever. Upon four magicians discovering an array of blueprints for magical machinery, they set out for stardom following the rules and paths of this plan devised by the almost fictitious card-requester. Morgan Freeman plays a very condescending guy towards the FBI, impersonating the role and the persona of a magician, whilst at the same time being a failure of one.<br/><br/>The actual magic shows are very little, disappointing, though it fits with the plot. Mark Ruffalo is a detective, constantly overshadowed and a few steps behind these Magicians.<br/><br/>Thats why the film excels. The acting is very strong and the character development is little though the point is clearly made. The film stresses several main themes of 'everything is not as you see' and 'viewing the big picture'.<br/><br/>An understandable 8/10"
"jaidenfrostTV","8","1","4","14 July 2013"," Great flick... but not Oceans.
","I found the film to be exhilarating, tastefully hilarious and visually stunning. The amount of twists and turns that are unexpected are as much to try to figure out as they are to watch. <br/><br/>Here are my issues with it though.<br/><br/>NYSM failed to develop the characters fully. When Jack ""dies"" I seriously didn't care, which is absurd for me. I cry over the tiniest cinematic things. I didn't feel connected to the character, no matter how much I wanted to. Isla Fisher's character felt rather useless other than her apparent eye candy appeal. As far as the performance wise, out of the Horsemen I truly felt that Eisenberg and Woody carried it. Though I didn't feel connected to them either. The primary amount of development rode on the characters of the detectives which was difficult to understand why the writers would have me develop such close interest in the ""antagonists"" other than the apparent twist at the end. <br/><br/>The ending was a little overwhelming and obnoxious as far as VFX was concerned. The holograms on the building was a little too much and not explained. The card lighting up in the tree and the tarot cards becoming suddenly magnetic in it's presence was a tad bit too much. <br/><br/>Though the comparison was mentioned a lot by critics, overall this film was not Oceans.<br/><br/>8/10"

The twist at the end is predictable yet thrilling as the focus is shifted across characters.The drawback is the movie is that the magical tricks are left unexplained. The first and second acts are explained but the final act is not explained which leaves a big question mark. The end of the movie seems to be a set up for a sequel to come. One might be reminded of the movie The Prestige but this movie does not have the credibility behind the magic tricks that is so evident.A little more time devotion to the background of the tricks could have struck a chord with the audience and made it more entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall , Now you see me is an engrossing crime thriller which is sure to keep you on the edge of seat.

"ricardopthomaz","8","1","4","9 July 2013"," Great fun!
","""That was a great concert!""<br/><br/>Those were my thoughts when I was walking out of the movie theater. Long story short: it's a heist movie with magic as a background turned into a huge visual attraction, almost glamorizing burglars. It's not something new, you probably saw this a thousand times before with movies like The Prestige or Ocean's Eleven, in fact, this movie not only takes a lot of the concepts from The Prestige by Christopher Nolan and being two steps ahead being the smartest guy in the room in Ocean's Eleven and mix them to work together with great visual and art concepts that would make a director like Baz Luhrmann applaud as loud as he can but also elevates these concepts to the heights, putting into practice everything we saw in the famous Christopher Nolan movie.<br/><br/>So, there's nothing really new here, but it's well made, well orchestrated, gives you tons of fun and a thousand twists, I mean, holy moly, this movie has more turns and endings than Return of the King, when you think you had it figured out, it just fools you once again! Anyway, it's a nice spectacle, worth the admission ticket, go watch it! And also has great actors like Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Woody Harrelson and others.<br/><br/>I've just saw it and I enjoyed the ride, so yeah, it's worth of your attention. Just take care and don't play the fool in front of your friends thinking you know what the twist is gonna be. Pay attention to the details and don't look so close."
"mariogamer2000","8","1","4","7 July 2013"," Better than The Prestige (Dont read if you like long reviews)
","Please note* This a short review, if you don't like short review's do no read. Thank you. <br/><br/>I know a lot of people are going to dislike this straight away because of the summary title. But I just want to quickly justify the title(This is only my opinion, Im not forcing it) The reason I liked this a lot more is for one thing, this seemed more believable. Being a small time magician myself I know for a fact everything in this film was possible, unlike The prestige where that went too sci-fi for my liking. Although both films had a great cast, this film just outdid it. Every character was played by very talented actor. <br/><br/>Now about the film. I loved mark ruffalo in this movie, he was amazing. Ever since Shutter Island he's been impressing the hell out of me with his performances, for me he stole the show the entire film. Followed by Jesse, he was great too, although he plays the same kind of nerdy character, he was just perfect for this role. Another actor who I thought stood out was Dave Franco, I thought he was great and he's character was really believable. And I loved his act of the film, it was very entertaining. All the cast did great but I don't have time to talk about everyone, but I must say, every actor added something special to this film and It was a pleasure to see them all in one film. <br/><br/>Now about the filmography. The directing was good, I bit shaky and quick at times but I got used to it. Because the film is so fast paced,which leads me to the editing. The editing was so sharp, every frame just seemed to fit in great and cut with great timing. Again one reason the film had such a good flowing movement to it. Also the opening scene had great cinematography, its not consistent throughout the film of course, because the film becomes fast paced, but the opening scene was great. <br/><br/>The score. Oh my goodness, Im I the only one who thought the music in this film got to repetitive and annoying. Im not sure but for me the music was a downside after a while It got too annoying. Also the whole film does seem to become a bit repetitive, its like you've seen one scene and then its onto to the next scene which is almost identical. Also the film could of answered a few more questions but I suppose it did leave it open for a Sequel and I do kind of the think it adds to the film to make you wonder a little after the credits show. Apart from that I cant find anything really wrong with the film. I thought it was a highly entertaining film, that you can go and watch with your younger brother.<br/><br/>So Im going to give Now You See Me, 4 Stars. IMDb rating (8/10)<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review and have a great time watching this movie. :) :)<br/><br/>Also please forgive any bad punctuation lol, my writing is not the best.(As you can tell)"
"MUFCOK","8","1","4","4 July 2013"," Different than I thought .. Although that's not a bad thing
","This film had a bit of everything... Action, comedy, suspense and even romance.<br/><br/>The story was interesting enough, basic but interesting. The visuals were good and the cinematography was well done.<br/><br/>I felt the cast were very well picked and came across together very well. Woody Harrelson was brilliant in this film, very quirky and interesting.<br/><br/>The movie is very well paced, from the 1st minute to the last I found myself very entertained and didn't once feel my attention slipping. The main scenes in the movie come and go very well and it never feels as if they are dragging out a scene/situation.<br/><br/>The only gripes I have of this movie is the character development. I found it near non existent. I didn't feel as if i cared much for any of the characters, be it the magicians or the FBI. The film is so fast paced and it didn't seem to slow to build any characters stories.<br/><br/>The magic scenes are good, the cat and mouse chase scenes are good but I still can't help feel disappointed about the weak character development, especially with it being such a strong cast.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to anyone, plenty of twists and turns, laughs and suspense to keep you thoroughly entertained.<br/><br/>8/10"
"PassPopcorn","6","1","4","28 June 2013"," Pass the Popcorn review
","Now You See Me is the newest movie directed by Louis Leterrier, the man who brought us mainly mindless action movies like The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans and Transporter 1 & 2, which is interesting since all the trailers presented Now You See Me as a movie that strives to become something more than a mindless action movie - they presented it as a somewhat intelligent crime/thriller movie. But, hey, even the movie itself says 'come in close, because the more you think you see, the easier it'll be to fool you'. And that's what happened, I saw the trailers and thought I will be seeing an intelligent crime/thriller movie; and I was fooled. Instead I got a boring, fairly mindless movie with some, clearly, needlessly long action scenes.<br/><br/>Let me start of with the plot first. So, what is Now You See Me about? I could say that Now You See Me is a movie about 4 magicians called the 4 horsemen - consisting of J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) whose magic acts are a front for robberies, and try to escape an FBI agent who is after them. I could also say that Now You See Me is about an FBI agent named Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) who, aided by an Interpol agent named Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent), is trying to catch these magicians. I could even go as far as to say the movie is about an ex-magician named Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) who tries to expose these 4 magicians and make money off of it. Furthermore, there is Michael Caine somewhere in the equation.<br/><br/>I really applaud the movie for assembling such a great cast (maybe the best cast I've seen in a while), however Now You See Me's greatest merit is its greatest flaw. There are just too many characters in the movie, and none of them get enough screen time. Moreover, there are too many subplots, and the movie constantly changes its focus. Who are we, the audience, supposed to root for? For the magicians to succeed in their plans? For the agents to catch the magicians? For Morgan Freeman to reveal the magicians? As a result of these rapid focus changes and the undeveloped characters I completely lost my interest for the movie half way through. Which is a shame, since the majority of the cast are wonderful actors who could have shined in their roles - had they only had something to work with. Eisenberg and Harrelson have no chemistry whatsoever nor do they share much screen time, in spite of the superb chemistry they showed in Zombieland. The only pair that's worse than them are Laurent and Ruffalo, who are awkwardly forced into a romantic subplot.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don't care about the characters and just want to see some pretty good scenes with amazing magic tricks (which were the best part of the movie), a somewhat decent and original story and obligatory car chase scenes, knock yourself out! Your money will be definitely well spent if you're not looking for anything more than a forgetfully fun movie. As for myself, I think the movie's title - Now You See Me - is pretty fitting. This is, hopefully, the only time I'm seeing this movie and never again. Since I don't want to get fooled again.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/"
"jillvesta16","9","1","4","28 June 2013"," This is fun.
","I can sum up Now You See Me in one word: fun. But, obviously, I can't stick with one word to talk about this film! <br/><br/>Yes, it was incredibly entertaining. You will remain interested in the overall plot the entire time. Another one of this film's selling points was its uniqueness. This summer, we've gotten a lot of explosions, big names, superheroes in powerful suits, several versions of the impending apocalypse, and an overdose of hype underscoring the madness. And in Now You See Me, there's some action. The roster is pretty much loaded; unless you live under a rock, you will recognize at least two of these actors. But the premise, magicians using tricks to pull off heists, is something you're not going to see every day. Even its title, ""Now You See Me,"" is unusual. It's different. And that's a good thing.<br/><br/>The recurring idea, ""The closer you look, the less you'll actually see,"" is truly the theme of the movie on a whole lot of levels. You'll have to watch it to see what I mean, but it explains almost everything, including the feel of the movie itself.<br/><br/>I'll admit, character development was comparable to that of a Mission: Impossible film, but this was also a plot-based movie, not a exhibition of the human emotions. That being said, many of the characters were quite entertaining and at times hilarious, especially Harrelson's and Eisenberg's. There wasn't a whole lot of a message or social commentary here (which was actually a relief). Instead, they kept the pace fast, the production quality high, and the corny drama levels at a blessed minimum. Alright, the ""romance"" is pretty cheesy, but it's a sideline story and does not really affect the main plot.<br/><br/>There are a couple of bad words, a few suggestive dialogues, and one somewhat inappropriate scene (it's near the beginning), so the PG-13 rating is probably fair, but don't let it scare you. I've definitely seen a lot worse out of this rating category.<br/><br/>And finally, the much-debated conclusion. It is certainly surprising but in a good way; I have no further comment but you should decide for yourself what you think about it.<br/><br/>Rewatchability: Unless you were totally disgusted by the conclusion, it's likely possible to watch this movie again when it comes out on DVD to explain everything, and to see the tricks again. However, do NOT read spoilers before seeing it at all, because that would take away all of the fun! <br/><br/>At the end, they have certainly set the stage (pun not intended) for a sequel. I personally think it's a one and done enterprise, and a follow-up will only ruin the magic (another ""accidental"" pun), but the film's done well enough at the box office that they might give it a shot, if they can get all of the Horsemen back together. Like I said, though, I really hope that they won't.<br/><br/>You will not be bored by this movie. You will not fall asleep. It's got a little bit of everything in it. Will it amaze you with its deep meaning? Not really. You can't look too closely at that, because it doesn't really exist. But it will engage you in its intrigue and attitude. Definitely recommended."

The characters are developed much better than the plot...but it's about them. This is a fun and thoughtful film. It keeps you guessing and when you think you know, you don't.

"PWNYCNY","8","1","4","25 June 2013"," Interesting take on the con-job theme.
","This is an offbeat movie that approaches the level of excellence but does not quite make it. The story is cleverly developed and the acting excellent but in total the project, although entertaining, just misses the mark. The biggest problem with the movie is the ending, which will not be revealed here. Suffice it to say, however, that it could have been treated better. Also, James Franco, although a wonderful actor, seemed to be not the right actor for the part of the FBI agent, which is the principal character in the story. Not that he does not do a good job with the role, but it seems that the story required a different kind of character than the one played by Franco. As for the rest of the cast, they are excellent. Morgan Freeman again delivers a strong performance and Michael Caine is superb. These wonderful actors, both up in years, defy time. One thing this movie shows is that inside information plus some cleverly staged tricks can produce some interesting results, especially when money is involved."

","Now you see me was a spectacular film by which I have not seen compared to any other film. They draw you in perfectly and make the film very entertaining, all of the actors are amazing.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo was very convincing throughout the whole film, portraying his character very well, bring some humor and entertainment to the screen. Isla Fisher brought about great acting while looking dazzling throughout the whole film. Jesse Eisenberg was also very convincing, he really could be a magician for all we know! <br/><br/>As for the story, it was very interesting. Many turns and twists throughout. The story developed quickly, not too fast mind you, and caught the attention of audiences easily. The tricks, turns, tears and shock this film brings work together in perfect unison bring a perfect mixture of flavors blended perfectly for such a film.<br/><br/>The only downside I have with the film, as pointed out by a friend, is it gets a little bit Sc-Fi towards the end. That being said, this is easily plausible considering the thoughts of magic and illusion, as most magic is, and still bring about a very enticing story. It wraps it all up nicely in a red bow but still may leave you a little bit confused. But is confusion a bad thing? Not always."

","Best movie to come out in 2013. You go the movie not knowing exactly what to expect, and you leave smiling. How can you go wrong, yes maybe not the best movie some of there actors have done but it is a far cry from being bad. While watching the movie you look forward to seeing what is going to happen next. It is a movie that predicting what is going to happen next, is just going to leave you guessing and you will find out you were guessing wrong the whole time. The ending was a twist you don't see in Hollywood enough. I look forward to see if they can make a sequel to this movie and not ruin what could be a good franchise. There is much more they can do with this movie so much more they can touch and bring to forefront about the characters you meet and the ones they only mention. Go see this movie you can not go wrong."

","I saw this movie today and wasn't expecting much, but I was completely blown away with the story line in this movie. It literally makes you think one thing and then it does the exact opposite. This movie had me thinking for hours after wards. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, and (spoiler alert) I never expected the master mind to be Mark Ruffalo's character, like my mind was blown. And all the tricks with the switching of the cars, I honestly thought that guy in the car had died, and I was so shocked to see that they did the switch and he lived. I was wondering in the beginning why they were showing the bunny in the box trick because I thought that trick is so boring and old school, but it made sense to connect it to the safe scene where they put in the mirrors and make them believe the safe is already gone. ""The closer you look the less you see"" was the perfect theme for this movie, because it stayed constant throughout the whole film. Not to mention I already love magic and the mysteriousness to it all, so this movie was just a home run for me, and definitely a good way to spend time and money."

","Magic has returned to the silver screen, and it comes in the form of the original (NOT based off of a book; when was the last time that happened?) movie Now You See Me. In this new thriller, four former street magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) are brought together to pull off the heist of a lifetime, all while putting on a performance that no one will ever forget. When a level-headed woman from Interpol (Mélanie Laurent), a frazzled FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo), and a former entertainer turned magic buster (Morgan Freeman) start to hunt them down, the Four Horsemen must pull out all their tricks in order to elude them, and to be able to perform their greatest spectacle of all.<br/><br/>Not only is this film extremely entertaining, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. What is amazing about this movie, is that it perfectly reflects the feelings experienced at a true magic show; the feeling of awe, the questioning of how it is done, the expectation of what will happen next, and the thrill of not being denied the enjoyment of a good, quality, show.<br/><br/>There are multiple twists in this movie, yet none of them cause the audience to despise the surprises (unlike the recent disappointment of a good number of movie goers when they met Trevor from Iron Man 3). The story line has an impeccable balance of thrill and comedy, where one moment the atmosphere will be tense during an interrogation, and the next the mind reading member of the group (Harrelson) will start giving a therapy session to the two agents about their relationship, although they just met.<br/><br/>There have been many complaints about unanswered questions left by the movie, though perhaps that is the point. Who hasn't left a magic show with a question or two buzzing around in their mind? And can we say . . . sequel? Taking a break from wizards and spells (looking at you, Harry) Now You See Me reintroduces the art of the true magician, and their amazing ability to enchant us with their clever tricks and performances. With a spellbinding cast and mesmerizing storyline, Now You See Me will make you believe in magic once again."
"belovedseo","3","1","4","16 June 2013"," Promising beginnings, and then utter disappointment
","The movie in regards to its theatrics and the way it presented itself was amazing. I particularly fell in love with the fight scenes because they were so well-executed (despite the fact that I highly doubt anyone could be held at bay for that long because his jacket was caught in the garbage disposal). When the film began I was honestly very interested in the way things would turn out -- the presence of ""magic"" brought a peculiar sense of wonder and curiosity to the film that is rarely reciprocated in other movies.<br/><br/>That said, the movie focused much too heavily on the magic and not enough on the actual characters that comprised the movie. The lack of characterization for the members of the Four Horsemen made me disinterested in them specifically and only attracted me when I saw another ""trick"" being performed. Nothing character wise is developed throughout the movie at all. We know Daniel is controlling because the trait is literally handed to us at the beginning. We know Jack is cheeky and young but yearning to be recognized as an equal because Daniel addresses this desire directly before handing him an order. What about Henley and Merritt? Daniel and Henley have a ""thing"", but it serves little to no purpose and is constantly cast aside, and Merritt is simply tossed into the guidelines of ""that guy who makes all the smart quips at the right times"". The movie made me disinterested in the characters as a whole because they were barely characters as opposed to clichés.<br/><br/>The police force was genuinely useless throughout the entire movie and only served as a foil to show how cunning and intelligent the magicians were, which was disappointing. Thaddeus had so much potential as a character yet even he was just used to explain tactics and reason things out. After all, since the police are such dunderheads, how will the audience be able to know how the Four Horsemen pulled off their schemes without Thaddeus briefly explaining it and proceeding to do nothing about it?<br/><br/>Even though there was so much of the movie that made an impression on me in terms of the visual effects, the interesting premise, the acting and the captivating twists and turns, all of it was deflated after the ""twist ending"". Everything the audience learned about Dylan was cast aside for that twist ending of ""the good guy is actually the ultimate bad guy!!!"" which has already been wrung out time and time again in film history. Also, he falls in love. Quite suddenly so. Not that it actually means anything in the larger concept of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was enjoyable despite its flaws. The only time I was significantly disappointed with it was the ending, which didn't shock me as it was supposed to but rather made me tilt my head in confusion. People should watch this movie if they want entertainment at face value, but nobody should expect a very lasting impression from it."
"akshay-ak-kumar","8","1","4","15 June 2013"," Excellent suspense film on magic
","Three dialogues define this movie...<br/><br/>'The more you look, the less you see.', 'The closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see.' and my favorite 'The job of the assistant is to divert you from the magician's real trick'.<br/><br/>The movie starts well and when the interval came, all of us in the theatre where clueless as to what is happening. Its only in last 10 mins that things fall in place which is the beauty of this movie. <br/><br/>As the audience I kept guessing abt how this movie will end and when it comes...I figured out none of us ever had of clue !!<br/><br/>And when I came back home, the 3 dialogues struck me and things finally fell in place for me.<br/><br/>Its an excellent film and a definitely a must watch. Its falls just short of Nolan's 'The Prestige' which I consider the best film on magic till date."

","Perhaps NOW YOU DON'T, the second half of the famous line NOW YOU SEE ME, would be a more fitting title After we get to know ""The Four Horseman,"" a group of magician/con artists using their showcase to steal from the rich and give to the poor (think David Copperfield meets Robin Hood), we don't see them very much or get to know them all too well. <br/><br/>That's not entirely bad since Mark Ruffalo's put-upon FBI agent Dylan Rhodes constantly on the trail of the roving charlatans, each a solo act until they were hired by a mysterious backer to pull off three big heist/shows as a team is a worthy main character: Through his befuddled eyes we venture from one level onto the next.<br/><br/>The Horseman include Jesse Eisenberg as a snarky card shark; Isla Fisher as a risk taking performance artist; Dave Franco as the group's physically-charged street fighting freshman trying to prove his worth; and scene stealer Woody Harrelson as a charming comic relief mentalist creeping into everyone's minds. Woody's Merritt McKinney is, by far, the coolest cog in the wheel. But once each score is done we're left with duped agent Rhodes lost in a perpetual cat and mouse maze.<br/><br/>Along with an exposition-spouting Morgan Freeman, whose act is to debunk all magicians, you'll be guessing through each step: although the actual stage shows are downright preposterous unless you put this movie in the Science Fiction category. And to bring the cerebral mind games down to earth there's a prolonged fistfight and car chase leading to a giant twist ending too complicated for its own good, over-explaining the ultimate ruse and making everything (and everyone) seem simplistically sleight of hand in comparison."
"DareDevilKid","8","1","4","11 June 2013"," ""Now You See Me"" Demands to be Seen and Savored for a Long Time.
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK) Rating: 3.7/5 stars<br/><br/>Unabashedly entertaining, relentlessly engrossing, and delightfully mesmerizing. ""Now You See Me"" is the kind of heist film that cockily displays the lighter side of entertainment in the crime genre with oodles of style and chutzpah. But the discerning viewer too gets his share of the pie with the ample twists and turns, which keep you riveted and guessing right till the end - a rare feat to accomplish in movies these days. Boasting of an all star cast, each actor brings forth a unique charm and persona to his/her role.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake is the jolting twist at the grand finale, which knocks you spellbound and leaves you with a savory taste in its aftermath. You can't help but yearn for a sequel to this intricately wound tale at the earliest."

","Its not often, that I get completely bamboozled by movie plots, or if I am, its so well done that it doesn't matter. Now You See Me did a fine job. I'll try to keep any info that may ruin the movie out of this review. Starring Jessie Eisenberg (Social Network), Mark Ruffalo (Avengers), Woody Harrelson (Seven Psychopaths), Isla Fisher (The Great Gatsby), Dave Franco (21 Jump Street), and Melanie Laurent (Inglorious Bastards), Now You See Me is about four magicians who all specialize in a different field of magic and are brought together mysteriously and hence forth perform around the country using their talents to carry out heists, pretty much in front of the FBI's noses, specifically Ruffalo's and Laurent's characters'. I was well pleased with the direction of the movie. The acting while pleasing lacked depth and the ""love story"" if you can call it that, was weak at best. The movie kept me engaged the whole time, while I feverishly tried to figure it out but it was difficult because it was so entertaining! :)In the end I wasn't completely oblivious, I figured just a few small things out but the ending was a surprise and right in front of my face. I kept replaying the tag line, ""Look closer, because the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see,"" in my head. I tried not to look close but I did and I saw less. :) Regardless though, I was thoroughly entertained and after all isn't that the point of a movie about illusion? To keep me guessing and entertained! I'd spend the money and see this one in theaters."
"cooljishi","8","1","4","9 June 2013"," Perfectly suited if you are looking for some solid weekend entertainment!
","I suggest you people to go watch this movie as early as you can because 14th June is round the corner (MoS!) , and this movie is high on background score(Brian Tyler w00t w00t!), a decent plot, tricky direction and of course, smart performers. <br/><br/>The cast was so balanced. I have seen such a perfectly chosen ensemble after a really long time. Though Eisenberg should have been given some more screen space. And Isla Fisher is much more prettier than her 'Wedding Crashers' days.<br/><br/>The first half is not that slow, but actually not much is shown in the first half in comparison to the second half which manages to keep you at the edge of your seats, mounting to a satisfying climax in the end.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman looked frail for the first time on screen-diluted pupils, weak mouthing of lines. And that made me really sad and worried. <br/><br/>People might end up hating the movie because of the simple fact that it lets out secrets as much as it elevates the magic trick in the next sequence, and so on and so on- which is a bold thing to pull off. The mythological connection should be explored more in the sequel if they make one(confused if they will or not) . <br/><br/>Overall, Eisenberg-Freeman-Fisher-Caine-Ruffalo & Co. will ensure you don't come out of the theater disappointed. The illusion-shots are superb. And please, don't keep guessing the ending before it comes. Let it grow and flow as designed. That's the key to enjoy a heist movie you know!"

","Having all the gloss, glamour and bedazzlement of a Vegas act, it lacks a definitive and in-depth story, and has no focal point in storytelling point-of-view. Louis Leterrier's thriller follows the heists of four magicians in 'Ocean's 11' style. Though it's entertaining throughout, and has two actors from the Nolan franchise (Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman), don't compare it to Nolan's masterpiece in the magic realm, 'The Prestige'.<br/><br/>The whole cast is incredible, and play characters different from their previous roles, but the characters lack depth and texture. The character interactions and one-liners are filled with adequate amount of wit and humour. Though the characters seem interesting, their presence is lost in the stupendous situations and ridiculous twists.<br/><br/>I have to say once again, the movie is spectacular and keeps you hooked from beginning till end, but there's a difference between being tricked and being cheated."
"Quietb-1","6","1","4","5 June 2013"," Don't expect movie magic.
","OK movie, as long as you don't think too much. Need a cadaver? No problem.<br/><br/>Start with the cast. Jesse Eisenberg is cocky and too fast talking. Mark Ruffalo is calm and scruffy. Isla Fisher is screechy, like chalk on a blackboard. Dave Franco is the wrong Franco. Melanie Laurrent doesn't have the chops. Woody Harrelson seems to be making an effort and he steals every scene. The two old stars sleep walk through their parts.<br/><br/>Like magic, film editing should be seamless. In this movie the editing is noticeable and distracting. Fast pace takes you from Las Vegas, to New Orleans and New York but why?<br/><br/>If you suspend your disbelief big time and sit back and take the ride it's an OK trip. About an hour after the end credits you think back and think did I miss something and they hypnotized me into thinking this was a good movie. It should have been better."

","""Now you See Me"" is an excellent modern day take at an ""Oceans 11"" style, mastermind type movie. It is also unique in that not many films (that I am aware of) feature the criminals as master magicians and tricksters!<br/><br/>Each character uses a specific skill set that aids the team in different ways. For example there is an illusionist, a magician, a trickster/pickpocket and a mentalist. Each character has some development and background throughout the movie, however the character with the most depth would be the FBI agent who chases them around the globe to stop their crimes and arrest them!<br/><br/>The scenes where the ""magic"" is performed, is absolutely breathtaking. Thanks to the use of high end CGI sequences, the stunts and tricks are added with just that extra touch of glamour and ""wow"" value. Scenic areas are appropriately chosen and show a diverse visual range.<br/><br/>The plot, while as simple as it sounds, also has a few tricks up its sleeve and provides an ample level of depth, obviously not as in depth as a movie you might study in high school English class (like inception or the matrix), but nonetheless it is sufficient. I only found there was one or two parts which i was a tad iffy about.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie hits the spot and is a breath of fresh air from sci-fi, action and teen-drama type movies that tend to dominate the screens these days (although I am a fan of several of those)!. The movie is definitely recommended and you probably wont be disappointed!"

","When seeing this advertised I knew it was going to be a great film! The ""rob a bank"" line got me interested!<br/><br/>The magic tricks in this film were pretty good! Like when Henley Reeves was trapped in the piranha tank! And got out in the last minute! That was good! Liked the mentalist Merritt McKinney! He was funny as! 4 gifted magicians come together via tarot cards & form a known as The Four Horseman! <br/><br/>They then perform in Las Vegas as ""The Four Horsemen"" sponsored by Arthur Tressler, an insurance magnate. For the finale of their performances, the Four Horsemen invite a member of the audience to help them in their next trick: robbing a bank. The man is apparently teleported to a bank in Paris, where he activates an air duct which vacuums up the money and showers it onto the crowd in Las Vegas. I like how the group manipulated the man into going to Las Vegas! Very clever!<br/><br/>Liked the performance they done, when they stole 140 Million from Tresslers Bank Account and distributing it to the audience, which comprises people whose insurance claims had been denied or reduced by Tressler's company. That was ace! Well done! Especially when the mentalist, Merritt got some of the audience to be football players & they dived onto the stage on top of FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes when he attempted to catch The Four Horseman!<br/><br/>They bit when Rhodes and Dray locate the group's hideout and confront Wilder! & The chase sequence when Wilder attempts to escape in a stolen car, but during the chase it flips and explodes. I liked how cleverly the group performed the safe heist through use of mirrors! When they realised they were chasing the wrong safe! How well it was explained & how it confused the police/FBI! The group were 2 steps ahead of them! Awesome! And not to mention how Wilder faked his own death! And how the bridge sequence on the bridge was done to confuse them, Merritt being the bus driver with the duplicate car with the dead body from the morgue! When they preformed their final performance & rained fake money onto the crowd & the real money bursting out of Bradley s car & him getting arrested by the FBI! He then reveals to be the 5th Horseman to Bradley who is now stuck in prison! The group are surprised to discover Rhodes is the benefactor who assembled them the previous year, and he initiates them into The Eye.<br/><br/>It then ends with Dray & Rhodes meeting & him explaining that Lionel Shrike, was the magician who drowned years ago. Rhodes says he designed the Horsemen plot to obtain revenge on those involved: Bradley, for humiliating his father, and potentially even sabotaging the trick; the bank in Paris and Tressler's company, which refused to pay insurance on his father's death; and the company that produced the safe used in the trick. Due to the inferior quality of metal used to construct the safe, it warped, resulting in Rhodes' father's inability to escape it. I just like how it connected together so well! Great film! The tricks got me & how they were done were spectacular! Go see it! You won't be disappointed! <br/><br/>9/10"

Now You See Me is the coolest, smartest, slickest and probably best acted film you'll see all summer. <br/><br/>Now You See Me focuses on a group of arrogant, over-confident magicians, called 'The Four Horsemen', who perform amazing tricks involving robbing banks and giving all the money to their audience. But when the FBI finds out about their magnificent heist, the two groups begin a cat-and-mouse chase across the U.S as the FBI agents try to find out how the illusionists are pulling the tricks off – with the help of Morgan Freeman's trick-spoiler, Thaddeus Bradley. The group of magicians, (played by Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) although pretty cool, are completely arrogant and laid-back and the FBI agents (played by Mark Ruffalo, Melanie Laurent, Michael Kelly, Lonnie Lynn and David Warshofsky), although more down-to-Earth, are completely stupid and slow-minded. From here we get two groups of characters who both have strong points and both have bad points, so its full marks to the makers of the film that they are given an equal share of the screen time, and the film lets you decide who to root for. <br/><br/>'The Four Horsemen' all have brilliant chemistry and all work extremely well as a unit– you believe they are actually in a group together. Mark Ruffalo, who plays reluctant agent, Dylan Rhodes, puts in the standout performance and his interplay with Interpol agent, Alma Dray (played by Melanie Laurent) is superb. <br/><br/>Anyone would forgive Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine, both in supporting roles, for almost sleepwalking through this film given their ages and past appearances in films like this. Freeman plays an ex-magician who gives away trade secrets to the highest bidder, and Caine portrays Arthur Tressler, the group's financier. But both give truly strong and emotional performances in roles that would have seemed under-written with a lot of other actors. Each cast member has put their full effort into this and produced an amazing achievement in the process.<br/><br/>The film is highly suspenseful and keeps you interested and guessing the final outcome. Each trick is made with visual excellency and are surprisingly given a simple explanation. Although the multitude of tricks and illusions can be hard to get past, once you do get past them you are rewarded with a brilliant, initiative, exciting and original thriller. Those expecting a typical summer blockbuster need to push up their expectations. Now You See Me is full of mysterious turns and includes the finest twist ending I've seen in a long time. It uses brilliant visual and camera trickery not too dissimilar to how the tricks themselves are played out on-screen.<br/><br/>Look closely, because the closer you think you are, the less you will actually see."

I thought Morgan Freeman's performance was ""on par"" ( I cannot think of a movie in which he acts bad, ever ).<br/><br/>Some things where not very logical ( I won't spoiler it though ) but all in all this is a more than decent summer flick You can't afford to miss if You want to have a great time.

","This was an amazing movie. From flesh-eating piranha scares to robbing banks from a stage, ""Now You See Me"" never ceased to wow me. I loved the illusions and tricks brought to life with the movie. The plot revolved around a group of magicians,( the Four Horsemen) and their quest to fame using intense skill, and illusions like no other. Their heists are very well thought out and kept me on the edge of my seat.This movie required me to think and kept me guessing until the final scene. I highly recommend NYSM to those who love the art of illusion and fantasy itself. ""The closer you look, the less you'll actually see."" Was a line often said and proved many times over throughout the movie. In conclusion, I suggest seeing this movie, it is very good and one you will be sure to love!"

","This is certainly not an epic film, it has Woody Harrelson for heavens sake, but this is a very good original storyline and script. There comes a point in time when I am so tired of these big loud apocalyptic special effect movies or sequels to a movie that was not all that good to begin with. This one is awesome, hope they do not ruin it by doing a sequel.<br/><br/>Four illusionists/magicians, each with a special talent, are brought together by a leader from the secret society of magicians (I do not remember what it is called). Together they put on a great show and get some revenge on corporate America. At times this movie went so fast I could not pick up all of the details or the reasons why certain things were done. Then other scenes, when they were being questioned by police, I would have liked to see the funny antics continue.<br/><br/>The special effects are original, creative, it is well acted, well directed, cinematography was awesome, and well written. This was, however, poorly edited. There were some holes in the storyline that I had to depend on a site like this to explain to me. Overall I highly recommend this movie to all, although you will likely want to see it again to catch the stuff you missed - I know I do."

","OK, I saw it for the second time on 6/4/13...and I want to change my entire review about it. I now enjoyed it SO much better! I did not leave the theater at all confused. I loved hearing audience reaction and being one of the very few in the know. I went with my family and from time to time my Mom would lean into me and ask questions. I had to keep telling her 'just watch!' LOL. When I watched it the first time I missed two minutes of it (elevator scene) so I was glad to finally see that! Awww! :)<br/><br/>This movie is just brilliant because you DO have to see it twice to catch on to everything. <br/><br/>I NOW give it a 9/10<br/><br/>----------------------<br/><br/>This is what I said the first time on 6/1/13 ...I really don't know how I feel about this film after finally watching it because I was too amped up in watching it that I researched it, read updates from those who saw it and got excited, too excited as my expectations were a bit cheated. (Word of advice, don't read critiques or opinions prior to viewing it) I didn't really read about the film and or have it spoiled for me except seeing previews, videos and hearing so much praise for it that I was expecting mind blowing results but I'm reminded of this saying from Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory) 'You told me it's mind-blowing, so my mind is going into it pre- blown, and once a mind is *pre*-blown, it cannot be *re*-blown.' that is EXACTLY how I felt leaving the theater. It was a great fun movie no doubt. I do not diminish anything about the film but I will say this you have to have the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it. My only complaint is that there needed to be more development for the four horseman. (It could've used at least another 30 minutes if you ask me) because they needed more screen- time. Im not gonna give anything away but I was not all that blown away in the end. I kinda figured it out. However, great cast, great acting and I WILL see it again. See that is what was brilliant about it. TPTB made it in a way that YOU have to see it again. Whether its for pure enjoyment, catching up or you missed something the first time.<br/><br/>8/10"
"cornflakeboy20","7","1","5","31 May 2013"," Fun magical heist movie
","This is a bit of Ocean's 11 meets The Prestige and I'm sure some people will find it derivative, but the mash up of magic and heist movie worked for me. This was tremendous fun from the beginning more or less until the end (more on that later). We meet our four magical heroes in montage fashion that recalls Ocean's 11: each is shown working their own routines and then receiving a tarot card telling them to meet at a specific place and time. A year or so later, they have a magical act together in Las Vegas under the name The Four Horsemen, where they tell the crowd that they will rob a bank live on stage. They then – supposedly – teleport a French banker to his Parisian bank to steal thousands in Euros and leave a calling card, the money is then rained down upon the crowd. Later shows in New Orleans and New York follow the same format. In New Orleans, we see that their act is a kind of Robin Hood gesture, as money is stolen from an insurance magnate and redistributed to foreclosure victims.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman stars as a former magician who now makes a living debunking magic acts and trying to figure out the gang's method; and Mark Ruffalo is the federal agent attempting the catch the Four Horseman committing a robbery. The main cast – Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco – are wonderfully charming. There are a few one liners that fall with a thud, and a couple plot points that might have been better developed, but the movie is a breezy ride most of the way through. Dave Franco, as always, should get more screen time.<br/><br/>The central mystery to this plot is who is pulling the strings; who summoned the Four Horsemen to their meeting and organized each of the heists? The answer, when we receive it, is a bit unfair and leaves many open questions. The more you examine the questions, the less they make sense; though repeat viewings may disprove me. This isn't a Sixth Sense kind of ending where you should have seen it coming all along; it's more of a Murder of Roger Ackroyd solution where the perp wasn't even really a suspect.<br/><br/>I think that many people will feel cheated by the ending. Still, this movie was an hour and 50 minutes and I thought some more development and additional scenes could have been included. When I want a movie to stretch longer, it's definitely working for me."

","Now You See Me (2013) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Entertaining but far-fetched action picture about four magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco) who use their talents to pull off some bank robberies. An FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) and a former magician (Morgan Freeman) try to figure out exactly how the tricks are being done and especially since there's no logical explanation. If the trailer for NOW YOU SEE ME left you feeling somewhat cold like me, then the movie itself is actually much better. The trailer would make you believe that this is just going to be a silly little movie and it is to a point but there's also a few nice tricks being done in the screenplay and director Louis Leterrier also manages to do quick a magic trick himself. Throughout the film we're told to believe in magic you can't look too closely to the trick. I think if we look too closely at this story we're going to have many logical problems but the director does a good job at making you forget these and just takes you along for the ride. There's no question that I was entertained from start to finish because the screenplay is good enough to keep you on your toes and you're never quite sure where the story is going to take you. Another plus is that we're given a pretty good cast and each one does a very good job in their parts. Eisenberg plays the brain like no other can. Harrelson has that sly charm working well. Ruffalo is good as the cop and pros like Freeman and Michael Caine never fail. Melanie Lauren is also extremely good in her supporting part. The film offers up some dazzling cinematography and there's no question that the look of the film is very impressive. NOW YOU SEE ME isn't a masterpiece but I think it's a very well-made film that at least does what a cheap magic trick does and that's entertain you."
"carbuff","7","0","1","21 March 2020"," Better than ""Ocean's Whatever"", but went a bit too mystical
","""Now You See Me"" worked out well as entertainment for a wide-ranging group of people. It's basically a complex heist flick, but it has an underlying mystical bent to it. More rationality and less ""woo-woo"" would have been a major improvement in my opinion. Still that irrational part of this film was not overpowering for most of the film, and it's production values and acting are high enough that one can easily suspend belief, even though you know better. So, it worked well for a very mixed group, but I wish they just didn't take any easy ""spiritual"" way out at all anywhere in the film. That might just be a personal preference though, and maybe many people prefer it this way."

There are some good things, such as the scenes where the Four Horsemen perform their acts, which are scenes I really like, and I think Louis Leterrier really directed those scenes very well. There are several action scenes that are really poorly done, and there is also a twist in the film that has been so bad and hasn't had any setup during the whole film.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","8","0","1","8 March 2019"," A film full of flash and fun and the requisite number of twists.
","The key to a great heist film comes in three stages: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Wait, that's the key to a great magician's illusion. Actually, here's the real trick: both are very similar in structure. Each requires a setup of events which lead to an amazing reveal, followed by an explanation of how the heist/illusion was performed. In Now You See Me (2013), both the heist and magician genres are found to be so closely related that it was nice to see them meld together so well.<br/><br/>In a page ripped straight from Robin Hood, the main characters justify their thievery by stating that their actions are to right the wrongs done to the general public. Of course, when a movie uses CGI to enhance the magic of the actors, it's just that much more fun to see how they are able to pull off each heist using their skills as magicians. A successful magic act relies a lot on the stage presence of its magician, and the comedy of the ""Four Horsemen"" certainly helps the levity of the film remain high, even during moments of doubt.<br/><br/>Part of me is a little surprised it has taken this long to combine the heist and magician genres. Sure, there were more character-motivated magician movies like The Illusionist (2006) and The Prestige (2006), but neither of them had the heist angle that Now You See Me does. Plus, with modern technology making traditional magic more difficult to fool an audience, the more advanced magic of the Four Horsemen made this film just that much more enjoyable.<br/><br/>A film full of flash and fun and the requisite number of twists, I give Now You See Me 4.0 stars out of 5."

"milanrijsenbrij","8","0","3","1 March 2019"," Anyone who gives this movie a bad review need to rethink their decision
","The movie was in my opinion brilliantly written. The main objective to not tell you how things really work out in the plot are met. You dont see any of the important stuff on screen like any real life magician would if he performed on screen. Therefore there is no way to know what happened unless you really watched because it gave the slightest of clues. Of course these clues would have to fitted into the puzzle and that was up to you, so anyone who did not realize that this happened need to rewatch the movie. Also i believe that the ending is the best ive ever seen. ( its the same for the 2nd movie which is out, we will see if this goes for the third too. ) It shows how they made their tricks come to life and yes they seem a bit much. But thats why its a movie not a theatre play. Its a horrible argument to say that because the tricks seem unrealistic the plot sucks. No, if it did not come to mind the four horsemen seemed to be capable of it all. Just like harry potter could use magic and not die to voldemort as a kid. We didnt question that either. So why are these characters that are clearly portrayed as being capable of doing these tricks questioned. My point is that people are unhappy because they expected a real life magician on a movie screen. but that is not how movies work because there is no fun in that. Thats why movies always have a bit of imagination because the mind/brain thinks its more fun than actual things that happen. So the whole 'it does not seem real' thing should never be a fricking argument for any movie unless its clearly stated that its a bloody biography or something that ACTUALLY HAPPENED.<br/><br/>Also morgan freeman is the best actor in the world"

","A movie about magic.
Or is it?
Is what we see real, or is it an illusion? That is what magic is all about.<br/><br/>Only these four are not just performing illusions they are robbing banks, and other institutions. Are they just randomly choosing an institution to profit from, or is there a greater motive behind all the trickery.<br/><br/>A federal agent is brought in to solve the heists. Mark Ruffalo plays as Dylan Rhodes. He is smart, he is tough, he is dedicated to nail these thieves and put them away. But they ARE illusionists and they keep slipping away from his grasp. Even when they are in custody, he cannot seem to bring enough evidence to bear that will keep them locked up. There are several important and interesting people besides the main four magicians who call themselves the four horsemen. There is Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley who makes presentations exposing the tricks of magicians. He is getting rich from ruining the magic acts of others. Michael Caine as a wealthy man who is promoting the four horsemen as a way to profit. Then enter a bright young woman from the French division of interpol after a bank in France loses I think it was 30 million euros.<br/><br/>There are several respectable foot chases through buildings and alleys and an above average car chase. When it seems we are about to see an answer to all the activities we are thrown a curve. But even then, is it real or an illusion?<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film, hope you will too.<br/><br/>I didn't really sense chemistry between Rhodes and the lovely French interpol agent played by Melanie Laurent, but that was not a major point. One thing I did not care for was that lousy ""shaky camera"" effect. This movie like too many other recent movies has the camera so close to the action it is sometimes hard to tell what I am seeing.

"maiken-zupancic","9","0","1","10 November 2018"," Magic, simply
","I just recently rewatched this movie (for the third time or so) after reading a whole lot of critique about plotholes, bad writing etc. and despite my brain constantly reminding me of those while watching and forcing me to notice all the inconsistencies and unrealistic things in the movie, I still couldn't stop myself from enjoying it. By the time the twist ending came around, I was as petrified as I was the first time. Of course I knew what was going to happen, but over the course of the movie I got so invested into the story, I almost forgot that the Fifth Horseman actually WAS the Fifth Horseman and not just this incredibly stupid FBI agent. So a lot of kudos to that. (Well, mostly to Mark Ruffalo. I mean, the guy CAN ACT.) I'm not one to analyse the ending and why it might be good or not, I only know that it gives me immense satisfaction. And that's gotta count for something.<br/><br/>I already gave this a rating a while ago, but I came back to write a review, because I can't stress enough how good this movie is. Yes, it has some plot holes and things that don't add up, but the story itself really holds water in the end. It gets surprisingly better after seeing the sequel, which, despite throwing in another twist no one saw coming and which might be regarded as lame, actually fixes many of the first film's plot holes. And the story itself, well, it's still genuinelly complex,(that's probably why all those plot holes show up - the writers complicated it too much and holes appeared on the way, cause they simply couldn't hold ALL the strings in their hands at the same time) with a lot of aspects that come together in the end.<br/><br/>As for how the twist is something you would never expect: yeah, it is. There's no clues indicating it, but you were never supposed to suspect it. This movie might seem like a crime story at first, but it's really not about solving a crime, at its core it's about magic. So unlike most stories with a surprising ending, it's not built as a puzzle to be solved, but rather as a magic trick. And you can't really figure out those by yourself in real life either - You really only understand what happened (and why) after you're given an explanation, but when it's all explained, it starts to make sense. It's the same here, with all the elements and questions - why were the Horsemen recruited, why they target those specific institutions and people, why everyone won't shut up about Lionel shrike, the card in the tree and the other elements that seemingly serve no reason to the story - suddenly start to make sense once it's all explained. And once you watch it the second time, you view it completely differently and can marvel at the deception.<br/><br/>Oh, and the writing's pretty great in some places, there's genuinely funny lines and moments, despite the ocassional corniness of some dialogues. But even those corny lines are often just coming from Dylan, who speaks that way on purpose. I like that the film doesn't take itself too seriously either, frequently making fun of its characters and just generally serving you so much unrealistic bull***t in those tricks that you can't possibly take it seriously. Which makes it a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Oh, and about magic: it's not even that unrealistic. They had a lot of magicians consulting them (hell, they got DAVID COPPERFIELD), and although it was all very exaggerated in the movie, the basic ideas of deception, where and how close you're supposed to look are actually pretty legit. They also apply to the 'magic trick' of the movie's story: the one character you spend most of the movie focusing on, seemingly seeing him from up close, is the one you missinterpret the most - the closer you look, the less you see. 'The trick is to look far into the past, not close' - yeah, as far as 30 years back to find reasons for what's happening now. And so on.<br/><br/>Overall, I just really enjoyed this way too much to criticise it. Yeah, it's ridiculous and the most unrealistic thing ever, but that's how you're supposed to take it and how it sees itself too. So if you can let go of overthinking it, it's a fun ride. I'd honestly fangirl a bit if I could, but I'm trying to keep this professional so let's just say: it's super cool. And the ending kills me every. Single time. Honestly, the sequel is possibly the only thing better than the first one."

"Enchorde","8","0","1","30 September 2018"," Take a leap of faith...
","Take a leap of faith, that is a common theme in the movie. And it applies to us as the audience too. Before I wrote this review I checked around and saw that other reviews were quite mixed. Some loved it, and some hated it. I loved it. But it required a leap of faith... to believe in the magic of the film.<br/><br/>So this is magic/heist movie. Four aspiring young (can you still call Woody Harrelson young?) magicians are recruited by a mysterious person to form the act: The Four Horsemen. In their first show they do a big finale by robbing a bank halfway around the world. That gets everyones attention (especially the FBI's) and the magicians rise to stardom. Now starts a cat and mouse chase with the authorities, all the time while their mysterious sponsor remains in the shadows.<br/><br/>Now, performing magic acts must be easier in a movie than in real life, but quite a few are tricks that could have been made (and are?) in real magic shows. And here is the leap of faith we need to take. If you buy into the premise of the movie, that the tricks work, it becomes a spectacle of fun (if you don't, well quite everything falls apart, but why watch a magic movie and not want to believe in the magic).<br/><br/>The ride we are taken along is fast paced, with some good action and some nice effects. The air, much built upon from the magic shows, is good and humorous. The movie is really entertaining. It is fun to follow their magic tricks and heists. To follow the next step, and trying to stay one step ahead of the heists. And therein perhaps is the biggest fault of the movie. The final twist is not really hard to see coming, but actually that doesn't matter too much. It is the magic that is the central part of this, so just sit back and be entertained."

Having seen it and pondering about the twist ending, I watched it again. Not everything makes entirely sense once you know the outcome and more than just a few questions comes to mind, but this is such an exciting film with great fast-paced action scenes that these can easily be overlooked.

","The movie lost me when the illusionists attempted to convince their audience they were sending a French businessman on his way to Paris via a teleportation helmet. Reminds me of that saying, 'If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything'. So very early on, the story announced that it wasn't about anything real in the way of 'magic'. You didn't need Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman) to convince you that the teleportation gimmick was staged, you just needed to know how it was done. I have to admit though, I'd never heard of 'flash money' before so I had to look it up. It's true that flash bills vanish when set on fire while leaving no trace, but a whole pallet? I'd like to see that in person.<br/><br/>The best thing to do here is to just sit back and enjoy the ride, as the players are entertaining and the gimmicks are interesting, it's all very slick and polished. Being the story of ego-centric illusionists, you had to know that Jack Wilder (Dave Franco) didn't really die in the car wreck. It was just a matter of waiting out the story to see when he would pop up again. And again, if you find yourself in the 'fall for anything' camp, you'll take it on faith that FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) had the patience and stamina to concoct a twenty year old revenge plan to get back at the elements that contributed to his father's death. <br/><br/>Best magic trick? When Jack Wilder turned into Gambit of the X-Men and started dishing out those deadly cards at Dylan. But now that I think about it some more, I DID see the Seven of Diamonds both times when Danny (Jesse Eisenberg) shuffled the cards to open the movie. Now THAT was magic!"

","I liked it in the theater, and I liked it today, when I watched it again.
It had a lesser impact because I knew the twist and turns, but the magic tricks were still awesome, the escalation of the whole con and revenge well done and the movie has no malice, no unnecessary deaths to give it ""meaning"", nor any casualties. You have to see this movie. It worths the time.<br/><br/>Having said that, It is true though, that the dialogue and parts of the story seemed forced at points. Also, some actors do some amazing work while others are, at least in my opinion, quite awful.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Freeman and Caine are amazing. Melanie Laurent and Ruffalo do their best effort to sell some too forced story beats, and Ruffalo in particular struggles to give his character any charm or believability, stuck in the middle. Isla Fisher and Dave Franco were a cringe fest.<br/><br/>SPOILERS! SSSSSSSSSSSSSSS<br/><br/>A LOT of people saying that Mark Ruffalo's character being in the FBI, just to have revenge about his dead father (another magician) is too much work not to be ridiculous.<br/><br/>IT WAS ""THE EYE""!!!!! The secret organization called ""The Eye"", has enough power (and in a too obvious comparison to the Illuminati) to pull some strings and easily make Ruffalo an FBI agent.<br/><br/>Now. You can call the tricks unbelievable to your taste, and that's your taste. But they are more or less as unbelievable as the one of the Ocean's Eleven movies. In my opinion, the movie is good enough to let you forget the implausibility of all and ejoy it"
"joeldibasso","7","0","1","18 August 2018"," Let the movie fool you
","I have seen some reviews saying that none of the events in the movie makes sense, that this is way beyond just tricks, that it's not believable even for a second, many plot holes, etc... . Let me recall something. The central quote of The Prestige (2006) reads :
""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called the Pledge. The magician shows you an ordinary object, a deck of cards, a bird, or a man. He shows you this object. Maybe he asks you to inspect it, to see if it is indeed real, unaltered. But of course, it probably isn't.
The second part is called the Turn. The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it doing something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it. Because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really wanna know. You wanna be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet because making something disappear isn't enough, you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call the Prestige.""<br/><br/>I think we can easily agree that both the characters in the movie and us, watching it have been fooled several times. But for those who say that this makes no sense at all I answer : play the game. Let the movie fool you a little, these are the rules of a magic show, right ? The only purpose of the man who spends money for the show is to be fooled, not to be comforted in his logical sense. These are the values carried be the high ranked tricky movie The Prestige by the huge cinematic genius Christopher Nolan (I personally think that this movie is a kind of tribute to The Prestige, the script seems really inspired I mean, Borden's favorite quote was ""Are you watching closely?"" and Atlas' favorite quote is something like ""the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see."", that's really close, no joke).
Moreover, for those who dare to compare these to movies I say, what's more credible: the end, that is to say the main plot of The Prestige or four well-trained illusionists gathered by an unexplained link, performing impressive tricks that take a lot of chance and money to achieve ?<br/><br/>I personally really enjoyed that movie. It has a good rythm, a few jokes, you eventually get attached to the characters. It's original, it's fresh (even in 2018) and it creates a thrilling atmosphere, it's like nothing can stop these guys. It surely has a very good Mark Ruffalo and a brilliant Jesse Eisenberg and I think it really deserves a higher rate."

","I have somehow missed 'Now You See Me', a very entertaining movie directed by Louis Leterrier when it was released four years ago. Luckily, it's one of those movies that do not lose their appeal that fast, and then it's summer time, so the right time for fun and entertaining films. The only detail that seems overcome by time in this film is the usage of phones phones with geo-positioning systems.As smartphones took over the market, and applications as Google Maps became ubiquitous, the cops using keyboard based not-so-smart mobile phones seems to have happened twenty and not four years back. It's kind of a lesson for film-makers which may find more and more difficult coping with the pace of progress of our smart gadgets. Maybe the sequel avoids this mistake.<br/><br/>'Now You See Me' combines two genres - the big robbery and the magicians movies, with more emphasize on the later. 'The closer you look, the less you see' is the key saying of the film which tells the story of four magicians with different specializations brought together in a team that combines huge magician shows a la David Copperfield with bank robberies. They are supported by a finance tycoon (Michael Caine), followed by a former magician (Morgan Freeman) whose pastime is exposing on TV the tricks and frauds of magicians, and have of course all the FBI and Interpol on their tracks. The roles of manipulators and manipulated, suspects and innocents change all the time, and as in a good magic show we are never sure what we exactly see on screen.<br/><br/>The story may have a few holes that cannot be filled even by magic, but the convention works well, and is well supported by the actors. Watching Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine is always a delight in this kind of roles that they enjoy playing in this epoch of their careers. The rest of the team does a good job as well, with special mentions for Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson. 'Now You See Me' is a film to enjoy, like a good show with magicians."

","Now You See Me<br/><br/>Look closely, ""the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see."" Part of the opening scene of the fantastic, Now You See Me movie. Magic tricks have been a source of live entertainment for centuries, now they have the chance to do it at the movies. The actors chosen for the role and the plot they were given created an unpredictable two hour, must see film. The movie received multiple awards including the People's Choice Award for favorite thriller movie of the year. Now You See Me has made up the perfect plot. Four street magicians are brought together to create ""The Four Horsemen"". The plot would be nothing without magic tricks, and the director (Louis Leterrier) knew what made a good magic trick is what you can and cannot see. The camera angles trick you into believing one thing until later on in the movie, when the magicians explain how they fooled the FBI, their audiences, and you. You don't find out why the team is stealing money until much later in the movie, keeping the plot unpredictable, as well as the audience on edge. The plot did its job of pulling the audience in, while on the other hand, it could've been even more enhanced by more thrilling sound effects. One upsetting feature of the film would have to be the soundtrack of the movie. The sound effects do not add much to the excitement of any scene if at all. Even though, the chase scenes still manage to excite the audience and throw them in different directions. <br/><br/>The casting was close to perfect for this movie. Daniel Atlas, the quick witted leader of The Four Horsemen, was played by Jesse Eisenberg. Eisenberg has shown to be very talented at acting out a sarcastic genius in the film. He's shown this quality in some of his other movies like The Social Network, where he plays the creator of Facebook, Mark Zuckerberg. The mentalist, Merrit McKinney, who is introduced while shaking down a bad husband, is played by Woody Harrelson. Woody works well with Eisenberg at the sarcastic characters they were given, they make the movie kind of a comedy when they are together. Henley Reeves, the illusionist, is played by Isla Fisher. Isla fits in well with the other actors, saying her lines with a fun attitude while also quick witted toward the other magicians. The last magician, Jack Wilder, is a street magician who uses sleight of hand to pick pockets and break open locks. Dave Franco, who plays Jack, is perfect for the role of a younger magician than the rest of the group. Dave acts shy when meeting the other magicians, who are actually famous, but kind of arrogant when he knows something the older magicians don't. All four actors brought together seemed to work great, the amount of quick comebacks they all throw at each other makes the movie somewhat of a comedy.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, the big reveal almost throws you out of your seat, not even knowing what just hit you. It would almost help you understand the movie more if you watch it a second time with the knowledge you find out at the end. Magic has entertained audiences for centuries and now it has been brought to the film industry. Now You See Me has set the bar for any other movies about magic tricks pretty high and the sequel will have to top what this movie has done. I would highly recommend going to see this movie whenever you have the chance. When you go to see the movie just remember, ""the closer you look, the less you'll see."""

","In preparation for seeing the sequel I have finally seen now you see me and I did enjoy this film. The premise of the film sees a group of four magicians rob banks while on show. A cop attempts to take them down even though he doesn't understand. Jesse eisenberg plays the head magician and this role really did fit him. He was eccentric but in the right way as you understand the complexity of a magicians mind. Woody harrelson is good in this film with a very charismatic performance but once again for this film his eccentricities work for the film. Ilsa fisher and Dave Franco are the other two four horseman and even though they have less to do they both do a good job as well in the roles and the whole group work well together. Mark ruffalo plays the cop going after the group and he does a good job in the film and it is interesting to see him try to tackle the group. Melanie Laurent plays ruffalo's partner in the film and she does a good job with her character having some good depth to her and a good chemistry with ruffalo. Michael caine and Morgan freeman are also in this film and they do good jobs in the roles that they have. The story has an interesting heist element to it and I liked watching the investigation into the group by ruffalo and Laurent. However, there are quite a few things that don't really make sense. Also there is a twist towards the end of the film that doesn't really add up when you think about it. The script has some interesting dialogue in it, its just nothing really stands out and adds character depth. The style has some good chase scenes and also the magic tricks are visually very impressive. However, most of it isn't very plausible and it does take a bit away from the magnificence of the tricks. Overall this is a good film that has some interesting things in it."

","I've wanted to see Now You See Me since I saw a GIF-set from the beginning of the movie. In the scene Jesse Eisenberg's character does a magic trick with a cards, and even through few GIFs the trick works, and that blew my mind. Another reason was that I saw the trailer for the sequel, and I wanted to see that, but didn't catch it at the theatre.<br/><br/>The cast of Now You See Me is excellent, and that's the first thing I noticed even before seeing the movie. All the actors and actresses are well known, and while they quickly feel like a weird combination, they all work well together. For example it's always a joy to see Woody Harrelson in a movie - if the movie is good, that is, because I've had enough disappointments with movies he was in.<br/><br/>While the cast is amazing, the characters are even more awesome, and every actor does their job wonderfully and with skill. In the beginning you very quickly learn the basics about the four magicians, but towards the end they don't have so many lines and it's mostly about the FBI and the Interpol trying to catch them, but during that short while you are introduced to four interesting characters, and while I think there's much more to know about them, I am content with what this film offered me. While it's easier to root for the magicians, Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent's characters also turn out to be more than two-dimensional Lawful Good characters what we are used to in a crime mystery movies where the criminals seem to be more like heroes. <br/><br/>The plot of his movie is sensational and clever. It sweeps you off your feet right in the beginning: you see characters and you want to know what that mysterious party wants with them. And as the movie goes on the plot just keeps getting bigger and bigger, larger than you'd think. The film is full of delicious plot twist, and each and every one of those work instead of just being there to confuse the audience. Now You See Me is like a magic trick, with misdirection and all.<br/><br/>But this film was so great and well written I'm pretty skeptical about the sequel. How could it be as good, because how could they introduce just as amazing plot twists? Also it never feels good when a director changes between two movies.I'm not familiar with Jon M. Chu, but comparing his filmography with Louis Leterrier's makes me a tiny bit suspicious. But still, I wouldn't want to miss out on Now You See Me 2."

If you like music, you have some sort of standard for listening pleasure, and you'll find this film one of the most dreadful experiences in your life.To be honest, I don't even know if the directors would watch this film after the production, everything about the film is so fast-food manufacturing style, the plot is not rich, the characters are vague, and the tricks are lame.

Making its debut in 2013 by director Louis Leterrier and Summit Entertainment, this film tells the tale of four incredible and talented street magicians. Chosen to work together, they are given the ultimate test in pulling off unbelievably over the top magic tricks to become part of ""Eye"". Legend has it that the ""Eye of Horus"" is an ancient Egyptian prophecy involving only the most talented magicians including former member, Lionel Shrike. With initiation opportunities twice every century, this secret society is considered the ultimate reward for magicians. They are the keepers and protectors of real magic for those who study it. Their ultimate job is to keep the hope and belief of true magic alive. Their seeker and creator study each magician for months lurking and watching their shows determining whether they are the right fit to embark on this fantastic yet dangerous journey. Lover and upcoming illusionist, J. Daniel Atlas played by Jessie Eisenberg, hermit and mentalist, Merrit McKinney played by Woody Harrelson, height priestess and escape artist, Henley Reeves played by Ilsa Fisher, death and con-man Jack Wilder played by Dave Franco are chosen as the four contenders.

With Thaddeus Bradley, the ever-famous former magician, played by Morgan Freeman out to expose the horseman to the world, these magicians must successfully perform each magic trick before time runs out. Thaddeus believes in his ability to expose these magicians since he did it once before to Lionel Shrike. After betraying their finance contributor, Arthur Tressler, played by Michael Caine, the horsemen embark on their final performance leading them to the mystery of whether the Eye truly exists. With rumors of a fifth horsemen, can these magicians pull off the unthinkable and become members of the Eye?

","""The closer you look, the less you see."" The four magicians we are watching for most of the movie are themselves a sleight-of-hand for the real 'hero', and do their jobs well. Going on about the lack of their characters' development misses the point, since they are supposed to be 'the smartest guys in the room' and have nowhere further to go, or so they think. Their comeuppance is combined with their reward once the game is done. The hand inside their glove is himself apparently a servant in some fashion of the Eye, a secret society dedicated to magic and the sense of wonder (as well as some degree of social justice) which we never otherwise see. The central premise of the movie is stated at the end, but developed throughout. ""You know how I feel about resolution and logic."" The speaker doesn't care for them much, at times. ""Some things are best left unexplained."" The sense of wonder that the movie is trying to defend defies explanation, to the point where the explainers are treated as villains. In this case the real hero's enemies are also enemies of the Eye, the debunkers and explainers, the greedy plutocrats, and he is serving himself while serving them. If there is a flaw in the finale of the show it is in the failure to make this clearer, and I don't think it would have taken much, even less than they showed. The meaning of the carousel, if there is a meaning, is especially obscure (maybe if they'd shown it, eye-like, from above?). Making things clearer, i.e., 'resolution and logic', is not the point of the story, and it would have helped the movie if it had been less faithful to the story itself."

""The closer you look the less you see"". Anyone who understands what I am talking about will know this film to be an incredibly underrated story. Making its debut in 2013 by director Louis Leterrier and Summit Entertainment, this film tells the tale of four incredible and talented street magicians. Chosen to work together, they are given the ultimate test in pulling off unbelievably over the top magic tricks to become part of ""Eye"". Legend has it that the ""Eye of Horus"" is an ancient Egyptian prophecy involving only the most talented magicians including former member, Lionel Shrike. With initiation opportunities twice every century, this secret society is considered the ultimate reward for magicians. They are the keepers and protectors of real magic for those who study it. Their ultimate job is to keep the hope and belief of true magic alive. Their seeker and creator study each magician for months lurking and watching their shows determining whether they are the right fit to embark on this fantastic yet dangerous journey. Lover and upcoming illusionist, J. Daniel Atlas played by Jessie Eisenberg, hermit and mentalist, Merrit McKinney played by Woody Harrelson, height priestess and escape artist, Henley Reeves played by Ilsa Fisher, death and con-man Jack Wilder played by Dave Franco are chosen as the four contenders. After receiving an invitation to an old abandon apartment in New York City, the recruiters are exposed to holographic blueprints to a magic show beginning their journey to the Eye. After a year of training, they finally become ""The Four Horsemen"" successfully robbing a French bank thanks to volunteer, Étienne Forcier, an account holder of the Credit Republican De Paris. Their success and exposure turn them into overnight international sensations. FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes played by Mark Ruffalo and Partisan Interpol agent, Alma Dray played by Melanie Laurent take on the four horsemen along with other members of the FBI in a cat and mouse game. With Thaddeus Bradley, the ever-famous former magician, played by Morgan Freeman out to expose the horseman to the world, these magicians must successfully perform each magic trick before time runs out. Thaddeus believes in his ability to expose these magicians since he did it once before to Lionel Shrike. After betraying their finance contributor, Arthur Tressler, played by Michael Caine, the horsemen embark on their final performance leading them to the mystery of whether the Eye truly exists. With rumors of a fifth horsemen, can these magicians pull off the unthinkable and become members of the Eye? A film, testing one's belief of magic and reminding ourselves the beauty of the unknown."

","Lots of bad reviews out there for this but I didn't hate it. It is a bit all over the place though so that even with the fantastic cast, original story and all the flash it just failed to impress me much in the execution. It sorta feels 'Oceans'ish except with a with a group of magicians known as ""The Four Horsemen"" who pull off brazen heists during their performances, the proceeds of which they share with the audiences. This raises the attention of FBI agent (Mark Ruffalo) who spends the rest of the movie trying to catch them.<br/><br/>Its a caper film and very watchable, in fact there were moments were I thought it was going to be a really good movie but it never quite lives up to itself. Some parts of it are clever, others stupid. A lot of the story happens off screen then is just briefly explained by the characters or assumed by the viewer. There's a big car chase in the middle that comes out of nowhere and a crazy lukewarm romance going on between Ruffalo and a French Interpol agent. Towards the end it becomes almost fantasy-like with shades of 'National Treasure' thrown in and the actual ending just goes on and on; its over, wait another sub ending, another explanation, the credits, another thrown in bit scene.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the extended cast though, as well as the initial set up and coming together of The Horsemen (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco) The banter between them is entertaining and there's also Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman who are such pros they can do no wrong. 1/10/16"

","As a person with a lifelong distaste for the pointlessness and immorality of films lauding the actions of criminals and con-artists, I had a very bad sinking feeling for the first couple of minutes of this film. But somehow I stuck with it, and in fact had a great (unexpectedly great) deal of fun with ""Now You See Me"". I have never been to an illusionists' show and am never likely to. But if you're going to do it, do it big, and we the film audience get an impressively tangible sense of the awesome scale and complexity of the illusions being performed here by ""The Four Horsemen"" (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher and Franco). Given that they are at once the controllers and the controlled, these key characters come over surprisingly sympathetically and are pleasant to watch - especially in the early and middle stages of the film. The debunker is played by Morgan Freeman (great as ever), but the sparks of screen presence fair fly in the short scenes he gets to play with Michael Caine. The Mark Ruffalo character and the FBI side of the film are obviously necessary to it, but seem to add relatively little to the enjoyment, while the addition of the Interpol agent in the admittedly delightful form of Melanie Laurent (who also acts well enough) is nevertheless puzzling at many moments. To be honest, I was not a huge fan of the ending either, but that was a few minutes in a couple of slick and spellbinding hours that do what a film ought to do (even in a genre such as this which is definitely an acquired taste for this reviewer)."
"hunter_reboul","7","0","1","2 January 2016"," Great movie, but lacked logic.
","Let me start off by saying I won't say that the plot is the perfect, but it isn't as bland as most say. The general plot is an FBI agent trying to catch four magicians for various robberies throughout the movie. Really I don't see how it was scattered or horrible.<br/><br/>Now comes the big part of this movie; the logic of it all. Of course, there are these huge tricks throughout the film that almost seem like real magic, which is of course the point. However, they do explain how they are done, and most of the explanations make sense. <br/><br/>However, every so often there are moments that make no sense. For example when Dylan and Jack fight. Dylan pushes Jack into a curtain...and Jack vanishes and appears on the other side of the room. So you mean he somehow was able to get out of it and across the room WITHOUT Dylan seeing him? Another instance is when the three Horsemen jump off the building in their finally and turn into money. I'm guessing that suppose to be some funky projection or whatever. Some naive people may even say ""Well the only explanation is that they have real magic!"" I get that there's hints that maybe these guys have actual magic...but that just feels like total bull- crap to me. The only instance of real magic is ""The Eye"", who claim they have real magic. But at the times of these tricks, the Horsemen weren't part of The Eye, so they shouldn't have had access to the magic.<br/><br/>If they had passed it off as the guys had ACTUAL magic, that might have been fine. In fact, that might have made it cooler. But the fact that they tried to explain that everything they did had a logical explanation made it so that some things in the movie were down right IMPOSSIBLE.<br/><br/>Basically, it has great humor, a good story line, generally likable characters, and maybe one too many twists (in my opinion, Dylan being behind everything was pretty cool and did fill in a couple holes), but the fact that logic was thrown out the window throughout the movie just took away from how awesome it was."
"SenjoorMutt","6","0","1","24 December 2015"," That's What Happens When You Try to Be Cool
","'No You See Me' is trying to look cool and smart, but it actually isn't. At least it's entertaining and fun, but not because of plot but through witty dialogue and charismatic cast. Though the film is about magicians the magic vanishes pretty quickly and leaves us ridiculous and implausible heist schemes. Characters, though charming, are rather one dimensional and not as mysterious as one could expect from magicians be. This film tries to convince you how clever it is, but if you take away all the flashing show scenes and sloppy action scenes with all the unnecessary jump cats and camera shakes, you'll get quite a flat movie. Just another film that purely relies on fast paced action sequences than actual storytelling, clever twists or complex characters. And those action scenes and editing aren't very magical (creative) either.<br/><br/>Nonethless, 'No You See Me' is nice fun ride that can be easily enjoyed second time when it's on cable."
"goinggolden","8","0","1","2 December 2015"," A fun movie but not the best of all time
","The Film Now You See Me is a thrilling adventure that takes you on a magical journey with these four characters Jack, Henley, Danny, and Merret as they try to earn their place in the Eye. Heading their escape was the ever clever Dylan Rhodes (played by Mark Ruffalo). The way the movie coalesced everything from the beginning to the end is what makes this movie for me. Knowing that every robbery and every magic trick was done for an exact reason was impressive. Also was the all star cast that they put together for this film, from David Franco to Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine this cast is star-studded. The big thing for me was the twist at the end of the film, which I won't give out but it will be worth the wait. The last thing i have to say that this film isn't going to win best picture. There are a lot of things that are plot holes within the film but I do not think about that. This film is about four people finding themselves in their group. Their soul purpose is to make each other better and I think makes the film for me. It is about finding themselves and I really enjoy this film because is what just downright fun to watch and that is why i can watch them again and again"

","This film is an extremely intriguing mind twisting thrill ride. The plot and the twists that entangle it are truly amazing! The special effects are well done and add to the overall movie. The actors, including Morgan freeman, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, Dave Franco, and Michael Caine all do a very good job with their lines and scenes. I thought Morgan Freeman did the best job of the entire cast personally. This movie had very sneaky clever plot twists, as you would expect from Now You See Me. It's all a big illusion, and it's an illusion you won't want to miss. This movie is intelligent and smart as well. The action sequences are great fun too! I cannot wait for the sequel in the summer of 2016! 7/10."
"Screen_Blitz","7","0","1","11 October 2015"," Fun and energetic heist-thriller with a marvelous cast
","From Louis Leterrier, director of The Transporter (2002), Transporter 2 (2005), and The Incredible Hulk, this crime heist-thriller follows four magicians: Daniel Atlas (played by Jesse Eisenberg), Merrit McKinney (played by Woody Harrelson) Henley Reeves (played by Isla Fisher), and Jack Wilder (played by Dave Franco), who host a reality show on-stage where they use their magic skills to rob banks around the world. Their amazing magical abilities soon draw to attention to FBI agents Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (played by Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent) who go investigation in search of an explanation behind their robberies, and an eccentric mastermind Thaddeus Bradley (played by Morgan Freeman) who desperately tries to expose their illusional power, leading a wild chase in search for secrets and hidden plots.<br/><br/>Now You See Me boast some creative ideas and executes them in an ""okay"" way. I can't say I was too impressed with them. With the plot involving magicians who use teleportation techniques to rob banks for living, you would expect few plot twist and turns somewhere along the way. Sadly this film doesn't have much of these. But that's okay, the thoughtful storytelling, decently constructed characters, and strong pacing make up for some of it. The biggest disappointment however, is that the film lacks suspense and thrills that make it more exciting. The whole premise of how the characters use their magic to manipulate the minds of people is clever, but it's never gets interesting. The cast is very great on the other hand. Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco demonstrate some great performances as the main characters. Morgan Freeman did an alright job as the main antagonist, although he felt a bit miscast. <br/><br/>Overall, Now You See Me isn't too bad of a movie. Maybe if the plot was better developed or at least was a given a better direction, this will would feel more captivating. Also, suspense and thrills are what is this film is missing and really needs."

","a little bit of fun and some good Woody Harrelson that's about all i got from this film, the tricks are to confusing and seem impossible to pull off. I didn't believe anything that was happening they should have just made the tricks a little more realistic, the final ""illusion"" was like what the hell just happened. Jesse Eisenberg Is always hit or miss with me ( ex. hit: Zombieland, Miss: 30 minutes or less ) and this movie was a miss he comes off as his normal pretentious self and in this movie it was just to much. I really liked Melanie Laurent and Mark Ruffalo as the detectives, Michael Caine and Isla Fisher (who's super hot) are both pretty good even though Caine plays him self as usual and I like the Morgan Freeman Character. To this movies credit it does have a lot of cool twists and had the right idea just went way to far. in conclusion if you like magic or thief/heist/con movies you will probably wanna watch this once and never again lol because they had a good idea my rating is 5 / 10"

","Talking to a family friend about a friends upcoming birthday,I was happily caught by surprise,when he revealed that he had picked up a film to give as a gift,due to it having ""inspired"" the Bollywood flick Dhoom 3,which led to me getting ready to step into the magic circle.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Successfully performing their own acts, magicians J. Daniel Atlas/ Jack Wilder/Henley Reeves and Merritt McKinney each receive a mysterious card,which contain details to a hidden location,where they meet a benefactor.<br/><br/>1 Year later:<br/><br/>Gaining sponsorship from wealthy insurance magnate Arthur Tressler,the group perform their first ever show in Las Vegas. Expertly using their showmanship ,the gang announces that their final act for the night is a bank robbery.Getting an audience member on stage,the group teleport the audience member to his bank in Paris,where he activates an air duct that vacuums up the cash,which causes it to showers onto the Las Vegas audience.As news that an actual robbery has taken place, FBI agent Dylan Rhodes is joined by Interpol agent Alma Dray,and given the task of finding out how the robbery took place.<br/><br/>Interviewing the group,Rhodes and Dray find each of the gang to be holding their cards close to their chests,which leads to them being freed over a lack of evidence.Keeping a close watch on their activates,Rhodes and Dray attend the gangs second Vegas performance.Pulling Arthur Tressler up on stage,they allow him to bask in their showmanship.As Tressler starts to enjoy the adoring crowd,the group reveal a new trick up their sleeves.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Whilst the guys do dominate the flick,the two girls shine in magical performances,with the very pretty Isla Fisher (who almost drowned when a scene which has Henley Reeves fail to get out a water tank,turned into Fisher being unable to get out of a faulty tank) giving Reeves a sassy curl of the lips,whilst an elegant Mélanie Laurent gives the title a perfect French New Wave light touch.Always kept one step behind the magicians, Mark Ruffalo gives an excellent performance as Dylan Rhodes,thanks to Ruffalo avoiding the easy option of making Rhodes look like a hapless idiot,by displaying intense desperation in pulling the bottom card from everyone else's pack.<br/><br/>Reuniting from the Batman movies,Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman both give charming performances,with Caine barking orders at everyone,whilst Freeman walks across the title with a wide, charismatic grin. Addressing the viewer at the start of the film, Jesse Eisenberg gives a very good performance as J. Daniel Atlas,whose showmanship hides nerves of doubt over their tricks being a success,as Eisenberg's former Zombieland star Woody Harrelson chews the scenery with a hilariously dry wit.<br/><br/>Increasing the elaborateness of each magicians act,the screenplay by Ed Solomon/Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt casts a dazzling twist ending over the film,which whilst coming from a rather left-field position,gives the magic an unexpected darkness,as the writers reveal the ""final trick"" that the magicians have been playing from the very start.Whilst the writers do use magic to make some leaps in logic disappear,they keep the movie moving at a sparkling pace,by turning the magicians into a gang of outlaws,whose heists go from a misdirection bank robbery to transforming into falling money.<br/><br/>Capturing every wave of the wand,director Louis Leterrier and cinematographers Mitchell Amundsen & Larry Fong build a thrilling atmosphere with stylish frantic scatter-shot camera moves,as the gang casts their spells in order to stay ahead of the cops. Diving into Las Vegas,Leterrier brilliantly uses vast wide shots to capture the spectacle and every gasp that the audience makes,as Leterrier grips the viewer and casts a spell,which reveals that the closer you think you are, the less you'll actually see."

","Now You See Me is a fun movie that keeps you interested until the end. The cast is superb and the acting is great. The premise is an interesting one, but the big twist at the end really ruined the movie for me.<br/><br/>Spoilers:<br/><br/>It's obvious from the first scenes that there is a mystery man behind everything in the movie. You, the viewer, are left to guess who that is. They really push you into believing it is the female Interpol agent, but that really was too obvious. You might also think it was Morgan Freeman, but it's Mark Ruffalo, who is the head of the investigation into the heists.<br/><br/>There were many coincidences and perfectly-timed events that had to happen for the movie to play out like it did. For one, before Ruffalo's character set all these things in motion, how would he know he would be the lead for the investigation? During the whole movie, his character does things that are inexplicable if he was really the master magician behind everything.<br/><br/>Yes, you can explain away his persistence in trying to catch the 4 Horsemen in that he wanted to test them, but other actions don't make sense, like getting drunk at a bar after a failure to catch the thieves, or browbeating the female Interpol agent because he ""believes"" she's in cahoots with the 4 Horsemen. This twist just seemed too forced. Like the writers really wanted to surprise you, so they make it impossible to ever suspect Ruffalo's character. The result is that you feel cheated. This isn't an ego thing, I enjoy a good twist, but it has to be reasonable, and it just wasn't here.<br/><br/>At other times, you really have to suspend your disbelief for the movie to work. Franco's character happens to escape a certain way just when an FBI unmarked car pulls up. He later escapes by having an identical car set up on the Brooklyn Bridge. In order for this to work, they would have had to know the exact make and model (and color) of the FBI car that would be pulling up at the complete other end of the building. I hate to feel like I'm overthinking the writers, but I think they overthought the movie. Keep it simple and this movie would have been a lot better."

","The guy who played the part of Dylan Rhodes was horrible. I think the guy ruined the movie with his overacting. Anyone else could have done a better job with this role. If you don't mind watching this clown for however long this movie is, then go for it. I think I'm going to change the channel and watch baseball instead. Ruffalo, who I have never heard of before, was a bad choice for this movie. I can't remember seeing him in any other movie, so I am hoping that other casting directors have a better sense of talent. If I happen to see him in another movie, I will gladly stop watching. Funny because I thought Woody Harrelson would have been the reason to not watch the movie. He was tolerable but Ruffalo just stinks."

","If you like the mystery of magic, but also like being told how it's happened, this film is for you, if you like character development and a progressive story line maybe you wont like this film so much. I personally enjoyed this film as I enjoy the mystery of magic and the big shock of 'how could i have been so stupid?! It's so obvious!' however, watching it a few times was needed to understand a few of the tricks and devious manipulations. A few of the tricks were left a mystery, such as how the 'machine' appeared when they robbed the bank, but overall it was enjoyable and quite cool how it all came together, when they used the tricks they'd previously shown everyone to fool interpol and how every trick ruined a persons life, for a reason. I would recommend this film to anyone who is interested in magic, but maybe not a magician themselves. However, even though I recommend this film, I suggest not reading to many reviews, as the bad ones will point out the negatives and thats all that you'll notice when watching it. Its a fun, clever and interesting film that you'll probably watch once, unless you're interested in figuring out the unanswered tricks."

","Now You See Me starts with a card trick that seems to be played on we, the movie-viewing audience. From the moment the card we picked is seen projection mapped onto the side of a building, there is one question constantly asked: How did they do that? As the bank robbing 'magic' pulses along, a sub-plot involving a fatal attempt at escapology in the past hints at relevance to current events. The cast are outstanding, there is a brisk line in jokes and put-downs, and most of all, the audience is trying to constantly keep up without ever managing to get ahead. The reveal at the end is fiendishly tricky and emotionally poignant. It also has the two qualities required of any perfect twist - it is both surprising and inevitable. Yes, there are plot holes and incongruities, but they only occur to you after the credits have rolled, and the more pedantic viewer can have a field day going over them. Some films you just have to give yourself over to and enjoy the ride, and Now You See Me is a perfect example."

","Now You See Me (2013): Dir: Louis Leterrier / Cast: Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Isla Fisher, Melanie Laurent, Woody Harrelson: Flashy magical entertainment about deceit. It regards four magicians brought together for a phenomenal show that concludes with the robbing of a bank. The question is how did they perform this stunt. Mark Ruffalo plays a frustrated FBI agent out to convict these magicians but baffled at their constant ability to remain ahead and commit these robberies under their noses. Melanie Laurent plays a French detective brought in to assist in the case. At first she butts heads with Ruffalo until he realizes that she has studied up on the art of magic. Well written with enchanting images of magic as well as a thrilling plot with many clever surprises. Unfortunately the ending is problematic with its justified stealing as well as logic being really tested. The actors do a good job but only Ruffalo and Laurent have roles of any great depth. They are the two attempting to bring this whole scheme down, and by itself, it is the best written element in the film. Jessie Eisenberg, Isla Fisher, Woody Harrelson, and Dave Franco plays the magicians but they come off as types as oppose to personalities. In comparison to Ruffalo and Laurent they are boring. They are introduced quickly with each subjecting a different form of magic talent but despite this they are never very interesting. We witness several spectacular magic acts that allow viewers to get some sort of grasp on such an event. In the end director Louis Leterrier presents his best film since The Incredible Hulk but not quite as magical as that film. Score: 7 / 10"

","I note that three people worked on this script. It's a real shame they never thought to actually meet each other and nobody told which kind of film they were supposed to be making.<br/><br/>The film starts okay, and continues being okay for a good third of its runtime with some nicely done sequences. Then it starts to go downhill and I immediately started worrying that its vast ego was going to get in the way of a good story. Spoiler, it did.<br/><br/>The plotpoints were pulled from a hat. I cannot think of any other way this story could have come together. Numerous scenes have little to no purpose and seem so out of place they could be from a completely different film. There are two plot twists that happen within a minute of each other towards the end that are both astoundingly nonsensical, as they go directly against the tone of the entire film - rendering a potentially decent climax utterly useless as the writers (probably completely unselfconsciously) demonstrate that they don't have anything like the skill required for what they've set up and just decide to throw reveals, dramatic music and camera sweeps into the bucket and hope to bob you don't notice that none of it makes any sense.<br/><br/>It is a watchable film, I'll give it that, but I really really tried to turn my brain off only to find my spinal cord telescoping with shock at the unbelievable number of plot holes. I wouldn't definitely not recommend it, but be prepared that it it really seriously, seriously stupid.<br/><br/>If the writers are reading this I might suggest they be a little more realistic about their abilities next time."

I've still never seen it in one sitting from beginning to end but I think I got it all now. During staged acts the Four Horsemen, ace magicians all, appear to be invading bank vaults or bank accounts and distributing their contents to the unwashed masses. What is really going on and why? You'll have to watch and find out. Mark Ruffalo, my new favorite actor, plays the FBI agent working with an Interpol agent to break the Horseman. Add Michael Caine, wealthy owner of an insurance company/victim, and Morgan Freeman, the great debunker of magicians, to the mix. Ruffalo and, of the Horseman, Eisenberg, are just great and this is good if somewhat complicated fun. Docked a point because the audience to the big stage acts comes off strangely unreal and hokey, otherwise just grand."

"bhargavbbdoublebannigeri","4","0","1","29 March 2015"," So disappointing...
","Okay, this movie has such a great setup. Magicians and crime is like peanut butter and jelly. And it's also nice to see illusionists in a more modern, down-to-earth story than those 18th century fantasy movies of which I'm getting a little tired at this point. So this movie builds anticipation. Even better, an enjoyable cast (Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson vs. Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman? That's forcing us to give them our money) pretty much does what they can to save this movie, but it's not enough. This movie has two main problems.<br/><br/>First off, Mélanie Laurent's character. It's kind of underdeveloped and doesn't really lend much to the movie. I guess they just needed to throw romance in there somewhere. But she's annoying! She just ticked me off throughout the whole movie. I just waited the whole time to see where she fit in, but the movie never really absorbed her.<br/><br/>Secondly, the ending. Holy cow, the ending. This is one of the worst movie endings I have ever seen. Yes, I did not see it coming... oh wait, I kind of did. It's such a formulaic resolution that you can't help but ponder during some of the draggy parts of the second act over how they're going to end the movie. From a logical standpoint, yes, it's kind of weak. I mean, he put all of his life's work into getting revenge on these guys, some of whom didn't really have much to do with his father's death, in such a shady way... it's just... beyond logical. Don't think about it, that's the logic of this movie. It's also just lazy writing. They took a premise they knew would make money and just threw in a pretty girl, maybe an Oscar winner or two (three if you include Common's Oscar win for Selma), and a lame plot twist to boot.<br/><br/>Maybe watch this movie if you want to. It's not unwatchable, but it will frustrate you."
"valen060","9","0","1","8 February 2015"," Cliché, Yet It's A Film with A Talented Cast
","Thinking about how much creativity came into play throughout the film is no easy feat. When I watched it shortly after its first weekend of release back in May 2013, I left the theater curious and constantly pondering over what happens next for the main characters. It certainly took me a while on how to properly critique it, but here goes:<br/><br/>The story about a group of four successful illusionists who step out of their average parlor trick performances and into something much bigger when they are given mysterious invitations. When they are caught by the FBI at their sold-out act in Las Vegas, there is little to no evidence to land them behind bars, and therefore released.<br/><br/>Stars Jessie Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco did outstandingly well as the Four Horsemen with wit, humor, and an intricate amount of knowledge to understand how to enact their plan. For example, I enjoyed the 'Zombieland' nod between Eisenberg and Harrelson (as their personalities in this film started to remind me of their previous work together). Another example is that Dave Franco really stood out when his Jack Wilder character is caught. When confronted by FBI agents while all alone, his knowledge of 'sleight-of-hand' proved beneficial in getting him out of tight spots. Although it does seem deluded and ridiculous that such a thing may happen, it was clever and witty on how it played out on screen. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo as an FBI agent pursuing the Horsemen was good for a few laughs. Every time he thinks he's got them in his grasp, he would usually be left outwitted and dumbfounded as to how it happened to him. The reunion of stars Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine since 'The Dark Knight' films was really interesting. They delivered impressively as supporting characters who are also in pursuit of these performers (usually out of their hands and into that of the authorities) and are just as significant to the film's storyline. In one scene, Freeman's character Thaddeus Bradley quoted as saying, ""leveling the playing field"" for both the FBI and the Horsemen, but his true intentions still felt shady.<br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier (Transporter, Unleashed) did a splendid job crafting the entire set-up. It's like Robin Hood meets David Copperfield creatively spliced together. Judging by the various heists the Horsemen pull off, mysteriously robbing a bank without getting caught was only the beginning. I can tell that the film did not rely too heavily on CGI for the complex stunts and that most common tricks shown on screen like sleight-of-hand or disappearing acts were practiced countless hours by the cast. Story-wise, it does feel cliché in terms of a typical caper film (albeit adding illusionary elements into it), but still it's a movie that is worth pondering over because with some surprising twists and a few scenarios left unanswered, it's very possible that Four Horsemen's quest is FAR from over."

","As most people already wrote, the twists can be seen coming from a mile away. The final reveal got me a bit off guard as I guess my brain went by the basic Hollywood standards (the foreigner is the ""bad guy"") but nevertheless, 90% predictable down to the actual ""magic tricks"".<br/><br/>Especially these magic tricks, however, are the biggest flaw of this movie. If you want to sell ""magic"" as elaborate tricks you should stay away from CGI effects that do not work in real life and/or you should at least try explain these tricks (especially the complex ones) more so if you already have a debunk character in the movie anyways. Otherwhise you have a merger of tricks and CGI-real-magic, that this movie is trying to permanently deny. The tricks that get explained in the movie are your basic stuff that has been known by every schoolchild since ...I don't know the past 100 years? and their use within the movie is soooo predictable, so many MANY ways of using more clever tricks.... and all failed.<br/><br/>Writing of characters and dialogues definitely not based on reality, and filled with typical American stereotypes of ""balancing the world"". Just on the main description of this movie and the modern ""Robin Hood"" image it tries to create. If you rob a bank, this doesn't hurt the ""evil"" bank (little hint - its ensured!) it hurts the little people that have their money IN the bank..... <br/><br/>Now the good parts: Acting was decent and visually the movie is quite nice, take away the overused 360 camera movements around the main characters.Lots of colors."

","Slick Hollywood entertainment doesn't do a hell of a lot with its cast members that portray the magicians (Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco), but it allows for some wowser, jawdroppingly meticulous, pull-the-wool-over-the-eyes stunts that make asses out of the FBI, an insurance company's filthy rich CEO (Matthew Caine), and even a ""magic debunk media specialist"" (Morgan Freeman), all with massive egos that get deflated. Mark Ruffalo does disheveled, downtrodden, down-on-his-luck characters especially well, here portraying a FBI agent in need of a break as it seems the magicians are always pulling a fast one over him. His French Interpol agent partner, played by Mélanie Laurent (fabulous actress from QT's Inglorious Basterds), seems to know a lot about magic and could be another part of the ""grand design"". This is one of those films with a twist that is most certain to leave a ""you gotta be kidding me"" feeling. It is a hard pill to swallow. The film, as explained throughout by Freeman, allows us to see how our magicians orchestrate the theft of large sums of money and how they are used to help those in need or to just as punishment for a specific reason determined later. Freeman's gloating at the expense of the agents trying to catch the magicians and later looking at a face behind a jail cell is rather fitting for such a condescending geniusseeing himself duped has a poetic justice to it. Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco are often devices instead of characters fully fleshed, besides a few moments of repartee and traded pokes at each other, which is a shame because they are all strong talents in need of a better film. This instead is all about a screenplay that wants to amaze through its elaborate plot using ""misdirection"" than truly developing characters we care about. Caine's CEO losing money on stage with the very magicians he is managing has quite a bit of amusing irony. Could all of this really happen? It's beautifully designed rubbish for our enjoyment. Turn the brain off, folks."

","I think the greatest trick that this show presented us is that Tommy Wiseau actually wrote and directed it and no one even knew. There was enough arrogance and pretentiousness in that movie to make it unbearable, but that's unfortunately not the worst part. The movie reveals a farrago of plot twists and explanations of how things happened, and they are meant to make people gasp and explain how unbelievable the writing is. It worked: as I remember, after watching some of said plot twists I gasped and said ""I cannot believe how stupid this is"". The explanations either made absolutely no sense or were just completely un-believable. Not to mention, although the explanations of these magicians' 'genius' plans were so elaborate and complex, the motivation and incentive behind the extremely dangerous and illegal tricks they performed was never revealed. In the first bank robbery trick alone, the magicians rob $3M before they even do the 'robbery', but instead of keeping the money for themselves, they decide to do a magic trick about it? Not to mention, as they make their epic getaway from the FBI after their last trick, they end up in the middle of Times Square, watching the breaking news among thousands of people. Great idea. And don't tell me I'm missing something. Between me and the writer of this atrocity, the only thing I'm 'missing' is a chromosome."

I can't buy the plot twist, well come on, it was not very well thought through, if you really think it through, yes, inspector Dylan could have been behind all of the tricks and had secretly given Four horsemen the directions to complete these tricks, but the way he acted through the whole movie..... it just doesn't add up. He was supposedly a dumb inspector, who always screws up, so if he was behind all of the tricks, then the scenes when he fought/ tried to catch the four horsemen were completely irrelevant and no hint was shown regarding him being behind all of it or at least knowing something. Would have loved to see more of the tricks/action instead of the dumb fbi chases like in every other movie. <br/><br/>The fact that Morgan Freeman actually got tricked and put in jail by the supposedly dumb inspector was hilarious."

","It's probably aimed at the same audience as some of Steven Spielberg's lighter works. Four magicians (or illusionists) combine forces to rob millions of dollars from an insurance scam, led by Michael Caine, who, baggy eyes or not, is still a presence to be dealt with on the screen. Ditto for Morgan Freeman as the debunker of magicians. Mark Ruffalo delivers a smooth performance as the New York City detective out to nail the Fab Four.<br/><br/>And Mélanie Laurent as the Interpol Agent after the same gang of miscreant youngsters is -- Wow. <br/><br/>If you subscribe to the concept of conventional beauty, she's got it. Only she doesn't smile much. Her default expression is searching and a little grim. Reminds me of a French concierge I once had to deal with. Makes me shudder to think of it. That wouldn't stop any normal man from throwing himself at her feet and worshiping her toes.<br/><br/>Of the four youthful illusionists, the least youthful, and the only one I recognized, was Woody Harrelson as a ""mentalist"" adept at intuiting facts from a person's expressions and body language. Of the other three, one of them, I think Jesse Eisenberg, speaks more quickly than I can think. Don't we already see enough of that on cable news and in commercials? Of course we don't want to bore the intended audience with elasticized phonemes.<br/><br/>I'm kind of skipping over the plot, I know, but for good reason. I couldn't follow it. Illusion follows illusion, the identities of the principals are peeled apart like layers of an onion, and some of the supposed tricks aren't tricks at all because the explanations that follow make no sense. Example: An ordinary mirror reflects the person looking at it, not a distorted image of what's behind it. Well -- doesn't it? Not in this movie. An illusionist here can see through the kind of mirror you have in your bathroom.<br/><br/>With respect to these magic tricks, it resembles ""The Game,"" with Michael Douglas as the victim of a cruel conspiracy designed to turn him from a frigid ass into a mensch. Every trick pulled on poor Douglas must be planned perfect, right down to minor events that no one could have predicted would take place. Same here.<br/><br/>The only method of coping with this is to relax and allow the fantasy to flood your mind. You know, try not to think too hard. Just watch the images flashing by on the screen, and relish the Ooohs and Ahhhs from the audience. The epic musical score will help a lot. And since you will never understand the intricacies of the plot, why not indulge yourself with a dose of psychedelic tea? When it's all over, it will make looking into a kaleidoscope seem dull."
"tobiasfrolov","4","0","1","6 August 2014"," ""The Prestige"" - the Michael Bay version.
","The one thing that comes to mind when trying to describe this movie is ""Michael Bay does The Prestige"". If you haven't seen The Prestige it's a brilliant movie by Christopher Nolan featuring two magicians performing illusions on the backdrop of a meticulously crafted character-driven story. Now You See Me however, is all about the dazzle without any of the wit, or overall content for that matter.<br/><br/>Let's forget for a moment about the lacking quality of the characters and the story, and instead focus on one of my other main gripes with the film; it's cheapness, specifically regarding the ""illusions"". Throughout the film we are shown a few tricks that are fairly clever and that challenges the viewer to figure out how they were performed. The movie then proceeds to explain the trick, giving us a sense that ""I could totally have figured that out!"" (something The Prestige also did incredibly well). That's all very good, but then the movie puts a ton of CGI-effects on screen, expecting the viewer to accept that ""there must be some logical explanation for this"" even though the writers clearly didn't bother to come up with any. This takes all the enjoyment out of these scenes, which frankly are supposed to be the selling point of the film.<br/><br/>That being said, the production values are good, the actors are not bad per se, and yada yada yada... I can't give it too low of a score because of basic stuff like that. But if you're looking for a smart movie on this subject, go watch The Prestige. And if you've already seen it, watch it again. I wish I had."

","This movie is a very good story, very innovative and original, but the casting was totally off! It seemed to me, they should have cast mostly unknown actors for the characters of the four horsemen. Ruffalo was all wrong for the part he played. Pierce Brosnan, or someone like him would have been a much better choice. Ruffalo just doesn't exude the intellect to adequately pull off a part like this with confidence. Jesse Eisenberg has an ever/never ending ego I just can't digest in any movie. Dave Franco seemed to always try too hard to correctly pronounce every word instead of acting natural. Woody Harrelson, well, can anyone ever imagine him being this smart? Isla Fisher, just like Anjelina Jolie, seems to spend more time worrying about how she looks than how she is acting. Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman are the only two that really fit their parts. Worth a watch, but not very satisfying due to the casting errors."

It's certainly a novel concept - four magicians rob banks while they're on stage and donate the money to the audience - live! Naturally, the FBI has something to say about this and a cat and mouse game ensues.<br/><br/>The first thing to say is that it's an 'all star' cast. Of course the only trouble is that, having so many talented actors in one place, means not all of them get the screen time/character development they deserve. The direction is slick and the film looks and feels like part of the 'MTV generation.' It is a case of 'style over substance,' but there's so much style that you should just sit back and enjoy the ride.

","This movie was for me one big magic trick.<br/><br/>Like many, I thought the beginning of this film was great. The presentation of the ""Four Horsemen"" was well done. Especially Woody was brilliant as the mentalist. His humor is natural and doesn't feel like forced or exaggerated. I find him irresistible in this role as a shrewd and highly intellectual lettered psychic illusionist.<br/><br/>Eisenberg has that natural arrogance of which I sometimes doubt whether this is played or it's his personality in real life. Fisher and Franco ensure the beauty portion of the film. The interplay of the four characters and the interactions between them was quite entertaining and frequently enormously funny.<br/><br/>Merritt McKinney: The first time I saw you, I thought you were... a dick. Henley Reeves: And? Merritt McKinney: That's it. J. Daniel Atlas: I'm touched. Merritt McKinney: Yeah, just from the bottom of my heart. J. Daniel Atlas: Well, I didn't say where I was touched.<br/><br/>Dylan and Alma, respectively FBI and Interpol, the Scully and Mulder of this film, played a very fine part. Caine, the wealthy guardian of the foursome plays a limited role. And Freeman was again the mysterious ex-magician whose lifework is to unmask the 4 magicians. These are the main characters what the story is about. The performances were magnificent. My favorite scene is the one where they all were arrested after the first performance. The conversations, the ascendancy that they showed, the arrogance and the magic they used. Admirable beautiful.<br/><br/>The illusions were of course totally exaggerated and improbable, but were a magnificent spectacle that was masterfully visualized. The sparse action scenes were worked out to the last detail and at times convincingly realistic. And sometimes these action scenes are ridiculously exaggerated. But yes, it's still a movie about illusionists. Right ?<br/><br/>Where did it go wrong then ? The denouement ! It's truly a total surprise, but at the same time so far fetched that it was implausible. Anyone who had seen it coming, better start a hobby in making bedspreads because all the other movies will be extremely predictable for you, I guess. For me this was a total letdown. A great movie with a magnificent run, a loving captivated middle, and then such a weak denouement. <br/><br/>More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/"

","From director Louis Leterrier (Transporter 2, The Incredible Hulk, Clash of the Titans), the trailer for this film looked really good, an all star cast in a film combining magic with a heist, I was certainly hoping for it to be slick and fun. Basically four small-time down on their luck magicians, J. Daniel Atlas (The Social Network's Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves (Confessions of a Shopaholic's Isla Fisher) and Jack Wilder (Dave Franco, James's brother) are summoned and brought together to an obscure place, and a year later the four are performing in Las Vegas as ""The Four Horsemen"". They have become big time stage illusionists filling venues, sponsored by British millionaire Arthur Tressler (Sir Michael Caine), but one particular show gains the attention of the authorities, when they perform a trick where audience member Étienne Forcier (José Garcia) is teleported from the Las Vegas stage to a bank in Paris, France, and robbing Tressler's account the stolen money showers the audience, but this heist did in fact happen for real. FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and French Interpol agent Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent) are partnered to investigate how this trick was pulled off, but they get completely lost along the way, not just by the four performers managing to use their skills of misdirection and illusion to get away every time, but by the mysterious insights from professional illusion exposer Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman). After many chases and opportunities to try and catch the foursome, all of which lead the cops to the wrong locations and get them more and more confused, it does appear that Jack is killed in a car crash, while J. Daniel, Merritt and Henley announce they will perform one last show to an audience, Dylan is sure he can get one step ahead of them, but he is still not able to keep up. In the end however, it turns out that Thaddeus was the one being tricked all along, he looks to have been set up by The Four Horsemen having his car stashed with stolen money, and in fact Dylan has been the mastermind behind all the schemes the magicians have got away with, he wanted to get to Thaddeus for humiliating his father years ago, and Tressler's company refused to pay his father's death insurance, Alma finds out but does not turn Dylan in. Also starring rapper Common as Evans and The Adjustment Bureau's Michael Kelly as Agent Fuller. All the actors are chosen pretty well for their parts, the film certainly has good use of special effects, camera tricks and editing, and there are small bits and pieces of a good story, but unfortunately it felt very predictable most of the time, there was too much going on, it got a little confusing, and I just couldn't shake off the feeling that the film was lame and boring, and I don't understand why they would bother making a sequel like they plan to, a sort of alright crime thriller.

","The movie starts out with an interesting premise and an intriguing cast of characters. I am not a fan of Jesse Eisenberg. His quick talking, over confident jerk does not get me all that much (although the scene where he gets his card is hilarious). I do, however, enjoy the performances of Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher. The interactions of the two are near on perfect, getting me to chuckle more than a few times. Dave Franco is practically nonexistent, for everything that he brings to the film. Melanie Laurant is there to be a pretty face and go oooh and aaaaah over the magic tricks. Mark Ruffalo's character is a bit harder to judge, as the character is acting, after all. The scenes where he is being his normal natural self, like the end, seem a bit more natural, so yeah.<br/><br/>A lot of people are complaining about the character development, but seriously... you are walking into a movie with Eisenberg and Harrelson as the main actors. Were you really expecting something deep and meaningful, with the world rocked over the magic mystery that this film is?<br/><br/>No. I saw those two names among the cast, and I went in knowing that it would be a shallow magic flick. And I was pleasantly surprised. Not about the shallow flick part, but because I found myself actually enjoying how... meaningless it was. They had the chance to make it deep and meaningful with the whole 'Eye' aspect, but they decided not to. This film does not put out any serious message, Oscar-nod-worthy portrayals. It is simply there to make you get lost in this fictional world for about two hours and nothing more.<br/><br/>Of course, there are plot holes and the capability of a watcher to suspend belief is a little stretched at times, but do you seriously go to see a magic show because the magician is a deep and complex character, with a tragic backstory and is capable of change if only the right woman were to step into his life and set him straight through a long and drama filled quest to find out the true meaning of life?<br/><br/>If so... don't you ever talk to me. You sound like a very boring person to be around. This movie, when it comes to pure entertainment value, I give it a ten. Acting I put on an 8. plot comes at an even 6, which makes for an 8 average, and that's what I'll give it.

As the Movie goes ahead, the viewers are served with some of the most enthralling magic performances and also the logic behind each one. The simplicity of each trick is jaw dropping when they are deciphered by Morgan Freeman. The Four Horsemen as the Protagonists call themselves in their stage shows are guided by this mystery man who they themselves will not have seen. After the Final performance from the 4 horsemen they are led to a tree where the mystery man is waiting for them. the 4 Horsemen are in for a huge surprise when they see the FBI agent who has been chasing them all along stands there. <br/><br/>The story is well written with a good old mix of mystery. A stunning performance by lead actors such as Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo, Morgan Freeman, Micheal Caine and others.<br/><br/>There are a few loopholes in the movie which can be excused looking at the overall performance of the movie. All in all, Its a good watch!!"

","I like my movies nice and tidy. You can make the beginning and middle as strange as you want, but the ending should be the bow on the package, sending the viewers out happily ever after.<br/><br/>That didn't happen in Now You See Me.<br/><br/>Worse yet, the more I try to understand it and end it happily, the less I understand.<br/><br/>With heist movies being one of my personal favorite genres, I sat down with high expectations for this movie. I got up feeling confused and disappointed. That movie didn't seem to end right. However, the more I thought about it, and took a look at the big picture, the more I realized the makers of the movie had me right where they wanted me.<br/><br/>Quick synopsis: Four street magicians find cards with the same address, date, and time on them. They meet up, find some mysterious room, then appear at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas a year later, now together and known as the Four Horsemen. They rob a bank in France from Las Vegas, sending the FBI and Interpol after them. After a couple more heists during shows and close calls, they escape and join the elite magician organization known only as The Eye.<br/><br/>Sounds fairly clear, right?<br/><br/>But then there's deeper elements that I'm not going to get into, because that would drag this review out. If you want to fully grasp this movie, you need to watch it for yourself. But now to the whole reason behind the movie.<br/><br/>As an amateur magician myself, when the actors discuss the concepts of misdirection in the movie, this was all stuff I've heard before. There is also one line repeated throughout the film: ""The closer you look, the less you see."" Also, when discussing misdirection, they repeatedly say that ""the magician makes you think you've seen something, all the while setting you up for the biggest trick."" That's exactly how the movie as a whole works. The ending is so confusing at first, but when you think about the movie, you realize that the whole movie is a magic trick. <br/><br/>Just as you start to think you understand the movie, there's a twist ending, then the movie's over. <br/><br/>Misdirection.<br/><br/>Then, as you think harder about the movie and try to resolve it, you can't.<br/><br/>""The closer you look, the less you see.""<br/><br/>The masterful job that the film does of making a movie into a magic trick makes it definitely deserve an 8 out of 10."

"Buddy-51","8","0","3","30 November 2013"," A Hollywood blockbuster that's actually fun
","Sort of a modern-day version of ""Charade"" (much better than the ACTUAL modern-day remake, ""The Truth About Charlie""), ""Now You See Me"" is a phenomenally entertaining piece of prestidigitation about four street magicians - Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Isla Fischer - who form an act called The Four Horsemen, whose claim to fame is that they have the ability to rob banks without leaving the arena where they're performing. Like the Stanely Donen classic, ""Now You See Me"" is built on a series of plot twists and character turns in which no one or nothing is quite what he, she or it appears to be.<br/><br/>The always engaging Mark Ruffalo is the skeptical FBI agent trying to catch the criminals in the act, while old pros Michael Cane and Morgan Freeman have the time of their professional lives as a veteran magician and a veteran magician debunker, respectively. Their scenes together are alone worth the price of admission. And Ruffalo is perfection as the slightly disheveled and perpetually outmaneuvered law enforcer who finds himself up against a quartet of antagonists who always manage to be a good half-dozen or so steps ahead of him.<br/><br/>It's hard to overstate just how much fun this movie turns out to be, with well-earned kudos going to Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin and Edward Ricourt for their infinitely imaginative screenplay, Louis Leterrier for his turbocharged direction, and all the technical wizards who've engaged in a little legerdemain of their own by making the magic scenes so seamless and convincing.<br/><br/>And if it all doesn't seem entirely plausible in the end, and you walk away with the nagging suspicion that the writers must have cheated in some way - well, that IS the power of magic, after all.<br/><br/>Hollywood filmmakers please take note: THIS is how you make a crowd-pleasing blockbuster!"
"jackasstrange","7","0","4","22 November 2013"," The critics are coming for all the wrong reasons
","Seriously, i'm just shocked to see how many critics this film received. It's a perfectly enjoyable and well made film. C'mon. <br/><br/>The plot is maybe too absurd and flawed for some, and i can understand that. In a superficial sight, you can really see that in some parts, i admit that, the events are not very well explained, and the ending was probably not a good deal, and in that i agree, obscure and quite nonsense. But to put the fault in the character's development is a little too idiotic. The magicians are not the protagonists anyways, so what the film shows is exactly what we need to know about them: they were cheap artists, which were selfish about their gifts and they just used them for money. But later they found a reason bigger than them to use these gifts and make their tricks, without being selfish enough to ask for money in exchange. <br/><br/>That's it. They can be seen as an allegory of the man itself, which don't think that to live for himself is good enough and follows something that they don't even know if exists or not, just for the faith of that there is a good and bigger proposal. And after reaching all the objectives, they finally can met their creator, God, that can been seen as Mark Ruffalo's character in the film. Another hint of why i assume that is because his character has eyes everywhere, he knows exactly what everyone is doing into his plan. But of course, is just my theory. You may accept it or not. <br/><br/>I don't have any complains about the acting. Average. Neither good or bad. Convincing, but without impact. The cinematography is very good, Oscar nomination worthy for sure. Some scenes are really breath-taking, such as the first presentation of the magicians in a show. Anyways, it's a film worth of a watch. Not sure about a re watch, though. 6.8/10"

","Review: I really enjoyed this movie because its full of suspense and, of course, amazing magic. The cast was great and the twists throughout the movie were unpredictable. As I hadn't read any of the reviews, I didn't know what was going to happen at the end, which made it more enjoyable. It was good to see some old faces, like Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine and Woody Harrelson, who were a great addiction to the new faces like Jesse Eisenberg, Mark Ruffalo,Dave Franco and Isla Fisher, who was a brilliant choice by the director. It's has a very original concept which was well put together by the director and the pace of the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's not very often that I say this, but i hope that there is a sequel. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: After watching the first half an hour of this movie, I didn't have a clue were the storyline was going to go, but it just gets better from one scene to the next. It was also good to finally see a movie that doesn't include a romantic element because it gets straight to it, right from the beginning. In a lot of Jesse Eisenberg's movies, I find his voice really annoying and he talks way too fast, but it seemed like someone had a word with him because he was quite good in this film. The mixture of wit and seriousness was put together well, along with the action and drama. The only question that I have about the movie is, what happened to Michael Caine's character? Apart from that I couldn't find that much wrong with it.<br/><br/>Budget: $75million Worldwide Gross: $234million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there movies about magicians robbing banks with the FBI on there tail. 8/10"

","Who says only children could believe in magic? Let's close the mouth of all these great people who told us ""There's something, that's not real, He's just manipulating your mind"" . Because finally, we all know it but we choose to believe, believe that everything's possible when you have a dream. And most of all when you want to keep a part of unexplained in this world sometimes too harsh. Prove that things are not always what they seemed to be, that's the missions of the ""4 Riders"", they all possess a single talent and use to re-established truth and order in this world of manipulation. Of course magicians use rigging but only to let us dream and forget the reality. A movie full of surprises mixing magic, mystery, action and police investigation, with endearing and destabilizing characters who definitely let us think they have their place in ( I'm thinking about Jesse Eisenberg or Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent), a screenplay wrote perfectly without floating minute or incoherence. In the end, this movie (collaboration with French and American) is a magic trick perfectly orchestrated, enough to make us wonder in the end ""Was it real?"".

","Now You See Me is a brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a talented cast that all work very well together. The movie was exciting and unpredictable, all the characters were suspicious, which added to the suspense and lead to many great twists and turns throughout. The character arch for Dylan Rhodes was terrific, however, I felt the Four Horseman were very underdeveloped, we learn a very scarch amount of information about their lives prior to the events which unfold in this movie, hopefully we will find out more in the confirmed sequel. The cast is top notch, with the Four Horseman, Eisenberg, Fisher, Harrelson and Franco, all working very well off each other. They are joined by two very experienced actors, Morgan Frreman and Michael Caine, but Mark Ruffalo steals the show as the hard working detective trying to crack this complicated case. An exciting, magical experience with no poor performance in sight, I would recommend Now You See Me to anyone looking for a good crime film or mystery. <br/><br/>An FBI agent investigates a case involving a group of four magicians that managed to rob a bank in France while performing in Las Vegas, as well as several other groundbreaking, illegal stunts. However, it is impossible to get his hands on this team. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Mark Ruffalo"
"foxington4000","9","0","3","24 October 2013"," Exactly what you want from a movie about magic
","Quite simply, we know from the trailer, that this movie involves magic. The purpose of magic is to watch and be amazed, and for one moment, just enjoy the fact that you don't know how a trick is done. That is exactly the best way to enjoy this movie. To pick apart any plot hole, or any twist or turn that may be 'predictable', would ruin what is a great film.<br/><br/>From the very start, we are made to side with the magicians, until they rob their first bank. This brings in Mark Ruffalo's character. Can I also add that this guy is on fire at the moment. Underrated actor. Anyway, from this point on, and for the rest of the film, you are on his side, hoping that he catches the 'bad' magicians, and the thrill ride which goes on while he slowly but surely tries to piece together each piece of the puzzle, while Morgan Freeman continuously believes he knows what is happening and becomes a nuisance to the FBI, is perfect for the inevitable reveal at the end.<br/><br/>In review, this film is enjoyable to watch. What more do you want?"
"Reno-Rangan","8","0","2","21 October 2013"," Very clever but not intellectual yet entertaining
","The story was commercially very strong and these guys really pulled it together who are not actually the top league actors (big buck giants), except Morgan Freeman. It was also Mark Ruffalo's one of a major role in his career and did nice work. Woody Harrelson also supported very well with young and rising actors like Jesse Eisenberga, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco.<br/><br/>Like I said vast cast and diverse with layers, anything could be happen and anyone could be the end twist. The movie was kinda similar to 2012s 'Red Lights' about exposing the secrets of psychic and magic tricks. Here Morgan Freeman as the chaser and four young magicians called 'four horsemen' are being targeted by him. After theirs first and second show they instantly become national talkative. Along with illusion exposer, the FBI joins them who are after them for their bank heists during the performances.<br/><br/>Kinda cool, very thrilling and entertaining, like a cat mouse-chase. The magics are not really magic that we expect them normally, but very modern and fictional tricks that specially made for cinematic. So don't expect any sense or logic, it has been just major commercial element used as the movie theme, that's all. I enjoyed the movie a lot. If you see the movie poster you will know that where 'The Illusionist' meet 'Ocean's Eleven'. One of 2013s fine commercial entertainer and it can be watched once.<br/><br/>8/10"

","The screenplay of the movie was very good, it maintained a fairly captivating scenery and a hint of mysticism everywhere.... the four horsemen and the eye are great back drops but the way that the movie is concluded really ruins the whole plot that was building up into a promising epic. the way the eye part is left without any further clues or hints and the way the director thinks that disappearing off a merry go round can answer our questions is really frustrating. the scene between the credits is highly confusing too (although it adds another important aspect- mystery) it is aimless and doesn't give a clue as to the further role of the horsemen, i couldn't even determine if they got played or did they reach their promise land. So, concluding, the ending leaves the user confused and a bit irritated, and unsatisfied. but overall its a must watch (although strictly one time watch) movie."

Now you see me, oops, now you don't.<br/><br/>The four magicians here perform as a team, Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco (brother of James). As the opening scenes play out we get a glimpse of each one of them before they began working as a team. <br/><br/>So they hold shows in various cities, always performing fantastic illusions. Sometimes vast amounts of money disappear. Like from a bank in Paris. They appear to teleport someone from the audience, but they don't really.<br/><br/>Morgan Freeman has an interesting role, he attends and videos their performances, with a goal of writing about them and explaining how each illusion is accomplished.<br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo has an equally interesting role, he is the detective trying to catch them in the act and pin certain crimes on them. <br/><br/>It is an entertaining story, and the actors pull it off well. You find yourself wondering, ""What's next? And how are they going to do it?""<br/><br/>Big SPOILERS: As the story lines wrap up we find that we, the audience, were involved in a big deception. While it looked like the Ruffalo character was just an incompetent detective, he was actually the master magician, son of a legendary master escape artist.

The final twist is somewhat ridiculous considering the the whole story, and, in my opinion removes any clever feeling towards this movie. The movie is entertaining, and develops at a fast and steady pace even if it does not explain half of what it should and jumps from Ruffalo to the Horsemen so fast it will just confuse you.

It begins with the exceedingly elaborate script from Boaz Yakin (""Prince of Persia""), Edward Ricourt and Ed Solomon (""Men in Black""). They craft something so totally compelling that no one is bound to turn this film off or walk away before it's over. Plot holes and leaps in logic and belief are stashed aside until the final minutes because the mystery simply envelops you, just as any good magician in his or her act.<br/><br/>Four magicians with unique talents, slight of hand master J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg), escape artist Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher), mentalist Merritt McKinney (Woody Harrelson) and trickster Jack Wilder (Dave Franco), have mysteriously been recruited to create a magic act unlike anything ever seen. Fast-forward a year later and they reveal their act in Las Vegas, with a grand finale in which they rob a bank in Paris while on stage. Their little display catches the attention of FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) and an Interpol agent (Melanie Laurent) who work together with famed magician debunker Thaddeus Bradley (Freeman) in order to guess their next move.<br/><br/>And their moves only get more and more complicated and astounding. The script teases with little bits that make you think you're inching toward an answer only to be caught looking the wrong way. Director Louis Leterrier (""Transporter,"" ""Clash of the Titans"") adds plenty of movement and excitement to the proceedings as well.<br/><br/>If you so desire to dig below the surface layers of ""Now You See Me,"" it goes from wildly entertaining and engrossing into downright horrible. No, it's simply not feasible that anything that happened in this movie could happen. Yes, the characters are only as interesting as their different talents and witty remarks, and their motivation to execute this grand plan comes from something we do not know until the very end. It's too slick, too neat, too glossy.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" will only be as good as the person watching it allows it to be. Bite early and lay back and you're bound to enjoy it; stay skeptical and bank too much on the payoff and you're bound to dismiss it entirely. It's the same with any movie that's building toward a big reveal right from its opening scene. Live by the twist, die by the twist.<br/><br/>Personally, I bought in. Fantastic performances from Eisenberg and Harrelson plus the gravitas of Freeman and Michael Caine as the executive who funds their show helped keep up the appearances and cover up the blemishes that really only became apparent to me upon reflection post-credits. I came in open-minded and bought into the entire aesthetic of the movie and enjoyed it presumably a lot more than if I had paid too close attention to the details. And the ending had me fooled, which happens a lot less these days.<br/><br/>As easily as one can find the seams ""Now You See Me"" and tear it apart, it does exactly what it set out to do: beguile, trick, deceive and entertain its audience. Regardless of the artistic qualities or merits of a film, if it does what it sets out to do, it's a success.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit moviemusereviews.com"

","I really hate putting a pretty good movie into a microscope but here I am. I'm not really into summer movies because most of them are just great at first look but when you really think about it, they're somehow awful; barely a number of summer movies are really commercial and critical success, and I think I could count Now You See Me in the list. I just saw it yesterday and I thought it was pretty good. It reminded me of Chris Nolan's film about magicians also, The Prestige, starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Anyways, watching the film makes me feel the suspense, drama, action, humor, wit and most of all, wonder. The acting from the stellar-looking cast makes it wonderful, especially Freeman, Ruffalo, Eisenberg and Harrelson. Louis Leterrier did a great job directing this film. The visual effects, art direction and the score is amazing- not that awe-inspiring but amazing. The story itself is awesome but the screenplay really needs some polishing. I mean, sure the story is witty and fun and mind-bending, but the characters' back story and development through the story wasn't presented very well. The four magicians remained stagnant and Dylan the agent is just a gift wrap to make us all believe that he is just an ordinary man when he in fact is the most important character, which is not really a good way of storytelling, considering none of them actually got a chance to develop throughout the film. Anyhow, that pretty much sums up my view of the film. I hope we would get to see some improvement on its sequel, but for now, all I can say is ""Kudos"" to every cast and crew involved in the film, and for those who haven't watched it yet, go see it. Trust me, it will make you see wonder for 2-hours length of the film."

","What I noticed about ""Now You See Me"" is that the magicians play tricks on bankers and insurance men. No doubt this is something that people would have to like in the era of the Great Recession. Even apart from that it's a pretty good movie, showing the characters pulling their tricks and figuring out how to always stay ahead of the authorities. In addition to the cast presented on the poster, the movie also includes Mélanie Laurent (Shoshanna Dreyfus in ""Inglourious Basterds"") as an Interpol agent who isn't about to take crap from Mark Ruffalo's FBI agent. That also means that Shoshanna Dreyfus costars with Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) costars with Batman's butler (Michael Caine) costars with a frequent narrator (Morgan Freeman).<br/><br/>I really liked the movie. It always seems as though each character knows something about the others that can ruin them. But the best parts are without a doubt the magic tricks (or are they tricks?). You'll probably like the movie."

Yes there is a lack of character development and there is very simple dialogue that is because this is a very stylized, fantasy type of movie and relies on that only to entertain the viewer. In that aspect the film does very well! Now You See Me is fun and you will be glad you watched it. No it will not make you ponder, no you will not fell a deep emotional connection with any of the characters, yes you may discover the twists before they are revealed and yes there are plot holes, but none of this matters!

It is full of excitement, misdirection, and surprises; much like a magic trick of its own. Every moment when I thought I would guess what was going to happen next, then all of a sudden, it's something totally different. I am normally good at predicting the ending to films, but I never saw the ending coming. The writing is full of good quotes, such as, ""I believe what's about to happen is really going to amaze,"" and, ""the closer you think you are, the less you actually see."" Also, I really like the score of the film, after watching it, it's actually always stuck in my head.

","I was surprised that I enjoyed this movie as much as I did. After reading negative reviews on this title, I was ready to be disappointed. I was not. If you appreciate a movie that will make you keep guessing and are one of those people who have a brain that spoils so many movies for you, whether you want it spoiled or not, this one does a good job. I am not saying that no one will be able to figure any of the plot before it is shown in the movie but it isn't completely transparent the entire time. I am hard to impress with titles that have twists but this one impressed me. If anyone tells you they knew every piece and part of this before it was revealed, they are bending (if not breaking) the truth.<br/><br/>The cast all did a wonderful job. I was a little let down seeing the guy from the last season of Scrubs on here (everyone should have hated him from his role in that show) but he did a pretty good job of proving that he has some range. Seeing Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson together again was really cool. Morgan Freeman is in it, need I say more in that department? Really, they all did quite a good job.<br/><br/>Last thing I am going to say is that this is the first time I have reviewed a title on IMDb and I created my account for this one. That's not to say I wasn't really tempted before but this is the one that actually made me pause the next movie I had started watching, sign up and type out this review. That has to be saying something since I have seen untold numbers of movies and IMDb is my go-to for movie related information.<br/><br/>There you have it. Someone notorious for spoiling movies for himself just by thinking about the plot and someone who hasn't cared enough to sign up and review a title before... this one flipped both issues around for me. Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I did."

","I do like to know as little as possible about a movie before I go ahead and watch it. Movies like this one almost make no sense watching if people tell you more than a few pillars/plot points of it. It's about magicians, but also about crime. It's also a thriller, but also very funny almost like a comedy.<br/><br/>Intentions may not be clear, but they will be by the end of the movie. And while some things seem to convenient (like a relationship that seems to build too fast), the movie does work and warrants more than another viewing. It's been a while since a movie was as mysterious yet so intriguing and rewarding as this is. Prestige by Nolan comes to mind (which is slightly better, so if you haven't seen that one, go check it out, though not as funny and light as ""Now you see me"" is)! <br/><br/>Great entertainment, great actors and a stunning finale"
"RevRonster","8","0","2","6 September 2013"," Illusions, Michael...
","Since this has come out, exactly nine thousand and fifteen comedians and syndicated critics have summed this movie up in one hack joke that reads, ""The only thing magic about 'Now You See Me' is it made my time and money disappear' but, despite how lame that joke is, the movie is fairly entertaining.<br/><br/>The story is fun (it's about magicians stealing money, enough said!) and the characters are quirky and interesting. The cast, despite being maybe too big, is fantastic in their roles. Special mention MUST be made for Mark Ruffalo who stole the film as the obsessed cop trying to stop the magician thieves. It's already been scientifically proved (citation needed) that Ruffalo is an amazing actor but he never stops giving commanding performances that grabs your attention.<br/><br/>The only drawbacks I had with the film is that the movie seemed like a ""For Boys Only"" film as the female characters portrayed by Isla Fisher and Mélanie Laurent felt like they could have been more but were resigned to being romantic (or former romantic) potentials for the male characters. The film also weakly establishes some plot points that, sadly, go almost completely unresolved near the end (but there's a sequel coming, so that might help) and, finally, where was G.O.B. Bluth in all this?!?"

","I didn't here much about this movie before I came across the trailer randomly on youtube. After seeing the trailer I was immediately drawn in and decided to watch. The movie has a stellar cast that all compliment each other pretty well. The story is very exciting throughout the entire movie but for me the ending fell very flat. I'm not sure what they could have done differently. The plot twist is decent and makes you go back and think about a lot of things. I find the ending love story unnecessary between the two detectives. It didn't really add much to anything, and all the build up to the eye to not have anything really happen at the end. I watched the ending credits hoping that something was going to pop back up on the screen and it did but it was nothing special and again fell flat in my opinion. I would still recommend this movie to everyone though as I feel its one of the better thrillers I've seen in the past few years."

"TheDancingPanda-692-744536","6","0","1","4 September 2013"," It's amazing how much I agree with the other reviews
","This is the first time in IMDb history I wish there was a like button because every 6 star review said the same thing I'm about to say.<br/><br/>It's not an awful film. But wasn't happy that It was much different than I expected. I was led to believe that it was more humorous than serious, which it did have a few knee slappers I guess, but it was similar to dark shadows in the way it seemed to be marketed one way and was something totally different.<br/><br/>I agree with many other reviewers that it was trying to be way smarter than it actually was (ironically all the 9-10 stars mentioned it was very smart? Haha coincidence... I think not) Jesse Eisenberg's character was supposed to be self-serving yet smooth like you'd imagine a world class magician to be. But unlike the other reviewers I very much disliked him being the superficial intelligent guy. I don't think he pulled it off and it was unnatural/unconvincing. He doesn't have that Anthony Hopkins factor that makes you believe this man knows more than me and is already mentally dominating everyone in the room. Maybe could pass as a fairly intelligent guy because I'm sure he is, but he can't talk the mad scientist talk. That being said the parts that didn't force him to speak out of his range he did as solid as ever. I do genuinely like the guy.<br/><br/>Woody shinned and kinda made me desire a much bigger part from him. Seemed like a waste to pull the starting Qaurterback in the 4th quarter if you catch my drift. Young Franco did better as an actor than his other roles but maybe could've chose someone better to do the fight scene. It was well put together and everything but I was sitting there like..... 5 foot nothing 160 pound Dave Franco couldn't forcefully take a box of thin mints from a girl scout.<br/><br/>But here's the grand pisser. Those who say the movie was thrilling and smart with huge twist are kind of shooting blanks here. They weren't as much twists, more the ""plot pinch"". No crazier than Monsters Inc. & Toy Story. And the ""Thriller"" element is greatly exaggerated. You're not guessing the whole movie, pretty much the last 20 minutes is like.... Somebody's in on this. Of course you're going to self - consciously make assumptions, but there's no shifting in your seat. No cold sweats and hair twirling. It's almost an after thought in plot that really delivers very little. <br/><br/>Overall it's being listed as a mystery action crime thriller. Instead of being under an umbrella of genre's like all the greatest films, it seems to be stuck between stations. Woven thin like a cheap wash cloth. The reoccurring theme is that it's missing a few pieces and some others fit incorrectly. Worth a watch if you're a movie buff, but a Rewatch may not be rewarding."

","Magic topics in the era of digital cinema are not as they were in the past, as at present you can create virtually everything. All this made the plot complex to follow at times - the line of possible and impossible was gone and, until the end, it was difficult to realize whether it had fairy-tale elements or not. At least to me, the solution (= who was behind all this) was factitious, bearing in mind most of preceding actions, especially the fight in an apartment... <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the events were catchy to follow, and actors like Jesse Eisenberg (as J. Daniel Atlas), Mark Ruffalo (as Dylan Rhodes), Woody Harrelson (as Merritt McKinney), Morgan Freeman (as Thaddeus Bradley, Michael Caine (as Arthur Tressler) are always up to their scratch...

","Four very good Illusionists known as the Four Horsemen rob a bank in France while they are still in the United States, leave no clues and it is up to FBI Agents and Illusionist Exposer, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman), to figure out how it was done. <br/><br/>The first 90% of the movie is captivating, riveting, engaging - yes, magical - and really quite good. I thought I might have to see it a second time to understand everything. But, there are subtle hints of something that went wrong years ago that became the actual focus of all that we see. In other words the twist at the end within the last 10%, was, IMHO, contrived and this is where the movie falls apart. I found it hard to swallow and when you get to know the characters, you may feel the same way too. To say more would be to give things away. <br/><br/>There are questions I would like to ask of the character Arthur Tressler (Michael Caine) but to do that here would give away too much. Sorry. Okay, here's the thing: I looked at him as the key to why everything worked the way it did, and my question to him would be: how did you become the Four Horsemen's benefactor? We were under the impression he was their banker. At the end of the movie you will surly have that question too because there is no way he can give a good answer: that was contrived too. <br/><br/>CGI played a huge factor and it was spectacular in places, but the car chase on the bridge actually made me dizzy. It was one of those things where they sped up the film to make it like the cars were going 90-mph when they were actually going about 5-mph, if that. See? A little gimmicky. The crash was CGI. <br/><br/>The heists or robberies that you will see are probably the most involved ever put on film. Kudos. <br/><br/>One interesting scene I saw was on a bridge in Paris, France. The screen alongside the bridge had key-locks all along it. I believe, if you have secrets, you are supposed to attach the lock to the wire fence and throw the key into the river below. Thus your secrets are forever safe. Or, for the amorous: they can lock their love forever. Cool. To see what is up with that bridge, Google: Bridge in France that has key locks attached to wire fencing.<br/><br/>All the actors performed well, and it will be up to you whether or not to believe them. Hey, these are professional actors and it's what they do: convincing you of what they say is true. Good luck. <br/><br/>Overall, this was still very entertaining, but contrived when you see the ending and because of that we shall never see sequels regarding the Four Illusionist Horsemen. At least I don't think so (never say never, Bob). (7/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No."

I think some the users here really missed the plot and all about this movie when they decided to compare this with The Prestige let me explain; This too movie apart for some ""magic tricks"" have nothing in common, The Prestige was about The Prestige, about ultimate trick, the teleportation, the race between to magicians to perform this ultimate trick while in Now You See Me non of those elements were part of the movie or part of the plot, hypnotize, teleportation were common, no ultimate trick was taking place here, there was no race between magicians here.<br/><br/>This was not about magic tricks, this was about heist, revenge, punishment and for these reasons there is no ground to try and compare The Prestige with Now You See Me.<br/><br/>Bottom line is that Now You See Me, is a very good movie, some comic scenes, some magic tricks, surprises it is entertaining and for so it's worth watching."

I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The start of the movie really got me hooked, it is well paced and does a pretty good job of developing a brief backstory on the main players. It does drag a little bit in the middle of the movie, and at over 2 hours it was a little on the long side. The end picks up and is fast paced right up through the end.

The Prestige and The Illusionist are among my favourites, and I believe their strong plots and my childish imagination make these movies seem magical to me. Although Now You See Me is more of a theatrical act for contemporary audiences, the one category this movie completely fails in is acting. <br/><br/>The magicians themselves are fairly amiable. You have Jack, the humble boy who wants to make it big. Then you have J. and Henley, who have some kind of relationship going, but that is all but disturbed by Merrit, the old pervert with a good sense of humour. <br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong, this movie was quite amusing and funny at times. But at others (especially in emotional scenes), I felt like cardboard could have had more expression. The acting from the detectives was generally dull, and even when there was a fair bit of tension, it just felt too insincere. <br/><br/>I am glad nonetheless for watching this movie, as I was entertained for the whole duration.

This is a film that has all those qualities. Jesse Eisenberg brings a great character to life that makes you love him when in any other film his attitude would annoy you! Woody Harrelson brings a great comic act to his role whilst still keeping you on your toes. Dave Franco brings a more subtle character that most of the time you don't notice him yet he is a vital part! Those were the three characters that stood out to me, I became fond of them very early in the movie! Not forgetting Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo and Michael Caine who are all great actors and bring great characters to life! Despite all the hype and greatness of the film, I do have one small part that i didn't like and that was how the ending was very silly and i found it quite childish.

Heck, I even had books on how to perform magic tricks and illusions. but after a while I stopped doing them because I realized how much I have to prepare for them.<br/><br/>The movie shows some of the work that magicians do, but of course this movie takes four magicians from a level of entertainers to a level of vigilantes or Robin Hoods or maybe even personal avengers (depends how you see it, but all of these apply). The storyline is that four illusionists are lead together to a room where they find blueprints for the best show ever. So they become the Four Horsemen and start doing the show (after a year of preparation of course). The thing is, they capture FBI and Interpol's attention because during their first part of the show (show is from three parts) they rob a bank. How did they do it? Well, you could say magic, but let's not forget that this is a movie about illusionist and as I said before, illusions need preparations.<br/><br/>The whole movie is really fast pace, which you would not expect from a movie about magicians. Actually, the camera was moving so fast you could feel that you're running alongside FBI and Interpol. There are a lot of wide shots here as well because illusions are best performed when audience views them from afar. Of course, there are always those who still are very attentive because they want to know how tricks are performed. One of those people is Thaddeus Bradley and he is the one who seems to best understand how everything is performed. He also brings the concept of the Eye - a league of magicians and illusionist who with their illusions try to level the scale between rich and poor (what did I say? Robin Hoods). And apparently he is right about everything (even about that he was framed).<br/><br/>The movie is mesmerizing and the change of characters gets you going (not to mention the beautifully performed tricks) and you don't even notice that it's the end of the movie. For me the end was surprising and a bit disappointing. Yes, I loved that there was that plot twist that the fifth Horseman was the FBI agent (I thought it was the Interpol agent). But I did not like that he was also the leader of the EYE and that he had to come back for the French girl. He could have left her a message, explaining how the tricks are connected. The Eye could have been left a mysterious faceless league, it would have been more mysterious and I guess then more people would actually start believing that something like that might exist. But that's just my opinion.<br/><br/>I just think some things are better left unexplained."

","Movies like Now You See Me are rarely done lately. The last time I was surprised pleasantly like this was Pirates Of The Caribbean the first movie. The movie has it's own faults, like the underdeveloped characters and no emotional ties are really happening, but the it's fast paced and intriguing. During the 2 hours of run time you are always wondering trying to guess who and why is doing this?<br/><br/>Now you might start and question the validity of the tricks that are happening in the film, but it's a movie about magic and much more impossible things are happening in regular movies.<br/><br/>So just take the advice of the movie itself, ""the closer you look the less you see"", don't try to debunk it, just enjoy it."

Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson after zombieland they did justice again. After watching the whole cast of this movie i decided to watch this one and i was right. The twists and turns in this one will keep you interested and curious throughout and when you started thinking they already performed tricks and there is nothing more than they come out with new tricks and yes there is a reason behind that why they are doing this that you should see yourself. I have seen lot of negative reviews but didn't find the reason. This is is must watch and deserve audience so don't read any negative reviews just give it a chance i can bet you don't even want to miss it for a second. Don't want to spoil the fun so better see yourself this Energetic and Entertaining ride.

","I had to write this review just to balance out all the negative reviews you see here.. Actually, i don't know why people felt this way, i'm guessing they either didn't get the movie (didn't understand the twists) or either they just don't like magic shows...<br/><br/>Personally, i loved it... This movie was original, exciting,and filled with CLEVER TWISTS that i just love and think are absolutely Necessary for a plot or a movie to be successful... <br/><br/>It's mainly about tricks and illusions of the magic industry.. and combining it to good old Bank robbery excitement make it a good success... The acting is Great! no exceptions (Jesse Einsenberg seems to stand out a bit with a focused performance) the camera movements were extremely nice, and the special effects were awesome and subtle enough to keep it beautiful and real !... The movie was obviously well thought of. (and that's its main attraction) and well executed as well. usually, i Only give a 9 star ratings to movies that have something new or ""something"" that makes them Stand Out from all the other movies.. and i guess for this movie, it was: 1) The theme itself (magic tricks, not overused in movies, and i think it's better than the Prestige), 2) All the above 3) AND the fact that it kept me smiling and entertained throughout the most of it ! (which is rare, especially for 2013 movies). Must see ! :)"
"bws2828","Null","0","1","22 August 2013"," Saw ""Ahora me Ves"", dubbed in Spanish language and really enjoyed the entire heist film.
","Having read the synopsis in Spanish, I had a good idea about the plot.I really enjoyed one of my rare visits to see a dubbed version from English to Spanish at the cinema, but this was a great two hours entertainment. My Spanish is now about first year university level after 11 years here, but being aged 78 it's not easy to follow the very fast Spanish. The scenes in Las Vegas were spectacular and the car chase quite typical of Malaga city center. I sometimes wish that there were subtitles, but in Spanish not English, as it makes it easier to follow the sometimes very fast speech and verb tense endings. There are some cinemas which show original version language films but so far from my East Malaga home. Maybe one day cinemas will be able to allow customers to chose language, as does the Spanish TV which shows so many USA and UK films which I can watch in English."

","I've been waiting for this movie for such a long time since I think it will be different from all movies I've seen before. Yes, it is different, but not better.<br/><br/>I think there are too much small and confusing details, which truly distracts viewers from the main plot. The whole movie concentrates too much on the performances and talents whereas the gist is not clear enough until the end, which lasts less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Also, I can't believe that Shrike's son can plan such a particular plan and the fake acting like a fool. It's clearly a fantasy world.<br/><br/>Anyway, the effects of all the performances and the curiosity to solve the tricks really turned Now You See Me into a fine entertaining movie of this Summer.<br/><br/>I gave the movie 5 out of 10 stars."
"mark_oasis","6","0","3","22 August 2013"," Four magicians unite under mysterious circumstances, creating a live display claiming to do the unthinkable, robbing a bank on the other side of the world.
","Louis Leterrier's thriller bases itself around the concepts of misdirection, showmanship, deceit and ultimately, the power of magic to stun and confound an audience, leaving them wondering at just how the feats that they have witnessed have been pulled off. Jesse Eisenberg's Daniel Atlas invites our fullest attention, claiming ""the closer you look, the less you see"", in an opening gambit that promises intrigue and suspense, which also acts as a (possibly) unintentional device for viewer reaction, namely, will we be taken in and wowed by what we are about to witness.<br/><br/>Any film of this type is likely to bring about comparisons to Christopher Nolan's excellently dark 2006 thriller ""The Prestige"", with the on screen presence of Michael Caine only serving to reinforce such correlations. However, where Nolan's effort looks to explore behind the façade and mysterious surface of the tricks presented, ""Now You See Me"" chooses to shy away from much that could be seen as real explanations, instead allowing a high paced caper to take place, largely centred around the cat and mouse chase between the four conjurers and the law enforcement team led by the slightly unbelievable pairing of Mark Ruffalo's exaggerated sceptical field agent Dylan Rhodes, and Mélanie Laurent's inexperienced desk agent Alma Dray. This immediately takes the film tonally away from the territory of ""The Prestige"", thus placing it firmly in its own space, but leaves the viewer pondering upon the potential lack of substance that shying away from the deeper explanations may indicate.<br/><br/>However, as the 115 run time of the movie progresses, it becomes clear that to dissect and over analyse every move of the twisting narrative is clearly not the point of this film, and as such, the best way to approach it may be to simply sit back and enjoy the tumult of events as they unfurl before your eyes. The 100mph plot rarely takes a break to allow for reflexion, preferring to let the A-list cast take centre stage, with performances admittedly sometimes bordering on the edge of credibility, Morgan Freeman's disgraced ex-magician Thadeus Bradley being a case in point, in a demonstration which, in the end seeks not to deceive, but instead to entertain.<br/><br/>Undeniably, the film does fall down in certain aspects, such as a shaky script, and the lack of depth which wont allow the audience to ""see more"" on repeat viewings, but, in a summer dominated by comic book heroes and city-levelling CGI, ""Now You See Me"" at least offers an entertaining alternative watch which can be largely enjoyable, so long as the obvious thematic comparisons which have been made to more accomplished past films are not kept in mind for too long."
"adhithya1993","7","0","3","22 August 2013"," Joy to watch
","'Now you see me' has one of the best starts for a movie in recent times and though the ending doesn't keep up with the start, on the whole the movie is still great. I am a fan of Jessie Eisenberg and had high expectations for this movie and it did not disappoint. You never feel less entertained in any of its parts.<br/><br/>The movie opens with such a bang, right from the very first scene. Whenever a magic trick comes about, you feel like you've let out your inner kid. The first half hour is just pure joy for watching.<br/><br/>The pace of the movie lasts and amps up till the very last parts of the movie. Leading to this point the tricks seem to get a little ridiculous and even more so as it ends. But at this point you would have left behind worrying about the logic and would just be enjoying it.<br/><br/>At the end things move about so fast that most average movie goer tends to miss many things and can leave them a bit confused and leaves critics hard to grasp in all minute details.<br/><br/>There are a few things that bothered me a bit. There is no way Morgan Freeman knew all that so correct to every inch of particular details. I did not find the character of Alma Dray to my taste. The romance is totally unnecessary in the movie. <br/><br/>There definitely are few blunders and errors in logic as it is in any movie. But my views are put together in a dialog from the movie, paraphrased: ""It's not how it's done that is important, but at the end it did put a smile on your face and that is what I paid to watch"".<br/><br/>It is one of those movies that you need to watch more than once to absorb in every little detail of it, though there might be few details that might not be to your liking."

","Of course the premise of Now You See Me is nonsense, but I wouldn't imagine people wanting to see this are looking for gritty realism.<br/><br/>It's fun and I enjoyed it more than most films I've seen recently, and I watch a lot. Sometimes you just want a film you don't have to think too hard about, and this more than fits the bill.<br/><br/>I didn't much enjoy the action sequences, but to be fair I tend to tune out during car chases, and it has been a long time since I was 16.<br/><br/>It reminded me of the UK TV series Hustle, and in my book that's no bad thing. It's not art but who cares? Glossy, decent acting, intriguing story and the bonus of Melanie Laurent.<br/><br/>-1 though for the terrible twist and the last 10 minutes."

","To summarize in one word : wow ! This movie lured me in and had me on the edge of my seat constantly wondering where it was going. It twists, turns, shakes and twirls. Every time you think you have figured it all out, the plot turns around 180 degrees, making this pure entertainment. The CGI is very nicely done. Acting is well performed by everyone and eye candy to watch. Every now and then a movie pops up that stands out. This is one of them. Only downside I discovered was the chase scenes carried on to long a bit. But they soon followed by yet another twist. Great movie, I would recommend my friends to go and see. Even better, I'm calling them right now!"

","Fortunately the answer to my headline question is provided in the movie. I was tempted to headline this review as ""The closer you look the more you see"" as the opposite is often asserted in this movie concerning magic...i.e. ""The closer you look the less you see"".<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot of this movie concerns a group of disparate magicians who are brought together by a mysterious person and instructed to follow directions without question. These directions involve making money disappear, which leads to police interest in their activities.<br/><br/>There are many herrings provided in this movie. It would be inaccurate to say, I think, that you can deduce the identity of the mystery organiser but the movie does often throw out little titbits which are fun to make you surmise who knows more than they are letting on. I was half expecting a revelation a la ""The usual suspects"" as to who the mystery mastermind was. In any case, that revelation came as a surprise to me. Of some consolation to me was that I guessed (or at least was open to the possibility) of how the final heist in the movie was achieved, no doubt thanks to a little titbit on how a previous magic trick in the movie was accomplished...but, thinking more about that latter trick, I doubt that it would actually work in the way you see it in the movie! The closer you look, the more you see it doesn't stack up!<br/><br/>Maybe it was on ""At the movies"" where I heard the suggestion that ""Now you see me"" is structured like a magic trick...all misdirection and sleight of hand. Not sure that that is right. It seems pretty conventional...insofaras all movies utilise camera angles and editing and plotting to create an illusion of coherent narrative. These movie tricks make it seem that something extraordinary is occurring whereas if you pulled back, you might see, for instance, that a very dangerous looking car stunt was actually very safe and only camera angles and editing made it look life threatening.<br/><br/>Like I said initially, I was inclined to headline this review as ""The closer you look the more you see"". By that I mean the movie has plot holes which make the illusion disintegrate once you analyse them. One would think that the use of captions in the movie would be a sign of objectivity, but it seems to me, from memory, that even they misdirect...e.g. that scene early on in the movie where a French man takes part in an onstage magic trick. The caption used for that scene seemed a quite obvious case of misdirection (but I'm relying on my memory here as to what those captions assert).<br/><br/>To the extent that I have a 'problem' with this movie is the very Hollywood like leaps faith required to make the story gel...hence my comment that the closer you look at things the more they fail to make sense. Maybe a movie like ""The game"" is another example of this...there is a certain sense of implausibility when 'going with the flow' of this movie. The illusion is quite fun though, once you focus on the 'big' picture...and not get bogged down in details like how anybody could have the ability of foresight required by the plot of the movie.<br/><br/>My headline also states that this movie has substantial style...a play on ""style over substance"". That would be my only quibble with this movie and why it does't score higher...since it doesn't hang together logically that much, you really want the principle magicians at the heart of this movie to sweep you off your feet with their charisma and make you swoon. They don't quite make you forget the artifice of this movie but they do display wit on occasion...but a bit more chutzpah would have been nice. Maybe it's also a pity that later on in the movie it becomes clear that the magicians have actually crossed the line between seeming to be criminals and actually qualifying as such."

","This Magic meets Danny Ocean movie certainly keeps you on the edge of your seat. And though some may find the plot convoluted or characters underdeveloped, I found the movie to be fast paced and entertaining.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A team of Magicians who calls themselves The Four Horseman pulls off a series of flashy heists, thereby being chased by the FBI and Interpol. As FBI agent Dylan (Ruffalo) and Interpol officer Dray (Melanie) begin tracking them, they start to suspect that something bigger might be at play behind these flashy heists.<br/><br/>Plotwise, I could predict almost all of the twists (movie is full of it), and was even able to circle out the mysterious Fifth Horseman. But I admit the final twist was really cool and unpredictable. <br/><br/>Almost all the characters were quite good, but my favorite character from the movie was Jack Wilder (Dave Franco). The one scene where Wilder fights FBI agent Dylan was nothing short of exceptional. My other favorite would be McKinney (Woody Harrelson). His wise-cracking mentalist persona was quite entertaining. The only actor whose talent was under tapped was Michael Caine. His role was too short and could have been easily done by any other actor.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the movie was good and matched seamlessly with the heists. The pace of the movie does get a bit slow towards the end of the movie, but the surprise ending more than makes up for it.<br/><br/>This movie is no 'Prestige' or 'Illusionist', but it holds its own. If you are expecting some sort of character development or serious drama, be warned its not that kind of movie. In fact, lack of character development is what keeps the pace of this movie fast. Possibly one of the better heist movies in recent times, it's meant to be enjoyed and not pondered upon."

","Summer blockbusters seem like they're all comic-book based or based on whatever or seprequereimaginings these days. Now You See me is an old- fashioned fun and uplifting summer entertainment..not all dark and Nolan-y.<br/><br/>Nothing too original or never seen before the film combines a heist flick/comedy/crime thriller and succeeds in doing so. Like the story of the movie it has a bag full of magic tricks that make a great show. The movie feels like watching a magic show. However that is at the same time the film's biggest strength and weakness.The problem is that a magic trick works when you don't get to see the trick of the magic, but a heist movie works when you need to see how they ""did it"".<br/><br/>So, like it's tagline( The closer you'll look the less you'll see) the film is at it's best when you let it entertain you not thinking too much of who's who and what's what. But when you get to the revelation of the whole magic trick behind the magic of this movie it falls flat. Nevertheless SPOILER when I found out that Mark Ruffalo's character was the main magician I was surprised- not a bad magic trick.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Jesse Eisenberg is great following from their great chemistry in Zombieland. Mark Ruffalo is as great as ever, Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman are...well,Michael Cain and Morgan Freeman and they all seem to have a good time.<br/><br/>Also, Lois Leterrier keeps his film at a fast pace and good visual style.<br/><br/>All in all a great summer movie and maybe the best movie this summer simply because I'm just bored of all the super-hero/saving the world flicks."

It was a change to see Mark R having a bit more to do than his normal film and of course the two heavy weights in Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman complimented the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>I know some of the reviews did not like the end, was it predictable, I thought so but got it wrong as did my fellow viewers!!<br/><br/>All in all I would recommend seeing the film so much better than many others and I echo another reviewer, great film really enjoyed it."
"princedelapau","8","0","2","3 August 2013"," Best of the year so far
","I was intrigued by this film from watching the trailers. Loving magic, I decided that it would be worth seeing - and it was worth every penny for the ticket.<br/><br/>Apart from the stunning magic and special effects, the most unusual part of this film is that there is no real lead character: most of the characters seem to take up roughly equal time on the screen, so no particular star seems to be carrying the story.<br/><br/>That said, Morgan Freeman's role was very much an enlarged cameo performance, which he played magnificently. But then it's always a pleasure watching Morgan Freeman.<br/><br/>The only thing that riled me was that, despite all the wonderful things in it, the story just didn't hang together: it simply didn't make sense, especially the ending. Normally this would drive me mad, but the film as a whole was so mesmerising, that I actually didn't realise that there were a million gaps and logical failures until I got home.<br/><br/>I'm giving the film a solid 8/10, which would have been higher if just a little more time had been spent on working the plot through.<br/><br/>All in all, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and, judging from the upcoming offerings, it's likely to remain that way until the 2014 releases his the big screen. So allow credulity to take a back seat and go to the cinema to enjoy probably the wildest ride available."

In addition, the highly impressive cast offer a strong comical and engaging dialogue. However, where the film disappoints is the lack of a strong finish, leaving you with a promising twist but also a complicated, flat finale. What's more is the over elaborate special effects where the film tries too hard to impress on a visual scale. As a result, a promising story line with an impressive cast is somewhat ruined by a very weak ending.

I think the film maybe lacks some of the 'magic' it promises, but as the film progresses you'll see it's more about showing slight of hand, mind games and how to fool with illusions rather than pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Freeman and Caine in the same scenes is absolutely mind blowing, as both share such a strong presence and excellent scripts that even if the film lacked a bit of oomph, it's instantly clouded by the amazing performance the two offer. Mark Ruffolo also offers a new shiny side to his acting, showing he can adapt to everything directors offer him.

","I just couldn't predict what was going to happen next, and the movie was told in linear time with a lot of detail. What a great movie! If it wasn't for the ending, I could have given it a 9. It just felt like I wanted something a little bit more spectacular for closure, hell aliens pulling the strings would have been better than ruining the character development of the cop. So many different endings could have been possible, and although this one did provide closure, and logically explained itself, it was more of an afterthought. Although we got closure on the 'mastermind,' it would have been nice to get closure on the 4 main characters that we loved throughout the whole film. Why build them up so much, just to make them disappear on a carousel? Woody's performance was brilliant and likable, Jesse Eisenberg also portrayed his role very well. The cop for the most part played his role well, so well that it just made the ending that much more nonsensical."
"koen_smit","8","0","2","24 July 2013"," The surprise of this summer
","This movie may as well be the surprise of this summer. Of course by watching the trailer I expected a high tech, sfx and enjoyable laid back consumers experience, but the story itself is quite smart and complicated and until the plot was completely revealed, I did not know whodunit. The acting itself is good, as you would expect from these A class actors. The chemistry is there between all four of the magicians, between Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent (yes, that's her from Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards) and between Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman. It is nice to see the two last ones performing as not really friendly characters, and Mark Ruffalo as an asshole. Castingwise this movie hits bullseye on all fronts. <br/><br/>After the introduction of the four magicians, we step into a roller coaster of special effects and illusions while the police is trying to catch them and they always have to be some steps ahead. And they are. That much you can get from the trailer. Watching the movie it makes me break my brain on how they do everything. It is so witty and smart that I can't help myself having a lot of huh?-moments during the movie. But of course, without spoiling the plot to you, most of it will be revealed at the end. The plot is very strong and surprising up until the end of the movie. They didn't got too far in it, you will see all the pieces fit together in the end. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie much more than expected and I want to advise you to try to step into it as blank as you can."
"TheSquiss","7","0","1","22 July 2013"," Nolan-esque spectacle. Illusion, crime & superb cast.
","Some people spend the duration of magic shows trying to spot the sleight of hand, to work out how the magician fools the rest of the audience; others sit back and allow themselves to be amazed by the illusions; a few convince themselves from the outset that all magic is genuine, that they are in the presence of a miracle worker and the naysayers be damned. Audiences will inevitably approach Now You See Me in much the same fashion, and that will have some bearing on how much they enjoy it.<br/><br/>Take heed: don't think; just roll with it.<br/><br/>Four magicians each receive a mysterious tarot card invitation to an address that holds secrets and a challenge. The reward is membership of the exclusive, perhaps mythical, magic circle known as The Eye. A year later, rebranded as The Four Horseman, they perform a spectacular sell-out show in Las Vegas that culminates with an apparent bank robbery and redistributing the cash to their audience. Is it magic or just a remarkable illusion? FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) regards it as nothing more than an elaborate crime and launches an aggressive hunt for the truth to expose and capture the Four Horsemen.<br/><br/>Though Now You See Me lacks the drama of Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, it's a thrilling romp that begs to be seen at least twice; once for the spectacle, twice for clearer understanding. It's no mindbender, like Inception, but is a thoroughly enjoyable romp that will keep some people guessing. The biggest surprise is that it comes from Louis Leterrier, the director of clunking bombs The Incredible Hulk and Clash of the Titans. Who'd have thought? <br/><br/>Take the bling and blast of David Copperfield (who is credited as the inspiration), give it a screenplay with some criminal zing and what would once have been known as an all-star cast and that's pretty much Now You See Me. Dave younger-brother-of-James Franco holds his own as street illusionist Jack Wilder against the 'above the title' star power of Woody Harrelson (Merritt McKinney), Jesse Eisenberg (J. Daniel Atlas) and Isla Fisher (Henley Reeves) as the Four Horsemen. There's very little in the way of character development but this isn't that kind of film. This is a movie where the stars play second fiddle to the spectacle and the quips, snaps and asides to each other are seasoning to the visual feast.<br/><br/>Now You See Me feels like a Nolan film (though he appears not to have been involved) in tone, character and casting choices, not least of all for the double act of Michael Caine as Arthur Tressler, multi-millionaire financier of The Four Horsemen, and Morgan Freeman as Thaddeus Bradley, the debunker of all things illusory. But it never feels like a rip-off because of it, more a case of beneficial influence.<br/><br/>It's difficult to pick out a performance that overshadows all others here because Now You See Me is a superb ensemble piece that deserves to be seen for the grand scale. I'm not claiming it's a modern classic, nor that it will feature in the top ten at the end of the year, but like last year's Chronicle it's stomping good fun and a flick worth having on the hard drive for one of those evenings that require a beer, feet up and a small amount of thought without the need for pure reality.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

","This was a decent film but it really had nothing on The Prestige and I don't know how the two can be compared apart from the fact they're in the same 'magic' genre (and both star Michael Caine!)<br/><br/>I found 'Now You See Me' confusing and annoying. Three of the four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson and Fisher) are smug and arrogant - especially Eisenberg - and I couldn't help wanting them to fail throughout the film as they travel around the US as the 'Four Horsemen' performing impossible tricks and wowing crowds in glitzy venues. That's another thing... I found the tricks weren't explained that well (especially the last one) and didn't make that much sense. They were all just covered up with loads of glitz and glamour, loud self-satisfied music and random crowds cheering as if that would rub off on the audience.<br/><br/>The story is pretty entertaining and unpredictable with some good chases, cop banter, cool magic and romance (although they could and should have progressed with the romance element more). It just lacks depth and was too self-indulgent and clumsy for my liking. Worth a watch but not amazing"

","Four smart-alecky young illusionists team up at the behest of an unknown mastermind to wreak havoc and revenge on some deserving individuals. Included in the the group is Woody Harrelson, who is not so young, but always entertaining in whatever movie he's in. They work for... maybe Morgan Freeman? or maybe Michael Caine?<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" is loaded with plot holes and contrivances and, moving at breakneck speed, is tough to follow. It skims over obvious flaws in the narrative and, in the end, does not play fair with the audience. It is nevertheless a fascinating look into the world of magic, sleight-of-hand and hypnotism. There is, of course, the OCC (obligatory car chase), which tips off the target audience. Car chases got old shortly after ""The French Connection""(1971).<br/><br/>The picture is energetic and good-natured fun, but don't look too closely. And bring ear muffs for the ear splitting sound track."

","Like most of the critics, I had a very mixed reaction to this Fantasy Heist Caper from Transporter director Louis Letterier. The film left me mesmerised of course, but not because of a clever plot or brilliant performances (of which none were really exceptional), but because I felt pranked or rused by what I had just seen. The film has some spectacular moments granted, from car chases and explosions to FANTASTIC visual effects, but in turn almost swaps what could have been a very clever storyline for a thinly plotted film that is expected to hang on star quality and humour which usually fail to hold a film. My advice would be to see it for yourself. It's by no means a masterpiece, but will entertain for a while."

","'Now You See Me' is a disappointingly thin magic sketch which implies great complexity and intrigue but only offers a quick flick of the brush and a inconclusive plot line.<br/><br/>Jesse Eisenberg, Dave Franco, Woody Harrelson and Isla Fisher are ""The Four Horsemen"" - a group of famous magicians who get sucked into controversy when they 'rob' a french bank of all its millions in a large scale magic performance. However, as they catch the interest of the CIA, they are forced on the run whilst performing these controversies. Why are they performing these tricks? What do they have in common.<br/><br/>Well, when you discover the answers to these questions, you will most definitely have lost interest and the conclusions are confused and a little ridiculous anyhow. Also following in the final few minutes is a nifty twist which you won't see coming as it is a far too flawed one.<br/><br/>The pace of the story is too fast and for a movie that promises so much complexity and intelligence, the formula of the film in general is too linear and lacks the oomph which separates the average movies from the great ones. It's comparable to drawing the outline of a house but not sketching out the rooms, there's plenty of good ideas which aren't really polished.<br/><br/>On the brighter side, the acting is superb from ""The Four Horsemen"" quartet while Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent also keep the standards high.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is sound also.<br/><br/>Still, nothing to make it stand out from 2013's other movies on the box office."

","The story about a group of diverse magicians assembled for a purpose that isn't clear till the end. There is fun magic in different locations and a few twists and turns that are not what you'd expect.<br/><br/>I thought this might be a crime caper in the vein of Ocean's etc but it was way more interesting.<br/><br/>The cast is good because it doesn't rely too much on one cast member. Jesse Dave and Isla lack star quality to lead a movie so they are fine in supporting roles. Woody looks younger than of late. Mark Ruffalo is suitably disheveled and bewildered. Melanie Laurent is quite lovely to look at as the Interpol agent assisting Mark. Hope she gets more English speaking roles - all she need to do is improve the clarity of her English pronunciation a little. Morgan Freeman - seems to be in every other movie is alright.<br/><br/>There was some critique about the ending not resolving things enough and leaving too many red herrings unanswered. I think the ending is clear about what happened if you had concentrated throughout but it was a bit rushed in not showing enough flashbacks of the explanation of things. Still liked the feel good story and momentum of the movie - it doesn't drag and keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>Worth a watch - good plot dialog humor and enough originality with a feel good ending."

",". . . so if you watch NOW YOU SEE ME, you will know how to view your local magician. Some of the more recent movie magicians I've seen have not treated those around them very well. One flick featured a codger illusionist doing the finger-in-the-guillotine ""trick""--but he had a mental lapse and CUT OFF ANOTHER CODGER'S DIGIT FOR REAL!! Another such show ended with the trickster murdering a mountain of magically cloned guys. Yet another destroyed a library in Ann Arbor, Michigan. NOW YOU SEE ME advances the stereotype of magicians as really dangerous people even further. A bank is robbed which does not even have FDIC insurance! (For the financially illiterate, that means that customers lose some or all of their savings account money!) The FBI is tricked into spending billions of dollars of U.S. taxpayer involuntary ""donations"" in a futile pursuit of joyriding rogue illusionists. Magicians make mayhem on the freeways, with countless people injured and property-damaged. Unlike the victimized zombies in WORLD WAR Z, these illusionists have no excuse for wreaking havoc. NOW YOU SEE ME makes a great case for OUTLAWING MAGICIANS!"

","The movie starts with big premises: the abilities of the four illusionists are enchanting, and the idea of them being summoned and moved by a mysterious eye sounds really enthralling. The first part is developed through dynamic and vigorous sequences. The link to America's tragedy of Katrina, with an attack to insurance companies could also be interesting. Moreover, the rational explanation of the tricks results quite involving and intriguing, and the viewer feels torn between the need to understand how the tricks were made and a more subtle desire to believe in magic.<br/><br/>And, to tell the truth, the picture never loses the viewer's attention, it's fast- paced, never a dull moment, but then, in the second part, something changes and the movie turns more into an action movie with chase sequences, punches, violence and moves away form those promising premises, hurrying towards a hasty finale with an interesting twist but lacking the solidity of the first part. The cast helps make a difference, although I found the big Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine a little under tone, I appreciated the boastful performance of Woody Harrelson and in general the freshness and vitality of the younger cast. On the whole, the picture is worth the ticket, two hours of real entertainment are granted, but I cannot deny some disappointment in the end."

Once you get past the 'Mousetrap' element, providing, of course, you can, you will probably revel in the sheer outrageousness of the whole thing. Clearly the writers painted themselves into a corner around the eighth or ninth reel, realised that there was no plausible explanation on God's earth for what was happening and thought, screw the audience, we'll just go into hyper mode and maybe they won't notice it's total BS.

Like watching a magic trick live, your attention was brought to various places. As soon as you thought you caught up and were one step ahead of the supposed con artist, they were really three ahead of you. ""How did he do that?"" was a constant thought throughout various scenes for me. Although camera angles were constantly changing and some may argue it can distract from what is really happening, in this type of film it was very effective.<br/><br/>Although the ending to the movie was slightly predictable, the moments leading up to it on the silver screen were impressive. The special effects were fabulous. The action going on keeps the audience on their seats, and whenever the characters would explain what really happened as far as certain tricks go, a wave of ""oooooh!

First lets start with the four magicians, Jesse Eisenberg (social network, zombieland and an Oscar nominee) Woody Harrelson (zombieland, natural born killers and a double Oscar nominee) Isla Fisher (wedding crashers and Rango) finally Dave Franco (21 jump street and superbad.) These four actors had excellent chemistry on screen and were extremely good in this movie. The other main actors in this movie are Morgan Freeman, Micheal Caine, Mark Ruffalo (the avengers) and Mélanie Laurent (Inglourious Basterds) all of which again were very good and did their job very well, especially Mark Ruffalo he was excellent.<br/><br/>SPOILERS START HERE !!!!!! <br/><br/>So lets go into specifics especially the ending I have heard mixed reviews on the ending some of the people that I went and saw this with, thought it was very good and didn't see it coming, the other found it to be a bit forced upon the audience and very convenient. I didn't feel that it was that bad, if you didn't know (MASSIVE SPOILER)Mark Ruffalo character turns out to be the guy that originally brings together the four magicians and is a great magician himself. I didn't really see it coming but at the same time I knew there was something wrong with him if I'm honest I thought he was related to one of the magicians but I was wrong.<br/><br/>SPOILERS STOP HERE !!! <br/><br/>In conclusion I feel that this film was very good I would probably give it a high 7 maybe 7.7 or 7.8 and is defiantly worth a watch the cast is very good and is well written and directed. But don't go into this film expecting a film that makes perfect sense then you wont like this movie, but if you like the national treasure films then you will probably enjoy this film."

"zardoz-13","9","0","6","16 June 2013"," Worth Seeing More Than Once!!!
","Some movies ought to be watched more than once. The latest example is ""Now You See Me"" with Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Mark Ruffalo, Michael Caine, and Morgan Freeman. ""Now You See Me"" amounts to a good magic act. You think you see everything that you need to see, but you actually don't. The narrator/hero J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg) summarizes this ideology. ""The closer you think you are,"" Atlas claims, ""the less you'll actually see."" His second, relevant line is: ""The more you look, the less you see."" Without veiling my critical opinion of ""Now You See Me"" in literary lingo, let me say I enjoyed it enough to watch it twice. The first time I saw everything. The second time I understood everything. Some may put off a second viewing until Red Box rents copies, while others may stand in line the following day. Nevertheless, ""Now You See Me"" is rare because it makes you want to watch it again. Like any good magic act, this glossy melodrama manages to keep you distracted for many of its fleet-footed 115 minutes. ""Now You See Me"" deserves at least one star for not taking more than two hours to cap off its plot with a sensational finale. Meantime, ""Clash of the Titans"" director Louis Leterrier keeps everything both audacious as well as spontaneous. He relies on Steadicams so co-lensers Mitchell Amundsen and Larry Fong can together make the world of illusion whirl before our eyes as much to induce vertigo as to keep us anxious. Surprises and reversals occur almost every quarter hour to keep you on your toes. Honestly, I saw through at least half of this flashy gibberish, but I couldn't figure out the cloaked identity of the enigmatic individual behind a hood. Indeed, everything else about ""Now You See Me"" is first-class from the charismatic cast to the splashy CGI-special effects. This movie is as much fun to watch for its immediate gratification as well as its lasting gratification.<br/><br/>A quartet of magicians known only as the Four Horsemen forms a heroic group of protagonists in ""Now You See Me."" Arrogant J. Daniel Atlas (Jesse Eisenberg of ""The Social Network"") specializes in sleight of hand antics. As a David Blaine style street magician, he is a pretty sharp card sharp. Sexy Henley Reeves (Isla Fisher of ""Wedding Crashers"") tantalizes audiences with her Houdini-like feats of escapism under extreme conditions. She must unlock the shackles confining herself to a glass box before a school of Piranha fish are dumped atop her. Hypnotist/mentalist Merritt (Woody Harrelson of ""Zombieland"") uses his cerebral powers to divine the thoughts of others. Finally, Jack (Dave Franco of ""Fright Night"") employs his talents as a pickpocket, a card thrower, and safe cracker. Each of these characters appears in an introductory vignette before they are assembled by an unknown leader under extremely cryptic circumstances as a team. They open their magic act at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. They announce they are going to stage a bank robbery. As a part of their show-stopping antics, the Four Horsemen teleport a random audience member (Jose Garcia) from Sin City to his bank vault in Paris. Right before the audience's eyes, the guy attaches a bizarre-looking contraption to his head and vanishes in front of everybody. A moment later, he finds himself inside his bank vault. Millions of Euros in the City of Lights vanish, and the Horsemen find themselves in FBI custody for theft. Agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo of ""The Avengers"") questions them with the help of French Interpol detective Alma Dray (Mélanie Laurent of ""Inglorious Basterds""), but they cannot make their charges stick. Initially, Rhodes and Dray don't cooperate with one another. Their approach to solving crimes differs as much as their attitudes toward each other. Miraculously, the Four Horsemen always manage to stay a couple of jumps ahead of them. Gigantic mirrors, holograms, doubles, hypnosis, and profuse quantities of flash paper constitute most of their magic arsenal. While the cops are pursuing our heroes, an ex-magician, Thaddeus Bradley (Morgan Freeman of ""The Dark Knight""), who has acquired a reputation for debunking magicians, decides to join the authorities.<br/><br/>""Now You See Me"" shares a lot in common with the Michael Douglas movie ""The Game"" (1997) as well as the Kevin Spacey nail-biter ""The Usual Suspects."" Consequently, even if you can keep up with this snappy saga, you may still stumble when you guess the identity of the character behind the hood. Clearly, either Leterrier or scenarists Ed Solomon of ""Bill & Ted"" fame, ""Prince of Persia's"" Boaz Yakin, and rookie writer Edward Ricourt, or all, have read Agatha Christie. Agatha Christie plotting is the key to this intriguing mystery. Parisian-born Louis Leterrier learned the logistics of filmmaking as a director under the tutelage of French writer & producer Luc Besson with the first two Jason Statham ""Transporter"" thrillers. Leterrier also helmed the Jet Li crime thriller ""Unleashed,"" a movie with a happy confluence of charismatic characters and a rewarding finale. Leterrier's reboot of the Marvel Comics mutant superhero character ""The Incredible Hulk"" with Edward Norton as the eponymous hero caught more of the spirit of the comic book than Asian helmer Ang Lee's tragic ""Hulk"" (2003) with Eric Bana as the big, green guy. Leterrier went from comic book superheroes to mythological Greeks in ""Clash of the Titans."" This outlandish but adolescent sword and sandal opus with Sam Worthington furnished the requisite number of cliffhanger predicaments. Leterrier hasn't made a bad movie, but ""Titans"" wasn't as satisfying as the 1981 original with Harry Hamlin. Although ""Now You See Me"" careens through a labyrinth with a time limit, the characters emerge as an appealing group so you are rooting for them from the start, even when they have no business surviving some of the disasters that they survive. You can never really believe what your eyes are seeing in ""Now You See Me,"" but you'll have a blast watching it."

","Sometimes I think I should give ""Now You See Me"" more credit. It's exactly what it's supposed to be; the tag-line ""The closer you look, the less you see"" couldn't be more accurate, and I'm pretty sure the sole point of Hollywood summer fare is to be entertaining. That it is. The Four Horsemen will take you on such a fun ride that you might not notice how terrible the script is.<br/><br/>Woody Harrelson, Jesse Eisenberg, Isla Fisher and Dave Franco work exceedingly well together as a rag-tag group of magicians. Their individual talents and personal egos are brought together to create magnificent illusions to entertain and please the common folk. They rob banks and rob people but it's okay because some banks are bad and some people are bad and they give the money back to people who unfairly lost it. They're Robin Hood and his Merry Men and FBI agent Dylan Rhodes (Mark Ruffalo) is the Sheriff of Nottingham.<br/><br/>The tricks were exciting to watch with a particularly appealing style and choreography. Story-wise, the tricks build in significance, visually the tricks build in cinematic wonder. People like that but eventually you'll get concerned that the film doesn't have anything intelligent to say.<br/><br/>Dylan Rhodes was a frustrating character. He worked his way up in the FBI, takes his job seriously and snidely communicates with co-workers (whether they should be there or not). He doesn't care about magic – doesn't believe in it but also doesn't have an interest in how the tricks are actually accomplished. Each step closer to the Four Horsemen and he's pushed two steps back. The frustrating part is that we don't want him to catch them but we do want him to get close because whenever they're on the screen, the film is fun again.<br/><br/>Obviously there's a twist, it wouldn't be a heist movie without one, but how unfortunate that is. I wasn't the only one hoping there wasn't a twist which was guaranteed to undo all the fun that came before it. It would have been a much better movie if the entire thing was Harrelson, Eisenberg, Fisher and Franco performing magic for the masses without even an attempt at a story. That would have been written better.<br/><br/>As is, ""Now You See Me"" throws in a romance subplot for no good reason, destroys meaningless characters for no good reason and a twist that undoes that glorious good the Four Horsemen accomplished. The Four Horsemen did accomplish a lot. Their personal issues never got in the way, the lack of character development wasn't a problem and they obeyed one of the golden rules of performance art: Have fun and your audience will too."

","Now You See Me is the story of four illusionists who call themselves The Four Horsemen. The Four Horsemen consist of J. Daniel Atlas(Jesse Eisenberg), Merritt McKinney(Woody Harrelson), Henley Reeves(Isla Fisher) & Jack Wilder(Dave Franco). These four magicians rob banks using their illusions & reward their audience with the money. Enter FBI agent Dylan Rhodes(Mark Ruffalo) who, along with Interpol detective Alma Dray(Melanie Laurent) investigate how the Horsemen rob the banks & are hot on their trail to find out the secret.<br/><br/>This was an extremely enjoyable movie. The illusions were otherworldly. All of the actors performed brilliantly. Jesse Eisenberg is hysterical as J. Daniel Atlas. Mark Ruffalo is spectacular as Dylan Rhodes. Woody Harrelson is great as Merritt McKinney. Isla Fisher is outstanding as Henley Reeves. Dave Franco is impressive as Jack Wilder. Melanie Laurent is effective as Alma Dray. Last but not the least, the veterans, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine are wonderful as Thaddeus Bradley & Arthur Tressler respectively. All in all, Now You See Me is a movie filled with power packed performances, stunning visuals & an engaging storyline that will have you hooked throughout the film."

","This film is based on the magic trick efect. Starts off by letting you believe you know how it works, but at the end it shows you that you weren't (almost) always ""one step closer"".<br/><br/>The directing is good, no visible mistakes found, but I have to admit that is, same as the script, a bit exaggerated when it comes to some scenes. In spite of that, Louis Leterriermanaged to direct an alert movie which amazes with every scene.<br/><br/>The script isn't that abundant in originality, borrowing sketches from another genre films. Even if it's exaggerated in some points, it still manages to remain plausible until the very end.<br/><br/>Full review here:http://cinefilul007.blogspot.ro/p/blog-page_15.html"
"divyavijay1422","9","0","4","14 June 2013"," Very good movie, but don't expect mind-blowing results
","'Now You See Me' was an excellently developed movie, showcasing brilliant magic tricks and great humor and snarkiness from the Four Horsemen. Both Harrelson provided the comedy relief and Jesse Eisenberg displayed the cocky arrogance from The Social Network. Isla Fisher debuted in the movie amazingly, but then her character got pushed aside and later, reinstated as fighting for control of the group subtly along Eisenberg. Franco was also very funny and did an amazing fight scene with Ruffalo, using fire, cards, and a high-speed car chase with fantastic explosions. Ruffalo's character was pleasingly befuddled with a humorous chase down in New Orleans which ended when.....oops, spoilers. However, his partner, Laurent's character was earnest and passionate about the subject of magic but was rather pushed to the side and later suspected of having choreographed the whole thing herself. But the movie itself was funny, intelligent, witty, action-packed, and everything you could ask for if you don't want a thriller/psychologically stimulating movie. It's an action magic movie and that's that. There's no philosophical meaning, no deeper layers like in The Prestige. But The Prestige was dark and meaningful, and this movie is more lighthearted, something to laugh and ""wow"" at. The stunts and tricks were amazing and the effects were great. However......... The movie could stand to have had more character development. I felt it was all action, action, action. Freeman's character was frustrating because he spoke like he knew everything, but he knew nothing. Caine's character was actually well placed, used for the purpose of showing the audience what a lying cheat he was. I liked the way the Four Horsemen's tricks were conducted to achieve a higher end. None of the stealing or giving back to the deserving was for their own good. Like a magic Robin Hood mafia. All in all, it was what I wanted it to be. You won't be disappointed unless you're looking for a psychological thriller, in which case, you're in the wrong theater son."
"Florence_Ledger","7","0","3","14 June 2013"," Liked it in the theater, but besides that, there's not much more.
","When I saw ""Now You See Me"" on its opening day, I honestly thought it was pretty good. It was much better than I expected it to be, but it didn't leave any further traces in my mind after the movie was over. For me, many of the tricks were predictable, but the movie as a whole was still enjoyable. Unless you are a total dummy on magic tricks, you will probably be a bit disappointed. Personally, I like movies that keep me hanging at the end. I don't mean that in a sequel-promising manner; I like to muse over movies after seeing them, but ""Now You See Me"" ended in a way that just left me thinking, ""... that's it?"" I think that this is definitely a movie that you should see, just for the thrill and fun of it, but it's not a keeper. It isn't something I would go back and see again, which to me isn't very satisfying for a movie about brain-twisting magic and thrill."

","""I was a hundred and forty million dollar distraction?""<br/><br/>Distractions are key to magic tricks, diverting attention to successfully pull off illusions. Now You See Me is filled with great distractions that attempt to hide obvious flaws within the plot and characters. However, the big twist (which is to be expected in a film centered around magic) is a good enough final act to make the film superficially entertaining and enjoyable.<br/><br/>The film has a wide variety of cast members, including Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, Dave Franco, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine. In the film, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine's characters are portrayed negatively, which is a bit off seeing these old gents play personas that are far from their usual, likable statures. However, Morgan Freeman still gets his scenes of explaining exactly what is going on at the moment. The four magicians (Eisenberg, Harrelson, Fisher, and Franco) aren't very interesting as characters, mainly because they aren't given the chance. The film jumps back and forth between the escaping artists and the FBI, Dylan Rhodes and Alma Dray (Mark Ruffalo and Mélanie Laurent), that it becomes confusing as to who the main protagonists are. The way the film is put together limits character development, which is why even by the end of the film I found myself not caring about the magicians whatsoever. Their over-the-top personalities are smart distractions for the lack of character development.<br/><br/>Story wise, the film is pretty much one big setup for the final plot twist. The viewer isn't told exactly what the motivations are for the magicians to continuously break the law. Therefore, it becomes slightly confusing as to why the magicians would abandon their successful lives in Las Vegas to become fugitives. The act of leaving their elegant lives goes directly against their personalities - street performers (who obviously love the attention) finally get their own Las Vegas show only to throw it all away. It seems as though even the magicians themselves lack information as to what the end goal holds for them. Perhaps if the viewer is shown that the magicians care more about being the best illusionists rather than having an endless amount of cash, their conflict throughout the film would be a bit more believable. Showing them to be con artists and thieves in the beginning of the film (both which have the end goal of making easy money) doesn't really help the story. But, the twists are elaborate enough to distract from the holes in the plot.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Dylan and Alma, along with the action and chase scenes, round out the film for a wide range of audience members. While the film isn't focused on action, the chase scene of Dave Franco's character running from Dylan has interesting choreography and a good amount of suspense. Other similar scenes demonstrate that the film looks great visually. However, the CGI makes some of the illusions look fictitious, even though the film does not cross over into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi like The Prestige. In addition, a number of scenes are filled with real life impossibilities. It is important to note that Now You See Me can be best enjoyed by following the big picture rather than paying too close attention to the plot and character development. Ironically, the closer you look, the less there really is to see.<br/><br/>So in a way, the film with a budget of $75 million is a $10 distraction for people who want to have a fun time with magic. Sure the plot and some of the characters are trivial, but that doesn't mean that the film can't be entertaining - and it is. And that's what really matters."
"faiz-can","Null","0","4","10 June 2013"," Not Bad, Not Great - Just an Average
","When I watched its trailer, I thought it is similar to the Prestige and Illusionist. (By the way I loved both movies). Magic/illusions always fascinate me and it influenced half of my decision to watch this movie, while the other half was supported by the strong cast of this movie like Morgan Freeman, Jesse, Ruffalo, Woody and Isla. Although it does not stand anywhere near Prestige and Illusionist but that doesn't mean it is not a good movie. The movie started off very strongly and created interest immediately. However, as the plot unveiled, it turned out to be an average- Not bad but not great even as expected. As this is an illusion based movie, it keeps the viewer confused for most of the time and reveals answers in end. The acting was good, although the character building was weak. The movie still entertains till the last seen."
"christianjarmon","6","0","2","9 June 2013"," Pretty Good, Somewhat Hyped Up
","""Now You See Me"" was a pretty good movie, I think it was really hyped up to be something that it wasn't because the previews made you think that there was going to be a huge mega show of an ending. The high points of the movie were based around the actual magic, as a whole the tricks were good, and I think that they did a good job of explaining how they pulled everything off. There was a little bit of comedy that lightened the serious mood, and once again the tricks made the movie worth watching. I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because the movie was cohesive until the end. There was really an incomplete ending with no explanation of what made their common goal so worth it. Overall, I'm iffy on recommending this movie. I wouldn't pay full price to see this movie in stores, but I think it is a good movie to just watch. - Christian J."
"Eboy","8","0","2","9 June 2013"," Good movie if you suspend belief
","7.5 stars, rounding up to 8. My family wanted to go so I took them, not eagerly after reading the Rotten Tomatoes assessment. Darned if I didn't like it. I think the key was, early on, just letting myself go and suspending belief. Some of the illusions just would not seem viable otherwise. What helped was the breakneck pacing. It starts out at 90 miles per hour and does not let up. No chance to reflect or get bored because once you start, BAM!, it's off to something else. The plot, generally, I do not find plausible. I saw the ending criticized elsewhere. Again, suspend belief and it is not a problem. Magic is kind of fun to me, and I think that helped get me through. I would recommend this movie to a friend, along with some of my advice above for viewing."
"cinemachutney","7","0","2","7 June 2013"," A group of street Magicians pull off their best act yet!
","Thriller as a genre doesn't cease to entice you because it is a sphere that doesn't have a beginning or an end. The more you roll, the more you will have! Here's one movie that is a sphere in its own entity – 'Now I can see you'! It didn't entice a title, does it as a movie?<br/><br/>The movie teasers let the plot out! So it's all the more fun to see how the script has been executed. Magicians turn infidels! That's the only thing we can leak out. How they use their talents is what is enticing! Looked like an old story to us but there's something new in here! <br/><br/>Director Louis Leterrier, where have you heard that name before? Transporter series of course! His work seemed like an 'Oceans 11' extension but it is only a mere comparison because both the movies deal with heists. The director hasn't tried too hard. He's kept things simple and scripted quite a decent movie. <br/><br/>Technically sound, the movie does have its share of flaws and importantly blank spaces in the plot itself. That's because the director has chosen to get the characters called 'The Four Horsemen' to do the talking rather than the plot by itself. When you see bad, there's always a good bloke who wants to end the menace. Mark Rufallo as the cop has his FBI shoes on and tries his best! <br/><br/>Let's talk about the pace of the movie. May be the first 60 minutes were like a Japanese magnetic train and then the following time frame till the end seemed like a tad tiring disclosure of facts. Should the screenplay be a little faster, the movie would have been even more engrossing to watch. Seasoned actor Morgan Freeman gets his bunch of dialogues, at a very nagging time of the movie, making it all the more tiring for the viewer. <br/><br/>Explanations for most unanswered questions were answered towards the climax. It seemed like, 'a few questions, don't have answers'! Finally an element of suspense that we wouldn't want to leak here doesn't quite go with the audience because the entire premise of the movie is not convincingly explained. <br/><br/>Let's give the errors a pass, the almost convincing robbing techniques, highly imaginative modern day illusion depiction and not to forget the characterizations of each of the individual street magicians, this movie has every reason to be a time spending investment!"

And there was surprisingly humor in this film and the jokes were delivered incredibly. But in between the ""Acts"" I got bored because if you realize it, you are not really being amazed by humans, it is just the special effects.
