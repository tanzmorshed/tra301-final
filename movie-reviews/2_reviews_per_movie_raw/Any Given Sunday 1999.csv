","Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino) is the head coach of the Miami Sharks who are owned by the Christina Pagniacci(Cameron Diaz) who is using the Miami Franchise only for profit. Trouble stirs up after long time star quarterback Cap Rooney(Dennis Quaid)is injured along with his back up bringing in third string quarterback Willie Beamen(Jamie Foxx) who becomes the face of the franchise after having great game after great game. The only problem is that he plays only with his head and not with his heart, with an aging team that needs an emotional leader to guide them to victory. Also Starring: James Woods, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Bill Bellemy, Lawrence Taylor, Charelton Heston, Aaron Eckhart, and John C. McGinley.<br/><br/>In a cinema that rarely produces pro football movies, this is the cream of the crop. It captures the reality along with the heroic story of a nobody rising to the top. The movie is humorous, dramatic, and a thriller for all sports fans.<br/><br/>This is not only one of Oliver Stone's best films but this is also the start of Jamie Foxx's ""good"" acting career. Forget what the critics said about Collateral or Ray being the beginning for Jamie Foxx. It was Any Given Sunday. Willie Beaman is a complex character and Foxx nailed the part. He was magnificent. He played the part to perfection and out shined the great Al Pacino. The supporting cast was also incredible with great performances from Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, James Woods, and surprisingly John C. McGinley. It is very rare to find a great dramatic football movie but this is definitely one those small few.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the greatest sports movies of all time and it is highly enjoyable for adult audiences.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie."
"alexkolokotronis","10","39","51","22 November 2007"," Very Underrated and Well Overlooked
","It seems that many people dislike this movie and I can see why. First of all it shows that professional athletes are far away from being perfect. A lot farther than we would like to believe. The movie shows that many athletes as we know are just out their for the money. It also shows the corruption in the owners and politicians. But for me, all of this is good thing. I like seeing a movie that does not include glory in sports.<br/><br/>Another aspect of the movie was the cast. I thought the cast that was put together was very well put together. I was especially surprised at the performance of Cameron Diaz. I thought she played very well as the viscous and corrupt owner. Specifically in the part were she black-mails the mayor into giving the team money for a new stadium. Jamie Foxx also gave a very well played performance as the new upcoming quarterback. His role shows that he has become sick with fame and fortune and has seem to forgotten who helped to reach his superstar status. For example when he ignores most of the plays called in and decides to run the game the way he wants to. He reaches as point were he just flat out ignores everyone. For example he says: ""I'm trying to win coach. I ain't trying to disrespect nobody, but winning is the only thing I respect."" I think Oliver Stone shows that this is the problem we have in our society, that everything is about winning. His relationship falls apart with his girlfriend and seems to believe that their is nothing that could stop him. He almost reaches a point were he believes he is like a god. But, he realizes he needs a wakeup call or he will end up like the some of the people around him. I liked the way Dennis Quaid played as the long time starting quarterback who nearly becomes paralyzed. Now my initial reaction after he got hit was that his family would want him to immediately retire. What happened was the opposite, his wife wanted him to risk being paralyzed and brain damage so he can get one more contract although Dennis Quaid was trying to explain to her that he is worried about what might happen to himself. Or one of the confrontations between wife and husband when he mentions to her that they should put the kids to bed and the wife responds by saying:""Why can't we hire a maid?"" This also adds on to Jamie Foxx's role and shows that the players are pressurized by their families towards good decisions and bad decisions and that the families have also lost touch with what is important in life. As well with Lawrence Taylor's role which shows the player-doctor relationship and the role that age and lack of education forcing players to push themselves over the limit for that last bonus, knowing after they retire they may not survive in the real world. LL Cool J's role as the star running-back shows that he no longer cares about the team or the game itself and feels threatened by Jamie Foxx because he has brought a new style of playing to the team and they tend to not agree with each other but above all with this new style of play may not let him reach a certain amount of rushing yards to reach his bonus. Again Jamie Foxx comes into this part of the movie at the end when he hurts his arm but does not tell anyone worried what might happen to his career. I think overall this show that their is too much emphasis in sports and I'm saying this even though I'am a big sports fan.<br/><br/>A very interesting part of the movie is the Al Pacino's role as the head coach. His ongoing fighting with Cameron Diaz shows the relationship between owner and coach. The coach wants to win games and have control of the team but the owner wants the money, the power and the credit for building a team. Pacino has fallen into a slump and doesn't like the ways are looking for the future of the his job and the sport. For example when he says: ""It's TV, it changed everything, changed the way we think forever. I mean the first time they stopped the game to cut away to some commercial that was the end of it. Because it was our concentration that mattered, not theirs, not some fruitcake selling cereal."" He believes the game no matters any more it is the money and this is what I believe is the main point of the movie. It is no longer the game that matters it is the people who put the money into it and this is what has been or what will be the downfall of sports or really anything.<br/><br/>I think that a good message through all these downfalls is that if you stick together and focus on your goal you will succeed no matter how big the obstacle, hence the title ""Any Given Sunday""."
"Agent10","7","26","35","15 May 2002"," Sports in its most brutal moments
","Wild and outrageous, Any Given Sunday gives the viewer a glimpse into an athletic world not too far from the real thing. While some of the scenes were a little too over the top, it proved to be a very enjoyable experience. As a major football fan, I was disappointed in the fact the NFL did not allow Stone to use their logos and stadiums. Oh well, I seemed to enjoy the fictional league even better, even if some of the team uniforms were a dreadful. Jamie Fox portrayed Willie Beamon perfectly, epitomizing the selfish athlete with a cultured ease. While the speed of Beamon's rise proved to be a little too quick, the message in the rise and fall of stardom was more poignant than anything."
"Don-102","7","49","74","14 January 2000"," A Dizzying, Entertaining Peek Into Pro Football...Stone Style
","Sports movies are tough to make.  Creating the essence of the actual event is the toughest.  Most films fall short in the editing process of the event or through sheer carelessness and lack of knowledge.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is somewhat of an exception.  It is hard-hitting and bloody like NORTH DALLAS FORTY.  It is actually conventional when you think about it, like a warped RUDY.  It is a hell of a lot more realistic than say, NECESSARY ROUGHNESS. These are all football films with varying degrees of success (except ROUGHNESS), but Oliver Stone, in his usual over the top way, throws a dizzying, mind-splitting film at us, much like the sport itself.  This is why I liked it.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone began a wicked spell of filmmaking with JFK, evident in its editing style.  Fast-paced, black and white mixed with color, documentary-like methods ensued in NATURAL BORN KILLERS, NIXON, and the ghastly U-TURN.  Nothing is new here with ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.  Football is a battlefield Stone chooses to depict and depict it he does.  Even the most ardent fans of the sport do not really know what it is like for a quarterback to drop back and get rid of a piece of pigskin before 11 players maul him.  You certainly get the idea watching this.  <br/><br/>Al Pacino is the dried up head coach of the fictional Miami Sharks and he barks out the usual coaching cliches you hear in press conferences after real games.  Pacino also seems to be sleep-walking through the picture.  At times, he appears drunk even when he is not supposed to be.  Cameron Diaz's character, a young chick owner, (yeah right) destroys any credibility the film may have had going in (Even the NFL would have nothing to do with this movie). Her constant bickering is so over-done, you almost feel like hurling much the way Jamie Foxx does every time he enters a game as the team's 3rd string quarterback.  Realisticly speaking, this is not a very sane film about football.  It is a maniacal celebration of the game.  The scenes on the field are the ones I cherished.  Beware of the locker room or domestic sequences.<br/><br/>No one has ever put such energy into football scenes in a film before.  He definitely had some good consultants.  There are some comical cameos - Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus play opposing coaches.  Lawrence Taylor can actually act a teeny bit and Jim Brown shares the film's best off the field scene with Pacino in a bar.  Stone tries to show us how the game has changed.  He resonates past glory with quotes from Lombardi, dissolves showing Red ""the Galloping Ghost"" Grange, and even Unitas handing off to Ameche.  TV has changed everything, says the coach, and he is right.  It seems to be all about the money nowadays.<br/><br/>That is the message, but you'll find yourself losing that idea in the lunacy of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY and the bone-crushing, ear-damaging football scenes. They are filmed and cut with such raw intensity, you feel like playing afterwards.  This is definitely a film for football fans only unless you like big, sweaty men.  Is there a big game at the end that needs to be won? Yes, and this surprised me considering how unconventional Stone usually is. Basically, surrender your senses and thought process to Stone's most entertaining film in quite some time.<br/><br/>RATING: ***"
"SKG-2","8","49","74","12 January 2000"," Not quite a touchdown, but at least Stone is back
","Oliver Stone is one of the most, if not THE most, passionate filmmakers working today.  He's also a talented filmmaker, which a lot of people seem to forget.  When both his talent and passion are at full strength, the results are impressive(SALVADOR, PLATOON, JFK, NIXON).  When the passion is still there, but the talent is tripped up by his passion and ambitions, he makes flawed movies which are still powerful(WALL STREET, TALK RADIO, BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, HEAVEN AND EARTH).  But when he goes outside of his passions, for either experiments(NATURAL BORN KILLERS), or to make ""mainstream"" movies(U-TURN), he misses wide.  NATURAL BORN KILLERS, to me, was a worse film, but U-TURN was, in a way, even more dispiriting, because the former you could at least excuse as an experiment gone wrong, whereas the latter screamed ""Cash-in!""  You felt after watching Stone was too tired to fight anymore.<br/><br/>Well, as ANY GIVEN SUNDAY proves, Stone, like his on-screen alter-ego, Tony D'Amato(Al Pacino), may look tired, but he's still got fight left in him. Many have seen football as war, so it's appropriate Stone has long wanted to make a movie about football.  And as Spike Lee did with HE GOT GAME, Stone wants us to see not only the glory of the actual playing(as well as how tough it is to earn that glory), but also the corrupt forces which are pervading it today.  After all, we decry flashy players, and then complain about those who are too boring, we talk about tradition out of one side of our mouth and demand the game be updated out of the other side, we call white players who exhibit boorish behavior ""colorful"" while calling black players who exhibit similar behavior ""punks""(and that's putting it mildly), we complain about players who are overpaid while thinking nothing of owners who spend lavishly on themselves and move teams around, we complain about football being too dominated by TV yet sit around like couch potatoes every Sunday and Monday night, we react with horror when players get hurt badly and get addicted to drugs, yet we yell at them to murder each other on the field and call those who don't chicken(to put it mildly), and so on.<br/><br/>This is a wide canvas to cover, and yet Stone does a pretty good job of it. Especially good is how the relationship between D'Amato and his new quarterback Willie Beamon(Jamie Foxx) encompasses a lot of that canvas. There are two scenes in particular which stand out; one where D'Amato sits with Willie on the plane and tries to talk to him, but can't think of anything which doesn't sound patronizing from Willie's point of view(like music, where D'Amato thinks the fact he's mentioning black jazz musicians is supposed to mean something), and the scene at D'Amato's house, where Beamon talks of how, in the past, ""playing for the team"" was code for ""Know your place, boy,"" and have things really changed?  Willie has to learn that playing for the team really does mean, as quarterback, getting them to respect you so they'll play for you, and Tony has to learn that tradition can't be stodgy, that it has to accept change.<br/><br/>Stone is less sure in other aspects.  Cameron Diaz does a good job as the team's owner, but her character is a little too one-dimensional at times. It would have been more interesting to have here not just talk in terms of money, but that the game, to her, really is more interesting the way Willie plays it(maybe I'm biased, but I'm a fan of more pass-oriented games).  And while I don't think Stone is as misogynist as he's been charged with in the past, certainly it's evident here.  It's one thing to say there are groupies in football, it's another thing to delight in showing them.  There are sympathetic woman here, particularly Ann-Margaret as Diaz's mother, who shows what being a football wife costs, and Lela Rochon as Willie's girlfriend, who is unwilling to have that happen to her(the scene at the party, where she feels both isolated from Willie and the other wives, is nicely drawn).  Finally, Stone can't resist the ROCKY-type cliches near the end.<br/><br/>But though it's flawed, there's still a lot of power here.  Except for Lauren Holly, who I'm not a big fan of, the acting is all around excellent, particularly Foxx.  I was particularly impressed with how well the athletes did as actors, particularly Jim Brown(though he's an actor, so this isn't surprising) and Lawrence Taylor.  And, of course, all the football scenes are terrific and feel real.  It's always good when you see on screen what you can't see watching the game on TV, and Stone accomplishes that here. Call it not quite a touchdown, but a film which convinces us Stone still has fight left in him."
"butango","6","35","52","14 March 2006"," Machismo
","Any Given Sunday is one of Oliver Stone's most enjoyable movies. Sunday is pure entertainment, an action-packed spectacle that will delight even the most ardent sports enthusiast. Stone draws on the usual assortment of sports movie clichés, but he directs his actors, including Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, and LL Cool J, into such passionate and intense performances, that the movie is able to transcend its familiar material. While its 160-minute running time is a bit of a detriment, AGS works overall as a superior piece of escapist entertainment. Also, the locker room scene, which showcases a confrontation between Cameron Diaz and a football player with a giant penis, is a classic."

","Any Given Sunday (1999)<br/><br/>Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, LL Cool J, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Lawrence Taylor, Jim Brown, John C. McGinley, Aaron Eckhart, Charlton Heston, Oliver Stone, Elizabeth Berkley. Directed by Oliver Stone. Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" is a film that is a feast for the eyes, but not the mind. Stone does a great job for creating a dizzying direction, eye-opening visuals, and extremely loud sound, and he does all of this with the 2 and a half+ hours that he has to spare with the film but never does go deep into detail on the characters.<br/><br/>The story consists of a professional football team struggling with their season. The film opens with a quote from football legend Vince Lombardi, and then fades into a football game, where the starting quarterback for the Sharks, Jack Rooney is hurt in the middle of a game, unknown third string quarterback Willie Beaman is sent in for the rest of the season. As Beaman starts rising to fame, aging Coach D'Amato and Rooney begin to question if Beaman is worth risking the rest of the season and their chance for the championship as he is trying to make the team win by himself.<br/><br/>The performances are pretty good and powerful. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx do great with the lead characters, and other familiar faces such as Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine and John C. McGinley in the supporting performances.<br/><br/>One thing I did really like about ""Any Given Sunday"" is how the action during the games is very realistic, gritty, and fast. It ultimately captures the intensity and hard work from the sport of Football. But like ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""U Turn"", the sound is so unbearably loud and images are so fast and dizzying that the film could give some viewers a headache. Stone has been known to cause controversy among his films, and this is a way that he seems to do it, but it didn't bother me so much as haters of the film. Despite of some of the strengths, ""Any Given Sunday"" does have a few flaws. The film is unnecessarily overlong, overly stylish, and underdeveloped. Stone really could have made the film about 20-30 minutes shorter, and with most of the time the characters are either playing on the game field or yelling at each other. Some scenes showing Willie's rise are no more interesting than a Nike Gridiron commercial or a Michael Bay film. Another thing Stone forgets to do is add emotion to the film, and he replaces that with mostly sports action.<br/><br/>Overall I really did enjoy this film a lot, for it's realistic football scenes and the living hell that the players go through in order to win. But at times it really does try too hard, especially when it's absent with a great script and follows clichés of older Football (or even gladiator) films. But I would recommend it to Stone fans and football fans especially. A very considerate 4 stars out of 5."
"noralee","7","22","33","21 December 2005"," Professional Football Meets Its Match in Oliver Stone
","I thought what a great combo for ""Any Given Sunday"" - Oliver Stone and professional football -- excess meets its match. <br/><br/>So I grabbed a chance to go to the movies with my sons. They got a lot more out of the first and third thirds of the movie that are football games, which I couldn't follow at all, knowing zilch about football so I missed any references to significances of plays and strategies and didn't recognize the zillion football players past and present in bit parts, but I got other visual and music references they didn't.<br/><br/>The football field is explicitly a jungle, with the sounds like an elephant herd crashing. Of course Stone never says or shows once what he can get across 5 times, so the jungle fever point of the primalness of sports as a venue for male violence is accompanied by Native American chants, aboriginal and Asian Indian mystic strains as well. I don't know enough about rap to judge those selections -- I could tell there were lots of lyrics about ""niggaz"" working for The Man type of thing. <br/><br/>The second third should have appealed to me as that's when the huge ensemble has personal interactions and we learn all their selfish, dastardly, unpleasant motivations, but I was on sensory overload. Example: Al Pacino as the Old Guard Coach calls in Jamie Foxx as the suddenly first string quarterback (in a terrific performance), for a tête a tête on the pro's of Jazz over Rap, as a metaphor of the old football of finesse (what? all those flashbacks to black & white football games were of a subtle sport?). But when Foxx walks in Pacino has ""Ben Hur"" playing on a wide-screen TV. As if we didn't get the point Foxx actually says ""The old gladiators, huh?"" If we still didn't get the point the conversation keeps intercutting with the chariot race. And if we still didn't get the point of any reference in the conversation to racial issues then intercuts to the galley slave scenes from ""Ben Hur"" THEN on top of that, the NFL commissioner who puts the Bitch Owner in her place for trying to play with the Big Old Guys is none other than Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>No one just has a conversation -- everyone shouts, usually at the same time, so I had to close my eyes and I'm not sure if I missed something.<br/><br/>This is Sunbelt Football of expansion teams where the sport is not a Fall/Winter season - so the women were everywhere in tank tops, cleavage, midriffs bare and hips swinging, even Cameron Diaz as the Bitch Owner. Though all the women are really high priced prostitutes (even usually sweet Lauren Holly is a hardened cold Football Wife).<br/><br/>What I don't think I missed was Stone's outsize determination to ignore the homo-erotic aspects of male sports violence that ""Fight Club"" reveled in. Aw come on Stone, not a single gay player in the closet? He crowds the behemoths into locker rooms and showers that can barely contain their bodies--but he's so afraid of showing them in contact that he even at one point has one throw a baby alligator into the shower so they scatter.<br/><br/>Everyone is criticized-- including the sportscasters, which Stone revels in playing one (I think in general this movie is a show down between Stone and Spike Lee as it takes on more racial issues than he's done in the past). What a coincidence that ESPN is continually bad-mouthed when there's a big legible credit at the end to Turner Sports Network when this is a Time Warner movie and ESPN's a competitor.<br/><br/>Stone of course goes out of his way to link football with war, to fit into his oeuvre, with battle quotes from Vince Lombardi and some sort of link with Pacino's father dying in WWII that was irrelevant it seemed to me. <br/><br/>I think this is Dennis Quaid's at least third football movie and in the genre of such movies as ""North Dallas 40,"" ""Longest Yard,"" ""Great American Hero,"" etc. and this joins that pantheon as a terrific football movie. <br/><br/>The music selections were by Robbie Robertson (with Paul Kelly but I'm not sure which Kelly that is) and he did as seamless a job as he's done for Martin Scorcese. The music credits at the end were impossible to read -- in 3 columns of a vertical font that was like watching the credits on TV - plus the movie continues under the credits so all those who bolted missed the ending.<br/><br/>Professional football deserves to be Oliver Stoned. But if I never saw any more football that'll be fine with me. <br/><br/>(originally written 12/27/1999)"
"jeremy3","5","12","17","29 November 2007"," Good cast, but too much of a soap opera
","The positives in the movie was a good cast. I don't like Cameron Diaz in most roles, but this was her best one by far. She is very good as a woman owner of a football team trying very hard to do it as a woman. In addition, at times the football action was entertaining. It is the ""off-field"" dramas that mar the film substantially.<br/><br/>First of all, it was a professional football team. In the real world of pro football, the quarterback doesn't puke on the field. There are fans watching the game. James Wood's role was largely comical and irrelevant. Since pro football is a multi-billion dollar business, ""amoral"" doctors are not going to be hired or tolerated. It was also almost playoffs. As bad as the sport's world seems, players don't party openly, do drugs, and hire prostitutes right before the playoffs. Even the most irresponsible football players are not that dumb, because at that point of the season they wouldn't want the entire team and city hating them. The coach of a football team would be planning plays after the game, not drinking at bars and being propositioned by prostitutes. A coach wouldn't openly scowl, when his quarterback deviates from the play slightly, if it results in a win. Pro football coaches are celebrities, and wouldn't scowl when their team won as a result of a player being independent minded. The coach may after the game in the locker room remind the quarterback that there is a game plan. That was another major wrong with this film. There was only a play called in the last few seconds of the final regular season game. Pro football is all about plays. All the coach did was give pep talks.<br/><br/>So, the film was basically ruined by unrealistic, exaggerated scenarios. Stone should have spent more time studying the real game of football, instead of some Hollywood interpretation. The acting was good, and at times there was an attempt to show that football is a very rough sport. However, I can not really recommend this film, other than being slightly entertaining, and possessing a good cast of actors."

","Let me start by saying that i dont like or even understand american football and i personally think it does not come close to soccer but with this film it did not matter a jot. Oliver Stone had directed a film here that crosses all bounderies. You dont have to like the sport or understand it to appreciate how brilliant this film is. It is shot so well ,it makes you fell you are in the game and as for the soundtrack well that just adds to a mesmerising showpiece. Stars such as Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid,James Woods and Cameron Diaz star but for me the real Star of this film is James Foxx who plays the Quaterback who begins to believe his own hype but ultimately understands that it the team that matters. One of the test of a good film is that if you start to look at the clock throughout the film is usually means its not good , this film lasted 2 and a half hours and i never looked at the time. Brilliant. 9 out of 10."

","I think the movie as a whole was excellent.  Oliver Stone did a great job, I felt as though I was inside the screen.  The almost 3 hours didn't even feel like it, it felt like watching a Football game on Any Given Sunday.  Jamie Foxx did a great job, you loved him at times and hated him at times, and he gave you great reason to do either.  And of course Al Pacino was the man as always, playing a coach with heart and blowing you away at the end.  Cameron Diaz was the best wicked witch, just a hard-core display of a woman of the millenium. All in all, anyone who thinks this movie had no plot, wasn't paying attention.  All you have to do is see the change in the characters throughout the movie, and what the game meant to each one of them: from the owner, to the coach, to the players, to the doctors, to the families. Perfect example is the characters of both Ann Margaret and Lauren Holly. There is a lot of meaning in this movie.  Kudos!"

","I don't intend to add to the many positive comments about this movie.  I agree with them.  But from another perspective:<br/><br/>First, I have never been a football fan.  However, any movie that combines Oliver Stone and Al Pacino has to get my interests. I loved it.<br/><br/>One thing that did impress me more than anything else was the quality of the sound design.  The 3 dimensional noises in the huddle, on the line, from the grandstands; the growls and other sounds from the players; these things made the movie live and my blood boil.  I was breathless.<br/><br/>Then these things interspersed with dead silences and slow motion dreamlike sequences gave the action a spiritual quality.<br/><br/>I stayed for the credits to see who had done this sound work and I think Wylie Stateman will get, at the very least, an Oscar nomination for sound design.  If you ever wondered what this credit meant, see this movie and you will know. This movie would have lost a great deal of its punch without that sound designer's talent."
"Wolf Man","5","3","3","31 August 2000"," Well...
","This flick just wasn't very good.  The fact that we are immersed in the bone crunching and the jarring qualities of a contact sport is played out by the jarring camera work do not succeed in covering up the fact that this movie is not constructed very well.  It just doesn't cut it on the technical end.  Numerous continuity problems were so glaring on the screen that I wondered if the editors had gone on strike half way through production.<br/><br/>The writing is just as poor...No, I retract that; it was worse.  An example?  In the end, we get to see the owner contemplating on these events that changed her.  Well, the writing is so thin that this character doesn't even show enough dynamism to portray a convincing change.  And Pacino is no football coach.  Not that his performance isn't the only saving grace in this trash, its just that he's not well cast.  I have nothing against a football film portraying the intensity and meanness of its characters or the ruthlessness of the management, but this over-the-top picture is far too gratuitous in all aspects.  Not just in violence factor, but as a whole. Half the film seems unnecessary.  The message gets completely lost and the actors cease speaking like they believe in what they are saying.  At points, the audience can find better dialogue in a middle school musical.  The whole effort could have lasted 80 minutes, caused less grief, and I could have done something productive with that extra hour-and-a-half... Like sleep..oh wait, thats what I ended up doing the first time I tried to watch this c**p, anyway.  Well, other than keeping myself amused by making fun of it...5/10 or C+ (thats generous)"

","I just got back from ""AGS"".  After seeing it, I'm convinced that no matter how much it's written how he extensively researched the film, Stone NEVER has watched an NFL game in his life.  Great cinematography ? Give me a break.  The game montages were almost unviewable and 90% of the other shots in the film were close-ups.  Was there ANYTHING in this movie that wasn't brought up in ""North Dallas Forty"" ?<br/><br/>Aging star player ... check.  Young hot shot .... check.  Painkillers .... check. Owner who doesn't ""get it"" .... check.  Crazy off-field behavior .... check<br/><br/>Also, it's the playoffs in Dallas (i.e Dec or Jan) in an outdoor stadium, yet people sitting there in tank-tops and shorts ! And what was with those lights ? Were they playing in a Japanese Kabuki theater or a sports stadium ?<br/><br/>And the strategy shown in the game was laughable. It's fourth & 1 inside the ""Sharks'"" 30. Dallas leads 35-31. KICK THE FRIGGING FIELD GOAL.  Not only would this had made sense football-wise, but you'd then have an even better final sequence where they could have scored and had to go for the two-point conversion.  Hell, tie the game w/ the extra point and Stone could have made it an even 3 hours with overtime.<br/><br/>Were the lame montages of ""old time"" football players supposed to be a tribute to the game ? Give me a break.<br/><br/>And the script ... ugh.  More cliches than you can shake a stick at .. oops, there's another one.<br/><br/>""Slapshot"" was better than this movie.

"jayaram5","1","16","28","29 December 1999"," This movie doesn't make any sense
","Another lame attempt to make a movie ""gritty"" and ""thought provoking""- whatever the hell that means.  They have Al Pacino say a lot of words like - ""Television killed football."" Yeah whatever.  This is another movie that showcases Oliver Stone's Delusions of Grandeur.  If Stone is trying to show us that football will be our downfall or something, why does he insist on romanticizing the sport with his stilted camera movements and Kid Rock songs?   He even throws Cameron Diaz into the fray for purely aesthetic reasons.  It's a shame that Diaz and Pacino have to meet in a movie that is so bad.<br/><br/>Ever since ""Scent of Woman,"" writers and directors have used Pacino to romanticize their pathetic lines.  His characters are nothing more than loudspeakers - their voices covering up what would normally be redundant and trite.  He needs to reinvent himself, showing how he can act without yelling.  He has to stop feeling sorry for hokey scripts with cheesy lessons like ""Organized football is messed up,"" and act out a good story."
"KnightsofNi11","3","9","14","8 August 2011"," Oliver Stone... what are you doing?
","Maybe it's just me, but when I hear about an Oliver Stone directed football movie starring none other than Al Pacino I'm expecting a masterpiece. That's why I was quite taken aback by how much of a turd Any Given Sunday is. It's the story of fictional NFL team the Miami Sharks. Al Pacino is the team's head coach who is trying to desperately to take them to the playoffs, but to do so he must battle against unnecessary roughness on and off the field. Dennis Quaid plays the teams star quarterback who, after a nasty hit, is put out of the game and replaced by Jamie Foxx who somehow becomes a superstar after winning just two games, because that's how the NFL works, right? Turmoil continually befalls the team as they try to keep it together so they can go all the way and have the season of a lifetime.<br/><br/>What I love about Oliver Stone is the way he can take something we've seen plenty of times before and make it into something highly original and absolutely brilliant. He changed the face of war movies with his robust shout out to the troops in Platoon. He took a rock and roll biopic and turned it into an existential masterpiece with The Doors. He allowed the presidential biopic to soar to new heights with JFK. So his attempt at a football movie should have been revolutionary. But instead we are given this sappy, cheesy, poorly written, poorly directed stinker of a film. What the hell happened? Any Given Sunday is just one big melting pot of clichés. There is absolutely nothing original here for a football film. You might not realize it, but you know the entire plot of the film before you ever hit play. I'm not sure that this film get any more obvious. It is the complete package of typical football film story lines. You have the tormented coach who can't keep his team together. The all-star quarterback who gets injured, letting the far superior rookie play. Said rookie is an egomaniac who can't get his life together because of the excess of fame. But of course a few inspirational speeches from coach and the whole team is golden once again. The flat lining lack of originality in this film is appalling.<br/><br/>However, what's even more appalling is Oliver Stone's god awful direction. This film is so sporadic and lacks any kind of structure to its editing. We are constantly barraged by quick cuts that do nothing but distract and quickly become very annoying. The look of this film is supposed to seem fun and artistic, but really it is just pretentious. Stone is trying to do something talented with the direction here, but it doesn't work at all and only gets in the way. There is hardly a shot in this film that lasts for more than 30 seconds. The camera will be focused on one person as they deliver a monologue, but the camera constantly changes angle on them, jumping from spot to spot on their face which gets ridiculously annoying. Stone has displayed such finesse and such raw talent for direction in the past. I really don't know what happened here.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is easily one of the biggest wastes of close to three hours of my life. It's a truly terrible film that lacks any kind of control, structure, meaning, or purpose. Al Pacino does a nice job while the rest of the cast are pretty sorry. A football film from Oliver Stone should stand out amongst all other football films, but instead this film just takes every football film cliché and applies that to itself, never raising the bar of originality. The only reason this film would stand out amongst others like is would be because it is so horrible. I never thought I'd say this about an Oliver Stone film but... I hate this film."

","First of all, I didn't want to see it because, after all, it's a football movie, but I was bored and my roommates wanted to go, so I succumbed to peer pressure.  Biggest mistake of my life.  Secondly, there were way too many minor stories about almost every player on the team that you don't know who to route for.  By the end of the three hours, I was routing for the other team just because I knew the season would end and, hopefully, the movie would be over.  I wouldn't see this movie again if Leonard Maltin told me it was his pick of the year."

"nico-153","3","6","10","10 August 2014"," An insult on several levels
","I am a fan of Oliver Stone. He made many films that are classics in my eyes. Consider films like Platoon, JFK, Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July, or Natural Born Killers. Even W. Now we see a certain Oliver Stone as director of Any Given Sunday. This can not be the same Oliver Stone. Obviously Any Given Sunday is made by a Gangster Rapper, a wannabe with some experience doing MTV videos, commercial videos and some experience doing promotion videos for American Football. Is this film so bad? In my opinion? Definitely! The first part of the film was just terrible, the second part at least had some structure and some story. Apart from the very poor directing, the editing was amazing as well. Lots of random shots, lots of meaningless shots, lots of unrelated shots. Add to that a sometimes weird soundtrack.<br/><br/>The acting? An insult to the actors! In the first part of the film only Cameron Diaz had a decent role. In the second part there were some indications that the director actually wanted to use the immense capabilities of Al Pacino. Dennis Quaid was completely miscast; a 45 year old quarterback? You must be joking. Jamie Foxx was badly used, James Woods had a ridiculously poor part. But look at what they did to Aaron Eckhart and Charlton Heston. Tedious little parts. Charlton Heston was probably only in it because they used some clips from Ben Hur, again unnecessary and unrelated. And then not to mention Ann-Margret. Was it really necessary to put her in this film at all? And certainly not as a drunk, possibly with dementia. As an overall result this film is a sickening insult to the viewer as well. A lot of promises, no delivery.<br/><br/>You are mad about American Football? Love MTV? Go see this movie. You like to watch a good film? Ignore this one. You expect an Oliver Stone film? Not this one, not Any Given Sunday."

","From the previews this movie looked like it deserved a look, but after sitting there for nearly three greuling hours, I can safely say, save your money. There is no plot, or if there was one is was thinly disguised in a series of bad scenes. The only thing that could have saved this movie was some great football scenes, but those too were very bad, due to the camera work. I had no idea what was going on when they were on the field. There was a funny moment here and there, with one of the funniest being LL Cool J's line as seen in the previews. Take you money, and stay away from this movie. Don't even bother to rent it once it comes out on video. If I could, I would give it a zero out of ten, but the lowest you can give it is a one, so I give it a one out of ten."
"bkoganbing","8","10","21","19 April 2006"," The Business of Sports
","When Oliver Stone isn't flaunting wild conspiracy theories, he actually gets down to the business of making some really good films. And Any Given Sunday is definitely one of those.<br/><br/>It's a difficult perspective for me to write about this movie as my favorite spectator sport is baseball rather than football. But the business end of it is virtually the same. Curiously enough I was in Miami last week and saw the Florida Marlins home opener. They are going through some of the same dealings with the Miami city fathers about a new stadium that you see Cameron Diaz having with Clifton Davis in this film. There's a possibility that Miami will not have its major league baseball franchise soon.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is the young owner of the Miami Sharks professional football team who inherited it from her late father who is described as one of the prominent owners in the sport, a kind of combination of Wellington Mara and George Halas. Her father gave Coach Al Pacino complete latitude to deal with his players, but Cameron is taking George Steinbrenner as her role model.<br/><br/>Al Pacino joins the ranks of players who have done outstanding portrayals of athletic coaches. It's an honorable tradition going back to Pat O'Brien as Knute Rockne. I'm not sure how Rockne would have done in the era of seven figure salaries, but Pacino is adapting the best way he can.<br/><br/>When I was a kid in NYC in the fifties following our three major league baseball teams, one of the great constants was Casey Stengel winning that American League pennant for the New York Yankees with Yogi Berra behind the plate. The catcher's job is similar to the quarterback's in football in that he sees the whole game and actually sets the pace in calling the pitches. As Yogi's skills deteriorated over time, Casey could never quite pull the plug on him as the regular catcher. As a result, Elston Howard who would have been a regular on any other team never amassed the statistics that probably would have put him in the Hall of Fame.<br/><br/>Pacino has that kind of dilemma here. A veteran quarterback in Dennis Quaid and an up and coming talent in Jamie Fox. Quaid's skills are deteriorating, but he has the heart of a warrior which Pacino tells him in my favorite moment in the film. And the lesson Fox learns from Pacino and Quaid is that if the team doesn't respect you, you don't lead winners. And winning is the bottom line. <br/><br/>There are a whole lot of good performances here in minor roles, the hallmark of a great film. James Woods as the slimy team doctor, Ann-Margret as Cameron Diaz's mother, LL Cool J as a defensive lineman who may have taken one hit too many. And what a casting coup Oliver Stone pulled off in getting Charlton Heston for a small role as the football commissioner. Who better to run professional football than the guy who brought the Ten Commandments down from Mount Sinai.<br/><br/>I think even non-sports fans can appreciate this film."
"pluto-11","4","6","11","1 August 2003"," Stinks
","When I saw ""Platoon"", I was blown away - I thought, wow, I'll go see anything this guy puts out. ""Wall Street"" was also pretty good. Then I saw ""JFK"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" and, well, I can pass up an Oliver Stone movie now. I finally got round to seeing this one, ""Any Given Sunday"" and now I just want to avoid ol' Olly.<br/><br/>Personally, a little bit of hand hold, jumpy, ""realistic"" camera work will go a *long*, *long* way with me. It takes me out of the film and just annoys me generally. Admittedly, a sports film will have a certain amount of this - but do we have to see it off the field as well? I don't see how this makes any artistic statement, it is just exhausting. This film is non stop jumpy short cut camera and editing work which just gives me a headache. It is possible there was a good story there before it was given this sound bite short cut treatment -  though it is possible there was never a good story there. I'll never know, I'll never watch it again to try and pick it up. Was this a truly cynical attempt by Stone to appeal to our supposedly short attention span?<br/><br/>Anyway, I'm almost totally cured of Stonecraft. Hopefully his upcoming film about Alexander the Great (""Alexander"") will remind us all that the director of ""Platoon"" has returned and the director of ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Any Given Sunday"" has retired. I'm going to read reviews carefully before I put any money down to watch ""Alexander"", but hope springs eternal. I love historical drama and this subject area hasn't been covered in film before to my certain knowledge, so I hope Mr. Stone has returned to his talented roots and makes his new film from the heart, as he did for his Vietnam movies."

Jamie Fox and Al Pacino had some very powerful scenes together, and being a huge Football fan, I was highly pleased with this film, plus it even has a cameo from that idiot Terrell Owens!. Oliver Stone put out another fantastic film here in my opinion, and never in my life have I seen, such violent football! plus it's extremely well made and written as well. I saw the Directors cut version, and I can't see why so many people dislike it, sure it's a little over long, but never is it boring! plus I loved how it wasn't afraid to go over the line either!. You want a top notch football movie??, look no further then this one, it's wonderfully acted,with exciting football action, and I say Go see it now!. The Direction is fantastic!.

The Acting is wonderful!. Al Pacino is amazing as always and is amazing here, he is extremely likable, very intense, delivered some great lines as always, was fascinating to watch, was really into his role, carried the film at times, and had some wonderful scenes with both Fox and Diaz,he was amazing. (Pacino Rules!!!!!!!). Cameron Diaz is stunningly gorgeous and actually does an amazing job here, she goes toe to toe with Pacino in heated arguments, which is pretty damn impressive if you ask me, this proves she really can act when she wants too, I loved her performance. Jamie Foxx is surprisingly fantastic here, and uses his cockiness to his advantage, he is very unlikable at the start, but turns out to be not a bad guy after all,, he gave a fantastic performance. Dennis Quaid is really good here as the QB Jack Rooney, I dug his character, and he was quite likable. James Woods is OK here but didn't have much to do as the Doc and was kind of wasted. LL Cool J is pretty good here, and as I said before I think he is a good actor. Lawrence Taylor is actually good here too!, I was really surprised. Jim Brown is OK in his small role, and did what he had to adequately, he is one of the best RB's of all time though!. Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers),Bill Bellamy(Jimmy Sanderson),Andrew Bryniarski(""Madman Kelly""),Lauren Holly(Cindy Rooney),Ann-Margret(Margaret Pagniacci),Elizabeth Berkley(Mandy Murphy),Charlton Heston(Commisoner.),John C.

Okay, an old, tired football coach (Pacino) is coaching a team of worthless thugs.  Their owner (Diaz) is a major b****.  She wants the team to win and they gradually do get better.  Wow!  I can't wait for Oscar night!  During the climax of the film, after being in the theater for over 2 1/2 hours, I found myself praying that the team would not win the final game.  I was afraid if they won we would then be dragged to the Super Bowl with them!  Oliver Stone was way out of his league on this one.  I wonder if he is even a football fan at all.  Picture the same type of camera shots as in his epic U-turn and add some bone-crushing football and a bunch of immoral players and you'll have Any Given Sunday.  If you go see this film, take some aspirin before you go in.  You will get a headache from all the fighting and yelling and cursing!  I'm not sure I've ever seen a film with such horrible language.

"daveisit","4","6","13","23 January 2001"," The Movie Like The Sport Is Just Too Slow...
","It wasn't a great flick, but you can not blame Oliver Stone entirely for this. It's the game called Gridiron or American Football. Unless you're brought up on it, it can be very hard to enjoy. It seems after five to ten seconds of play you need to have another two minutes break of play. If the movie was a little more condensed then the action and story could have moved at a more interesting pace. The movie simply did not have enough story to stretch out for this long.<br/><br/>In the end, in an appropriate irony, like the game of American football, the movie was just too stop start and drawn out. The sport and the movie could do with a little more continuity. Soccer has the continuity, although none of the toughness, and way too much rolling around in fake pain. Perhaps Australian Football or Gaelic Football could be a guide to the speed a tough game of football can be played. However, Oliver Stone is too good a director not to bounce back."

Cool J.  Those who were actors were good, just not in this movie.  Al Pacino and James Woods are definitely capable of doing better performances, however<br/><br/>I would partially put that on the writers, for lack of an easy script with which to show emotion.<br/><br/>the major redeeming qualities, I can say, are the cinematography.  Not great, but decent.  Lord knows its hard to show what exactly what's going on during a football game when you're not actually there, but they do it quite well.  the second is not necessarily a quality, but the pep talk   at halftime during the last game was... inspiring.<br/><br/>overall, not a good movie by any means.   ** out of 10"
"stalag9","10","3","5","27 December 1999"," Ready for some football?
","Being a long-time resident of south Florida, I found the story of this most excellent movie familiar.  Stone surely must have based the QB (Randy Quaid in one of his best roles ever)on the aging Dan Marino of the Miami Dolphins. Whatever his inspiration, Mr. Stone has done a wonderful job (again). This exposé of Football, as it were, is craftily and beautifully executed.<br/><br/>You feel what it must feel like to be on the field on any given Sunday: the utter confusion, the terror of knowing that three 250 pound line-men are rushing at top speed to take you down, the need to concentrate beyond your overpowering fatigue, the constant ebb and flow of confidence as you line-up against your opponents.  All of these components of the gridiron has been captured in a captivating manner by the great Stone, who, as usual in his movies, has a small part.  There isn't a single actor I can fault.  Nigh perfect casting followed nigh perfect performances.<br/><br/>The potential for a confusion is neatly and simply averted; the flow of the movie, in spite of Stone's signature cutaways, is logical so you don't feel overwhelmed by the action.  The behind-the-scenes look at Football management is not only enlightening but thought-provoking.  Al Pacino is excellent and so is Cameron Diaz.  Their scenes together are fraught with tension.  Lawrence Taylor, Jim Brown and some of Football's greatest players and coaches lend even more credence to the ""Footballity"" of this movie. You also get to see how this game affects the families and friends of the players, for good or usually, for bad.<br/><br/>I love this movie and think it is the best Football movie of the century."

Oliver Stone takes you straight into the action, and it never lets up. When I caught the trailer before Three Kings, I knew this was the movie to see. The best thing about this movie is Al Pacino, who uses all his bravura to bring to life a role that was tailor made for his over the top excitement. Any Given Sunday is the movie all football fans have been waiting for.  The only thing that bugs me is that it didn't use NFL teams, which I had earlier heard were going to be involved.

I presume the terrible editing was supposed to contribute to the concept behind the film, but it just doesn't. It is full of irrelevant cutaways that you have to see to believe.

Pacino commanded his character with the passion that only he can (see Scent of a Woman and you'll know what I'm talking about), and the rest of the cast - including many actors new to dramatic roles such as Jamie Foxx - also gave excellent performances. If there was a Best Cast category at the Oscars, these actors would certainly win the golden statuette.<br/><br/>

They try the usual a few seconds remaining to get the winning points scenarios, but it falls flat and you find yourself not even caring.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx plays a decent enough role as the young cocky quarterback who wants to do things his own way and is more interested in money and fame than being a team player but the story is boring, the movie is boring and for such a great cast it is criminal that this movie ended up like it did."

","Any Given Sunday is directed by Oliver Stone and Stone co-writes the screenplay with Daniel Pyne and John Logan. It stars Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart and Jim Brown. Music is by Richard Horowitz and Paul Kelly and cinematography by Salvatore Totino.<br/><br/>A star quarterback gets knocked out of the game and an unknown third stringer is called in to replace him. The unknown gives a stunning performance and forces the aging coach to re-evaluate his game plans and his life. A new female co-owner/president adds to the pressure of the team winning. The new owner must prove her self in a male dominated world while old coach and old quarterback equally have much to prove...<br/><br/>Stone, the perennial poo stirrer that he is, shifted gear this time around to bring us his take on the brutal world on and off the pitch of American Gridiron. Though without doubt this is far too long in run time (2hrs 40), given that it isn't actually multifaceted in characterisation terms (Diaz underwritten), there's no denying that visually this finds Stone at his best. The quickfire editing might not be to everyone's taste, but it really puts you right in every play out there on the field. So much so you can hear and feel every spit, vomit, blood spill and vociferous grunt.<br/><br/>No faults in the acting performances either, with Pacino thankfully doing his thing and Foxx superb as egotist QB Willie Beamen taking the honours and holding court. The narrative strains to make a point about the roles of black and whites in the game, and this being Stone there is no ""stone"" (sorry) left unturned into behaviour of the game's stars behind the scenes. Is this a movie none American Football fans can enjoy?, yes of course if one is interested in the various skill strands of the art, but really it's one for fans of the sport to see and feel the harsh realities of the game back in the previous decades. 8/10"

","Sports films rarely come off on screen. Hollywood seems to struggle with sports films, boxing is the rare exception in the genre.<br/><br/>Most Sports films follow a standard set-up, and this one mostly fits that bill. The main aspect to this film is that really, its a warts and all look at the American Football setup focussing on one club, the fictitious Miami Sharks. However, really it follows the same pattern: begins with a loss, a dysfunctional team with star player at loggerhead with the coach, but they get it all together to win at the end.<br/><br/>This is quite a dark look at the underbelly of the sport (Oliver Stone is directing it). Every character is unlikeable really. Cameron Diaz is the owner of the franchise and is greedy and unsympathetic. All the other female characters are treated cheaply in this, which is a little uncomfortable. Jamie Foxx is the vain star player and Al Pacino is the head coach. Their acting is good but really I couldn't empathise with them. All the other characters are really just, well, horrid and self-serving even to the extent it is not in the personal interest of those they are to serve!<br/><br/>I love sport, but this doesn't work for me. Couldn't like anybody in this film, and despite what this film says, there are plenty of good people throughout sport who deserve to be seen in a better sight than this film is giving. This film discredits too many, but I can't deny how low things can be in sport. With so much money in certain games it's no wonder.<br/><br/>Anyhow, back to this film. Nothing great, but some good dialogue and thumping speeches. Doesn't tell you anything you didn't already know. I'd just go for the drinks whilst this conversion is looking to be taken. Not for me."

","Oliver Stone would have you believe that his Any Given Sunday is the most realistic film depiction of professional football, both on and off the field. On the field Stone does capture much of the excitement and passion which makes people love the sport. He also is probably reasonably accurate with much of his depiction of the off-field excesses of our modern-day gladiators. But both on and off the field he probably goes a little too far. He pushed it a little beyond the point of realism and believability. Modern professional football is a grand spectacle but perhaps Stone made it just a little too grand for this movie's good.<br/><br/>With Stone laying bare some brutal truths the NFL was never going to have anything to do with this movie. So the story follows the fictional Miami Sharks of the fictional AFFA. Their veteran coach Tony D'Amato has had a distinguished career but has the game passed him by? The team's owner certainly thinks so. Oh, by the way that owner, Christina Pagniacci, is played by Cameron Diaz. Cameron Diaz owns a football team? OK then. Well, it turns out daddy died and left his daughter the team. And Christina is no shrinking violet. She is driven and determined. Which is a nice way of saying she's a bitch. When she isn't making her coach's life miserable she's trying to blackmail Miami's mayor for a new stadium. She thinks she's in control but does anyone really respect her? The answer to that question may well disappoint her. Meanwhile his raving shrew of an owner is far from Tony's only problem. In the first game we see the Sharks lose their star veteran quarterback to injury. And then lose his backup. Enter Willie Beamen. And all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>In no time at all Beamen goes from anonymous third-string quarterback to superstar. Really, I mean no time at all. Sorry Mr. Stone but I don't care how well you play you don't go from complete unknown to having your own rap video and your picture on the side of every bus in town in two weeks. Just one clear instance of the movie not really ringing true. Anyhow, Beamen's winning games and exciting fans but he's driving his coach and teammates nuts. He ignores the coach, makes up his own plays, does it all his way. And despite his success he ends up tearing his team apart. The coach sees this happening and tries to rein Beamen in but it's a futile effort. Especially when the owner doesn't back the coach. The Sharks are now winning games but there's conflict all over the place. Everyone's got their own agenda. The owner, the coach, the players, the doctors, everyone's pulling in their own direction. This seems destined for a spectacular blowup.<br/><br/>Stone has a great ensemble cast but there are two roles clearly more important than the rest. The movie is at its heart about two men, Coach Tony D'Amato and ""Steamin"" Willie Beamen. Al Pacino plays the coach and is as good as you would expect. A little over the top in some moments but the whole movie goes a little over the top in many moments. And Pacino is very good in the quieter moments such as heart-to-hearts with his two quarterbacks, the aging star and the young hotshot. Speaking of that young hotshot Jamie Foxx plays Beamen and captures all the character's excesses wonderfully while also conveying the hurt and frustration of a guy who never felt he was given a fair shot in football or in life. It's Pacino and Foxx who really have to carry the movie and they do a very good job of it. But they have plenty of support. Diaz is surprisingly effective in a role which certainly does not seem tailor-made for her. Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret...the list goes on and on. Notable performers who all add something to the film. There's also room for real-life football stars. Jim Brown we already knew could act. Lawrence Taylor is a pleasant surprise. He plays an old, broken-down linebacker facing the end of his career and his own personal demons. So basically, LT's playing himself. And he handles that very well.<br/><br/>So the cast is generally excellent and the story's entertaining enough so why is there the nagging sense that the movie's not quite as good as it could have been? One problem is the football action. Stone takes you right onto the field, capturing the sound and fury. But he goes too far. Realism takes a back seat as we're presented with a lot of rather cartoonish football, guys doing full-twisting double somersaults into the end zone and such. The game is exciting enough as is, Stone didn't need to crank it up past the point of truth. And a lot of the off the field stuff goes a little too far as well. There's a lot of craziness and excess. Our on-field warriors are wild men off the field. A little too wild at times to take the movie seriously. And then there's the central plot point, Beamen's rise to instant superstardom. The media makes stars quickly but not that quickly. It's just not really believable. Coach D'Amato tells us football is a game of grabbing that last inch. Any Given Sunday comes close but when we stretch out the chains it comes up just that inch short."

The movie is wrought with too many music-videos and shallow characters to whom we cannot relate. If Stone wanted to make ""Rudy part II"" he should have concentrated more on the characters, and if he was looking for ""MTV does the NFL"" he shouldn't have wasted our time even introducing half of the characters. But he ends up in the middle here, with a mish-mash of football-music-videos and underdeveloped characters who have mysterious and quick attitude changes just in time to win a playoff game. The greatest let-down is that the great rebel Oliver Stone sells out and gives us a Rudy ending, without making us care for anyone like we cared about Rudy.

"JimPills","Null","1","1","1 January 2000"," Vince Lombardi's not turning over in his grave, but he's got a hell of a headache
","Oliver Stone is a director who presents me with tremendous difficulties.  I think that when he is at his best, he's better than just about anyone around (see ""Nixon"" or ""JFK"", for my money two of the best historical films ever made in Hollywood), but when he's not at 100 percent, he's just about the worst filmmaker out there (see ""The Doors""...if you dare).  ""Any Given Sunday"", his new football epic, falls squarely in the middle.<br/><br/>The screenplay, by John Logan and Stone, is really not worth too much comment.  It's pretty much an overstuffed pile-up of sports-movie cliches, including the iron-willed coach, the headstrong kid who makes good on the field, the battered old veteran, the dimwitted muscleman, and the cold-hearted front-office suit (though a touch of novelty is added here by having the suit played by Cameron Diaz, looking better than ever). <br/><br/>
Still, from these raw materials, you could craft a pretty decent film if you handled it properly, and Stone really doesn't.  The opening football-game sequence is a good indicator of the method of the entire film.  Incoherent editing, show-offy angles, and a soundtrack that is so swamped with bone-crunching noise and over-the-top musical mayhem that the dialogue often becomes impossible to comprehend.  I found myself straining forward to get an earful (it probably wasn't worth it; the dialogue is nothing to write home about).  In the past, this has seemed like an innovative and interesting style.  Here, it gets in the way of Stone's story and just comes off as a lack of discipline.<br/><br/>Still, I recommend seeing the film at least once, largely due to the strength of its acting.  Al Pacino does a credible job as the team's beleagured veteran coach, and he has some good rip-snorting battles with Diaz.  Jamie Foxx wipes away all memories of ""In Living Color"" with a firecracker performance as the third-stringer whose time in the limelight swells his head.  Also good are John C. McGinley as a loudmouth sports reporter (obviously modeled on Jim Rome) and James Woods as the team's cynical doctor who's willing to let players go out there hurt as  long as it keeps him in money and cheerleaders.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think ""Any Given Sunday"" will appeal more to people with little knowledge of how football actually works than to aficionados of the game.  The film has almost nothing in the way of real sports strategy or tactics, but it does a decent job of capturing the visceral, brutal qualities of the game, and lends some credence to Stone's equation of football with war, and of its players with gladiators (it even goes as far as to cast Ben-Hur himself, Charlton Heston, as the football commissioner).<br/><br/>See the film, and draw your own conclusions."

","I really like Oliver Stone's movies and I have nothing against football, but this movie didn't really work for me. It was so loud and so frenetic, yet it didn't really hide that there was nothing much going on except the usual sports-movie hijinks. I expect more of Oliver Stone, and he usually delivers. The characters aren't sympathetic, but at the same time you can't really hate them. Yeah, they're all self-centered, but you can hardly blame them for trying to keep their own butts covered, given the people they're surrounded by. 'Sharks' was a fitting team name here. If this movie has a point, it's simply a portrait of the thirst for money and power that abounds in pro sports. That's what all of these characters are after, one way or another. Even the characters that should be likable- like Dennis Quaid's- come off as desperate and greedy. I suppose Al Pacino's character was supposed to be 'our hero'- after all, are old, white, male football coaches ever supposed to be anything but noble?- but I found him a good deal more distasteful even that the characters played by Cameron Diaz and Jamie Foxx, both of whom I suspect I was supposed to dislike, either a lot- Christina- or a little- Willie. She, supposedly, would 'eat her young' for being a tough team-owner trying to make her franchise work, and he's a jerk for trying to look after himself in a world that certainly isn't going to look after him on his behalf. On the positive side of things, the performances- one and all- were terrific. This was really a good ensemble cast, and they all seemed to have latched onto their characters and realized that the selfishness inherent in every one of them is both loathsome and understandable. I give praise to the actors and the realistic portrayal of pro-football injuries, stress, and excess, but this movie quite simply collapses under the weight of it's own artifice. It's a heavy, slick veneer over a shell of a film that is, essentially, empty."

"PhilipVier","3","3","6","11 August 2014"," Terribly directed rubbish
","Any Given Sunday was a film I had wanted to watch for some time. I knew it had Al Pacino in it who supposedly gives a great speech, and there were other actors in it who are capable of great things. The fact that Oliver Stone directed it led me to believe it would be good film. Unfortunately, while watching this it soon became clear that this was an abysmal film with extremely poor directing.<br/><br/>The film starts with a nauseatingly filmed American Football match in which a lot of things happen, but few are explained properly. Now I don't know anything about American Football, but in a good film you can usually follow what's going on. In Any Given Sunday you might as well ask a cat what's happening. Unfortunately, this goes on for the rest of the film. Important characters just come along without a proper introduction and we never learn anything substantial about them. Because of this I quickly lost interest for every character, and nothing they did or said mattered to me.<br/><br/>A confusing, bland story is bad enough in itself, but this also means that great actors are wasted. The film stars Al Pacino Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, James Woods and Cameron Diaz. In my opinion every one of these actors are capable of good performances. But throughout the film only Pacino, Foxx and Diaz are able to make something out of it. The rest of the actors add little to the quality of this picture. Dennis Quaid is boring and unconvincing as the only sane football player in the film. We hardly learn anything about him even though he's an important character. James Woods plays a doctor who acts like he's straight out of a parody. And the rest of the football team look and act like rappers and professional wrestlers.<br/><br/>Now I don't think the actors are to blame because the directing is absolutely terrible. It's hard to believe this was made by a capable director, never mind an Academy Award winner like Oliver Stone. Most of the film looks more like a rap video or a very poor episode of CSI Miami than an actual film. In some scenes you suddenly get pointless shots of the city or clouds or even Ben-Hur. I also wondered about the casting. The film has its fair share of people with limited acting skills, some of them even play main characters like LL Cool J. I also read Oliver Stone wanted P. Diddy for the character that Jamie Foxx played. This really amazes me, I mean why would a great director like Oliver Stone want to work with talentless artists who can't act to save their lives? When the film was finished I could not believe Oliver Stone directed this. It was more like watching a cheap advert or a music video. The opening sequence of The Last Boy Scout was a better American football film than this. What on earth went wrong? Was Oliver Stone on drugs? Did he do this for a bet? I suppose some of the actors are decent, and the story starts to pick up near the end. But that's it, there's nothing else. I would have never expected something like this from Oliver Stone, and I hope I never have to see something like it again."

","I both played and coached football and have been around the game for 30 years. On an entertainment level, Any Given Sunday is somewhat effective, but the comments from people lauding this movie's ""realism"" are laughable. Any Given Sunday is anything but realistic and is instead marred by questionable casting, over the top performances and an uneven script. AGS doesn't quite know what it wants to be: it touches on some relevant areas of the game including risking health for money, the business side of football and the importance of the team concept, but ultimately the movie isn't effective because the viewer fails to take a personal interest in many of these guys. They are instead merely cardboard characters used to advance the plot. What results is a disjointed, uneven film with more misses than hits.<br/><br/>The plot is simple enough. Veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) has been successful for most of his 30 year run. However, his team falls on hard times and questions arise about his ability to lead. When his veteran QB gets hurt, untested backup Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) steps into the breach and starts to win. He lets success go to his head, however, and quickly alienates his teammates with a selfish, me-first attitude. Eventually, he realizes he must lead by example and not just through physical play. Beamen redeems himself and saves his season.<br/><br/>Despite a host of name actors involved with Any Given Sunday, it is not well cast. I absolutely love Al Pacino- a truly great actor with scores of awards (including an Oscar) for validation, but he does NOT make a convincing football coach. Compare his role for instance with that of James Gammon as manager Lou Brown in the lightweight comedy Major League. Gammon looks, acts and speaks like a grizzled managerial veteran- a GREAT job of casting. Only Pacino's tremendous skills as an actor prevent this from being a disaster. Ironically, the unquestioned best scene in the movie is Pacino's locker room speech, an inspiring, passionate speech touching on the virtues of self-reflection and togetherness- it elicits both a tear from the eye and a fire from within. Unfortunately, this is the exception.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz, despite being a qualified actress, is not convincing as the owner of a professional sports franchise and strains credibility. It's revealed that she inherited the team from her football-minded father, but it plays flat. Many of the football stars are caricatures; when ex-Giant great Lawrence Taylor looks like Sir Laurence Olivier compared to some of these clowns, you know there's a problem. And perhaps the worst performance of all belongs to John C. McGinley who hams it up and evokes images of a crazed Jim Rome as a slimy sports talk show host.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is completely out of his element with Any Given Sunday. And any movie with Al Pacino, Charlton Heston, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Jim Brown, Cameron Diaz, James Karen and a host of other A-list performers should've been a helluva lot better."

Meanwhile the b**chy owner is having her only human moment of the movie, making me wonder if the writers had heard of character development, or if those parts got left on the cutting room floor to shoehorn the movie into 2 1/2 hours.<br/><br/>And the guy's eyeball getting knocked out? Whose idea was that? I'm guessing the SFX guy always wanted to do that scene and talked Oliver Stone into it. Completely unnecessary.<br/><br/>The acting was good, though I couldn't tell if Pacino was skillfully playing a tired old coach or if he is just a tired old actor. Diaz was not in her typical role, which means I didn't even recognize her at first. James Woods's character, the team doctor, actually had depth, and he was fun to watch. I wish the movie had been about him. All the football players, including Jamie Foxx, were forgettable, except for the big dude who worshiped Metallica and loosed his pet alligator into the locker room showers. Rare moment of laugh-out-loud fun in the movie.<br/><br/>Many many roll-the-eyes moments. In the middle of his prayer, the team chaplain says, ""there are no atheists in foxholes!"" Complete non sequitur, he wasn't in the middle of a war analogy or trying to win over the doubters on the team. The line was just crammed in. Sign of a lack of writing creativity. Likewise, various characters had to trot out the ""any given Sunday"" line over and over, making the title un-subtle to the point of ridiculousness. Oh, and the team names that the intern at the production company came up with were distracting. The Knights, with a big cross on their jersey? The Crusaders? Oh, wait, more in-your-face metaphors, got it.<br/><br/>Bottom line, probably not the worst sports movie ever but I would never recommend anyone see it. 180 wasted minutes, minus the few on-the-field scenes that were exciting, but you might as well just watch a real football game."
"rusty.gaynes","10","3","6","30 December 1999"," Oliver Stone style editing
","Why must we hear of MTV style editing every time Oliver Stone releases a picture?  Roger Ebert is even guilty.  Why don't we hear of Oliver Stone style editing on MTV?  That would seem more appropriate.  If this editing style is in the way of ones moviegoing experience, then don't watch!  And don't badmouth Stone because you fail to see what he is trying to accomplish.  Since when does a visually interesting movie get scorned because of it's style?  This is absurd.  The fast pased editing does no less than allow Stone to fit more into the allotted timeframe than any other director.  Why do his characters seem more real than anyone else's?  Why do Stone's actors seem to be one notch better than the same actor in someone else's film?  Because of his style.  It allows for multiple layers of story and character.<br/><br/>Now, on to Any Given Sunday, yet another triumph in the illustrious career of Mr. Stone.  To some, the football action done in closeup may be bothersome.  These folks would rather see a Fox broadcast with John Madden blithering incoherently and drawing all over the screen with his telestrator.  Well, we don't get that here, and I'm glad.  What we get, is football action from inside the huddle, the line of scrimmage, from inside a helmet being bounced around by 300 pound men.  This film is not about strategy, it is about brutality, physical brutality in terms of the players, and mental brutality in terms of Tony (Al Pacino).  We see the effects of the physical brutality on an aging quarterback, and the emotional, and mental effects on the coach, Pacino.  What we also have, is the brutality of greed.  Ah, there it is.  The famous Stone allegory.  We all know that Stone's films are not about the chosen subject, they are about something larger.  They are about America, about morality, about the media, about film itself.  This one is at its heart about bloodlust, for money, the bottom line.  It all traces back to the almighty dollar in this one.<br/><br/>
I saw a review posted on here stating something to the effect that this is also about age.  A very perceptive idea.  Stone, as an aging filmmaker, Pacino as an aging actor, it's all about age, about rekindling a love for ones art, Pacino's coach, and ultimately about Stone finding the fire within once again.<br/><br/>I beleive that Stone was very emotionally hurt by the box office draw (or lack thereof) for Nixon.  One of the great epics of all time in my opinion. Here is a film that is half Citizen Kane, and half Godfather, and is succesful at this blend.  Incredible.  It's too bad he was scoffed at because he is inherently so polictical.  It's sad that this great work has been overlooked.  If you haven't given it a try, do so, you will not be sorry.  The first half up until the Republican convention of 1968 is the most masterful piece of directing of all time.  Believe me, it's that good. And what more can you ask from Anthony Hopkins?  Here is a man who CLEARLY does not look one bit like Richard Nixon, but makes one forget by the end what Nixon looked like.  Truly one of the most masterful performances ever by an actor.<br/><br/>I digress, I am obviously a huge fan of Stone, so big a fan that I even forgave him for U-Turn, and eventually learned to like it.  I just hate these critics and nay-sayers who can't get past  his style to see what substance lies within."

The movie made you feel as if you were on the field with the players, absorbing the hits and living the highs and lows off the field.

","First I need to admit that I'm a big fan of Oliver Stone's movies. (although I didn't like ""Natural Born Killers""). Stone has always been extremely accurate, realistic and impressive in his way to describe the American society in his movies. ""Any Given Sunday"" describes the world of professional sport where money and power is taking over tradition and team spirit. Al Pacino is simply great in this movie. He plays coach Tony D'Amato who has to deal with a declining starting quarterback (Dennis Quaid), a rising star (Jamie Foxx), a selfish player (LL Cool J) and a team owner (Cameron Diaz) trying to sell the team. The rest of the cast is also very good with stars like James Wood and Charlton Heston. Other supporting roles include actors who played in Stone's previous movies, James Karen (Wall Street) and John C. McGinley (Wall Street and Platoon). The soundtrack is also excellent and add more emotions to the movie. Although a few scenes could have been deleted without impacting the movie too much, you never get a chance to get bored. Pacino's speeches to players scenes are magnificent and full of emotion. I strongly recommend this movie even if you are not a football fan."

Oliver Stone's brillance comes out in every aspect of this movie. Stone brings together a superb cast along with a great plot to create an accurate protrayal of on the field and off the field actions of not only football players but the coaches and management. A definite highlight of the movie was LL Cool J character of Julian Washington. LL Cool J gave an outstanding performance and his true acting ability was able to shine. Jamie Fox was able to show his versility as an actor by playing the role of a no name third string quarterback who suddenly comes to fame after the injury to the other quarterbacks.

"acillatem54","10","2","4","29 June 2001"," Best football movie ever, period.
","This movie is great, but it's not for everyone.  Only those who know football or have at least half a brain would like it.  Oliver Stone takes American Football and shows his audience every minute aspect of the game, and yes, it takes a while, but the outcome is nothing less than perfection. Every scene of the movie adds more to the overall picture Stone portrays.<br/><br/>
The movie is about people struggling, plain and simple.  Tony D'Amato struggles to keep his job and to keep his team of overpriced athletes from falling apart.  Willie Beamen struggles to win games his way, not trusting those around him who he feels have hurt him in the past.  And Cap Rooney struggles with a game that chewed him up, spit him out, and passed him by. The best scene in the whole movie is the confrontation between Beamen and D'Amato, the ultimate conflict between old school and new school football. It shows how the greatest players the game has ever seen sacrificed their bodies, their loved ones, and sometimes their minds to a game that gives most people very little in return.  Also, we see how players today consider losing money the greatest sacrifice of all.<br/><br/>However, in order to like the movie, you have to go further than skin deep into it.  Yes, the action scenes speed up and slow down, and seem to have no direction in them. But if you've ever played real football (high school football doesn't count here), you feel right at home in the action scenes. Things happen seemingly at random, players come out of nowhere, yet there is an incredible order and logic to it all.  If you pay attention (I know that's a lot to ask) you'll find that as the movie progresses and Willie Beamen gets acclimated to the game, the football scenes slow down, although they remain chaotic.<br/><br/>The movie is loud, brutal and honest.  No, it's not the polished product that you see on Sundays.  But Stone doesn't need to polish it because that's all we know.  He breaks it down and shows the game to us naked.  Players argue in the huddle and fight in the locker room.  And all the ""unrealistic"" scenes - the alligator in the shower, a car cut in half, etc. - they all actually happened at one point or another among NFL players.  And players do come from nowhere to make it big - can anyone say Jay Fiedler?<br/><br/>
All in all, I wanted more after the movie was over, even after well over two hours of movie time.  Excellent flick - 10/10"

It is a very realistic view of football, wrapped up into a pleasant story. All of the characters are exactly what you see in pro sports today, and the actors do a great job of portraying it. Standouts would be Pacino, as he always is, and surprisingly Foxx, who stole the show. Besides the acting, the gameplay scenes were incredible. It was actually like being on the field, playing with these guys. This is really worth the rent, and in comparison to the vhs, the dvd really makes it that much better."

At times you'll be on the edge of your seat as the intensity builds and at other times you'll be sitting back in complete reverence of what these people sacrifice in giving their heart and sole to the game.<br/><br/>It WILL show you, perhaps remind you if you've forgotten, what it is to be alive.<br/><br/>I hope you enjoy it as much as I did."

Any Given Sunday<br/><br/>
Directed by: Oliver Stone, 1999<br/><br/>
Simultaneously epic and earthy, Any Given Sunday is an astonishingly well-grounded drama given its premise.<br/><br/>
Despite sticking to formula (one final game to determine everything) and dropping a few characters on the floor (Ann Margret as the alcoholic mother), Oliver Stone's Any Given Sunday is fresh, energetic and skilfully crafted entertainment.<br/><br/>
Stone dazzles with trademark flurried cinematography, but he also wisely fleshes out interesting and reflective characters in this no-holds-barred depiction of how pro sports has become strictly about the corporate dollar.<br/><br/>
For football fans there's plenty to get excited about; Stone has made it clear that it's as much a work of ambivalent love as a homage to such classic football movies like Robert Aldrich's The Longest Yard. <br/><br/>Renowned for his cinematography, Stone here also delivers simply astounding and crisp sound editing. He also convincingly creates his very own pro football league as the NFL declined to offer any assistance. Some of the uniforms and team names therefore seem a little silly to fans (that includes me), but there's instant and added credibility in the form of cameos by such major former NFL forces as Jim Brown, Lawrence Taylor, Warren Moon, Johnny Unitas and Dick Butkus. <br/><br/>Pushing the envelope while also staying focused on the inner workings of the game itself, Stone has once again created some amazing visual achievements. His trademark. I particularly enjoyed his ability to film from the quarterback's perspective. Something many have tried to purvey realistically but never succeeded in until now. <br/><br/>Hard hitting both on and off the field, Any Given Sunday is a showcase for some unmitigated brilliant performances by standouts Al Pacino (as the head coach) and Cameron Diaz (as the team owner). Also by a wide range of normally unappreciated American actors: James Woods finds just the right pose as the sleazy and suspect team physician, Aaron Eckhart is fittingly subtle as the talented offensive co-ordinator who lacks his coach's trust, Jamie Foxx is poignant as the rookie quarterback and rapper turned actor LL Cool J is believable and bittersweet as the star running back. <br/><br/>However; the culminating treat is Dennis Quaid, picking up the pieces from where he dropped them in Taylor Hackford's Everybody's All American back in 1988, continuing his likeable rendition of an estranged yet proud and honourable star quarterback past his prime.<br/><br/>
`This game,' the thoughtful yet tormented head coach Tony D' Amato says to his rookie quarterback, 'this game has got to be about more than winning or losing.' <br/><br/>This kind of talk is cheap, sure, and we've heard it all before. But when delivered by Al Pacino  in an intoxicating performance that ranks among his most convincing  then these words suddenly feel like pillars to a Coliseum. And the meaning gathers new energy and purpose. The undercarriage of the movie  like the game itself  is about more than just blocking and scoring.<br/><br/>
Oliver Stone tells us the stories of contemporary people from different strata of society and how they struggle to survive within this world of pro sports where most everything is conditioned by money. A world that is morally repulsive, but built on a tough and tactical game that at heart is as pure as the driven snow. <br/><br/>As a storyteller Stone is both audacious, unconventional and frenetic and occasionally he gives way to hyperbole (the eye injury) and strutting formula (the final game). But Any Given Sunday luckily never just wallows in testosterone  it describes the game and its participants, both on and off the line of scrimmage  and it only uses its sheer velocity to get around and address issues in a refractory manner. Stone catches the mentality of the star athlete today and he pities him more than anything else.<br/><br/>
In the weeks leading up to my first viewing of Any Given Sunday I had seen a vast amount of terrific  movies (among others The Straight Story, American Beauty and Magnolia), but that couldn't shake my faith in it. Because it works so well, is such inspired technical work and so benevolent by nature. <br/><br/>Any Given Sunday takes its deserved place among Stone's best movies: Wall Street, Born on the Fourth of July and Nixon. <br/><br/>Maybe in time it'll even take its place among his very best: Platoon, JFK and Natural Born Killers."

","I admit I'm a bit biased towards Oliver Stone films since he's my favorite film maker. However, Any given Sunday was truly a perfect football film. Al Pacino was absolutely fantastic, but thats expected. For me - it was Cameron Diaz who stole the show. Powerful performance from Diaz. If she can get someone to hate her guts, then she's truly doing an amazing job ! A must-watch film for football fans, Stone fans, and for movie fans in general. A different project from Oliver Stone - 8/10."

","When you look at the cast of this film. You realize that had it been expertly directed It could have been really great. The biggest problem with the film was Stone's insistence on using frantic cinematography, and frantic editing in order to give you a sense of the intensity of the game. What it ends up doing is just giving you this rather incomprehensible mishmash. As a viewer you barely know what's going on. At any given moment, much less any given Sunday. It's a decent film considering the fact that Stone hasn't done much good work for the last two decades. It's, you know, probably up there with Alexander, an maybe Nixon in terms of decent work. It's passable entertainment, that is about as far it's about as I would go."

"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","0","18 September 2011"," As exciting as the game...
","American football coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) is a man with problems: his team have lost four games in a row and the boss (Cameron Diaz) is pressuring him into dropping his trusty old war-horse (Dennis Quaid); D'Amato's wife has left him; he's drinking too much; his team medic (James Woods) is overdosing the players on pain-killing drugs and ignoring incipient health problems which could result in (gulp) paralysis; and the one ray of hope – an unexpectedly impressive player (don't ask me his position, I'm British – he's the one who throws the ball a lot) called into service when options one and two are both crocked, is ignoring D'Amato's game plays and going his own way with not unimpressive results. <br/><br/>Possibly the most important thing I learned watching this film is that, when his attention is turned from conspiracy theories, director Oliver Stone doesn't really have a lot to say – although Pacino's character in this movie could easily be seen as a surrogate for the director's image of himself: beleaguered and misunderstood, but ultimately victorious.<br/><br/>When the film isn't deliberating over whether Coach D'Amato will buckle under the pressure it's at pains to draw romanticised parallels between the modern American footballer and gladiators/warriors of old. But by trying to idealise the players while simultaneously providing a salacious insight into their hedonistic excesses away from the pitch, the film creates a glaring contradiction that simply serves to distance the audience even further from its deified characters. <br/><br/>Stone's typically breakneck style of storytelling is really the only thing that sets it apart from what is, when stripped of its glossy veneer, an alarmingly stale and clichéd plot. How many times have we seen the ageing warhorse overcoming his self-doubts to win for the coach one last time? The player whose life is football and who is willing to risk paralysis in order to keep on playing? The morally ambiguous doctor willing to overlook the Hippocratic Oath in order to enable these 'warriors' to pursue their dream? The executive losing sight of the meaning of the game while engaged in the irksome politics of big business? Off-duty players snorting cocaine from the breasts of high-class hookers? Well, OK, we might not have witnessed the last one often (enough), but the other plot strands have been done to death a hundred times over.<br/><br/>Pacino wanders through the movie with an expression that swings like a metronome from anger to bewilderment. His choice of roles has become increasingly open to question as he grows older, but this one at least seems to suit his rugged, weary countenance. Jamie Foxx as Willie Breaman, the hotshot newcomer, is convincing enough without ever really stamping his authority on the role, but a miscast Cameron Diaz is sorely out of her depth as the owner of the Miami Sharks and becomes all but invisible in the scenes she shares with Pacino.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday isn't a bad movie, but neither is it a thing of any worth. Stone refuses to allow the camera to settle for more than a second at a time, and injects random images into intimate conversations that just don't do anything other than make you wonder why he's doing it. And in the end, you get the impression he knew only too well how weak his material was and attempted to distract us all with a display of cinematic pyrotechnics."
"topher_johnson","6","0","0","23 November 2010"," Oliver Stone's take on American Football
","Oliver Stone did his homework on this one. He dug up everything he possibly could that can be construed as negative about pro football in the USA and then exaggerated it (where possible). The money, the egos, the nepotism, the media's affect, the personality conflicts, etc, etc. Suffice it to say, he did have a lot to work with. What kept this movie from being a classic was the extreme heavy-handedness of it. Maybe it was his goal to beat us over the head with his vision of the world of pro football but it was too much for me. Most aspects deserved to be exposed without 'sugar-coating' or tactful delivery but I just can't help feeling that some of the messages could have been better delivered with subtlety, trusting the viewers intelligence to see and understand the problem without the overbearing nature of the film.<br/><br/>The cast was excellent, Pacino was as good as I've ever seen him, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, and even James Woods were all very good and casting Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown worked beautifully.<br/><br/>Like all Oliver Stone movies, it ran long but the last half hour or so might have been the best part of the movie (as it should be) so that isn't a negative aspect in this case.<br/><br/>Basically, if you know that this is an Oliver Stone dissection of pro football and you know anything about either of those topics, you know what kind of experience you're in for.<br/><br/>But that's just my two scents. ;)"

But then I decided to go for it, as I like watching sports movies, and I love Al Pacino. And I'm happy to make that decision. It's a good movie, but not the best.<br/><br/>Overall, Casting and Acting is good. But the sports scenes of the movie are handled with much carelessness. The viewer needed to watch the scenes with more concentration then they should be, and still get lost sometimes. This is a game about ball, and most of the time, you don't even know where is the ball. The movie intends to bring some emotions to the gameplay, but it fails in that as well, as we don't even know who is striking whom before it is shown that someone is hurt. Only one good scene for that, and even that did not create much emotion due to the fact that the character was not emotionally developed in the movie. We needed to have some secondary characters build, who played vital roles during the game, but there were none. Only one major character (of Jamie Foxx), and he never loses. OK! This movie is about the storyline. I can understand that. But what about the viewers who watched it for the sport? Looks like the director missed a simple point. The ones who want to watch the story drama, many of them avoid to watch the movie with Sports title, as it is not their taste. And the Sports Frenzy who will watch it, will get disappointed with the fact that there is not really interesting sport in the movie.<br/><br/>Well, 6/10. Why? Personally, I liked the movie because of the characters. The climax is indeed good and the best thing of the movie, and I really like the character of Al Pacino. Jamie Foxx overall did good, along with many other characters in the movie. Cameron Diaz also played her role well enough to create some emotion in the storyline. Though, some characters could be improved to create better emotional attachments and adjustments with the storyline. However, it is not a mistake of those actors. Script could be improved a lot as well, as the general storyline was good."

"elshikh4","6","0","0","19 February 2009"," Overdose !
","Somewhere I read that (Oliver Stone) has mixed 3 screenplays in one to make (Any Given Sunday). When you watch the movie, you must believe that as the truth. (Stone) is a knight among Hollywood directors. He fights the American system and foundations burningly and unstoppably. You have to notice his basic creed through nearly all of his works; he was fierily against the military foundation in (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July, Heaven & Earth), the political foundation, so the intelligence (JFK, Nixon), corporate raid (Wall Street), the media (Natural Born Killers), so why not to take on the sport foundation as well. However, this time, something was not bad, but too much. It was really about to be too-much-it's-bad!<br/><br/>We have a movie about a noble man against a system (values vs. money), a movie about a coach and a player (team vs. self), and a third one about a team that had to survive despite its own breakdown. (Stone) didn't want to lose any part of the big picture he was drawing, trying his best to present all the story lines, the satire, and the bitter details that he can tell about such a ""world"", however in one movie. And the result is an intensive movie, but so heavy. I had to watch it 3 times to catch on its treat in complete.<br/><br/>True that (Stone) managed to gather a lot of things by his distinct style without being adolescently manipulative or showy, but nothing can deny that the final product gives you the fatigue. There are almost 10 characters with hot drama and something to satirize also; I bet the characterization was such an exhausting job for the writers here. So sometimes you feel that this is an abbreviated TV series in strenuous 150 minutes; which feels like longer than that! Yes, the editing tried to collect the many pieces, keep the (Stone) flavor, and maintain a fast paced movie in the same time, though it's nothing but a violent long video clip in many places. Now and then, it forces you to lose any concentration you have.<br/><br/>I think it's like a cinematic novel in the frame of a movie. The sense to speak omnisciently and deeply ruined somehow the desire to be that watchable movie. Sure it delivers its very good case and commentary, but in someway forfeits its balance as a drama while the main personality of the whole thing is torn between being a simple story about how the ""team"" is more important that the ""self"", and being an epic about deadly tyrannical modern empire that makes the gladiators to kill them.<br/><br/>Unlike many movies that have similar problems, (Any Given Sunday) isn't slothful, but of course thick with a director who refuses to cut much of what he says. Till now I can't believe how (James Caviezel) and (Tom Sizemore) played roles that were eventually deleted, which means that this movie would've been something like 3 hours long already! Look at the closing credits displaying on the last 10 minutes; obviously they didn't want to make it any longer, so they put them while very serious event at the very end, which has been badly appeared because of this kind of dealing.<br/><br/>Anyway, it needs to be watched more than once to be fully understood, so to relish its own kind of enjoyment, and its real profound metaphors. (Stone) was right about so many issues here, but he wasn't right only when it came to making an engaging facile movie out of wide wild Film. He succeeded in that brilliantly before, for instance in (Wall Street). But, here, the dose gave me an impressive headache. Watch it 3 times to experience well the 3 movies that it is. 3 smart ones by the way, but weren't made entirely in just smart one."

","Starring: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid<br/><br/>Writer-director Oliver Stone leads an all-star cast to an ""insider's look"" at the world of pro football in this gridiron epic. When accomplished veteran quarterback Jack ""Cap"" Rooney (Quaid) goes down with a spinal injury, things don't look good for coach Tony D'Amato (Pacino) and his Miami Sharks. Perennial contenders for the fictitious Pantheon Cup, the Sharks have dropped their last three and are in danger of missing the playoffs. Salvation comes in the form of third-string sensation QB ""Steamin'"" Willie Beamen (Foxx), a rookie whose instant success breeds an instant ego. ""I've spent half my career sittin' on the bench,"" he says. ""I don't plan on going back."" His attitude begins to tear a rift between the team's stars (including LL Cool J as a superstar runningback who needs more yards to clinch more endorsements) -- after all, there's only one football to go around.<br/><br/>The movie goes beyond the field however, covering the sport from all angles: Owner/GM Christina Pagniacci (Diaz), sick of D'Amato's old school ideologies, sees offensive coordinator Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart) as the new face of her team, with Beamen leading the youth movement to take the Sharks back to the Cup. James Woods has a brief but memorable turn as an oily team doctor who clashes with his young assistant (Matthew Modine) over the ethics of sports medicine. John C. McGinley has a great turn as a Jim Rome-esquire journalist, with opinions so scathing that he and D'Amato actually come to blows (afterwards, in one of the movie's many brilliant moments, Tony asks flippantly, ""Where's your wheelchair?"").<br/><br/>The problem is that the movie stretches too far, and the film suffers from terrible pacing issues. Clocking in at over two and a half hours, the movie drags for the first 60mins before finally finding its feet. The initial game action seems to stretch on forever, with Stone highlighting pass after pass with generic rap music. It's a very trying first hour, but once the movie takes off, it soars. Pacino is fantastic as a man at the end of his rope and his pre-game speech about ""inches"" is stuff for the history books. Really though, this is Jamie Foxx's movie and he's phenomenal. It's surprising to me that it took five years after this film's release for him to become a star -- he does it all in this movie: he's fierce, funny, and even wrote three songs for the soundtrack.<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 7.5 = B-<br/><br/>As a football fan in Vancouver, it's amusing to spot the parallels between Beamen/Rooney and Printers/Dickenson. A few sensationalists at The Province wrote that not even Hollywood could write a better story, but Oliver Stone did. The performances in this movie are all strong, but there are too many of them. Just like the team on screen, there are too many superstars on board, and not enough screen time for all of them. Stone over-extends the film's perspective, and it leaves the film feeling very long at times. Still, when it hits, it's incredible. The chapter-search button was built for movies like this."

","""Any Given Sunday"" is a lengthy and mostly satisfactory football drama epic. It is given several strong performances by the likes of Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, and Jamie Foxx while several other familiar film and TV faces as well as popular football personalities contribute costarring or bit parts. Foxx is the main focus of the film giving a strong dramatic portrayal as a disgrutnled young quarterback who gets into frequent spats with the team's veteran coach (Al Pacino). The only sour note of an otherwise fine film is in the performance of the usually great Pacino who just isn't entirely believable as a football team coach. Don't leave it on the sidelines but there are some better (and more appropriately cast) football films of various genres out there."

"shaun98","6","0","0","15 May 2002"," Will disappoint Stone fans
","The best way for me to express my views on ""Any Given Sunday"" is to paraphrase Roger Ebert's review. Whenever I watch a film with Oliver Stone at the helm, I am acutely aware that he has a great deal to say about the subject matter, and that he is desperate to convey as much of it as possible before the credits roll. This is not the case for his most recent work, which is one of his few misfires. We never thought it could happen, but the man has actually made a film with little to say about a hot topic. He does little more than rehash ancient sports clichés, with the usual about teamwork, loyalty, and last-minute saves. We've seen it all before, often in much better movies. It's still watchable, but also shallow and empty, no matter how forcibly Stone tries to convince us of any deep meaning.<br/><br/>Stone employs his traditional cinematic flourishes; rapid editing, filters, interchanging film stocks, and so fourth, but to little avail. The final result is little more than a three-hour rock video. His films have often been accused of favoring style over substance, and for once, his critics speak correctly. ""JFK,"" ""Natural Born Killers,"" and ""Nixon"" made use of the same techniques, but with a purpose; they skillfully combined form and content, giving the films a novelistic complexity. In fact, at times it was an absolute necessity. Not here; in ""Any Given Sunday,"" it seems like an attempt to distract us from the tired plot.<br/><br/>Is the film entirely devoid of merit? No, but it's still a major letdown from a director of Stone's caliber. Nonetheless, from a strictly technical perspective, one can admire the editing and cinematography. The performances are adequate (with Diaz coming off best), and Pacino's heart-to-heart talk with Foxx, intercut with footage from ""Ben-Hur,"" is admittedly impressive. Overall, though, it's clear that the director expended a mere fraction of his creative powers upon this project. Let me end this review with another of Ebert's observations: if the film had been trimmed by the studio, it might actually have been an improvement.<br/><br/>** (out of ****)<br/><br/>Released by Warner Bros."
"Cochese-6","Null","0","0","4 January 2000"," Tries to Tackle too Much
","I usually like Oliver Stone, but I hate it when he blows his films way out of proportion. For example, the overdone style in ""Natural Born Killers,"" which is replicated here in ""Any Given Sunday."" Stone doesn't spare a cinematic technique, he throws every dizzying camera angle possible onto the screen. I was told this before I saw this, and it sounded necessary to me in order to fully capture the atmosphere that football players have to perform in ( Huge roaring crowds, photographers, cameramen, etc.) But Stone lays it on too thick making the viewer dizzy and ultimately tiresome with the game sequences. <br/><br/>    Another unnecessary addition to the game sequences is the blasting soundtrack, which seems only put there to attract the jock teenagers who couldn't begin to comprehend the films intended themes anyway. Speaking of various themes, ""Any Given Sunday,"" tries to deal with too many of them. To give you a clue it tries to show an aging coaches perspective of the game, his relationship with his players, his relationship with the black players, the black players perspective of the league, the team owner's relationship with the coach; and that's only a few of them.    Naturally the prevalent theme of the film is how much these players and coaches have to sacrifice only to get used, abused and then thrown away. However, I think the biggest problem with ""Any Given Sunday,"" is how much it glamourizes football players, (the taglines even go as far as to call them ""gladiators""!)     well... I'm not about to discuss that. Anyway to wrap it up Al Pacino, Jaime Foxx, James Woods, Cameron Diaz, and Matthew Modine all turn in good performances, and Stone remains a talented director, but next time Oliver, CAN YOU PLEASE HOLD THE CAMERA STRAIGHT FOR 5 MINUTES PLEASE!! And why the hell was LL COOL J in it?"

","Being an avid fan of *both* professional football AND Oliver Stone, I thought Stone's new movie ""Any Given Sunday"" would be a can't-miss hit, for me anyway.<br/><br/>But in the final analysis, Stone's effort is analogous to the star quarterback who has an ""off"" game (which can happen 'on any given Sunday' :^).<br/><br/>While the film certainly has its moments (Lawrence Taylor, believe it or not, is outstanding in a fairly sizable role, and the sound editing is fantastic), its not up to snuff with the rest of the Stone canon.<br/><br/>The plot is predictable and clichéd (what else do you expect from a sports movie?), but the real disappointment comes from the 'look' of the action on field. Here I thought Stone, a magician at editing and technique, would work wonders. But the end result is cheesy; its like watching a cross between arena league football and the sitcom, ""Coach"".<br/><br/>And the length. Whew! I mean, I can watch ""Nixon,"" ""Schindler's List,"" ""English Patient,"" etc. over and over.  But ""Any Given Sunday""'s 3 hours feel more like 5.  The movie starts to have that numbing, monotonous feel that you get when you watch, say, a Giants/Eagles game in mid-December. My<br/><br/>wife and I were both praying that Pacino's team would lose the (obligatory) ""big game"" so that we could go home...<br/><br/>In summary, Stone does connect on a few big plays.  But most of his passes fall incomplete.  I suggest those interested in ""Any Given Sunday"" wait until it hits vhs or pay per view.  It is certainly worth a rental.<br/><br/>
And of course, if you want to see Stone's best work, go rent ""Nixon,"" ""NBK"" or if you are in a really daring mood, ""U-Turn."""

","Well, Oliver Stone has gotten Vietnam out of his system, now it's time to take on pro football. POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!! OK story (young, excellent quarterback tries to take over team from the coach) but that's about it. Stone treats this story like it's big news (Football is corrupt!!!!  No kidding); he constantly cuts from one image to another VERY quickly--too quickly; women are treated as either b****es, sex objects, prostitutes or just nice scenary; EVERY football scene is shot closeup, so that it's impossible to tell what's going on, with bone-crunching sound; and at the very end every single major character COMPLETELY, with no discernable reason, becomes nice and forgiving and leaves us with a big old happy ending!  The acting is good (especially Diaz and Pacino) but they're all playing stock characters.  Also Diaz's character is treated very cruely at the end--memo to Oliver Stone:  STOP HATING WOMEN SO MUCH!  Ann-Margret, Mathew Modine and James Woods are all as good as they possibly can be, but are totally wasted in secondary roles--Woods only has two scenes!  Also the film is too long--2 hours and 40 minutes.  If you're desperate for a football film, this is for you.  Otherwise, stay away---FAR away!"

","Thank God Olly Stone has cut the hackneyed political crap out of his most recent films. Of course, this doesn't make them any less ridiculous, only much easier to watch. Even if he could forget for ten seconds all those fancy editing tricks he's learned from TV advertising, he'd still have to learn how to imbue his scripts with a bit more depth, and a few realistic (or at least likeable) female characters, if he really wanted to make a good film. As it stands, at least he has chosen wisely in the casting dept. If you're going to go full on with the sports cheese, there's no one like Al Pacino to give your picture the ham that it needs to complete the hors d'oeuvre. Cameron Diaz proves yet again that she's afraid of no part, or co-star; it's just too bad Stone hates women so much that he makes her a hardhearted bitch. (Imagine a man in the same role coddling his mother's lap dog at the big game to signify his redemption...)

"baumer","8","0","0","26 December 1999"," Get rid of the MTV editing and you have one of the best films of the year.
","Love or hate Oliver Stone for his beliefs and the way he films them ( Platoon, Wall Street, Born on the 4th of July, JFK, Nixon) you have to say one thing about the man; he is a brilliant artist/director.  What Oliver Stone sees, we see, what Oliver Stone feels, we can at least feel most of it.  JFK is one of the best films ever made and a lot of that has to be attributed to his work/vision.  It is a unique film and not just because of what it stands for but because how it was made.  There were certain scenes in that film where you couldn't tell what was 35 or 16mm filmstock and what was archived footage.  That authenticity, that care and devotion into that film made it ( in my opinion ) one of the 3 best films ever made ( Jaws and American Beauty sandwiching it on my list of best films ever).  While Any Given Sunday is not one of the best films ever made it is certainly one of the best that has come out this year.  Oliver Stone has done to professional football ( and perhaps all major North American sports ) what he did to politics and the government in JFK and Platoon.  He has dissected it and exposed it for what it really is.  As football fans, all we see is the gloss, the glamour, the spotlights, the charity devoted athletes, the replays, the larger than life personalities and great athleticism.  What we don't see, even though we know about it in dark corners is what Stone has shown us here, in this excellent film.<br/><br/>I read a few articles about this film and one of them said that Stone spent five years researching this movie to get it right and be true to what he is saying.  And if you look at what and who is involved here and what is not involved here, then you have to believe that what he is saying has some merit to it.<br/><br/>You have the participation of some of the games past greats like L.T. and Jim Brown and some of the games future greats like Ricky Williams that participated in the filming of the movie and they swear by what Stone has filmed.  They concur with the fact that corruption, drug abuse, womanizing, commercialism, greed and selfishness is just a euphanism for what football is all about.  Then you also have the non participation and non co-operation of the NFL when it came to using football names and even their logo.  To me that says that they don't want to be associated with this film because it is slanderous to what they want you to believe.  But look closely and listen even closer and everything that you see in here may be closer to the truth than what you thought.<br/><br/>What Any Given Sunday has is a great cast and one hell of a lead.  Al Pacino could read the phonebook and make it interesting somehow.  His portrayal of Tony D'Amato is so compelling and so honest that I really felt as though I knew this man.  There are so many tiny moments of grace for him in this role but the best that I have seen him in quite sometime was when he gave one particular speech to his team just before their potential last game of the season.  He was trying to preach that you have to win as a team and lose as a team.  He was preaching team unity and telling everyone that it is time to get rid of individualism that exists in the locker room.  It is a speech that starts out humbly enough but steamrolls into what Oscars are made of. I wanted to suit up and play for him after that speech.  I suspect that Al Pacino will get an Oscar nomination for his role in The Insider but this is the film that he deserves it for.  I still don't think there is a better performance this year than Kevin Spacey in American Beauty but this is definitely a distant second.  In this film he is Tony D'Amato.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is also quite impressive and I have to say that casting Cameron Diaz in the second biggest role in the film was risky. But she shows that she is more than just a pretty face in Hollywood.  There were many scenes where she bantered with Pacino for pages and pages of script and she comes across beautifully.  Jamie Foxx is also excellent in the film. There is one small role that I wanted to mention because even though Lauren Holly has a brief appearance as Dennis Quaid's wife, she steals many scenes that she is in.  There is one particular scene where she tells Cap ( Quaid ) that he is not ready to retire, that he is the bleepin quarterback for the Miami Sharks and that she won't listen to this crap from him right now.  I seriously wanted to leap through the screen and slap her and the rest of the theater felt the same way.  Her character is just as selfish as any of the others in the film and she should be recognized for doing it so well.<br/><br/>The one thing that is glaringly wrong with the film is some of the smashmouth editting.  There are times when the cuts are so fast and furious that you have a hard time seeing what is going on during the games.  This would have been better if the game was shown with more clarity and precision.  The MTV generation doesn't have to dictate editting techniques in an Oliver Stone film.  That is the only complaint that I have with the film but unfortunately it is a big one and it does detract from the overall aesthetic of it.  When the story is told and we are allowed to get involved with it completely then it is a great film.  However when it becomes a showcase for quick cuts to rock and roll music and the occasional gangsta rap, it becomes annoying.  I really wish the editting wasn't so dominant because the film would have been so much better.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is a great film and it is one that should be seen by everyone that has a mild interest in sports.  There is much to be learned from it and most importantly it is one hell of an entertaining film.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

This struck me as being made and written by Hollywood types that haven't watched a pro football game in years.  Your standard NFL video of the Superbowl has finer action.  The conflicts were ridiculous.  An owner that disagrees with the coach as strongly as Cameron Diaz did with homily-spouting Al Pacino would fire him.  Happens all the time.  Why would the writers think we would root for such a bunch of whiners?  Who needs to watch a football game where the outcome isn't in doubt?

","At first glance (the trailer), I drew a lot of similarities between this movie and The Program, with this appearing to be an upgrade: The Godfather replaces Sonny as the coach; the movie is longer, which must equal Oscar contender; and the hits are even bigger (and louder), enough to jar one from his or her seat.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I realized it was just a longer, louder, duller version of the aforementioned Program. Maybe we weren't supposed to believe this movie was more relevant than the Omar Epps/James Caan vehicle, but with Oliver Stone, were we supposed to expect something less profound?<br/><br/>I guess so. <br/><br/>Good things: Pacino and Foxx. Pacino was solid and Foxx had an engaging personality and swagger that worked as the young star. And L.T., I should say I actually enjoyed his work. I found his steam room speech to Foxx quite ironic.<br/><br/>Bad things: Cameron Diaz. It's not that I couldn't stand her character (that can be good) but I couldn't believe it. <br/><br/>The cliches. Does it ALWAYS rain when the team the movie focuses on loses/gets creamed/etc./etc.? And wouldn't it have been a lot better had L.T. not gotten hurt in the risky playoff game? It sure would've been a lot more original. And do teams always win on the last play? It doesn't add to the drama, not one bit, after every single movie that involves a sporting event ends that way. Find another way, coach.<br/><br/>The football logistics. A team that finishes the season 9-7 could've had home-field advantage if it had won its last game? 10-6 = home-field? A stretch ... And although this is a bit petty and licensing problems present themselves, I just can't get past the Miami Sharks, the Dallas Knights, et. al. And I also realize this wasn't the NFL ... it was the AFFL or whatever. So the new AFFL ""star"" has a No. 3 rap single? Arena League signal callers across the domed nation will be penning lyrics like madmen, if that's the case.<br/><br/>I could go on about time elements, the stereotypical alcoholism in the owners' boxes, Elizabeth Berkeley .... but I've probably went over the alloted number of words. I will close with this: If Stone wanted to catch the heart of football, he might have zoomed out and found a tripod to steady the damn camera.

","Just as NATURAL BORN KILLERS nailed the pop-culture gestalt of the early nineties--a demon's brew of Springer, tabloids, gothic death cult, grunge aggression and early VH-1--so does ANY GIVEN SUNDAY make an A+ time capsule for late-nineties American pop-cult. The quintessence of Miami South Beach, booty-shakin', synthetic-but-hand-pressed, multiracial-but-still-bland, Mr. Sean Puffy Combs America--in short, late-period VH-1--is clutched in the palm of Oliver Stone's hand as if he were...well, a boomer intellectual Michael Bay, to be frank.

But that would be wrong.<br/><br/>What you hope for going in to ANY GIVEN SUNDAY--entertaining cheese on the level of the dingy but ever watchable WALL STREET--is not what you get. Stone may still be working on a corny level of melodrama, sometimes evocative of seventies disaster movies, but this isn't ""Oliver Stone's football movie;"" instead, it uses the NFL as a prism to meditate on race, economics and personal ethics in the midst of the fat of a fin-de-siecle boom economy nonpareil. Those who think this is Stone's ""apolitical"" movie have got 160 minutes of another thing comin'.<br/><br/>It's also a work of studied portraiture on Stone's second favorite subject--his own bad self. Tony (Al Pacino), the beleaguered, alky-looking coach of the Miami Sharks, is a Portrait of the Ollie as a Midcareer Artist. (In a moment of Woody Allenish self-disclosure you wouldn't find in early Stone self-portraits, Pacino falls into the sack with silky-kittenish Elizabeth Berkley...then writes her a check for five thousand dollars.) Age is one of the prime sub-topics, given a rusty grandeur that's part mini-series, part Sophocles. Like the battered quarterback Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid), Tony is out of place in a world of endorsement deals hinged on yards run, and quarterbacks cutting hiphop albums. The negotiation of young brash energy and seasoned wisdom is given a satisfying, motheaten workout. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is Stone's COLOR OF MONEY--his show that he can still do the old tricks and keep the seats filled. And like COLOR OF MONEY, it ends with an ironic triumph that echoes that movie's resonant last line--""Hey, I'm back!""<br/><br/>For all the attention paid to Pacino's sagging face, Stone directs like a rock-video god given his first hundred million. In a year where some of the world's greatest directors didn't seem to have their head in the game, Stone goes at the material not just hammer and tongs, but with blood, sweat and tears--there's as much of his tissue on the prongs of this movie as in BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY. And the style he's minted here--an aggro, stimulant-esque version of a VH-1 marathon--holds for an extraordinary near-three hours. Stone's impressionistic editing remains venturesome, rangy, impressive, and his work with music and sound nearly equals that of NATURAL BORN KILLERS--a career (and perhaps an art-form) high.<br/><br/>Though the leads seem miscast (Cameron Diaz, God love her, may be the most committed major star in Hollywood movies--even to a dreadful part like the Owner's Bitchy Daughter), there are marvellous performances by the truckload here. James Woods doesn't do anything new as a company-man doctor who bends the rules, but he does it with a trim intensity, and some brilliant ad-libbing, that rank among his best work of recent years. (Somehow, only Stone knows how to put a choke collar on this guy.) Jamie Foxx is a revelation as a cocky kid discovering his own superhuman talent, and there are remarkable moments from John C. McGinley, Dick Butkus, Jim Brown, and Matthew Modine in small roles. Even Elizabeth Berkley is damn good. One of the tragedies of the career of Oliver Stone is that while he is known primarily for a) paranoia and b) manic editing, he casts and directs actors better than all but a few living American filmmakers.<br/><br/>ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a big, heady mixture--part potboiler, part philosophical campfire lecture from Shaman Stone, mixed together in a style that's somewhere between Hype Williams and Cezanne. It's a major Oliver Stone movie--and it's sad that it's being treated fondly and condescendingly, as if Stone directed a campy, gassed-up episode of KNOTS LANDING."

","First, a tip to those who can't stand Oliver Stone movies yet keep going to see them, only to show up in here and gripe about them: no, Oliver Stone is not going to make a ""normal""-looking movie.  He's not going to make his movies to look exactly like every other mindless chunk of garbage that shows up at the Cineplex Odeon.  If you don't like his style, stop watching the movies. :-)<br/><br/>On to ""Any Given Sunday"". Frankly, I thought it was great.  The performances were superb (even Stone himself as a sportscaster) and as always I found myself constantly being kept on my toes by Stone's visual style, particularly the football footage.<br/><br/>Stone does an excellent job of capturing the essence of the game by giving us rapidly-edited high-speed footage.  Most of it is very ""in-close"" and claustrophobic, and the intensity level is completely off the scale.  This frantic, chaotic feel is complemented by background music cranked to a level of discomfort.  This should give people a good idea what it's like to actually be a participant in a good old-fashioned smash-mouth football game.<br/><br/>I didn't think Cameron Diaz could play a villain, I really didn't. Surprise, surprise, surprise, folks.  She comes through with a bald-faced viciousness that raised my eyebrows on more than a few occasions.  (However, it should be kept in mind that I *also* didn't think Angela Lansbury would make a good villain, and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" proved me very wrong in THAT instance.)<br/><br/>Pacino is, as always, Mr. Badass.  This time around, he's Mr. Badass with a heart and feelings.  He means business when he sets foot on the field, and he takes it hard when he is criticized.  All in all, a very believable performance.<br/><br/>And as far as the length of the film goes... GOOD.  I LIKE long movies.  If a movie can hold my attention for three hours without letting me get up to smoke a cigarette or take a leak, then I consider it a success.<br/><br/>The bottom line:  I rank it right up there with ""North Dallas Forty"" and ""The Longest Yard"".  Never mind all this other nebulous junk like ""The Waterboy"", ""Varsity Blues"", and ""The Program.""  ""Any Given Sunday"" is where it's at.<br/><br/>Oh, and I *do* have one complaint about the movie: whoever decided on the color schemes for the various football teams' uniforms (particularly the Dallas ""Knights"") needs to be tested for color-blindness."

Diaz doesn't quite fit her role, but this has become my favorite Pacino movie. Quaid does a killer performance for the broken down player, though I thought Stone should have made a bigger example of long-term effects of the NFL on players. Modine and Woods turn in killer performances, and Jim Brown plays his part to a 't'. The sports writer storyline was way overblown. <br/><br/>I will go see it again."
"dogbert-6","8","0","0","24 December 1999"," Great cinematography and sound puts you in the game.
","Like ""Saving Private Ryan"", the opening puts you right on the field of battle. But instead of the beaches of Normandy, you are in a professional football game with casualties mounting. Head coach Al Pacino is down to his third string quarterback, Jamie Foxx, whose first play is to puke in the huddle.<br/><br/>Using the shaky cam and in the face close-ups, you feel part of the action, even if you don't know what going on. But unlike ""Private Ryan"", this cinema technique does not end with the opening battle. We are in everybody's face for the whole movie and Foxx pukes three more times. Too much of a good thing almost made me want to join him.<br/><br/>What saves this film is Oliver Stone's excellent use of his all-star supporting cast. Dennis Quaid as the aging star quarterback, James Wood as the cynical team doctor, Matthew Modine as his innocent assistant, Ann-Margret as the drunk owner's widow, and Charlton Heston as the godlike rival owner, all did well in familiar roles. Cameron Diaz as the tough general manager, by virtue of being the owner's daughter, at first seems miscast. But in the end we see her inherent innocence used in her character. If Stone really wanted a mean blonde bitch, he could have use Lauren Holly, who give a credible performance as Quaid's not-so-loving wife.<br/><br/>This show should get a oscar nomination for cinematography, and maybe direction and sound. But it should win booby prize for costumes. Designing the uniforms for an entire fictitious football league was certainly a challenge. But those uniforms of the Heston's Dallas Knights, with the Holy Cross in front where the players' numbers should have been, may be symbolic, but ""Oh God"" it was distracting.<br/><br/>Finally, was that Cuba Gooding, Jr. playing Foxx's agent? Maybe Foxx should have said ""Show me the money"".<br/><br/>I gave this movie an 8 out of 10, not bad for a year with so many good movies."

","If you want to see a move that shows what football is like from the insides, from the fights on the sidelines to the battles on the gridiron, this is the film for you. If you're looking for a good movie, it isn't. Any Given Sunday chronicles the last few games of the season of the fictional Sharks. Yet although it shows football very well, and what goes on inside it, it is filled with inaccuracies about points (7 points for a touchdown) and time on the clock. So in that regard, it fails. But the main thing it fails at is providing an entertaining movie. The movie basically rehashes the same tired points over and over again. The whole thing seems thrown together, with different scenes interjecting at different times, and seems out of order. Most importantly, the movie really seems like it is missing a story line with a beginning, middle, and end. Also, at a length of over two and half hours, it drags on, even with all the football scenes. Great photography, and great football insights, but generally a boring movie to sit through. 6 1/2 out of 10."

","""Any Given Sunday"" had a tough job when it came to me: I don't like soccer. I like American football even less. I find it dull and uninteresting - could ""Any Given Sunday"" drag me in? Almost, but not quite.<br/><br/>Acting wise? Pacino is good. He always is. He's the coach for a team on a losing streak, trying to bring them back up to form (does he succeed? Whaddya think...). He's got a brand new super player - Jamie Foxx - whose arrogance matches his skill, and a manager, played by Diaz, who sees her money draining away, to contend with in this 162 minute movie.<br/><br/>As there's not much in the way of the plot, the work of making the movie is in Oliver Stone's hands. He uses a variety of techniques including sound, camera angles, and different film stock to drag you into the heat and action of the game. I actually did feel the adrenaline pumping fury of the sport, and the raw energy dispersed, undercut with constant brooding violence. The movie has a great ""docu"" style to it, and the use of relative unknowns for the players, helps enhance this feeling of reality. There's a pretty decent soundtrack accompanying the movie as well, which helps you feel the passion.<br/><br/>However the movie tends to meander. There's a lack of a decent structure to it, and a sense of over-brutality of the sport. More importantly, the movie couldn't quite drag me in. I'm still uninterested in the sport. I got bored when they were discussing tactics because they were talking in terms I had no familiarity with. The movie often felt padded - needless amounts of game footage, just put in to lengthen the running time. Wandering attention is not good in a movie. As an American football movie it's probably great, but as a movie it alienates those not into the sport. Stone makes an admirable effort here, credit to him, but I can't quite get into this hobby horse of his. 5/10."

","Oliver Stone has tackled the Vietnam War (Platoon, Born on the Fourth of July), political assassination (JFK) and the media (Natural Born Killers), now he has set his sights on America's favorite pastime and big business, football, in the very impressive and adrenaline pumped ""Any Given Sunday"". Al Pacino heads an amazing assortment of actors in one of the best ensemble films to come down the pike, directed ferociously by Stone.<br/><br/>Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) is the coach of the fictitious football team, the Miami Sharks, which are on a big time losing streak.  With the injury of the talented, but aging quarterback Jack Rooney (Dennis Quaid) things look very bleak.  But enter 3rd string quarterback Willy Beamer (Jamie Fox) and the Sharks begin to take an upswing turn.  As the Sharks begin their instantaneous climb, turmoil begins among the players and with the old school D'Amato and the Sharks owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) attempting to move the team into the 21st century.<br/><br/>The bone-crushing ""Any Given Sunday"" is hands down one of the best movies about the inside and outside of sports and gives you a front row seat on what it feels like to be on that playing field.  This is one intense and caffeine induced film that gives one major rush.  The action sequences alone are worth the admission price and I am not even a football fan.  But ""Any Given Sunday"" has so much more going for it including some great acting by this very intense ensemble group.  Pacino who was wonderful in the recent film, ""The Insider"", continues his second chapter of his career that began at the beginning of this decade with ""Sea of Love"" and ""The Godfather Part III"".  His intense performance of the coach who actually cares about his players is worthy of an Oscar nomination; it is one of the best performances of his career.  He balances the strength and weaknesses of Coach D'Amato perfectly in a sport that has changed drastically since he began.  Cameron Diaz, a very talented and natural actress, gives the best performance of her short career and holds her own in scenes with the legendary Pacino.  Their scenes are as brutal and intense as what happens on the playing field.  As the owner of the Sharks, Diaz cuts a very strong figure in a man's world and pulls it off.   Jamie Fox of TV's ""In Living Color"" and ""The Jamie Fox Show"" gives a break-out performance in the role of the maverick quarterback who rises to the top (too quickly, which is a big flaw of this otherwise excellent film) and alienates his teammates.  Known for his comedic talents, Fox gives one hell of a dramatic performance that should get him noticed. Even Elizabeth Berkley, who was so awful in the horrendous ""Showgirls"" does good work in a small role as a prostitute.  I did not even know it was she until the ending credits.  The rest of the cast including the still very sexy and beautiful Ann-Margaret does wonderful work.<br/><br/>But for all the great acting going on, this film belongs to director Stone. His camera shots, which include split screens and MTV style sequences with a pounding score of almost non-stop rap and rock music, including Bill Withers classic ""Use Me"", show Stone in top form.  It is great to have him back on top after 1997's dismal disaster ""U-Turn"".  Stone has captured football, warts and all like no one else.  He digs into the brutal business and turns it inside out.  It is a great look at the inside of this very lucrative sport. But for all the big business deals going on here, the heart of the movie is about the players who live and eat football.<br/><br/>You do not need to be a football or sports fan to appreciate this great movie, I'm certainly not and I enjoyed it immensely. And for all those people out their wanting equal time for male frontal nudity, you've got plenty, with enough time to count every inch. Recommended. × × × × out of 5."

In the past there was a mediocre film acted by Heston about the same topic. Now this new film came made by masterful Oliver Stone, so good film maker is a sign of quality. Unfortunately this film is not the case, the sequences are designed in the same way as the former Heston's film and it is difficult to follow, moreover if your understanding of this sport is limited. Al Pacino never looked to be a sportsman or a trainer in his own life, although we should admit that he acted well as the trainer of Miami. Dennis Quaid played a very modest role and Cameron Diaz tried but not succeeded. Charlton Heston again played a very modest role, an insignificant one. James Wood, always wanted in Stone's cast, did his job well although modest. However, the message of the film is good and is there, i.e. no matter if players are deadly hurt they must play until they are killed or become unable (blind or anything else) to play, money is the main issue in this professional sport, the man and his family no matter."

Oliver Stone has penned a brilliant script and woven a tight and subtle story here for the discerning audience. the viewer will have to carefully observe the subtle interplay between various people to really appreciate what is going on in their minds and how each person changes as the movie progresses. this is what the whole plot is about and since its not exactly very obvious, the movie is lost on many.<br/><br/>however, the acting is still brilliant (even cameron diaz). the editing is just top-rate, the quick cuts and sharp angles to capture the excitement on the field is just terrific, but it might be a bit of an eye-sore for people who prefer the safe soft, long & slow shots. another outstanding highlight is the music, very very apt and and adding to the mood in each scene.<br/><br/>On the whole, a top class movie.<br/><br/>an exciting 8!"

An aging football coach struggles to keep the team together while an up and coming quarterback refuses to stay down after spending time in the trenches. Meanwhile, an aging quarterback contemplates retirement after one injury too many in his career. An unethical doctor's beliefs extend to that of the team when he keeps the players on the field.

The sounds of Kid Rock's ""Bawitdaba"" only foreshadows what kind of images you'll see in this film that will fuel you with testosterone. The epic scope shots of the field, the roars of the crowd, and the performances of the actors has you thinking this is going to be an unbelievable film. Unfortunately, it's nothing like that. Oliver Stone's take on the football world is nothing more than ""Natural Born Killers"" with a pigskin football. It's constant barrage of images filling up the screen only contributes to screwing up the film's narrative. It's because Stone wants to show us the commerical world that is football, but it's just used too much to create an impact. Shot like a football documentary, the performances are all around good, with the always satisfying Al Pacino at forefront as aging coach D'Amato, and Cameron Diaz as one woman who needs to be taken down a couple hundred notches for her ruthlessness. Dennis Quaid and James Woods are given their own space for performances and manage to create convincing characters. Woods is excellent as the ever so conniving doctor. The cast is impressive, with people such as Matthew Modine, Jim Brown, Bill Bellamy, and Aaron Eckhardt contributing worthy performances. More notably is LL Cool J as one of the players intent on playing the game and holding onto his endorsements. Jamie Foxx, a talented comedian is probably given the juiciest part of the film, and his performance is riveting as the cocky yet naive Willie Beaman, the upcoming quarterback who won't stay down. But unfortunately, if you're aiming to see ""The Program"", just stick with the said film, because ""Any Given Sunday"" is not that film.

","Warning: may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>When I saw the preview for this movie, it gave the impression that the film would be some cutting-edge expose of the way that evil corporate greed is threatening the future of one of America's best-loved sports.  What it instead turned out to be was a rather lame movie about some struggling gridiron team's attempts to reverse its rather pitiful performance and save itself from extinction.  Then again, from what I've heard, Oliver Stone seems to have a rather notorious reputation for vastly overinflating the importance and significance of his cinematographic creations (just look at ""Platoon"" and ""Natural Born Killers"").<br/><br/>Basically, ""Any Given Sunday"" seems to consist of little more than an endless succession of football games as the team we're all supposed to cheer for (the presumably fictitious Miami Sharks) takes on everyone else in the competition and tries to whip their asses.  There's also a bit of off-field politics: much of it involving Cameron Diaz's character.  Although she's supposed to be a real bitch, I didn't consider her particularly evil; all she seemed to be doing was trying to run the Miami Sharks as a sound business.  Far more disturbing, and truly worthy of the title of BITCH, was the wife of Dennis Quaid's character.  The last individual wants to quit football because he's getting too old and racking up too many injuries, yet his selfish cow of a wife refuses to let him.  Not only that, but when he gets in an argument with her over it, the bitch actually slaps him!  If the roles were reversed, everyone would be jumping up and down and screaming domestic violence, but presumably, because she's a woman, it's OK for her to lash out at her spouse like a spoilt little child who can't get its own way.<br/><br/>Another big gripe that I had with this movie concerned an injury shown in the final game.  Was it REALLY necessary for some guy to get one of his eyeballs ripped out in that?  Ugh, it makes me nauseous just thinking about it!<br/><br/>In summary, this was really nothing more than just another football movie: one with no real surprises in it.  Not TOO bad if you like that sort of thing but don't expect anything deeper from it."

","Although you can't argue about taste, people have to admit that Oliver Stone has made some of the most interesting, exciting, shocking and fresh, new movies of the last 20 years. Most of them have their own style, pace and even really good soundtracks. Now, Al Pacino is someone who I always like to watch, even when the movies themselves are terrible. He's really unique, and keeps on becoming a better actor every single time. Even people like Dennis Quaid and Cameron Diaz are very skillfull actors, although mostly underrated....<br/><br/>Now throw in some wonderful cinematography, incredible sound and the normal Stone-ish film length of almost 3 hours and you are in for a real treat - a masterpiece, or at least an enjoyable and interesting experience that will keep you thinking and talking about it for some time.<br/><br/>Looking at all that, it was a complete shock to see this movie. No, not even the word 'seeing' completely covers the feeling of having to endure this 3 hour pile of complete nonesence and abuse of great potential. I am sure that your opinion will be a bit more positive if you truly are a football fan, but as a filmfan with a broad interest there still is nothing I really like about this movie.<br/><br/>First of all unlike some what some people might say, the story of this movie is incredibly thin and shallow - it is made up of things 'you already have seen so many times before'. The only basic elements are simply an old player that is about to get sacked, but is still clinging on because of his old 'milestones', a new guy who can hardly cope with the pressure but is about to be discovered, a good coach having a bad time, and an annoying manager who knows as much about the game as the average fan.<br/><br/>But without doubt the most terrible thing about this movie are the characters. There are no private lives, no drama, no joy....all people are completely shallow, hollow, uninteresting, without having any other things to talk about than football: the results, contracts, etc.<br/><br/>The beautifull cinematography and sound doesn't make up for the completely failed 'behind the scenes' type of story.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone has showed us what we -the spectators- usually see on the field, and read & see in the media.<br/><br/>The only inside information is when the young Quarterback shows us all his last night's dinner on the field, something which onitself is a ridiculous way of portaying someone who's being bothered with nerves. Aside from it being disgusting to watch, it's hardly realistic and makes this movie rather ridiculous and annoying to watch.<br/><br/>Like Oliver Stone ? Have a look at JFK if you like suspence, Natural Born Killers if you like action and great music, or Platoon if you like to see people dealing with death, nerves or failure. Like Al Pacino ? Have a look at all his other movies....but just ignore this one.<br/><br/>Bart"

","Any Given Sunday was way too dramatic, and one of Oliver Stone's least impressive efforts.  Lost in all the drama was the love of the game that each participant has.  The wanting to win, and the admiration that follows with winning, were not thoroughly conveyed in this film.  It was a revisit of North Dallas Forty, the Oliver Stone way.  The movie is not bad, but I feel that the subject matter was lost in the interpretation of pro football."

","Stone always has people who ""represent"" a point of view first, and are characters second.  (Classic example...Tom Berenger & Willem Dafoe in PLATOON).  However, usually his filmmaking is strong enough to make us believe the people anyway.  This is a lightweight Stone, and his female characters in particular are unconvincing.  Cameron Diaz is horribly miscast...she gets to cuss and act mean, but to what purpose other than to be the character that represents ""young, money-hungry, tradition-despising business people of today.""  Lauren Holly...what the heck was that character?!?!  And Pacino, who can be good, is allowed to indulge in all his mannerisms, but to no purpose. I kept expecting a line like ""I try to get out of football...but they always pull me back.""<br/><br/>I enjoyed some of the more minor characters a bit more...some of the young football players were really well done.  James Wood was wasted, though."

We have ""The Legend"" in the guise of both quarterback and coach, played by Dennis Quaid and Al Pacino. I have seen this performance from Pacino too many times...where is the quiet calm of Michael Corleone? We also have the Brash Rookie played by Jamie Foxx and we also have ""The Tragedy"" in the form of Lawrence Taylor - a player who needs to hang it up before he gets killed, but can't walk away.

"Brian-272","8","0","0","3 June 2001"," Oliver Stone's take on pro football.
","Sure Oliver Stone did score several touchdowns and earned pro bowl honors, but still did not have a hall of fame movie. Any Given Sunday does it's best to show the life of pro football mostly the highs and lows that a team experiences in a season. Stone did very little to focus on the x's and o's of the game but decided to show more of the struggles, and I'm glad because it is how a team deals with differences and problems that makes them winners in the end. Al Pacino is veteran coach Tony D' Amato who deals with the pressure of life such as winning football and just basic everyday life only to have those matters become tougher when dealing with the tough and witch of a team owner the win at all cost Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) plus the struggle with young quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx) who takes the team over when aging quarterback 'Cap' Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is injured Beamen who lightens up the game struggles with success in terms of team and clashes with old school coach Tony D' Amato only in the end when it is said and done you see that both Beamen and Amato taught each other how to win. After the championship season you see just how smart that coach Tony D' Amato is as he really shows this franchise what it is all about and how he goes about, the ending surprised me when I first saw it but each time you watch the ending you cheer for coach Tony more and more. Willie Beamen and Amato are on another highway to a championship. Al Pacino is great as always, Any Given Sunday also stars former NFL greats Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor the musical scores played during the movie are great. Basically Oliver Stone makes Any Given Sunday a little long but hey this is a Stone movie he likes many many minutes in his films, but this does show a pretty good look at pro football but still I would take watching a real NFL game over this."

","A very - VERY (and unnecessarily) - long film exploring the relationship between Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), an old school professional football coach who has difficulty adjusting to the modern game and its players, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) the young owner of the Miami Sharks football team that he coaches, and who is quite willing to sacrifice her players health in order to win, and Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx), the young third-string quarterback who, due to injuries, takes over the team, becomes a star, and becomes arrogant and uncoachable as a result.<br/><br/>The movie isn't too bad, except for the interminable length. There is far too much focus, in my opinion, on the on-field action. I like football, and this is a football movie, so obviously some of that is necessary, but there was altogether too much of it. It was generally well-done, but the movie could easily have been cut by about a half hour if the extraneous on-field action was left out.<br/><br/>The performances were very good. Al Pacino was very convincing as the old coach, and Jamie Foxx was perfectly cast as the arrogant young quarterback. I confess that I did a double take when I discovered that Cameron Diaz was playing the hard as nails owner of a football team (!), but there's a logical enough reason that she became the owner (she inherited the team from her father), and she actually pulls off the role fairly well. Thee are also cameos from folks as diverse as Charlton Heston and Barry Switzer.<br/><br/>I found the development of the ""Willie Beamen"" story difficult to swallow, though. Granted that anything's possible in pro sports, but it seems hard to accept that in the course of what seemed to be just a few games, Beamen went from an unsure third-stringer who threw up from nerves whenever he had to play to the confident, cocky and arrogant superstar. That detracted from the plausibility of the story. As to the rest of the story, I'm not a pro football player so can't say with certainty whether the lifestyle depicted is realistic or just a rehashing of stereotypes.<br/><br/>The movie's not bad. It held my interest all the way, and I loved the ending I have to admit. Way to go, D'Amato! But the problems I noted above really hurt my overall rating of the movie. It's definitely not a touchdown, but maybe could qualify as a field goal. I gave it 5/10, but for the most part an enjoyable 5."
"swbhoy","Null","0","0","27 May 2001"," Oh Dear
","Oliver Stone takes a cast that most film-makers would give their right arm for, a budget to match, and gives us ""Major League"" with face-cages. I assume that Al Pacino had a couple of beers too many the day he picked up this script and thought, ""I'll give it a go"". Given that sports movies are notorious for being almost uniformly awful, one would have thought that someone needed to exercise more caution on this project. Either approach it with a ""Necessary Roughness"" or ""Mean Machine"" air of light hearted abandon or go for exploring the psyche of the celebrity sportsman and the nasty, heartless underbelly of professional sports. Combinations dont work and I'm afraid that its exactly this kind of middle ground that ""Any Given Sunday"" finds itself languishing in. For those who havent seen it, imagine ""Bull Durham"" with a coach and you're pretty much there, without the engaging performances of Costner or Robbins. Don't get me wrong, Pacino almost, but not quite, manages to overcome the cliche of the ""old timer"" coach with a heavy heart and trouble adjusting to the modern game, but Dennis Quaid and Jamie Foxx are given so little to work with that their roles are, I'm afraid, beyond redemption. After one particular defeat D'Amato (Pacino)announces ""this stinks"". I felt obliged to agree."

Dennis Quaid is the old time has been who's crumbling physical prescence is taking it's toll on him. Do these characters sound familiar?

","On a rating scale of 0 to 100; I gave Any Given Sunday a score of 56.<br/><br/>What a great looking film: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid and Oliver Stone, together. It's simply remarkable that this turned out to be a below-average film. Such a good cast, such a good director and such a good trailer. What could've gone wrong?<br/><br/>An ageing football coach named Tony (Pacino) finds himself struggling with his personal and professional life while trying to hold his team together. A star quarterback has been knocked out of the game and a naive football player replaces him only to become exposed to the world of sports and become a danger to himself and to his players. Meanwhile, the coach finds himself constantly at battle with the team owner's money and power hungry daughter Christine (Cameron Diaz) intent on moving the team out.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday made a decent amount of money at the box office and movie-reviewers enjoyed it. However, if you look at it from a different perspective, Any Given Sunday is too flawed to be enjoyed and has a touch of decency which makes it a film that doesn't deserved to be universally panned. Luckily for the team on-screen and off-screen, this film got hardly any bad ratings, most people rated it as the average mediocre movie. I was one of them, but I found a lot of flaws in the script and timing. The characters weren't developed enough before they started screeching at each other, it's simply too long and I left the cinema with the headache. However, Any Given Sunday is sometimes quite exciting and the cast make it bearable enough for the lazy running time.<br/><br/>Since the film is based on American football, it is mainly aimed at an American audience, which is unfortunate for eager New Zealander's like myself. Oliver Stone's decision to go completely technical is sometimes acceptable, but to be honest, he needs to desperately measure up his game some time soon."
"Barney-39","4","0","0","23 December 1999"," Too much of too much
","I was greatly disappointed in this movie.  Any Given Sunday has a great beginning.  The film starts off fast-paced with brilliant, exciting editing that puts the viewer right in the middle of the action of every play.  But after a while, it becomes clear that the editing prevents the viewer from actually seeing what's going on.  Everything's a blur of color.<br/><br/>The acting is first rate by everyone in the movie, but the writing is pedestrian.  The plot covers the same territory as that of North Dallas Forty but doesn't explore the issues as well as the earlier movie.  There is the same subplot involving a sleazy team Doctor willing to shoot the players up with anything to keep them going, but Stone handles the conclusion of this in an unrealistic way. And man, is this movie sexist!  The scene that involves domestic violence depicts the wife of a NFL quarterback slugging her husband as hard as she can, while he just hangs his head and takes it.  Yeah, right.  NFL players are beaten by their wives all the time. And the final half-hour of the movie is intolerable.  The inevitable climax of the Big Game is drawn out with every possible delay.  A touchdown is called back, there's a penalty, there's a time out.  On and on and on.  I must have looked at my watch five times. There's definitely some great visuals which look good on the big screen, but I'd recommend to my friends to rent this one.  That way you could put it on pause every once and a while.  You definitely need a periodic break from this movie."

","ANY GIVEN SUNDAY / (1999) *1/2<br/><br/>Here we have a film that has the impact of watching an angry father relentlessly lecturing and yelling at this child at the mall, without a clue of passion, depth, or humanity. The movie is loud and obnoxious, not failing to leave us without throbbing memorabilia: a headache! Half of Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" is like watching a professional football game up close and personal without the dubbed profanities and explicit remarks. The other half consists of a variety of blunt, unsympathetic characters getting into one verbal fight after another for reasons never really understood. Drowned in production overkill and shamelessly using every cliché in the sports movie play book, ""Any Given Sunday"" is one of the most ridiculously over anticipated movies in along time.<br/><br/>We do not care about any of the characters here, and the actors cannot get beyond their underlying stereotypes to make the movie intriguing. There is a powerhouse cast, with Al Pacino as a traditional coach of a professional football team, who has reportedly given up ""everything"" for his players. Cameron Diaz plays the team's owner, who sees the sport as big business and enormous wealth. Dennis Quaid (about fifteen years too old for his role) is an aging quarterback who requires recovery time after an injury. James Woods is the shallow and self-centered physician for the team. Jamie Foxx plays one of the most hated characters ever written, a football player named Willie Beaman, who represents the younger generation, selfish, arrogant, and concerned more about publicity and popularity than his loving and gracious girlfriend (Lela Rochon).<br/><br/>There are plenty of flat themes here, with the main characters all learning valuable lessons about sportsmanship and leadership. Even if the production was more of a respectable attempt at a behind the scenes look into football, Stone's direction is violent and nervous throughout. He thinks we are more interested in watching collisions on the field, sprinkled with ranting and cursing, and when the characters are not hollering at one another, the deafening soundtrack, obviously intended to inspire MTV fans, makes you cringe.<br/><br/>What about the football action? Are you expecting top-quality film making and expert technique to inspire us as the players play their hearts out? If so, ""Any Given Sunday"" is clearly not your movie. The on-field action, shot with hand-held cameras, is some of the most confusing photography witnessed in movies all year. Just when you think the shot cant get any worse, the camera changes to an even worse angle, and then returns to the original location after the important stuff has already happened. There is no breathing room, either, it is just one aggravating, irrigating, irrational sequence after another. The ending result is impersonal and astoundingly bad.<br/><br/>How about the performances from the all star cast? Al Pacino fails to capture his character's reality because, or so it seems, he has such little confidence in the writing. He comes off as dual and uninspired. Cameron Diaz cannot do a whole lot with her character either; she is engulfed in the character's selfish disposition. Dennis Quaid is boring and undeveloped. James Woods is tedious and unintriguing. LL Cool J's role is too small and expected. The few supporting female stars, including Lela Rochon and Lauren Holly, are seen in a sexist light. Jamie Foxx delivers a performance that feels way too much like watching him be Jamie Foxx.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" gets credit for a decent commercial design, aimed squarely at young male audiences. There is plenty to please the target audience, lots of off-color humor, sex appeal, bare breasts, naughty words-hey, there is even a few scenes that may interest females. Its locker room sequence where several football players bare all. The style obviously has a lot of irony and guts, but the movie itself is dead in the water."

","Normally sports movies are not my cup of tea, but this one was very funny to watch. At the beginning my hopes about this film were not too high, because I awaited the usual story about a old man, who once was a great football champion, but now as a trainer he´s persecuted by failure and finally he gets ruined and dropped by the merciless business. But ""Any Given Sunday"" was more a satire than a drama: in an ironic way it showed the madness of the All American Football Circus. Director Oliver Stone said about his own film: ""Baseball shows, what America wants to be; Football what it is..!"". Well, perhaps I´ve got to be an US-citizen to understand the message this movie wants to tell, because American football is not very widespread here in Germany, but the film itself was very entertaining (I recommend to everyone to watch the director´s cut with a total running time of 151 minutes!) and an ironic comment on the state of the American society. It is well-played by Al Pacino and Cameron Diaz, the cast of great supporting actors is nearly unbelievable (Woods, LL Cool J, Heston, Berkley, Holly, Stone himself...). After the disappointing ""U Turn"" which I saw recently, Oliver Stone strikes back again with this!!! (8/10)"

The acting in this film definitely was ok (good choice in cheerleaders and celebrity - sluts Mr. Stone. They looked very good). The best scene I thought was when Al Pacino gave the speech for the Play off game. That was really the best scene.<br/><br/>SPOILERS!!!<br/><br/>Another scene I liked though was when Willie and other guys were in the locker room and some big white guy played a record of his loud as hell. It was Metallica's Motorbreath. Willie goes on up to him and says like: 'Turn of that nazi rock s**t.' And the guy is all like: 'Man this is Metallica. James Hetfield is GOD.' I thought that was so cool and one of the funniest moments for me (as being a huge Metallica fan meself).<br/><br/>SPOLERS END!!!<br/><br/>But there were other good lines and jokes too.

","Aside from ""Platoon"", Oliver Stone has an annoying tendency to over ""Oliver Stone-ize"". For example, the freaky camera angles and background effects in ""Natural Born Killers"" almost made sense since the characters were on drugs most of the time (he certainly could have toned it down a notch or three though). But in ""Any Given Sunday"" and especially ""Nixon"" these effects occur far too often and usually for no apparent reason. This adds unnecessary length and confusion to what could have and perhaps would have otherwise been a much better film.

","Extremely sharp and intense film about the miniature and major dilemmas that a weary and devoted pro football coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) has to deal with during the regular season.  The team's new owner (Cameron Diaz) is unsure if Tony can lead the team to the playoffs.  Part of that conflict includes the team's two quarterbacks: Jack Rooney (Dennis Quaid) is an old, but a reliable veteran QB.  On the other hand, Willie Beamon (Jamie Foxx), is young and even though he becomes an overnight sensation.  Beamon makes the dreadful mistake of not keeping his cool and gets himself into a bitter conflict with the team's merc like running back (L.L. Cool J).  And just to make the film even interesting, the team's two doctors (James Woods as the unreliable one and Matthew Modine as the one who does it by the book) adds another piece of conflict.  Outside the team, John C. McGingly is good as the sarcastic football analyst/nutcase Jack Rose who constantly rips on D'Amato.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" doesn't seem to be predictable, but it's not although there's a wave of pressure in trying to be successful.  The film has several current or former NFL players and coaches in key roles like Lawrence Taylor as a veteran linebacker and Jim Brown as the defensive cordinator and in brief ones like Barry Switzer, Y.A. Tittle, Dick Butkus, and so forth.<br/><br/>Director Oliver Stone is smart in making films with a lot of conflict and mistrust like this one and ""Platoon"" is another example, but a lot better.

","Stone did a good job on delivering a solid movie. While the plot is extremely predictable, he was still able to sculpt a very interesting movie out of it.<br/><br/>This movie was not about football, it wasn't even about sports. It was really about people going through changes, sacrificing, about principles and friendship. While the main plot itself was pretty standard stuff, the subplots saved the movie: A coach losing his team,  an old pro having to accept he's out of the league, a daughter selling her father's principles and a few more..<br/><br/>The cinematography was great (esp. if you liked it in JFK and Natural Born Killers). Stone uses the same cut and past music-video style editing techniques and shaking cameras. The use of these techniques is a lot more conservative than seen in NBK, but it still has the same effect; You don't really notice the small edits, but you're dragged deeper into the picture by them.<br/><br/>The action scenes were impressive to say the least, they gave me the same feeling like when I first saw the epic battles in gladiator, but only now everything is using glossy colors, loud electronic music and time slowdowns (Matrix-like). All of these things have been done before, but the execution is very good, making the view worthwhile.<br/><br/>All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone who likes to see a good movie. Watch it with an open mind and just let it come down on you, at least it'll be entertaining, and maybe more.<br/><br/>Ps.: Make sure you see it on widescreen and with loud sound."

"thehowells","Null","0","0","1 February 2001"," Very good in the right venue, but not a super-great film
","My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie....and we're not big football fans either.  But after reading many of the negative reviews, I feel some aspects of this film deserve some defense.<br/><br/>We first watched this film on DVD projected (in widescreen format) on a 120"" screen with over 1000 watts of surround sound.  Then late one night I happened to catch it on HBO, and watched it again.  This time it was on a regular 35"" TV, without surround-sound, and without widescreen (pan and scan).<br/><br/>What a difference, and I don't simply mean that bigger and louder will necessarily make a ""bad"" movie a ""good"" film.  But what too many people don't seem to understand or appreciate is that many movies today are shot, directed and edited with the idea that they will be seen in an actual ""theater""....either the concrete nuclear bomb-shelter at the end of your local mall, or the kind more and more folks are enjoying in their homes (and NO, you DON'T have to spend $50,000 to $200,000 for one either!  We have no more than a few thousand dollars in ours).<br/><br/>Basically, if you watched it on a simple TV at home....then YOU DIDN'T SEE THIS MOVIE!<br/><br/>First, if it's not widescreen (letterboxed), then you cannot see a whole 1/3rd of the image that was filmed.  Movies are made this way for a reason...we have TWO EYES, not just one.  Second, if you have no surround-sound speakers then your ears and brain will not perceive the signals that help you become much more engaged in the images you see, or enveloped within the action.  Third, a subwoofer goes a LONG way toward feeling those hits by the players on the field!<br/><br/>It's just like someone who puts the cheapest tires on a new Ferrari and then complains that the whole car sucks!  And, has no idea as to why.<br/><br/>Another aspect related to the visualization of this movie is that Oliver Stone does not present images in a mainstream manner...and this obviously alienates some viewers.  Fact is, he's playing with the way we humans process visual information, and more often than not, the impact is greater than the simple hum-drum we're fed all the rest of the time.  I certainly wouldn't want to see it in every movie (e.g., Godfather, Big Chill, etc.), but sometimes it works (e.g., Private Ryan, Insider).<br/><br/>Some thought there was little or no plot, or storyline.  If you had attended and paid attention in English class, you'd have learned more than just the language ('nuff said).<br/><br/>Some also compared it unfavorably to movies made long ago (North Dallas Forty was common), and that there was nothing new here.  While I might agree with some of those sentiments, we should all be aware that there is a very sizable audience out there younger than us (I'm 40), who haven't seen those films.......this is all new to them.  As far as Hollywood beancounters are concerned, these ""kids"" represent a huge amount of the revenue.  I see a ton of re-tread on film and TV constantly...but us ""'ol timers"" should keep some prespective.  Some might even say there aren't many really ""new"" stories for movies....at least not ones that would sell anyway.<br/><br/>And comparing this movie to 'Replacements' is like comparing sugarless bubble-gum to a boilermaker (a shot & a beer).  Gimme a break!<br/><br/>As for the numerous Europeans & Aussies out there who complained and said American football is for sissies......   HEY!  You KNEW what the movie was about before you saw it, and you don't see us (relatively) uninformed and unappreciative yanks whining about YOUR games do ya?!<br/><br/>-end of rant"

","So American Football eh? A nancy's version of rugby replete with body armour and lax rules about forward passes or a game of tactics and skill played by honed athletes? Whatever your opinion on the game, you will be able to enjoy Oliver Stone's homage to that strange American 'sport'. This is mainly due to the blistering match sequences, which are the most realistic of any sports film with shaky cameras and frame jumping creating a truly kinetic feeling of action and bringing home the impact of the crunching tackles thrown by these human breeze blocks. Stone also evokes the testosterone-fuelled atmosphere of the front line with savage growls laid over the sound and cutting in of images to realise the aggression.<br/><br/>However, these same techniques are totally inappropriate in the more dramatic scenes but Stone insists on employing them, erasing any tension that may have been established previously. Unfortunately this undoes a lot of the actors' good work, we all know Al Pacino can rage without him having to be symbolised with lightning strikes and feral snarls. The cast performs well though; I don't think anyone would doubt Pacino's suitability for playing the beleagured coach, so the real impression is made by comedian Jamie Foxx as the upstart quarterback with the talent to lift the team to greatness but an attitude which could instead bring it to it's knees. Cameron Diaz is okay in a role which was far from made for her but, like the rest of the female characters, is little more than a money grabbing bitch.<br/><br/>The main story is the obligatory one for any sports movie, with a team struggling to overcome their difficulties and win a tournament - at least with American Football it can't go to penalties. It's disappointing that no one could come up with an alternative to this, although in 'Any Given Sunday' there are at least a couple of sideplots in which to take interest. These could have been developed further, and perhaps originally were; surely James Woods and Matthew Modine as the warring physios warrant more screen time than they are given here. Perhaps it was their scenes which were left on the cutting room floor to accomodate Stone's visual excesses."
"Minofed","Null","0","0","16 January 2001"," Just Tell the Story
","Oliver Stone refuses to let a good story get in the way of his razzle-dazzle directing technique in `Any Given Sunday.'  In chronicling four games late in the season of the fictitious Miami Sharks, he touches on everything he thinks is wrong with pro football: Violence, sex, injuries, drugs, racism, individualism, servitude and the economics that force a city to build a stadium or lose its team.  He tells his story through a combination of quick cuts, slow motion, split/screen, music videos-even the interspersing of scenes from `Ben-Hur,' whose star Charlton Heston makes a cameo in this film.  <br/><br/>Stone also has a thing for stunt casting.  A bit of this, especially in sports films, is okay.  And a few of the castings here, such as Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown, work.  But every opposing coach is a former NFL star-Johnny Unitas, Dick Butkus, etc.-and Stone doesn't realize their familiar faces only distract viewers and  drives home the point that we're not dealing with reality. <br/><br/>Stone casts Al Pacino as Sharks' coach Tony D'Amato.  But Pacino continues a habit he has picked up over the years of screaming almost every line.  Watch Pacino's understated performances in the first two `Godfather' films, then imagine what it would be like if any older Michael Corleone were coaching the Sharks.  Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, James Woods and John McGinley fare better in their roles.  And Jamie Foxx shines as the third string quarterback who Pacino must nurture to maturity.<br/><br/>Finally, the movie ends by giving the Shark's Dallas opponents the worse looking football uniforms anyone has ever seen, and with Pacino announcing a decision that catches his team off guard-something that could never happen in the real world.<br/><br/>The best football film ever made was 1979's `North Dallas Forty.'  It covered much the same ground as `Any Given Sunday,' and even had its own bit of stunt casting (using current and former NFL stars in some roles).  But it didn't let the director's technique get in the way of the story.  My advice: Rent that film instead of this one."
"Captain Ed","3","0","0","16 January 2001"," Boring, annoying, and pretentious (SPOILERS!)
","This is almost like shooting ducks in a barrel.  This football movie was made by people who don't know or understand football, and it shows.<br/><br/>The plot -- what there is of it -- is taken from Sports Film 101: struggling team with internal dissension, aging star/hip new rookie, coach past his prime trying to reach back for just one more win, blah blah blah.  Guess who wins the big game at the end of the film?  And since this is an Oliver Stone film, it tries to be cutting edge and revelatory by showing that athletes (gasp) sometimes abuse chemicals to play!  Sometimes they use bad language too, and one or two of them treat women badly.  What a shocker.  I guess no one involved with AGS ever saw North Dallas Forty, a truly seminal film about professional sports.  <br/><br/>Getting past the trite plots and subplots, the direction of this film was bizarre.  Stone has made the longest music video in history.  Every scene -- and I mean EVERY scene -- is jarringly presenting in quick cuts and odd camera angles.  Most of the movie uses overlays of old game films and pictures of old football players.  There are frequent times when the pictures go out of focus and the colors mutate -- I can't describe it any better than that.  The effect of all this film-school technique is for Stone to shout at you, ""LOOK AT ME!! I'M AN IMPORTANT DIRECTOR!!""  This film scales the heights of pretentiousness and self-indulgence.<br/><br/>The direction is not the only technical aspect that's botched.  At times, the sound editing is so bad that I had to turn on the subtitles in order to understand the dialog.  (I was watching the movie on DVD with a brand-new surround-sound system.)  At times, the audio sync seemed off.  And the uniforms were atrocious, especially those of the Dallas Knights.  I've seen better uniforms on high-school teams.<br/><br/>The acting?  Well, Pacino was okay, but he was terribly mis-cast in this role.  What normal human being looks at Pacino and says, ""Football coach""? Lela Rochon (who went to my high school) is the ONLY sympathetic woman in this movie, and I suspect that's because her character held no power.  All of the other women in this film come across as castrating bitches, especially an unintentionally hilarious performance by Lauren Holly. Ann-Margret was treated a little more kindly, but she was drunk throughout the entire movie.  Cameron Diaz got to play the Delta Burke role from HBO's ""First and Ten"", which aired about fifteen years ago.  Jamie Foxx isn't bad but his character is ridiculous and his character's elevation to star status is completely unbelievable.  I will agree with one previous reviewer about Lawrence Taylor -- he's great in this film, as is Jim Brown.  James Woods is wasted in a stupid subplot that is so totally undeveloped and yet so trite that you're glad to see him go at about the two-hour mark.<br/><br/>It's become clear that Stone is increasingly incapable of producing a coherent film, and you have to wonder why he keeps getting financing. Probably because the sheep flock to his movies and convince themselves ex post facto of his supposed brilliance.  This movie is a waste of time.  Even the pedestrian ""Replacements"" is more entertaining than this."
"Kevin1963","Null","0","0","10 January 2001"," A Long Movie With No Story
","Like many of the other commenters have already mentioned, the Oliver Stone syle of movie-making continues with ""Any Given Sunday"".  Each scene is interspersed with quick film edits that can give one a headache.  But I wouldn't have minded that if there was a story to tell.  Basically, it is 120 minutes of football action mixed with about 30 minutes of non-football action.  There really isn't any story told here and what is told is not unique.  You've seen the controlling female owner before in the old HBO series ""First and Ten"".  You've seen drug use in ""North Dallas Forty"". You've seen dirty and rough play and mangy characters in ""The Longest Yard"". And each one of those shows was more entertaining than ""Any Given Sunday"".<br/><br/>Al Pacino is sorely miscast as the maligned head coach, probably his worst role in his first-class acting career.  My guess is that he wanted to work with Oliver Stone again (they did Scarface together) and took the first thing that came along.  I also thought Cameron Diaz, who has actually become a fine actress, just goes through the motions in this one.  But I will say that I was very impressed with the NFL Hall of Famer Lawrence Taylor's performance in this film as the great linebacker in his last days on the gridiron.  He isn't on screen that much, but he is convincing.<br/><br/>There's great camerawork in the football action scenes as Stone put cameras on players to get as close to the action as possible.  But if he could have put an interesting story to it, I'd give it more consideration as a great film.  But it is only about a 2.5 out of 5 for me."

It was really a movie about how a brilliant coach (Pacino) finds ways to connect with and motivate his people. He doesn't give up on his most difficult player ""the maverick"" played by Foxx. Coach D'Amato puts up with a lot of crap from many factions, including the bitchy general manager (Diaz) and the unethical team doctor (Woods). But it all pays off for him while the credits are rolling (surprise ending)! The only bad part of this flick was the sound editing -- WAY TOO MUCH ambient noise constantly drowns out the dialogue.

"JBoze313","Null","0","0","6 January 2001"," Like two separate movies-the first one being quite mediocre.
","Overall, Any Given Sunday is a good watch.  It has a great deal of action, and some of the game scenes are actually very well done, minus a lot of jerky camera moves that do nothing to help the story or action.<br/><br/>This movie is like two movies in one.   The majority of the movie was like a bad music video, with nonstop weirdness when it came to camera shots/angles, weird fade outs, blurry and out of focus shots, etc.  The game scenes in the first half of the film are just horrible.  Sometimes there's game action sound, then sometimes everything is drowned up by rap music that is WAY too loud. Then...you have the fact that one second, everything is slow and methodical, then BAM, fast and crazy again.  It works every now and then, but every single time...no way.  It becomes way too annoying. I have never really liked Stone, besides his work on JFK (even tho half of the movie is factually wrong.)  His direction takes away from the story itself, and the characters and plot are just secondary items that hold the music video- like segments together.  That's not how a movie is supposed to work.  A good movie uses the cast and story as a basis, and works off of that.  A lot of the time, I couldn't tell if this was a straight up movie or a documentary...the first half being much more a documentary, the second being a movie.  In the first half you'll have a shot of a player, then the screen will divide in half, the right side being full-frame, the left dividing into 3 or 4 other smaller shots of the exact same shot as the right side.  Too much of that is annoying, and it makes Stone look like a recent film school grad who can't wait to try out some new tricks.  He overuses them all.  If he would have just toned down the first half--cut out the jerky, dizzying shots every two seconds, this would have been a great film. Then again, maybe not, because the middle of the film drags on forever. The beginning is full of football scenes, as is this end, but the middle is a nonstop mix of overacted dullness. Another thing that might annoy is the fact that all the characters seem to suddenly become new people overnight in the middle of the film.  Jamie Foxx's character is a complete A-hole who always has the look of death on his face, then suddenly he changes into this nice, funny, charming guy, who is so nice he tries to get his girlfriend back, and is all joking with her. I find that hard to grasp.  People don't usually change overnight, and if, by some miracle, they do, it's not like that! Anyhow...it's a good watch, especially if you love football, but a lot of people will find the direction completely missing the mark.  The second half of the movie is very well done and very tense...you know how it's going to turn out, but you can't help but be caught up in the action biting your nails down to nothing...if only Stone had done the first half as well as the second, and took out the artsy crap, it would have been so much better."

","It's not if you win or lose, it's how you play the game.  Football as a metaphor for life; you have to fight for every inch, on the field, as in life.  Or perhaps on the `playing' field that `is' life.  Take your pick, you get the idea; whatever you choose you can bet it's a concept director Oliver Stone apparently seems to think he originated in his over-long, self-indulgent miasma `Any Given Sunday,' starring Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz and Dennis Quaid.  A decent movie?  Yes.  Original?  No.  Stone pulls out every cliche in the book, twists it all like so much play dough to put his own spin on it and serves it up like so many hot dogs you can buy at the stadium while you watch his fictitious Miami Sharks play.  The recipe for this particular potpourri includes the quarterback willing to play-through-the-pain-for-the-team; the third-stringer whose success goes to his head; discrimination; locker room scene after locker room scene that play like, well, locker room scenes; players with names like `Madman,' `Beastman,' `J-Man,' `Shark' and `Cap;' a ruthless, young General Manager/owner who inherited the position from her father; the unethical team physician whose diagnoses of injured players coincide with the needs of the team; the young, ethical assistant team physician; and the legendary coach who just wants to inspire his team and win one more.  The title of this film could have been `Any Given Sports Film.' All of which may seem contradictory after stating that this is a `decent' film.  Perhaps.  But understand that by decent I mean that this movie was, if nothing else, a professional endeavor that was packaged and delivered in a way you would expect from the star-studded cast Stone assembled here. The problem lies with Stone, whose work on this project fairly rings of arrogance and self aggrandizement.  All of the aforementioned `potpourri' ingredients, for instance, are actually legitimate aspects of this story; but in Stone's hands the legitimate comes across as cliche, while any attempt at profundity seems merely pretentious.  His endless use of slow motion photography during the game sequences ultimately has a nullifying effect on the drama it is, I assume, meant to enhance; and it's a perfect example of the excesses he allowed himself that give this movie the sense of pretending to be something it is not.  It's a case of the artist who is too close to his work being given too much freedom, or in this case, enough rope with which to hang himself. Pacino is a star, always larger than life, with an incomparable screen presence from whom we've come to expect a certain quality of performance. And here, as Coach Tony D'Amato, he certainly does not disappoint.  That his character lacks originality is not his fault; it's the part he was given and he makes the most of it.  To his credit he keeps him interesting, even though this is a guy you've seen a number of times in just as many movies. Cameron Diaz does not fare as well; she simply was not given the time necessary to develop her character, Christina Pagniacci (The time was available, but Stone chose to use it for yet nine or ten more slow-mo close-ups of a hand reaching, reaching, reaching for a football prominently featuring the `Wilson' brand), and Dennis Quaid fell victim as well with his portrayal of Cap Rooney.  Jamie Foxx fared as well as anyone involved as third-string quarterback Willie Beamen, and there are some notable supporting performances from Lawrence Taylor (Shark), LL Cool J (J-Man) James Woods (Dr. Mandrake), Matthew Modine (Dr. Powers) and Ann-Margret (Margaret Pagniacci).  Charlton Heston, however, is wasted in a cameo as the Commissioner of the League. Some would say you do not necessarily have to like football to like this movie; that may be true.  Subjectively, I would say that to like this movie at all, you must approach it with very low expectations (and it certainly wouldn't hurt if you did like football).  As I see it, with `Any Given Sunday' Oliver Stone lowered the bar and allowed himself to step over the line, which is especially disappointing in light of the fact that this is the director who gave us such excellent, thought-provoking films as `Platoon,' `JFK,' and `Born On The Fourth Of July.'  And in the future, I'm sure he'll add more titles to that list; unfortunately, this film will not be one of them.  I rate this one 4/10."

","Funniest (and most accurate) description of Any Given Sunday that I've heard? Tackling Private Ryan. For a football movie, it's pretty damn epic (epic, in movie terms, has come to describe any movie over two and a half hours). I liked it. I liked it quite a bit. It's kind of a patchwork of about a dozen football movie cliches sewn into one, all under one of the modern masters of film, Oliver Stone. The old quarterback, trying desperately to hold on, the young rookie, nipping at his heels, the duelling doctors, one in it for the fame, the other well, for the fame, but with some concern for the players, the player risking brain damage if he can just hold out for one more game, the new female owner (surprise! she's a power hungry b****), you get the idea by now. Any of these cliches by themselves would make for a pretty crappy movie, but when you throw them all together, when you only spend a little time on each one, and when you mix them Stone's hyper kinetic, MTV style football clips you get a thrilling experience. I also appreciated the lack of on-the-field football cliches here, since you cannot decipher any sort of plays being made. It's all footballs being thrown, guys being tackled, and cheering crowds. Good performances by the whole cast (and what a cast! Stone's out-done himself once again in casting familiar faces). Pachino gives a surprisingly restrained performance here, as his character is supposed to be old, tired, and almost over the hill. James Woods is a scene stealer (as usual). Stone's one of the greats, so please, don't knock him for doing a football movie. I've heard some people say, ""He's the man behind Natural Born Killers, JFK, Platoon, Nixon, Born on the Fourth of July, and now he's doing this?"". The man has paid his dues, if he wants to do a football movie, no one is more entitled to do so. Now, if it were a bad football movie, I'd be the first one to complain, but it's not. 7/10 stars.

"Philby-3","Null","0","0","2 January 2001"," Stone's view of stone-age combat
","To us down here in Australia, American Football is a very weird game indeed. Played largely indoors on artificial turf by mountainous men armoured like riot police, every play pre-programmed and radio-controlled by the coach, an hour's play spread over maybe three hours, interminable time-outs and constant changes of personnel. Although it's `football' there's not a lot of kicking (of the ball that is). There's plenty of hard knocking though, especially on interceptions, which would lead to instant send-offs in other codes. There's also over-dependence on one player, the quarterback, for touchdowns, since most moves are programmed to get him the ball. The star system and rigorous teamwork are uneasy bedfellows.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone, a pretty bombastic director at the best of times, is in his element here. He obviously loves the game (we see him, eyes bright, shouting `God I love football' in a small supporting role as a TV commentator), and at the same time, he wants us to share his disgust at various aspects of it  the commercialization, big business ownership, mistreatment of players (especially blacks who constitute 70% of major league players) etc. But Ollie is a showman first, and he puts on a great show for us, his handheld camera everywhere on the pitch, amplified crunches and groans as the behemoths collide, soaring passes, roaring crowds and tension, tension, tension. It's all artificial of course, but still a theatre with something to say about the human condition, if from a peculiarly American perspective. Strangely, we see nothing from the fans' perspective, though the reptiles of the press get some exposure.<br/><br/>Da Coach, the central element in stories of this kind, is Tony, played by Al Pacino. It's a beautifully judged performance from one of the best film actors of the last 30 years and worth the ticket price alone. After 30 years he's over the hill, new, unsympathetic female owner whose inherited the team from her father, three straight losses in a row, his team hit by injury, trouble with a stroppy new quarterback, no other life worth mentioning, his family upped and left long ago. Al, in his world weary but intense style, makes this bucket of clichés worthy of our sympathy and respect.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast are competent enough, Jamie Foxx as Beamen the new quarterback, and Dennis Quaid as the old one, standing out. I also liked James Woods as the unscrupulous team doctor stretching the Hippocratic oath to breaking point to keep players in the team, and Charlton Heston in a brief appearance oozed brutal power as the Football Commissioner. Cameron Dias as the rich young bitch owner was oddly weak  she never really rises to be a threat to Da Coach  and Ann-Margret as her drunken mother did not have a part worthy of her.<br/><br/>So that's American Football at the turn of the century. My fearless prediction is that in 50 years time it will be played by robots controlled by computers linked to input devices under the fan's bums. The rest of the world will go on with the real mind game, soccer, while those primitives amongst us still in the Stone Age who like a bit of intelligent argy-bargy will be catered for by Rugby Union, Rugby League and of course, Australian Rules Football."

If you know football, you can easily follow this movie. The camera shots in this movie where great.  Stone does a fantastic job of not shooting this film like a TV game.  Instead, he primarily focuses on the individuals of the game, using close-ups and oblique angles to make the movie more realistic and intense.  If you know football, not just a fan that watches the game, you'll know that this movie is realistic.  From playing football myself, what goes on the field is depicted better than any other movie I have seen.<br/><br/>Don't worry if you're not interested in the on field performances though. The plot goes deeper than one might see from a distance.  There is so many uses of symbolism that Stone uses that it is masterful.  The camera work by far outweighs any of the great performances that Pacino or Diaz pulls. This is the way the game is. In someone's comments, this person mentions that they hoped real NFL players didn't behave this way.  In response to this, watching this movie probably gives the viewer an insight into what pro football is really like. Although it's scary, this stuff actually happens almost weekly -- From the locker room, to the on field discussions and pile-ups.  I can't think of anything that doesn't happen or that hasn't happened (including an almost cheesy part with a certain players eye- yes it has happened).<br/><br/>Personally I liked the movie if they would have ended it before the credits.

","What seemed like a great combination, Oliver Stone and football, unfortunately produced pretty mediocre results.  A real football game is much more entertaining--if you ever have to chose between the two there should be no question.<br/><br/>Stone never really lets us ""see"" a game.  He puts us on the playing field, to give us a realistic, shocking, jarring experience that real football players endure, in between cuts to the scoreboard.  This works at times, since one of the movie's main themes is the serious injury that football players risk every game they play, all for money, fame, and the fans.  But this is all that Stone really gives us concerning the football sequences. The more recent high school/tolerance film ""Remember the Titans"" actually gave us better football sequences, with a better understanding of strategy, plays, and action.<br/><br/>From what I understand, Oliver Stone tried to get the permission of the NFL to use real logos and team names, and he was unsuccessful.  This unfortunately lead to what is possibly the movie's greatest weakness--the fictional uniforms.  This is actually much more important than it might appear; A team's logo and look are critical to team sales, and sales are also important to a team's success.  The uniforms in this movie are ugly, dull, and poorly contrasted--they are distracting and don't look like NFL uniforms picked by researchers at all, but more like the work of a production designer given only a matter of weeks to decide on every team's appearance.  This contributes to the huge fantasy world that this film takes place in, with fictional cities and team names as well, and it all results in a setting that is unbelievable.<br/><br/>The movie has a somewhat decent script, and performances by Jaime Fox, Dennis Quaid, and Al Pacino are all pretty good.  The supporting cast is also quite colorful and entertaining to watch.  If you're a football fan or an admirer of Oliver Stone, then it's worth a look, but not if there is a real football game on!

"Godzcomic","Null","0","0","10 December 2000"," The most hard-hitting, top-notch film about sports in years
","Oliver Stone has created the most hard-hitting, top-notch film about sports in recent years, with stylish direction and great performances all around in Any Given Sunday. A movie with such versatile qualities, even for those who don't like sports, will take them on a high speed ride.<br/><br/>The prominent director decided to use the same style he used in his previous, underappreciated films Natural Born Killers and U-Turn.<br/><br/>The over-the-top direction, stylish, jittery camerawork and raunchy soundtrack has led some renowned U.S. critics to call the movie a shamelessMTV music video rip-off and even a nonsensical TV commercial (despite the fact that cinematographer Salvatore Totino has worked on many music video and TV ads).<br/><br/>But the result is an exhilarating, if not chaotic, in-your-face portraya of the bloody sport.<br/><br/>The premise about a proud rising sports star and a coach trying to make his team win back the game, however, sounds familiar. But Stone's sure-handed direction makes the difference.<br/><br/>Interesting characters develop nicely, including an Armani-wearing player, Julian, played by rapper LL. Cool J., a weasel orthopedist of the team played by James Fox and doubting quarterback Cap Rooney.<br/><br/>Fine performances from well-known actors also highlight the film, including those of Matthew Modine and veteran Charles Heston.<br/><br/>Stone keeps the more than two-and-a-half-hour duration tense and never boring. Everything moves so fast and every second is accounted for, just like in the sport itself.<br/><br/>When the film slows down and ear-throbbing music changes to slower music,including American Indian chanting, the movie is at its most tense.<br/><br/>Stone uses all kinds of unusual camera angles and rapid editing to give the strongest impact to audiences.<br/><br/>One should be forewarned, however, that this film is not for very young viewers. Locker room scenes are full of male nudity. The scenes on the football field are so vicious and include an eyeball being poked out of its socket.<br/><br/>Coach Tony D'Amato's character says in the film: ""On any given Sunday, you're gonna win or you're gonna lose. The point is: can you win or lose like a man?""<br/><br/>This film certainly is a winner, baby. Put your helmet on!"
"Shiva-11","6","0","0","28 December 1999"," Some fine performances, but it's too long to keep you involved
","Any Given Sunday: Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), the coach of the Miami Sharks (a once great football team) is a hard drinking, no nonsense legend, used to making deals on a handshake.  D'Amato believes in only one thing - the purity of the game - which makes him as an anachronism in a world filled with showboating free-agents interested in nothing but self promotion and portfolio building.  <br/><br/>After losing his star quarterback to an injury D'Amato calls on Willie Beaman - an unproven third stringer, to break the team's slump, and is surprised when the new boy actually delivers.  Faster than you can snap a football, Beaman is transformed - breaks up with his girlfriend of several years, starts making commercials, ditches the playbook, and begins aggravating his teammates.  Add a cantankerous female owner, who wants to win at all costs, and you have one very stressed out coach.<br/><br/>There seems to a belief among directors that in order for their films to be considered ""serious cinema"" they must be at least two and a half hours long (we can thank/blame Oliver Stone for this).   When they deliver the goods, you don't even notice the length.  When they fail, time can't go fast enough.  Sunday falls square in the no-man's land between the two.<br/><br/>Stone's initial thesis - football as a symbol of the decline of a bygone age based on honor and reliance upon one's fellow man - is compelling and strong enough to carry a film.  Unfortunately, even with three hours to tell his story, Stone can't decide what he wants to say.  Instead he chooses to veer off on multiple tangents, and devotes valuable time trying to build up several irrelevant subplots that contribute nothing and ultimately hamstring his efforts.  Thankfully there are some good performances.<br/><br/>Whether mob kingpin, or the devil himself, Pacino giving it his all is the closest you will get to a sure thing in Hollywood.  D'Amato's life-as-sport philosophizing is balanced by his frequent tirades, and withdrawn agony.  In the hands of an inexperienced actor D'Amato would have been little more than a caricature, but Pacino treads carefully and takes pains not to overshadow his colleagues. <br/><br/>Jamie Foxx does an admirable job in his first serious outing, as does LL Cool J (just forget about ""In Too Deep"" and you'll be fine).  Dennis Quaid is believable as the injured superstar - he grimaces so well that you will feel his pain.  The weak link in this film is Cameron Diaz, who tries too hard to be a tough guy - it requires more than being able to shriek and curse people out."

"TxMike","Null","0","0","28 November 2000"," Good ""football"" film that ends up missing the mark a bit.
","Oliver Stone is a good director. He did one of my favorites, ""Nixon"". However, in this film he gets too caught up with ""football for football's sake"" which ends up turning a pretty good film into a mediocre one.  A few examples - too many gratuitous shots of himself acting as a reporter, obvious use of former football stars, Johnny Unitas, Dick Butkus, Warren Moon, Barry Switzer, Y.A. Tittle as opposing coaches, or a cameo by Charleton Heston against a backdrop of Heston's Gladiator movie used in the film.  Each one of these is ""cute"", but so many of them takes attention from what should have been a more serious treatment of his subject. Still, for the good football action plus a decent story, I rate it ""7"" of 10. The DD 5.1 surround sound on DVD is very good, and it makes you feel like you are on the field during action scenes, with player grunts and equipment sounds all around you. There is also a good ""making of"" feature on the DVD.<br/><br/>CAUTION - SPOILERS - my narration of events follows... The film starts with a quote from Lomardi, about the ""field of battle"". Then cut to a game in progress. The Miami Sharks had lost the last 3 but were leading. Their qb (Quaide) is injured, the 2nd qb is injured on his first play, and the 3rd qb (Jaime Foxx) didn't even know the playbook yet. Coach (Pacino) plays it safe and loses the game. Qb vomits each game when he goes in!<br/><br/>Next game, brash and confident qb Foxx ignores coaches, calls his own plays, wins game.  Overconfident, and not a team player, he alienates his girlfriend, the coach, and all players and becomes ineffective.  Only the owner (Cameron Diaz) likes him, because he is exciting and brings in money!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Diaz is planning secretly to transfer the team to L.A., or to sell it. Very harshly evaluates coach Pacino. Several long speeches about ""teamwork"", and seeing the injured qb back in action, inspires qb Foxx making him realize what a heel he had been, apologises to his teammates, everyone pulls together, his qb sneak wins big playoff game aainst Dallas.<br/><br/>As credits roll, coach Pacino announces he will not be Miami coach next year, which pleases Diaz, however announces he will coach expansion Arizona team, and further, will take prize qb Foxx with him.  Team owner Diaz not happy.<br/><br/>During the film there is ample nudity. Coach with prostitute. Owner Diaz walking into locker room while men are showering, including frontal male nudity. Lots of R-rated language in the film.  In leisure time, football players behave like animals. I hope the real professional players, that we are paying $millions, are better humans than that."

","A return to the rhetorical, bomabastic, paranoia-driven style of Oliver Stone filmmaking after the brief refreshment that was ""U-Turn"". Here, Stone turns his attention to professional football as a metaphor for race relations and old American virtues versus new American slash-and-burn viewpoints. Al Pacino is the old-school coach of a struggling team (apparently, Stone couldn't use the NFL, so the league is known as the AFA--with totally unconvincing uniforms to boot) whose aging quarterback (Dennis Quaid) is replaced after an injury by an upstart (Jamie Foxx). The fact that Foxx is black (read: impudent) and popular causes the friction between Pacino and team owner Cameron Diaz and provides most of the drama. Everyone is totally miscast but that doesn't seem to bother the director as he continually searches for each character's vulnerability in order to exploit it. When he does find it, the character is proven to be a sham, most notably Diaz, reduced at the end to be nothing more than a mere woman. It's insulting to say the least. The cast Stone has assembled is huge: in addition to the above-mentioned performers, there's also Ann-Margaret (wasted), James Woods (funny as ever), Matthew Modine, Lawrence Taylor, Charleston Heston, Lauren Holly, Lela Rochon and Elizabeth Berkeley. But it's typical Stone: screeching and hollering with flashy editing to little effect."

This being said, Stone certainly does show us the power that the game of football glorifies.

","The movie was entertaining. I give Oliver Stone that. But it also was filled with stereotypes and most of all it didn't have a plot whatsoever. The outcome of the movie (not counting Coach D'Amato's ""plans"" at the end) was very predictable. Underdog team beats the odds and wins the big game in the final seconds, overcoming selfishness and times of doubt. C'mon, we already saw that in ""Major League"" and if we're completely honest we see that in every sports-flick that appears on the big screen. But I'm not saying by any means that ""Any given Sunday"" was a waste of time. It's gives you an inside look into the world of professional football, especially from a Quarterback's point of view and a coaching standpoint. It's a movie about teamplay and the principle ""One for all, all for one"". So, during the 3 hours running time I did not feel like it was a bad movie after all. But after the 3 hours I asked myself ""Was that all?"". Because something was missing. And since nobody I talked to could tell me what the movie was all about I'd say it's the plot or lack thereof."

","Stone's overstated style is evident here, although he turned it down a notch compared to ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Nixon.""  In places it works, as he's trying to illustrate that there are human realities beneath the carnival of glitz that is professional football.  No film has done a better job of portraying on-field action and conveying what a player sees during play. As a player on the college level, these sequences took my breath away.  The story, while simply a collage of real-life issues and situations affecting pro sports, is compelling, if somewhat tarnished by a predictable ending. Stone gets great performances out of a strong cast:  Pacino shines in one of his best performances of the last 10 years,Jamie Foxx looked and acted like a brash qb, and Dennis Quaid was the perfect battered, John Elway-type hero. Cameron Diaz gave the witch-owner character a level of complexity.  She showed glimpses of something more under the corporate shark's skin than a taste for blood.  James Woods, Lawrence Taylor (really!), Lauren Holly, LL Cool J, also shine. Although verisimilitude is pushed to it's limits with Willie Beamen's (Foxx) meteoric rise to the ""Sports Illustrated"" cover and endorsement deals after only one start, no other film has better showed the pains and joys of the game, and the machine of bigtime sports.

","I love sports and sports flicks.  That is the very reason I didn't care for this film.  This film is not a film about football; it is a film about Oliver Stone.  With `Any Given Sunday', Stone has created his most ambitious tribute to his own megalomania.  This film is a classic example of excessive style negating substance.  Stone was so intent on showing us the sizzle, that he cooked all of the flavor out of the steak.  A good director uses innovative technique to enhance the telling of the story.  An egomaniac uses the story as an excuse to show off his talent and creativity.  The result of such self-indulgence is almost always a diminishment of the final product.<br/><br/>Here Stone tries to out-hip the hip generation of directors by providing a staccato progression of weird angles, extreme close-ups and disjointed perspective shots with so many jump cuts that it makes `The Limey' look like it is on tranquilizers.  I have never seen so much dialogue delivered by actors with half their heads cut off.  The hand held football sequences were dreadful; as cameras were pounded into the turf without regard to the action that we were supposed to be following.  The entire movie was like a three-hour music video, with images flitting willy-nilly as if they were being shot by a drunken mosquito.  Ironically, Stone failed to learn the lesson learned by Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) in the story; that is that the good of the whole is more important than the glory of the individual.<br/><br/>It is a pity, because buried beneath all this decadent directorial tripe, there was a good sports story and some terrific acting.  We saw how money and greed adulterates the sport and how athletes too often become selfish and conceited as they bask in the limelight.  There was also the drama of the comeback in the critical game, which was dissipated by Stone's erratic camera work and editing.<br/><br/>Al Pacino gave a great performance as the legendary coach past his prime, who let his pride stand in the way of the team's success.  Cameron Diaz rose above her accustomed quirky lightweight roles to deliver a stunning performance as the hard-as-nails club owner trying to move out of her dead father's shadow.  Jamie Foxx was electric as the third string quarterback who explodes into the public eye and begins taking himself far too seriously, evoking the ire of his teammates.<br/><br/>This film had a great cast and a solid story that was marred by a narcissistic director who rendered it annoying to watch.  I rated it a 5/10. It's a shame, because I love sports stories and I never got a chance to enjoy this one."

","Any given Sunday was great! The acting by AL Pacino was very solid and flawless.  Any given Sunday has cool hits and effects like rain or mud.  The hits and plays where executed realisticly  like when they threw a deep pass it looked like one.  Any given Sunday also does a very good job of showing the off the field situation.  The best part of the movie though is on the football  field.  If your fan of football this is a must-see.  My verdict is an 8/10."

","I was in awe while watching this movie, I really was.  I love it - every little aspect of it (well, except for that sugary ending). To me, it wasn't just a movie, it was an entire stream of thought - Oliver Stone just happens to present his thoughts as movies.  I loved it because it deals with subject close to me - I am an aspiring professional football player (albeit in a different code), and I am also studying sociology of sport at university.  If I could ever arrange my ideas and opinions in the fashion that Oliver Stone has, I would die a happy man. People need to look a little bit deeper that the storyline of this movie, and the characters involved. As I said, this is my favourite movie of all time."

","With all the great talent that is associated with this film, you would think that it was a must see film.  Well believe me when I say that it's more of a must miss film. The story for this film is fantastic.  The choice of actors is superb.  The reason that I feel you shouldn't rush out and rent this one right away, is the director.  I know, I know it's Oliver Stone you say.  Yes, JFK was great, Wall Street was excellent, and I even liked Nixon, but I don't know what Mr. Stone was thinking when he envisioned  making this movie. <br/><br/>Specifically, I didn't like the football sequences.  Anyone who has seen this film will understand when I say that they were too short, and the camera angles were horrible set-up. I understand fully that the film is not just about the action on the grass, but the scenes were just too poorly shot to forget and not take into consideration when reviewing this film. This reviewer happened to enjoy Varsity Blues for the exact opposite reason I disliked Any Given Sunday.  Varsity Blues was able to hold a great story line while having some spectacular football scenes. Now I must reiterate, it is my opinion that you do not stand in line to rent this movie next week, but instead get your best friend (Michael) to pay for it and watch it at their house."
"Adz-4","Null","0","0","2 August 2000"," Just my opinion!
","Why is it that people persist in looking for criticism. Now if you had a problem with the acting or something, that is fine. I personally thought it was exceptional. But why must people claim they didn't like this film because they are not ""sports fans"". Or they don't like Stone or Pacino, or they don't like loud noise. This is ridiculous criticism as it does not criticise the movie, but simply states it doesn't relate to your interests. Those who criticise the plot of this movie, who call it ""sugar coated"" or some other term, have missed something. First of all, you are looking way too hard for criticism, because if you believe the exterior of this movie is ""sweet"" then the movie has indeed achieved its purpose, to entertain. What does it matter what is beneath if what you could clearly see was great? Does not matter anyway because there was no single plot in this film, rather several simultaneous stories, or ""battles"". This sport was portrayed like war, and each sub-plot was a battle of the war. Old versus young, tradition versus change, girl versus boy, money versus passion, there are endless themes. This film was indeed intellectual, but in a different sense of the word. It was smart in its ability to portray these themes successfully, but filled with passion and rationality at the same time. These characters DID have incredible depth, vulnerability and confusion, love and desires, backgrounds. Bottom line is this film is full of action! It isn't all about the action, but it is fast and furious with raw power! It is not exhausting but enthralling and exciting. The film edited to brilliance, with the most amazing football scenes I have seen. ""Rudy"" turned football into poetry and dreams, which was magnificent, this movie turned football into war with fire, toughness, brute force and inspiration. There were great speeches made throughout that made you feel strong. This movie was about another side of humanity, about the ones who participate in this sport, and anything of similar nature. These men and women (Cameron Diaz, Lauren Holly) are tough, not heartless, just tough and passionate about something, and what that was differed among them. Some of the football scenes gave such an incredible adrenalin rush particularly with the soundtrack behind it. It really pumped you up, but the feel of it, the way the movie hangs around you afterwards, it has a different feel about it, the movie was a little dark, a bit alternative (by no means a cliche). I am still thinking about days later, that was how powerful it is, with the enormous football stunts and flips...I mean it gave such impact. Like the players, this movie was tough and strong and full of powerful. Don't criticise it by finding weaknesses or calling it ""sugar coated"" because this movie is not weak or sweet, it is tough and powerful...and I felt..inspirational! Thanks, go see it!"

","Any Given Sunday is a very good film about what goes on behind the scenes of pro football.  Al Pachino is very good as usual and Cameron Diaz is just as powerful.

Also, there are some inconsistencies in the football scores and scheduling.<br/><br/>This aside, I would recommend this film for anyone who is not sensitive to what they see."

","As with other Oliver Stone films like JFK, Nixon, or even Natural Born Killers, ""Any Given Sunday"" raises intelligent questions and issues to its subject, in this case American Football. Is someone married to a footballer because they love the person, the game or merely the glamour and social opportunities that come with it? If you're injured, do you keep playing on, risking further injury or do you take a break, only to be overshadowed by another up-and-coming star waiting in the wings? I enjoyed Any Given Sunday, because there was much to think about after it was over like what I've just mentioned.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed seeing Al Pacino playing a frustrated, world-weary coach. With a voice like his, it doesn't matter that he's shorter than the team he's coaching! Equally impressive was Cameron Diaz as the Miami Sharks' Manager who stands up well against Tony's (Al Pacino's) temper and regards the team as merely an asset among many assets. And then there's Jamie Foxx. Just as he played an up-and-coming quarterback in the film, he is surely an up-and-coming film star in his own right. What a performance!<br/><br/>Seeing Oliver Stone's appearance as a commentator seemed to suggest to me that he must have had a great time making this movie. Watching a game he obviously loves, being played by teams he created and playing the way he wanted adds up to having a great time in my book!<br/><br/>Although I have only watched an American Football Game only once (Denver Vs San Diego at Stadium Australia, Sydney) and don't know much of the game, I nonetheless enjoyed this film because of the power-house performances and the trademark Oliver Stone wit and intelligence. Its frequent camera movement and pumping soundtrack give it a colorful pop video effect which for me made the film more memorable."

","If Oliver Stone had not made On Any Given Sunday, I don't think there is a director alive that could have made this film. As soon as the movie begins you realize that you are in the presence of a director that is beyond the realm of the ordinary because your senses are assaulted by extraordinary action, sounds that transport the viewer into the epicenter of mayhem and camera shots that I've never seen matched before. After leaving this film, virtually any other movie becomes mundane and ho-hum because the avalanche of on-screen action grabs you and holds you for the entire length of the movie.<br/><br/>This is hard to say but even the wonderful acting of Pacino is over shadowed by the enormity of the directorial excellence.<br/><br/>If you love Pacino, love football or love superb directing then you owe it to yourself to see this masterpiece."

","This movie from the outset, sets you up for a classic movie experience, and while it is more a character movie than a pure football movie, it does not let you down. First of all, it isnt nearly 3 hours, it falls just shy of 2 1/2, and the final 5 minutes are with credits added, which was a really interesting touch, almost a tv show ending where the 1st credit comes up, then you get the final minute (here 5 mins) of stuff before its over.<br/><br/>Back to the film, it is not easy to follow what's happening in each game, Stone obviously wanted it this way, more letting you feel the impact, until you reach the point in the movie where he does want you to be riding every down. I got a laugh when I saw that Miami's Pro Player Stadium was used as an LA home field, it would be obvious to most this was a silly trick which you pick up immediately. Every one of the 10+ stars in the movie do a great job, and Foxx and Pacino are a great duo, Foxx was much better than I though he could be. The only beef was I would have like the teams to be NFL names, but being a Cowboys fan it was great to see the movie shot inside Texas Stadium for the final 25 minutes or so. Great Movie, 8/10."
"timelord-3","7","0","0","24 July 2000"," Style over simplistic content
","The latest directorial outing from Oliver Stone (who last helmed 'U-Turn'), 'Any Given Sunday' is an in-your-face movie which does not let up at all for its near 3 hour length.<br/><br/>At its heart it is a very simple story, but Oliver uses his trademarks ""smoke and mirrors"" technique of different film stocks, jerky camera angles and pseudo-vintage footage to mask this.<br/><br/>What we have one one side is a story about a washed up quarterback, and the washed-up coach who still believes in him and holds onto the values and beliefs of the 'old school'.<br/><br/>On the other side we have the rising star of a black athlete and the ambitious daughter of the former manager who rules the club with an iron fist, willing to use anyone and anything to further her own ambitions.<br/><br/>Warning - do not see this film if you do not like Gridiron, or don't understand the rules of the game.  It has definately been styled for American audiences, familiar with the game and its undoutedly complex rules. Coupled with the fact that three quarters of the film is a football match, and you really need to like or appreciate the game to get a handle on this film.<br/><br/>As I said, the flashy camera tricks to hide what is a relatively simple story.

","Sports movies are notoriously disappointing as 'serious' films(with the notable exceptions of ""Hoosiers"", ""White Men Can't Jump"", ""Major League"" and a sad few others). Unfortunately, ""Any Given Sunday"" falls more into the former category than the latter.<br/><br/>It's really a shame. I had been waiting for this movie ever since I first heard mention of it. If anyone can do justice to the epic nature of a football team and league, I believed, it could be Oliver Stone and his first-rate cast. Yet Stone has fallen victim to the meatloaf principle. A meatloaf is only good as long as you put in what you need to make it; when you start getting all the unneccessary ingredients, it's not really a meatloaf anymore. Stone's stunt casting detracts from establishing characters, and while the plethora of subplots and roles may be realistic, it doesn't help the viewability of the film much.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" also gets boring, which isn't what you expect or want to see out of a high-octane machoismo football movie. Maybe its the length, maybe its the plot. Personally, I blame it on the characters. You just don't LIKE any of them about halfway through the film, and you just can't have that. As a friend said, ""they were all too hypocritical."" Once again, that might be realistic, but it doesn't help make the movie more enjoyable. Other concerns include jumpy camera angles that open the film and leave the viewer confused, and a loud soundtrack that drowns out some important dialogue.<br/><br/>This is a movie that begins with a Vince Lombardi quote, and to aim that high means that not all is bad. Certainly, the actual football scenes smack of realism and the end is worth waiting for. The credits also add a great dimension to the film, and the Pacino and Foxx performances weren't bad. Lawrence Taylor could have been an all-pro actor if he had more than the occasional appearance, and LL Cool J was in his usual charismatic mode. Isolated events aside, however, Stone has just bit off more than he can chew in this film. While ""Any Given Sunday"" isn't even close to the mediocrity of say, ""Varsity Blues"", it really just isn't a good movie, let alone a sports one."

The most insignificant things become important and the most important things like love and life itself are set aside. All that counts is the money. Thus Stone criticises the American society of today, to which the same comments apply, and suggests that changes must be made step by step.

","Rating: *** out of ****<br/><br/>You'll certainly agree with me that Oliver Stone is one of the most audacious and unconventional directors of our time, if not the most, now that Kubrick has gone. He has done some jaw-dropping films as ""JFK"", unusual war movies as ""Platoon"" and something totally weird and mad as ""Natural Born Killers"". He is not the best director of our time, but it is quite difficult to forget one of his films because of their impact. ""Any Given Sunday"" is not different. It is a mad, fast, violent, strong, frenetic and crude look at the behind-the-scenes of American football.<br/><br/>First of all, let's get clear that I have a thing about sports: I really dislike them. What to say about American football, which is almost unknown here in Brazil? However, I liked ""Any Given Sunday"". It is a movie about sports. Every scene, almost every quote, even an arguing, was somehow related to football. It would be almost unwatchable for me if not directed by such a strong director as Oliver Stone. With an amazing film editing, amazing sound, amazing acting, it is one of the most interesting films of last year, and even fascinating, in a strange way. Stone has no mercy to show blood, violent plays, even a man who has lost an eye. It's a mad, mad camera-work.<br/><br/>However, the film has its flaws. The biggest one is the fact that it is long more than it should be. Some scenes are too long and could have been easily deleted. Another flaw is the non-existence of a real story. It's just football, arguing, violence, crude language. But, as I said, it's not an ordinary movie- and not for everyone.<br/><br/>With incredible performances by Cameron Diaz (in a very different character of the weird Lotte Schwartz) and Al Pacino, and another great Stone direction, ""Any Given Sunday"" is a worth seeing not only for football fans (did you have to be a fan of porn movies to watch ""Boogie Nights?), but also for the ones who want to see a very good movie.

I'm not an American and I've never played American football (watched it on British tv though) but the scenes on the gridiron were, even for me, a total let down. All we saw time after time was erratic and blurred close ups where the sound guys were really allowed to go to town with their, ""Big Hit"" noises...any fluidity and grace of the plays was completely missed. Things weren't helped either by Oliver Stone's directing, which got very annoying after a while.

Oliver Stone should've taken that idea, too, from ""Lola."" Also, Cameron Diaz is wasted.

","This film was amazing. All the actors involved did great job. Every one appeared quite real. But the best thing about the film is the camera work. Every one of the shots can be used for a poster and would look great. There are several shots that stayed in my mind for a long time. My favourite scene was where your vision is that of a player. You see all the big guys around you, glaring at you, and you are scared brainless. You can feel all that in this film. It keeps amazingly intense, upbeat pace all throughout the film as well. Only few slow scenes are used well to fit the story. All around, this film was the best one I have been in a while."

","I really enjoyed Any given sunday. i thought that it portrayed the world of football very realisticly and it showed how that people in charge of sports teams in general sometimes have differences of opinion and most of the time those opinions clash.<br/><br/>Any given Sunday begins during a game when the sharks star quarter back(who is on the verge on retirement) is injured during a game. after this tony damato, the head coach, sends another player in who is also injured. next he sends in willie Beaman, who throws up everytime he is brought out on the field. At first willie is rusty but in future games he becomes better and he even becomes extremely cocky. so cocky in fact that when the teams are in huttles he changes the plays. Tony doesn't like willie disobedient attitude but, christine, the owner of the team doesn't care how you win as long as you win, her nature of winning soon clashes with tony's more traditional ways and soon everyone is at each other's necks.<br/><br/>even though this film is really long your nver bored with the film. The football action is wonderfully directed by oliver stone. the football scenes are very intense and as a director he succeeds in making all of them intense.<br/><br/>The acting is good from everyone on board. Al pacino is excellent as the head coach. he's a very intense actor and he can make the most out of every scene he's in cameron Diaz is the big surprise among the cast. as the teams owner, cameron diaz, bites down into this role with fury she is very good at playing it mean and bitchy. you can tell she was having fun with the role. jamie foxx proves that he can do more than just comedy. he is very good in the role and also a big surprise amongst the cast because he also turns in a very nice performance. LL Cool J has become a great actor as well. he is great in this and i'm glad he's doing good in his films.<br/><br/>All in all a good movie and very entertaining. B+"

","It's a damn shame Oliver Stone (possibly one of the only film makers who combines stylism with a sense of social awareness) sold out to the commercial demands of the studio by allowing ""bad commercial music"" to be played when it fit the least. Yeah, I guess I liked the movie, but the damn music just totally ruined the mood. I'm not just talking about that gratuitous music video featuring Willie Beaman (I understood what they were trying to say), but the songs during the game and pretty much everywhere else in the movie. I hate to use the word inappropriate, but that's truly what it is. Anyway...<br/><br/>It was a very interesting (and freaking long) study of the politics of sports. Wall Street on the gridiron. Nice combination. It was interesting to watch Cameron Diaz (who was so sweet in ""...Mary"") be so bitchy here. Al Pacino was very good. Dennis Quaid had a strange lisp. Lauren Holly had about two or three lines in almost three hours. Jamie Foxx really shocked me. When I heard he was going star I was thinking this movie was going to be cheapened. I was wrong. He's a very intense actor here.  He's a very different person than he is on that stupid show of his.<br/><br/>I liked the whiplash editing and surreal camera work. I know that pissed some people off, but I thought it was a nice change.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie with major flaws.  The music mainly. And it's so long. My attention didn't falter only because Stone is such a master of holding the attention of the ADHD afflicted (even on bland subjects like Nixon). My attention span didn't feel the three hours,  my ass did."
"stiny","7","0","0","13 February 2000"," Any Given Sunday...wait for the video
","On any given Sunday a movie will be seen. On this Sunday if you choose to go see Oliver Stone's football epic expect to see an extremely fast paced and predictable sports movie. This is your typical sports movie where the biggest game of the team's season comes down to the wire and the big hero of the team has to overcome all of the odds and challenges that are against him to win the big game for his team. And this is exactly what Any Given Sunday is. It is the sports movie we have come to expect these days. This movie presents nothing new to the sports movie genre. Instead it uses all of the same elements that popular and successful sports movies have used before it. The team in this case is the Miami Sharks headed by longtime coach Tony d'Amato who is of course played by Al Pacino. Al Pacino does a decent job with his character and performance but he plays your basic coach. The tough, mean coach who is obsessed with winning. He, like many other on screen football coaches before him is plagued with many personal problems including a broken marriage. This is the type of coach that we see in almost every sports movie today. The basic plot is also unoriginal and something that has been used many times before. The longtime legend quarterback who helped build the franchise and bring them to championship statis gets hurt and the new, inexperienced, young quarterback has to rise up and take his place. Dennis Quaid plays the older quarterback who is hurt. His performance is mediocre and nothing more. Jamie Foxx plays the young, inexperienced quarterback. He does not bring much to the movie either. The acting in Any Given Sunday is nothing special. It basically does not hurt the movie nor help it. Cameron Diaz plays the young stressed out owner of the Sharks who always seems to be screaming and yelling throughout the movie. She gets somewhat annoying by the end of the movie. The only reason she owns the team is because her father, the former owner of the Sharks died and passed the team onto her. The only thing she brings to Any Given Sunday is a headache. Other actors in this chaotic movie are LL Cool J as the team's running back, Bill Bellamy as one of the team's wide receivers, and Lauren Holly as Dennis Quaid's reluctant wife. Many famous football players make cameos of opposing coaches including such greats as Jim Brown, Dick Butkus, Bob St. Clair, Irving Fryar, Warren Moon, Terrell Owens, Barry Switzer, Lawrence Taylor, Y.A. Tittle, Johnny Unitas, and Ricky Watters. This movie is filled with these type of cameos. Legendary actor Charlton Heston also makes a cameo as the commissioner of the league. But the most mysterious performance comes from James Woods as the team doctor. I could never understand this character or what he does or why he does it. His dialogue is also very confusing. His whole character seems to be a mess. If you go to see Any Given Sunday don't count on seeing great, Oscar worthy performances. But you can count on seeing a lot of confusion. One thing is for sure about Any Given Sunday, it is an extremely fast paced movie. In many cases the pace is too fast to handle. If you like watching movie trailers I would definitely recommend this movie. Any Given Sunday is like a two and a half hour movie trailer. It comes at you and hits you hard until you can't take it anymore. The whole movie needs to slow down and develop its story and characters. The whole movie is also predictable especially the finale which is a shame because the whole movie seems to be leading up to a finale of titanic proportions. But instead the finale fizzles and leaves you saying, `that was it!?!' Oliver Stone trys to throw a curve at the end of the movie with that flag but it does not work. It is just a way to try to make the ending a little more exciting and thrilling with two big final plays instead of one.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is definitely an Oliver Stone film. It is controversial and does make you question many things but there is no originality to it. Although there are good scenes that work well utilizing at least some decent acting there are many unappealing scenes that are very forgettable. Any Given Sunday trys to hit harder than any other movie has and it does. But the whole movie seems to go overboard with it. It trys to make a football game seem like the D-Day invasion from Saving Private Ryan. The funniest part of this movie is the opposing team's names, which range from the Knights to the Americans. That in itself shows the lack of originality of Any Given Sunday. **(wait for the video)"

","Oliver Stone is a very unconventional director and Any Given Sunday is a very conventional movie. But this doesn't means that it isn't good. In fact, it is one of the best sports movies I've ever seen, even though I am not much into American football. Therefore, the major attraction for me, was definitely the presence of a star cast in an Oliver Stone film. To see Al Pacino (one of the world's best actors) and Cameron Diaz (one of the world' s most beautiful girls) together with a supporting cast of stalwarts as Dennis Quaid and James Fox, is more than a dream come true. And each of them has performed very well. Al is great as usual; his short speeches before, after and in the middle of the game can make the blood rush in your veins. Cameron was always a great looker but shows that given a chance she's worth while actress too.<br/><br/>The cinematography is Oliver Stone's trademark. Five minutes into the film and any film junkie can tell that this flick is directed by Stone. The game scenes are great; the tension, the excitement, the jubilation, the dejection are all so real that one can almost touch it.<br/><br/>The portrayals of all the characters related to the game seem to emphasize on just one point: the players are more than mere sportsmen; they are warriors, the gladiators in the ring to fight till one of the fighters die. To drive home the analogy to Roman gladiators, Stone even shows a glimpse of Ben Hur on Pacino's TV.<br/><br/>When I earlier said its conventional, I meant that the movie progresses in a predictable manner and one expects more than the oft repeated last second finish from a director of Stone's caliber. I think, what I really missed, were the characters like ones we saw in U turn and Natural Born Killers (which is, by the way, one of my all time favorites, particularly because of the back ground score by late Nusrat Fateh Ali, Pakistan's leading vocalist). Characters that are more than superficial and have a deep dark side that one thinks one sees but doesn't.<br/><br/>However, Any Given Sunday is still a very good film and a must for all sports and film buffs alike.<br/><br/>Piece of advice: Do leave the theatre till the credits end, it still is an Oliver Stone film!"

"mariobox","Null","0","0","25 January 2000"," Gets the job done!
","Director Oliver Stone finally gives us a break from his habitual ""big conspiracy"" theme, and delivers this powerfully entertaining movie about an imaginary football team, the Miami Sharks, and the people whose life revolves around it.  As it isn't hard to imagine, football is not, after all, just a game.<br/><br/>With Al Pacino in a classic performance as the coach; Cameron Diaz, remarkable as the voracious team owner; and Jamie Foxx as the rebellious hot shot rookie quarterback, this film also stars LL Cool J, Ann Margaret, and Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>This film hits the nail squarely on the head by vividly conveying to us the inside story of the world of professional sports.  In that world, almost every decision is conditioned, in one way or another, by money.   What makes this flick even more interesting is how, by watching it, the viewer comes to the realization that certain situations that in days gone by would have seemed extracted from the ruminations of a very cynical mind, have already become part of our day-to-day reality, and are accepted as matter-of-factly as we accept the rain and the wind.   That is why, when the team owner gets involved with the community and gives to charity, with the ulterior motive of having the city build a stadium for the team at taxpayers' expense, we don't even blink (we've seen it happen many times in our own backyard, haven't we?).  Or when, again Cameron Diaz as the team owner, insists that a seriously injured player must make the line up, because if he is benched no team would want to pay $2 million for him, it doesn't quite shock us (doesn't this ring a bell, like when in the 1998 soccer world cup some sponsors were accused of coaxing teams into lining up star players in spite of their injuries?).   We would definitely need to be awfully naÃ¯ve to believe that, in this day and age, this kind of stuff only happens in the movies.<br/><br/>On another note, this film succeeds by not falling into the easy trap of presenting the viewer with stereotypical ""good vs. bad situations"". Instead, it confronts you with many tough calls, where the line between the acceptable and the unacceptable is not clearly marked on the ground:  like when the coach must decide if an injured player, who risks being paralyzed if he continues to play, should in fact be allowed to go on playing  (the player in question implores the coach to let him play, so he could make a $1 million dollar bonus).  Or when, again, the coach must decide if he should allow the veteran quarterback (who has been with the team for 18 years) to return in the playoffs after a long injury recess, or play the cocky rookie that has brought the team back from a seemingly endless loosing streak. Even the outcomes of these two dilemmas have been designed to avoid turning Pacino's coach into a ""knight in shining armor"" moral hero.  Instead, he is portrayed in all his tormented humanity, trying to stand his ground the best he can in a world that he doesn't really understand any more, to which he reluctantly holds on, as there is nowhere else out there that he can go. That is why in the first of these two tough choices, he decides, against his conscience, to let the injured player play, provided that he sign a waiver in favor of the team, just in case something goes wrong  (sign of the times, in these fine-printed, legalistic world of ours).  In the second choice, however, he stands tall and decides to bet against the table, starting the veteran quarterback.<br/><br/>This is not to say that the film does not have some minor flaws.   Like the night football scenes, which are excessively dramatized, filmed under heavy rain and almost total darkness.  Or the unlikely scene where the rookie quarterback gets his epiphany before the crucial game, and accepts the coach's decision to bench him, after listening to him speak for just five minutes about the love of the game and the virtues of teamwork.  Watching Pacino's coach being so irresistibly persuasive, as to melt down a rap-listening playboy, hot shot quarterback, and turn him into a humble self sacrificing team player with only five minutes of talk, seemed to us a little bit farfetched.<br/><br/>But after all, since the film provides for three solid hours of entertainment, these minor glitches may be easily forgotten.<br/><br/>One word of caution:  a good amount of the suspense you will enjoy in this movie is conditioned upon your basic understanding of the rules of football. If you don't know that sometimes you must kick instead of going for the touchdown, or if you have trouble understanding the meaning of a penalty flag, or the value of a time out, I'm not saying that you won't enjoy the movie, but you will definitely miss a beat  (just like a bad translation doesn't necessarily ruin the joke, it certainly makes it a little bit less funny)."
"dual-2","5","0","0","23 January 2000"," disjointed expose
","While appreciating much of Oliver Stone's work, particularly his exposes, this movie had perhaps too much in it: racism in professional football, the use of drugs by medical staff to enhance performance at expense of athlete's health, the loss of innocence in the game put against the fact it remains a team sport and champions still pull together better than losers, and more. The scene sequences felt cobbled together: now we're on race, now on loss of innocence, now on unethical team physicians, now a spoiled legacy owner experiencing remorse.  Yet, Stone's editing works well enough on the ""field of battle."" You share the athlete's experience.  Stone skillfully deploys the juxtaposing of modern football imagery with images before the famous 1958 Giant Colt contest which brought in television revenue and great change, mostly bad. Therefore the film based on Rob Huizenga's story. Huizenga acted as team physician to the Los Angeles Raiders in the late 1970s and at the time reaffirmed the late Lyle Alzedo's theory that steorids caused his brain cancer.  Much good acting in this film, an appropriate use of hip hop to denote cultural change and counter culture within the NFL; yet disjointed, not smoothly accomplished.  This considered, it's a good thing Stone didn't attempt to discuss the gay phenomenon in the NFL (viz. The David Kopay Story), or the legitimate, balanced (though they be few) athletes still managing greatness or journeyman success in what has become a brutal, unideal grind leading each year to the grotesque excesses of the Superbowl."

","Hey! Heeyyyyyy, can you hear me? You can't? HOW ABOUT NOW? CAN YOU HEAR ME NOWWW?? Does it sound like I'm yelling at you?? Well if it does, then you have a basic idea of what this movie is about. It's loud, brash and not all that subtle.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is a football movie...American football in case any of you were wondering. It's about a team that has an aging star quarterback, Jack Rooney (Dennis Quad) and an aging coach, Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino). The two have been together for years and the relationship is more of a father-son relationship than it is a player-coach relationship. The season hasn't been going very well and to make matters worse, Rooney gets injured early in the season and will be out indefinitely. He's in the hospital and the team turns to their backup quarterback; a not too bright guy. The team goes on a losing streak and eventually the backup gets hurt too. In goes the third string guy, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). After a rough start, things begin to turn around as Beaman begins to change the plays and do the things that he wants. The problem is that the team is winning and Beaman has gone from a third string quarterback to a star player in the league. The team makes it to the playoffs and Rooney recovers from his injury. Now the coach has to make a decision of who to play. Does he stay loyal to Rooney or does he go with the brash, out of control but talented Beaman? The coach has very little control and management, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) is demanding results yet has an agenda of her own.<br/><br/>If the story sounds a little convoluted to you then you're not alone. I found it hard at times to follow and very loud. There was music running almost constantly and the camera shots of the football games were very quick and ""in your face"". Be warned, if you have epilepsy, you may suffer a seizure. I know I almost did with they way they cut scenes and how loud it was. This movie was unbelievably long too. It's almost three hours long and when you think it's about to end, it drags out another 20 minutes. I do have to say though, the ending was interesting. I'm not sure if it depicts how football life really is though. I've never played so I can't comment on it.<br/><br/>Despite those negatives, I have to say that Al Pacino was very good. But more surprisingly, I liked Cameron Diaz's performance. I saw her in ""Something About Mary"" and thought she was ok at best but in this movie she was extremely good. This is the first time that I have seen Jamie Foxx and I actually liked him quite a bit. Look to him for more good things in the future. <br/><br/>Overall, I'm luke warm to this movie. It's basically a three hour music video and may induce a brain lock. See it either as a matinee or wait until it comes out on video."

","I had high hopes for ""Any Given Sunday"" because I am a fan of (some) sports movies, the cast looked decent, plus Pacino took my breath away in ""The Insider.""<br/><br/>Talk about a major letdown.<br/><br/>ASG starts off well with fast-paced football action and great cinematography. Dennis Quaid had me squirming in my seat as the injured quarterback. But then it all goes downhill from there.<br/><br/>With a dour plot, an array of unlikable, stereotyped characters, silly nudity/sex scenes (I nearly threw up my popcorn during one locker room scene), lousy music (how was DMX's song relevant to a game in any way?), the usual amount of misogyny expected in a film of this genre, use of the ""F"" word every two minutes (never mind that some couple two rows down from me was irresponsible enough to bring their 3-year old with them), cliches galore, a totally predictable ending, and the dizzying shots during the games (I guess Salvatore Totino thought this style would be exciting throughout the entire film, but it made me nauseous about halfway through), you can't help but have such a muddled, confusing  work.  At times the football games looked more like music videos rather than actual contests.<br/><br/>All that was left was a car chase to make this mess complete. There were times where I swore I was watching a Jerry Bruckheimer testosterone fest.<br/><br/>I would also like to know: what did the co-ed football game on the beach and #69's thankfully brief home scene with his two pit bulls have to do with the plot? It's also little things like that which sent this film swirling down the toilet.<br/><br/>What in God's name was up with those fake league and team logos??  They all looked like 5th-grade entries in a ""Draw Your Own Logo"" contest.  Utterly pathetic (especially the Dallas Knights' unies). The team names were equally bad.  Plus, what did the NFL-wannabe league's initials stand for? I won't comment on the cheesy TV on-screen graphics either.<br/><br/>The Dallas Knights' stadium looked so unrealistic, it resembled something out of arena football rather than the NFL, not to mention that no NFL team would have all that psychedelic red and yellow mess on the 50-yard line. It reminded me of  ""Forget Paris,"" where all the NBA games - with all different teams - were shot in just one arena, thus giving the atmosphere an artificial look. I particularly had a hard time believing that Pacino's team was from Miami. (Oh, by the way, during the Sharks/Knights game you'll see a brief reversed-negative shot of Quaid standing on the sidelines. Oops!)<br/><br/>There were a handful of roles that could have been omitted and nobody would've noticed: Lawrence Taylor as ""Shark"" (why does he have a nickname that matches the team name? That's like nicknaming Brad Johnson ""Redskin""), Jim Brown as the fascist assistant coach, John McGinley as the sleazy sportswriter, Ann-Margret as the team owner's mother (what a waste of talent), and especially Andrew Bryniarski - who never met a 1-dimensional role he didn't like - as #69, who looked like a combination of Zangief from ""Street Fighter"" and the big Nazi from ""Higher Learning,"" two equally forgettable roles of his in two equally forgettable films. Can't believe he actually got paid to play this boorish redneck.<br/><br/>This movie was not a total loss; I thought there were some good parts, particularly with Jamie Foxx and, surprisingly, Cameron Diaz (was her role somewhat of a dig at Georgia Frontiere? Something to think about), plus a funny scene during the ending credits, but they were shot down by pretty much everything else. The film is way too long, probably by about 45 minutes, and as a result some scenes dragged horribly (especially those annoying flashbacks). Overall, if you want to see a terrific football movie, check out ""North Dallas Forty"" or watch an actual game rather than waste $8 on this. Also, it's hard to respect a fictional football league that includes a team called the Houston ""Cattlemen"" (I'm not making this up).<br/><br/>Even with Al Pacino's presence, ""Sunday"" is a turnover on the fourth down. 5/10"

This had the effect of making the story about 20-30 minutes longer than necessary, while adding nothing about storking Oliver's ego and reminding the casual viewer why many people dislike his films in the first place.<br/><br/>The football scenes, while a little too quick-cut in the editing, were exciting"

","I was hoping Oliver Stone would at least come up with something new and/or different when using American Football as his subject matter. Perhaps he was too concerned with his more-than-a-cameo role as a broadcaster to pay attention to the fact that he was making a bland movie with uninteresting characters and a recycled plot.<br/><br/>In this film we're blessed with: - The old coach who many think is past his time - Veteran players who forego injuries for one more win - Young hotshots who don't care about the team - The meddling owner who cares only about the bottom line - The zany defensive players - Flashy offensive players - The must-have-drugs-to-kill-the-pain attitude - Sardonic, overly critical sports reporters - Cameos from football players and coaches, past and present... pretty much playing themselves<br/><br/>With uneven editing and writing, incongruous dialogue and the total lack of ANYTHING fresh in this film, the only saving grace of the movie is that the football sequences are filmed quite well, with both accurate and creative sound editing to help the atmosphere. However, even these sequences fail to fulfill completely, as they are too replete with a fast-cut, MTV-style of editing with the audience bombasted throughout by loud, obtrusive music. No original score here, the film's ""score"" is merely a marketing machine to sell CDs.<br/><br/>Stone makes the world of professional (American) football seem so cut-and-dry by using every cliche there is; each character and action is nothing we haven't seen before in another movie, or every week on TV and in the newspapers.<br/><br/>And at 165 minutes, one wonders why some scenes weren't cut entirely, as many of them do little, if anything, to either further the plot or offer a closer look into this world.<br/><br/>5 out of 10."

","Any Given Sunday is a work of art for any true football fan. I do not recommend this film for others. Teamwork is a recurring theme. Pacino and the great Jim Brown have a conversation of how they played for the love of the game, implying that the present day athlete is controlled my big money and his egotism destroys the purity of the game. Ego destroys the concept of teamwork. The film shows great detail of the brutality involved on the field of athletic competition. Our heroes are not clear for much of the film, but the agitators are obvious. The players are testoserone based beasts, women are toys, football is life. Owners are control maniacs, advertisers manipulate life (football), and noone understands except Vince Lombardi. That was my early opinion of the film. The coach won me over. He devotes his life to the game. He has alienated anyone who ever loved him, touchingly portrayed during an early morning intoxicated telephone conversation with his ex-wife who of course hangs up on him when he asks why they ever got divorced. I redundantly state, this is a film for football fans only. There is love in this film, but it is a love of the game and it's players. There is one theme that might interest those who do not love football. The coach is like a father to the team. He fights for the good of the `family,' protects its interests, teaches the immature, allows mistakes to happen for the sake of learning, defends the injured, demands the truth, and inspires the soul. One example: A player is injured, LT (I hope you know who that is) the star linebacker. The trainer (expertly portrayed by James Woods) who had kept the severity of his injury secret is immediately dismissed. Against his better judgment Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) allows him to play only after signing a liability waiver. You can guess what will happen next, but that does not diminish the intensity of the fact. The 3rd string quarterback all the while is becoming a superstar. He is the young talented money and ego driven athlete with the attitude. He alienates the coach, but learns more about himself when his teammates turn their backs on him. A fan will enjoy the cameo appearances, I wonder how many will recognize ""Johnny U.""

","Oliver Stone's latest film is an interesting cynical perspective of professional football's provocative subculture of money, prestige, women, respect, and disrespect.  Although much of the movie is devoted to displaying the great intensity and physical danger of the game of football, Stone's intention in this movie seems to be to illuminate every element of professional football except for the concept of playing together as a team. Stone succeeds in portraying both a realistic and startling picture of this football subculture.  While many other football movies have been simply narratives of one team's success, Stone explores more of the off-field situations of the game, such as the greed of the team owners and executives, and the players' desire for immense prestige and publicity.  Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, and Jamie Foxx all give competent performances, though the depths of their characters are not very great because of Stone's desire to explore the lives' of many different characters.  However, Stone's reluctancy in centering on one or two characters is not detrimental to the movie.  One of the suprises of the movie was Lawrence Taylor's acting prowess, as he may be one of the hidden talents of Hollywood.  Of course, Any Given Sunday is fraught with jarring hits and crushing blows on the football field, and Stone's sometimes surreal direction and up-close camera angles are very exciting especially to a seasoned football fan.  Speaking of fans, it would have been interesting if Stone had explored football from the fan's vantage point as well.  Three stars out of four."

I thought I would be going ""inside"" pro football, but Stone keeps one on the perimeter throughout.  We never really believe that anyone is really what they played: Pacino doesn't convince me that he's a coach, Heston is an ass pretending to be the football commissioner, and Cameron Diaz as the owner of a football team?

","I've never been a huge fan of Oliver Stone.  His movies tend to be too long, too chaotic, and, frankly, too preachy to sit through.  However, he finally found his first subject since Wall Street that he can both sink his teeth into as well as turn into a cinematic treat.  This is an epic film, focusing on the gridiron from all angles - coaches, players, sportswriters, owners, doctors, promoters, and sponsors - and it succeeds.  The acting by all involved is superlative, as is the football cinematography.  The only complaints I have are that he gets a little carried away with the montage style he's made such questionable use of in the nineties and the little-too-neat ending, although the post script footage during the credits is wonderful.  Keep your eyes open for the cameos, odds are you'll miss a few if you don't."

"minnow-6","6","0","0","11 January 2000"," ""Any Given Sunday"" is 2 movies. One is really good (****), the other is very mediocre to bad (*).
","The good movie is the one about playing football or being a football player. The photography and special effects of the on-the-field scenes are awesome. The soundtrack, camera angles, and music (mostly Rap) create what must be the trill of being a professional football player. There is one scene where the quarterback is told to go out and make a play. He's reminded of 3 or 4 things by the coaches as he leaves the sidelines (the receivers, the defenders, the pass routes, his blockers, his options, etc.). When the ball is hiked to him he stands up in amazing chaos. In a split second he has to remember everything he was trained to do, make the play and not get killed. The camera focus on his eyes, the soundtrack is booming, total confusion and the play is over. Everything about being a football player (on the field, in the locker room, in the bars, at home with the family, with hookers and groupies, in the training room, on the sidelines) is great cinema.  All the subplots and side stories are boring (young QB v. old QB, young coach v. old coach, new owner/GM v. old owner/GM, mother daughter story, politics, old doctor v. young doctor). The acting is mediocre at best. Al, Cameron, James, Mathew, LL, Jamie, etc. aren't the stars. The stars of this movie are the camera, sound, and special effects crews. Pay full price, if you're interested in football. This movie isn't going to work on video."
"nathan19","Null","0","0","10 January 2000"," Epic, sprawling exploration of America's true pastime.
","""Any Given Sunday"" has a far-reaching ambition (nothing Oliver Stone does is ever lacking in ambition).  In its attempt to unravel the game of football, in its exploration of the game from the field, the sidelines, and the offices, it says much more about the fans of the game than it does about the game itself.  The pressures that the players feel is real, much more pronounced here than it was in ""Jerry Maguire.""  We (the fans) put these players into positions where the game is not as important as the endorsements, the behind-the-scenes wrangling.  The crowd sows the seeds of the very corruption of the game it watches.  The players thus put on a performance not only to the crowd, but also to the dollars that the crowd is willing to spend.  The film criticizes the crossroads that the sport sits on, where competition for dollars corrupts the pure competition espoused by the quote at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Given that the game's very point is entertainment for the crowd, it is ironic that in the film, the only time characters are able to pull off big plays is when they completely shut out the audience around them -- Coach D'Amato (Al Pacino) tells Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) at the film's beginning to focus on the game at hand, to forget everything and remember back when the game was played ""in the hood.""  It's the inability to forget the crowd that leads to Foxx's perpetual vomiting; when ""Cap"" Rooney (Dennis Quaid) goes down, we watch him disappear into the crowd's faces; and it's the desire to perform for the crowd that leads to the rampant egos we see throughout the film, as well as the moral ambiguity of many of the characters (Dr. Mandrake -- played by James Woods -- especially, but not exclusively, as Matthew Modine's character faces a similar moral dilemma, and we are not sure what his final action is).<br/><br/>The film frequently uses the shot of fading into the crowd's faces -- the players lose themselves in the crowd they are playing to, and collapse. Each character's moral barometer is based on his/her willingness to play to the crowd; when Cap, the moral component of the old guard, collapses physically, after losing himself in the crowd, it is a sign of the fate that befalls each character internally.  Whether morally or physically, each character loses themselves in the crowd, not in the game -- and it's only when they take themselves out, when they step out, that they are able to come to grips with why they are doing what they're doing.  Cap takes himself out of the game -- Willie is taken out -- at the end, Pacino takes himself out -- and it is only when this happens, that they are able to deal with the motivations that drive them forward.  WHY they play the game and live the lives they do.<br/><br/>The film's intensity and length is necessary in order to fully invest ourselves in the lives of these characters.  Unless we feel the intensity they do on the field (which Stone accomplishes through a pumped-up soundtrack, quick cuts and flash shots), unless we see the sordid underside of the game (Pacino consorts with a prostitute, his owners undermine his decisions, the team is rife with tensions, both racial -- note the sequence in the locker room with combating music -- and personal), we have no idea about the lives they lead.  Stone's point is not to criticize the game or its players -- it's just another component to American life, just as is the financial district of ""Wall Street"", the music of ""The Doors,"" and the political worlds of ""JFK"" and ""Nixon.""  Stone's desire is instead to hold up a window for our consideration -- this is a world we fund, a world we want to see on Monday Night Football, and these are the men and the women we call ""heroes.""  Stone shows us the pressures they are under to perform.  He does not present them as woeful cry-babies -- they are given a job to do, and are expected to do it.  But the film considers the cost and the price of fame -- and asks us to consider the fact that, in our quest to set up heroes (only to forget them when their playing years are up), we are sacrificing both the souls of these men, and our own.  Our ethos is, ""it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.""  Yet we remember only the winners; the losers go home physically and emotionally ruined.  We are each faces in the crowd -- and even in the film's climactic scene, the film audience becomes a football one, rooting for our ""heroes.""  Stone puts us into the position of the crowd in the film... and then wonders if we should enjoy being there."

","1999 wasn't a great year for the big-name directors with well-established presences; Lucas, Scorcese, and Kubrick at best disappointed and at worst seemed irrelevant.  Oliver Stone fights the same fate like a gut-shot wolf snapping at his hunters.  In Any Given Sunday, he dishes out MTV in spades, but it somehow feels so. . . 90s.  A quick look at what David Fincher and David O. Russell served up in 1999 gives one the distinct impression that we're beyond all that.  The new aesthetic may still involve clicking, but now it's with a mouse and a web browser, not a remote control.  Also, the cut-and-paste music video style has been superceded (in the arena of sports, at least) by the omniscience of Sega or Sony gaming systems.  Sure, Stone's whiz-bang style provides several hits of adrenaline, but it's all gland and no brain.  The technology is there to explore every nuance of a play; why not take us through it like Scorcese took us through each cog and wheel of a casino?  Instead, there's a lot of huffing about who gets to call the plays, the coach or the QB.  Haven't we seen this before?<br/><br/>Which is all very far from saying that there is nothing to like about Any Given Sunday. Jamie Foxx took me in as the struggling third-string quarterback Beamen and Jim Brown's jaded assistant coach was quietly impressive.  Both of them hold their own against the familiar, blustery Al Pacino as head coach D'Amato.  Unlike many of Stone's critics, I can't slip easily into a tirade about his obsession with father figures, but I do wish Any Given Sunday had focused more on Beamen and his world instead of D'Amato and his machinations, just as I wish Nixon had been a film about any one of the thousands of Cambodians whose lives were destroyed instead of the man who destroyed them.  Still, there are enough moments of brightness here to bring me back for his next film."
"jessie.ennis","7","0","0","6 January 2000"," It's as long as it is good
","Usually the quality of a movie can help to make up for the fact that the movie is a bit too long.  Any Given Sunday almost accomplishes this. At about three hours long, Oliver Stone provides a fairly entertaining look at the inner workings of a struggling fictional football team in Miami.  Al Pacino is his usual mesmerizing self as the under fire coach of the team. He must deal with a meddling owner (Cameron Diaz), an aging, injured star quarterback (Dennis Quaid),a prima-dona star running back (L.L. Cool J.), and the young third string quarterback (Jamie Foxx) that he must rely on to get the Miami team into the playoffs.  Mr. Foxx gives probably the best performance of the movie as we see him develop from a backup so nervous he vomits on the field before his first play into the toast of the sports world who butts heads with his head coach over who really leads the team. Cut out about a half hour of the movie, and it may go from a fairly entertaining saturday afternoon or evening experience to a really enjoyable , funny look at pro football."

","I was really hoping for ANY GIVEN SUNDAY to be the ultimate football movie.  I really was hoping since it had a great cast (Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Jim Brown, James Woods, etc.) and Oliver Stone is a powerful director with such movies as JFK and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  Yet when I saw the movie I realized that Oliver Stone has changed since JFK.  Since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, Stone has taken the audience into a bizarre and twisted world.  A world that some will find brilliant, and others disturbed.<br/><br/>ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is the in-depth look of professional football. Eariler this year we experienced high school football (VARSITY BLUES) and now it's time for the pro's.  Al Pacino stars as Tony D' Amato a aging coach who is struggling to get his team into a successful season.  His star quarterback, Jack ""Cap"" Rooney is thirty-nine years old, and isn't as healthy as he use to be.  The team owner and manager, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) keeps breathing down his neck on why isn't their team winning.  The team doctor, Dr. Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) is switching the medical exams of the players, so they can play.  Yet, Mandrake is endangering the lives of the players.  And to top it off, a young quarterback with a high ego is becomming the star player for the team, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). The trouble is that Beaman is doing his own plays and causing trouble among the team. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a strong look at the lives of the NFL players.  With money, fame, power, women, women, and more women, you would think that these guys have life made easy, yet they don't.  They have to face aging, younger and stronger players, teammates back-stabbing them, life threating injuries, and players who think that they are the only reason on why the team is doing good. I did enjoy the way the film looked into the lives of these men.  How the coach is under pressure with the team players and management, how the aging quarterback is trying to maintain his image, and how the young rookie is facing the negativity from his teammates.  The acting was very good.  Pacino as usual was great, but he gave a stronger and more passionate performance in THE INSIDER.  Dennis Quaid is always a delight to see, and he does a great job in this film as well. Cameron Diaz is a excellent actress, going from her ditzy role in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to her witchy attitude in this film. Jim Brown is always a delight to see, since he was a professional football player. James Woods is always a great slimy and evil person to see, and Matthew Modine is fun to watch as a character who is the opposite of Woods character. And even L.L. Cool J was fun in this film, a lot better than his previous film, DEEP BLUE SEA. But if the film belongs to anyone, it's Jamie Foxx. The rap singer/comedian does a great job and carries the film off well as the new popular quarterback who makes the team stand out.  I think that now, Foxx is going to be getting more juicy roles than he was before thanks to this film.  Foxx does a great job and shows a serious side to his character.  He doesn't overact or show off, he fits the role perfectly. So what did bother me with this film?  Well it was Oliver Stone's directing.  His extreme close ups on a person or a object, I will give him credit, it is original, and it has become a Oliver Stone trademark. But he's been doing it since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and even directors Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese change their visual style once in a while.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY would have been perfect had Stone direct the film more like his earlier films, SALVADOR and WALL STREET. Overall, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a great film, but it wasn't the classic that I was hoping for it to be.  I was hoping that this was the film that Stone would shock the critcs and tell them that he can still be a great director, like Speilberg did with SCHINDLER'S LIST.  But sadly, this isn't the film, some critcs enjoyed it, others didn't.  This critic did enjoy it, but it isn't the best Oliver Stone film, JFK still holds the title. **** (out of five)"

In another commanding performance, Pacino never lets us know if he's a good guy or a bad guy until the very end.<br/><br/>2) Jamie Foxx- While at times he seemed to be reading from cue cards that were difficult to read, Foxx also delivered a great performance. When we're supposed to hate him, we do, and when we're supposed to like him, we do.<br/><br/>3) The action- When not blurred by the funky editing and camera work, the football footage is nothing short of awesome. I found myself flinching more than a couple of times.<br/><br/>4) Cameron Diaz- She was great as a super bitch. Too bad she didn't stay bitchy, though.<br/><br/>Bad<br/><br/>1) Editing/camera work- Especially in the football action scenes, most of the time you have to squint to see what's going on. You might want to pop a Dramamine before you see this movie.<br/><br/>2) Realism- Ok, it's a movie, but come on. This team makes it to the playoffs when its defense routinely allows 21 points or more in the 1st half?? Not likely, no matter how good the offense is.<br/><br/>3) Dennis Quaid- I hate to do this because usually Quaid is great, but I think even brother Randy could've done better. Granted, the role he was handed isn't exactly Oscar material, but his performance evoked no emotion whatsoever.<br/><br/>All in all, I recommend seeing this movie, but probably not more than once in the theater. I give it a 7 out of 10."
"jlemons","7","0","0","22 December 1999"," Is Oliver Stone becoming a rich man's Michael Bay?
","Any Given Sunday is one hell of a movie.  The football footage is exhilarating in its violence and intensity.  The performances, across-the-board, are fantastic.  But Oliver Stone's love affair with the quick cut and multiple camera angles causes the film to fail almost as often as it succeeds.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is great as the Miami Sharks' beleaguered head coach.  Of course, this is a role that he could have phoned in from a beach in Maui.  Cameron Diaz is impressive as the steely co-owner of the Sharks.  I feared that she might be the weak link in the cast, but she's not afraid to play with the big boys.  Dennis Quaid, one of my personal favorites, is fine as the aging star quarterback.  Unfortunately, his role is underwritten.  Jamie Foxx is good as the impatient young quarterback out for Quaid's spot on the roster. He seemed to have his finger on the pulse of today's exciting/immature young athlete.  Hall-of-Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor is surprisingly good as the aging future Hall-of-Fame linebacker.  And James Woods revels in his character's amorality as the team physician.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the editing detracts from the film as much as it fuels it. Jamie Foxx's character performs in a obnoxious Met-RX commercial in the middle of the film that almost grinds it to a halt.  The mock-commercial is so artificial-looking that one cannot help but cringe when it comes on the screen.  The constant close-ups, quick cuts and multiple camera angles make me wonder if Oliver Stone made this film to beef up his resume for a possible Armageddon sequel.<br/><br/>Another quibble... the football fan in me can't help but question a couple of casting choices.  Both Dennis Quaid and Jamie Foxx nailed their characters perfectly, but both of these guys are too short to be believable as NFL quarterbacks.  The prototypical NFL quarterback scouts look for ranges from 6'2"" to 6'6"".  Al Pacino dwarves Jamie Foxx, for crying out loud!<br/><br/>But in the end, Any Given Sunday is a thrill to watch.  Oliver Stone captures the spirit of professional football in the 1990s.  And he fearlessly grapples with many of the controversial issues in modern professional sports without ever getting preachy.  In the end, what is he trying to tell us?  Two things:  First, youth will always be served. Second, America always gets the professional athletes she deserves."

I like football ok, but I guess I'm not into it enough to enjoy this film.<br/><br/>Why do I think it sucked so much?  Well, that's simply because the directing was absolutely horrible.  I do believe this is the first movie ever that the directing has interfered with the viewing of it.  I had a headache by the time the movie was over.  Now I understand why they would make a football scene disorienting to show how the players felt, but that doesn't have to be done for every game they show.  I couldn't tell what was going on most of the time because my head hurt so much.  The directorial problems aren't just with the football game either.  The camera cuts away to show a different camera far too often and there are too many face close-ups.  It wasn't like I was watching a movie, but rather a cutscene in a crappy video game.<br/><br/>Besides directing problems there is also a problem with the plot.  Like I said footballers will like it simply because its about football, but I need more than that.  I need an actual plot rather than a movie that shows what goes on in a football team.<br/><br/>I will also note that I didn't want to see the movie in the first place.

It has no discernible plot, completely cardboard-cutout characters, and every single scene is punctuated by loud, driving, rock/rap music that essentially makes this experience feel like a 2.5 hour music video.<br/><br/>Instead, this is strictly a vehicle for these purposes: -Getting Diaz in a few more sexy evening gowns -Showcasing Foxx as ""leading man"" material -Letting director Oliver Stone screw around for 150 minutes and throw theme after theme in our face while developing none of them -LL Cool J showing he can ""act"" as well as rap.<br/><br/>The ONLY bright spot of this experience is the epic speech given by Pacino's character before the film's climax. Surrounded by utter dreck on both sides, that speech will (if only for a few minutes) get you fired up about something.<br/><br/>Other than that, though, ""Any Given Sunday"" is a total mess. The inclusion of James Woods (perhaps the single worst/most annoying actor of his time) almost seems fitting for such a stinker. If you are a pigskin fan who wanted to enjoy this one, I suggest you do so in the middle of a roid rage or other crazy emotional moment. At any normal time, this is 2.5 hours of time utterly wasted."

","Oliver Stone tackles pro football with this high octane dissection of a fictional Miami team. On the short side, the film's story about an aging coach doesn't show us anything new and presents a minimal challenge to Pacino. On the long side, the film is crisscrossed with subplots, showcases some fine acting talent, serves up plenty of bone-jarring grid iron action, and revs up the tempo so the 166 minute running time passes quickly. If nothing else, this entertaining flick reminds us that pro football is not a sport but a business which chews up and spits out athletes in its lust to separate the fan from his money."
"bob the moo","Null","3","11","8 June 2002"," Media overload that maybe lacks a bit of substance
","In the modern world of American Football money drives teams, greed and arrogance drives players and boundaries are pushed in terms of physical and mental limits in an attempt to get the money.  Coach Tony D'Amato finds himself in charge of a Shark's team that is on a 3 game losing streak before losing it's 2 lead QB's.  With Willie Beamen leading the plays and growing in arrogance, Tony finds it hard to hold his team together, meanwhile the owners are pushing for TV money and new stadium deals.<br/><br/>As we all know most Oliver Stone films are like having Stone himself standing shouting at you for 2 hours.  Here the effect is the same  even if the message is confused a little.  We all know that US sport is more business than sport and we know that it's not all as good, honest stuff as it should be.  Here Stone makes his point but also tries to mix in other stories more at home in a standard sports movie  the clichés of overcoming, of team spirit etc.  However both work reasonably well.  However the main driving force behind the film is Stone.<br/><br/>Despite getting as many cameos in as he can (as a commentator and his picture on a bar wall) Stone delivers a powerful directing job.  He uses plenty of visual tricks and never lets the camera rest too easily.  Likewise the soundtrack is constant and contains plenty of hot tracks.  It's all very exhilarating and mostly makes up for a lack of real substance in the stories.  The only downside is that this is quite exhausting  it's very loud and just feels a touch too busy to be enjoyable.<br/><br/>The cast are good despite the fact that they seem to want to watch Stone's in-yer-face direction style.  Pacino gives it plenty of `hoo-hah' but struggles in the quieter moments.  Diaz is alright but is a bit out of her depth.  Nobody does loud, arrogant and irritating like Foxx, the only problem being he is very annoying most of the time.  Woods and Modine are good as doctors with varied degrees of realism/cynicism.  The support cast is all good  even if they don't all have much to do.  LL Cool J is good, Charlton Heston barely says a word and is only there to show the `modern day gladiators' theme, Lela Rochon is as beautiful as ever and does well with little material, Berkley is there presumably because she needs the work and has no problem showing her breasts (as long as she doesn't have to have sex with Kyle McLaughin).  Jim Brown, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Aaron Eckhart, John C McGinley etc are all good and help give weight to the film.<br/><br/>Overall it's all very loud and in your face but it's enjoyable  even if it leaves you feeling tired at the end! Oh  and it's `American Football' not `Football'  the rest of the world knows what football is and it's not just a bunch of men falling down every few minutes (unless you're Italian or Brazilian then falling down is what it's all about)."

","Either Oliver Stone is a HUGE football fan, or he deeply studied it in order to make Any Given Sunday the best made film about football ever. Through the standpoint of editing alone, Any Given Sunday is a masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's high energy, rock n' roll cinema. The kind that Oliver Stone is so famous for. Blink and you'll miss it. A film, truly, for the MTV generation. It's filled with tremendous performances as well. Al Pacino is in classic form as Tony. Cameron Diaz, Jamie Foxx and James Woods are spellbinding throughout. Everybody, behind and in front of the camera let nothing go to waste here. It's an underrated sports film and 90's film, in my view."
"HotToastyRag","2","1","2","24 January 2019"," This movie takes itself seriously
","The promotional poster for Any Given Sunday is priceless. Al Pacino is shown mid-shout, Cameron Diaz is trying to look sultry, James Woods looks like he's given so many promo pictures he's forgotten which movie this one's for, and Dennis Quaid and Jamie Foxx look like they're trying to be taken seriously. Add in tons of football, and you've got the entire movie in a nutshell.<br/><br/>If you don't like football, you're not going to like this movie. Since most Americans do like football, it's no wonder this was a successful film. Cameron Diaz tries to be taken seriously as a football team owner, and she and Al Pacino, the coach, continually clash on how to handle the team. For example, when player Dennis Quaid gets injured, Al sticks by him, but Cameron quickly replaces him with the inexperienced Jamie Foxx. Fans of Dennis in Everybody's All American will like seeing him back in the football setting ten years later, especially since this movie could be seen as a partial extension from the 1988 classic.<br/><br/>Keep in mind when you're deciding whether or not to rent it that this is an Oliver Stone movie. This isn't a feel-good football flick, nor is it something you can tune out during and not be lost. This is fast-paced and takes itself extremely seriously, as if the subject and storylines are the most important problems in the entire world and if you aren't entirely invested, you aren't entirely alive. If you decide you're in the mood for that, get ready to see a host of familiar faces, including Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, John C. McGinley, and Charlton Heston in a cameo. Football isn't my life, even though I did enjoy playing it in school, so this isn't my favorite movie. I just can't seem to take Cameron Diaz seriously, so the premise of the film isn't believable.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and graphic nudity, I wouldn't let my kids watch it."

There isn't much more to say that that...but it has to be at least 10 lines long so.<br/><br/>In Typical Oliver Stone fashion, the movie has cast ALL of Hollywood and James Woods. So, in typical Oliver Stone fashion, even the bit parts have A-list actors bringing their A games to the field. So you can't fault the movie for pro talent.<br/><br/>Most ALL of Stone's movies have that heavy handed acting.<br/><br/>It almost feels like you haven't got acting credentials unless you've played a role in an Oliver Stone film.

Speaking of which I need to review the greatest sports movie ever made. That's right, ""Bull Durham."" You know Stone loves controversy when he casts a sports movie and leaves out Kevin Costner.<br/><br/>Ramble, ramble, ramble and what you have here is a review of a movie that could be best titled: ""Clash of the Egos"" Some guys are team players and some guys aren't and you'll find out who is who on Any Given Sunday.<br/><br/>Really, there are characters here that predicted the modern age of football where people on a losing team will dance over the slightest play.<br/><br/>And that should be ten lines.

The minor drawbacks are the excess of unnecessary nude butts and some scatology, but, on the other hand, the film may also be praised for its edition innovations. Al Pacino is fantastic as the coach (as everybody may expect), but Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid and Camerin Diaz also do a great job.

","Any Given Sunday (1999): Dir: Oliver Stone / Cast: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, James Woods: Great look at professional football and the stresses behind it. Title suggests time that one cannot pin point into the future of a victory that will eventually happen. Al Pacino stars as the veteran coach for the Miami Sharks who feels his ability fading after they suffered their fourth consecutive loss. Cameron Diaz plays the daughter of the deceased owner who is under pressure due to the losses. Dennis Quaid plays a quarterback who is injured during opening game. Jamie Foxx plays the new star player whose fame goes to his head. Complete with Oliver Stone's trademark political views as applied to other films such as J.F.K and Nixon. Pacino is at his best as a coach down on his luck but not without resources. Whether the Miami Sharks succeed is not the point as to what he will do to counter a possible replacement. Diaz as the daughter of the former owner steals her scenes as she forces issues perhaps with certain regret in the end. Quaid as the injured quarterback struggles with his marriage but will attempt a comeback despite his age. Foxx realizes his celebrity ego and makes amends as well as opportunities. James Woods plays a corrupt physician whose tactics are risky to players. While repetitious, the action is rousing. Theme regards regaining the glory and keeping it alive. Score: 9 / 10"
"Prismark10","6","1","2","14 June 2014"," The modern sporting life
","Oliver Stone turns his attention to American Football with a long and frenetic film.<br/><br/>The Miami Sharks are in turmoil and struggling to make the playoffs. Their veteran coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino), who has fallen out of favour with young owner Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz)and offensive coordinator Nick Crozier (Aaron Eckhart)is expected to succeed D'Amato as head coach. During the season the Sharks quarterback, Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) and his replacement are both injured. They have to call up the rookie quarterback Willie Beamen (Jamie Foxx). Beamen is visibly nervous which includes throwing up during the game and makes a number of errors as he lacks knowledge regarding the team's play-book. Beamen however gains in confidence and quickly his star is in the ascendancy but the can the wily D'Amato turn the team around and outfox Pagniacci?<br/><br/>Stone tells us the stories of people from different levels as they struggle to survive within in the world of professional sport. Cap is ageing and maybe past his best but his wife wants him to continue despite the pain of injuries to keep up with the lifestyle. Beamen on the hand is getting endorsements, money and women but loses his long time girlfriend along the way. Many of the others are willing to risk long term health as their ruthless medic (James Woods) is willing to give shots and misinterpret findings so the players keep on playing.<br/><br/>Stone like D'Amato now a veteran filmmaker maybe past his prime when he made this film is typically audacious and frenetic. As always he keeps the camera moving, when one player gets tackled his eye pops out. He gets Pacino to let rip in several scenes but gets more nuances performances from Foxx and Quaid. A critical eye on NHL franchises, money and sport but this is a minor film in Stone's resume."

The ending ""will the old quarterback allow the young rebel to have the spotlight"" and ""will the aging veteran risk his frail health to go out in one huge flameout of football glory?"" makes the this movie completely unremarkable.

","Get ready for some football. You probably need to be a fan of the NFL; full disclosure here, I am a Green Bay fanatic for 45 years, so I am the perfect audience for Any Given Sunday. Others may not be as satisfied with the story. Al Pacino is a jaded coach with thirty years experience, now leading the Miami Sharks, a team on the decline. His starting quarterback gets injured, and the back up is an arrogant guy who plays by his own rules. Willie Beamen(an excellent Jamie Foxx) is the strutting QB, and although he struggles learning the system at first, he develops into a star. He gets commercial endorsements and a music video. He becomes a complete prima donna, and draws resentment from the rest of the team. Despite the friction, he leads them to the playoffs. With the starting QB ready to return, the coach must decide who to start in the next round of the playoffs. Some real players are used, including Terrell Owens and Lawrence Taylor, which make it look very authentic. The football scenes are well done and the sub plots good. The cast is without a weakness, and the only drawback is the length, which at over 2 1/2 hours is a bit much. Oliver Stone has a tendency to leave in too much. I'll compromise at a 7.5/10."

","Any Given Sunday is a sports drama film that depicts a fictional professional American football team.

McGinley, Charlton Heston, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Bill Bellamy, Lela Rochon, Aaron Eckhart, Elizabeth Berkley, Marty Wright, and legendary NFL players Jim Brown and Lawrence Taylor.Aside from that,it also featured many American football players including Dick Butkus, Y.A. Tittle, Pat Toomay, Warren Moon, Johnny Unitas, Ricky Watters, Emmitt Smith and Terrell Owens together with American football coach Barry Switzer. It was co-written and directed by Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>Tony D'Amato, the head coach of the Miami Sharks, won back-to-back championships four years ago. But new team owner Christina Pagniacci has little enthusiasm for the finer points of the game and is concerned only with the bottom line. The longtime strongman of Tony's team has been ""Cap"" Rooney, a 39-year-old quarterback, but Christina balks at renewing his contract. When Cap is injured during a game, third-string rookie quarterback Willie Beaman goes on in his place and becomes a major star. But Beaman is mostly interested in fame and money, and he has little regard for Tony and his teammates. <br/><br/>The film tries its best to depict professional American football as it looks at the best and the worst on the sport.Although the performances of the actors are far from disappointing,the film becomes an exercise of clichés and unoriginal ideas required by the plot.Also,the film does not focus on the primary theme it wants to focus on or the message it wants to convey about pro football despite of the passionate performances and brilliant film making from Stone.Overall,Any Given Sunday still entertains and remains an enjoyable sports film."
"saxon_is","9","1","2","27 June 2010"," ""In one word Any Given Sunday is 'different', which is a refreshing change""
","After seeing some of the reviews given on here I feel I have to come out and defend one of my favourite movies. My advice is to watch this movie as you would any other drama, rather than your classic sports movie. <br/><br/>The acting in this quite simply superb with Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz all putting in riveting performances. But the strength of this movie doesn't lye in the acting (which is excellent in itself) but in the story, which goes much deeper and much further than most other sporting movies go. It casts a harsher and more critical eye over its sporting heroes and focuses more on the impact sport has on those involved in it, rather than painting its heroes as larger than the sport itself as so many sporting movies seem to do these days. <br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is not without its flaws however. The camera work and editing in the football scenes are confusing and dizzying, and at times feel very unrealistic. But the thing is as long as you realise that the football itself is not the focal point, but rather those involved in it and how it affects them outside of the game, it will not get to you. If you are looking for a classic sporting drama then this is definitely not for you, but in all other aspects it ticks all the boxes. Excellent soundtrack, great acting and a moving story line that highlights the ups and downs of being in the spotlight that is football.<br/><br/>To be honest I was not surprised when I saw some of the negative reviews on here. The movie does not view as it is advertised and many would be justified in saying that they are disappointed in not getting the movie they were anticipating. In fact it might be a victim of its own audacity. Its more than your average sports film when it seems your average sports film is exactly what people wanted out of it. It isn't your fast paced all action sports drama. It at times moves at a slow, watchful pace and at others speeds on ahead at risk of leaving the viewer behind. <br/><br/>In one word Any Given Sunday is 'different', which is a refreshing change, and is something Oliver Stone should be applauded for if your not willing to give it anything else."

","Still, the bizarreness doesn't take away the positive points of this film. Al Pacino stars as Tony D'Amato, Miami Sharks football coach. Dennis Quaid is his aging quarterback Cap Rooney, Jamie Foxx is Wiliie Beamon, backup QB who must step in and takeover when Rooney is injured. Cameron Diaz is the team owner who believes D'Amato's style is old school and is waiting for a chance to sack him (literally). Among others the cast includes James Woods (sleazy team doctor), Lawrence Taylor (linebacker about to have his head popped), Aaron Eckhart, Matthew Modine, LL Cool J, Jim Brown, Lela Rochon and Lauren Holly (Rooney's slut wife who still thinks she's in high school)and some dude with a huge apparatus that the ladies will love. Being a Miami Dolphins fan, I couldn't help but notice the similarities between this movie and the Dolphins 99' season. <br/><br/>Don't miss Pacino's ""inches"" speech before the final game, nor his talk with Jamie Foxx at his residence. Among the bizarre and downright hilarious scenes (maybe coke ain't that bad for Oliver Stone after all): Jamie Foxx making a rap video with bikini-clad girls and a Sisqo look-a-like (it was 1999, Sisqo and Dru Hill were the shiznit); one heavy-metallish linebacker having his eye pop out of it's socket (no one would survive that one); Lawrence Taylor using a chain-saw to cut Beamon's car in half because Willie dissed the defense (never talk bad about the ""D"" in front of LT); Elizabeth Berkley cameo playing, you guessed it, a hooker. <br/><br/>The football scenes are fast paced and relentless; this movie is equally an expose and a satire on the world of modern football. Besides LT and Brown, keep an eye out for several other football greats."

At more than two-and-a-half hours long, our interest in this football soap opera runs out long before the final touchdown.<br/><br/>But there's more wrong here than a gaping story/running time gap. ""Any Given Sunday"" tries to say too many things at once. Stone examines a plethora of angles: questionable medical ethics, the familial cost of being a workaholic, the media's short attention span, drug abuse and promiscuity, etc., etc. The end result appears undisciplined. Worse yet, the most interesting of the angles - coach Al Pacino's need to overcome sentimentality in a dog-eat-dog sport - is woefully underexplored.<br/><br/>Yet like the game it depicts, ""Any Given Sunday"" has its share of ups and downs. The film's flashiness spurs a degree of excitement, but eventually becomes overwhelming. The vulgarity brings an element of realism, but this too just becomes too much after the first hour. The brightest spot is the cast, arguably one of the most talented and diverse ever to grace a sports film. Pacino is at his usual high level, while the likes of Jamie Foxx, James Woods and Aaron Eckhart aren't far behind - all the more reason for disappointment at the final result."

","Im gonna say right off the bat that this is the first movie review i have ever written, but i do not believe that changes how useful this review could be. Well im gonna do every review with a certain standard's ""Story"" ""Charecters-acting"" ""Audio-Visual"" ""Moral-Overall"" Story- (9.75/10)- When i first rented this movie i was really nervous about renting it, i heard it was real good but never really thought it would be. Now i do play football but trust me my opions is not biased. Well lets start it, i feel that the most important part of either a movie or game is the storyline, if i see some that looks spectacular and it turns to be a either simple or just boring story-line i ignore it. This movie exceeds in all of my expectations. It just took me by complete storm. It start off by putting you right in the action. The coach of the sharks (alpachino) starts trying to get into the head of the other teams coach right away by calling the same play's the other team had been picking up on every play and in doing so the sharks QB takes a severe hit an is injured. Then the 2nd string qb goes in and also gets injured then the 3rd string QB (jami foxx) gets the start. the movie kinda takes its leap from there...i don't wanna spoil anything. From the moment Jamie foxx's character willie the story never goes boring plenty of wicked things happen including a awesome talk at dinner between Willlie and the Coach (alpachino). Overall the story is more then what anyone including me could of askd for in terms of orignality and morals.<br/><br/>Charecters-Acting-(10-10)- Simply put the acting and the variety in characters could be this movie's strongest aspect. You may never see a more complete acting job done then this movie.Ever.<br/><br/>Audio-Visual(9-10)- The audio in this movie is some of the best i have ever heard the amount of things new that you can hear every time u watch this movie is remarkable. As for the visual's, whitch this movie still does really well is maybe one of the least appeling d to the not so graphical images, other then nudity of course! Moral-Overall(10-10)- Well after you get through this sorta lengthly movie whitch never once stops the action for even a sec ( i mean the talks are action packed) you will realize that you have just finished watching the greatest sports movie ever made, but thats not enough to say about this movie because sports movie's have never really been the top of the calibur movie compared to others, but this movie should very well be put into conversations with other great movies of all genre's. It not only succeeds the expectations set for it....it sets its own standards whitch may never be touched by another sports movie ever!"
"deadhead44","7","1","2","9 December 2006"," More than just football
","I have found Oliver Stone's films to be quite hit or miss. Platoon is one of my favorite movies, yet I can't stand Alexander. So where does Any Given Sunday rank in Stone's career? Better than average. While over the top and at times not very realistic, the acting is solid and the story is compelling. Pacino's speech towards the end is definitely a stand-out moment. While I am not a fan of this growing trend of ""hyper-editing"", a la Tony Scott's last few outings as well as Natural Born Killers, for me it doesn't hurt this movie. In my eyes Any Given Sunday is underrated. This is probably, and understandably, due to its graphic nature and appealing mainly to men. There is a lot going on under the surface when you begin to peel back the layers. Pacinos coach has such a sadness to him that is nearly palpable. There is an interesting subplot dealing with Matthew Modine's character. The usage of real former NFL players like Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown feel natural. This isn't just a sports movie, it deals with real human emotions and is definitely not sugar-coated. If you have liked some Stone movies like Wall Street, Platoon, and JFK, it's worth checking this one out."
"lambiepie-2","8","1","2","13 September 2006"," One of the most entertaining of the genre
","The one thing I like about Oliver Stone is that he can put together one of the best ensemble casts for films today. (Robert Altman and Paul Thomas Anderson are also good at it, Altman being the best) This is one of those films that has football and story that is very interesting and this film has something for everyone.<br/><br/>I've gotta say that every time I look at this film, I do snicker a bit for I moved out to Los Angeles, California around the time they lost their two football teams. One of the characters here played well by Cameron Diaz, I am sure is loosely based on the LA Rams owner of that time. (I say loosely because Cameron's character's claim to ownership fame was via her father passing the team onto her and her degrees. For the Rams, well, let's say, Joe Esterhaus should have based his movie ""Showgirls"" on her.)<br/><br/>I guess there are a lot of ""little insider things"" like that that Oliver Stone threw in this film. But the bottom line is, I am not an avid football watcher, or an avid film goer for sports films...but I like watching this film!! You get interested, keeps you interested.<br/><br/>I like Al Pacino as the dry, dusty coach who should have been named the head of the team. I like the showing of the marketing dogs behind the new team star, played by Jamie Foxx and I liked the on screen rivalry between Foxx and LL Cool J. I like the story with Dennis Quaid as the vet who get's injured and his wife played by Lauren Holly who just can't let go of all the glitz that came with him once being the top, I like the showing of the women with their claws in these foot ballers, I like Cameron Diaz who is in over her head and thinks a college education as an administrator in this game is everything and her quest for dollars, I like Charleton Heston's cameo role, I like Ann-Margaret as the ""I don't care what ya do"" mom to Cameron Diaz, I like Clifton Davis as the Mayor, I liked watching J.T. and Jim Brown and all the other American Football players on the field (T.O...can you believe it???), I like the party girls and the high class hookers (Elizabeth Berkley), I like James Woods as the team doctor getting his 'due' as part of the team, I love Thomas Jane as the booth coach and hey....I really liked John C. McGinnley as the sports writer. A good ensemble cast...in parts that aren't what they are typically known for but come together here under Stones direction well.<br/><br/>You get foot ball from all sides from this film - the field, the administration, the personal, the injuries etc. And please, watch this film uncut and with good sound. The sound on this film is to die for! It is an ambitious work and it works big time."
"lee_eisenberg","7","1","2","18 April 2006"," Oliver Stone and Charlton Heston collaborating on a movie? Bring it on!
","Having dealt with various politically charged topics in movies, Oliver Stone looked at pro football in ""Any Given Sunday"". Set in Miami, Al Pacino is as intense as ever playing coach Tony D'Amato, near the end of his rope. Throughout the movie, there are many games (and conflicts related thereto), a lot of people get seriously injured (physically and emotionally), and other such things. But through thick and thin, everyone has to get on with their lives somehow.<br/><br/>I must say that the movie pulls no punches (note: there are no conspiracy theories here). Cameron Diaz shows that she can do a serious, gritty role here as Christina Pagniacci, who may be considering taking over the team. Maybe this isn't Stone's best movie, but it is a good, scathing look at a typically American sport. Why do we even call it football when we don't play it with our feet? Also starring Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, Jim Brown, Ann-Margaret, Aaron Eckhart and Charlton Heston. As a joke, I'll translate the cast into their most famous roles/images: Michael Corleone, The Mask's love interest, the ""Far from Heaven"" husband, a September 12th Republican, Ray Charles, a rapper, Pvt. Joker from ""Full Metal Jacket"", Mr. Blaxploitation, a 1960s sex kitten, a tobacco industry spin doctor, and Moses.<br/><br/>And to what can we attribute the fact that left-wing conspiracy theorist Oliver Stone and right-wing gun lover Charlton Heston collaborated on a movie? Maybe that they both caught some flak after Columbine (Stone directed ""Natural Born Killers"" and Heston held a pro-NRA rally)."
"p_liles","2","1","2","24 January 2006"," I love football, but hate this movie
","I have my likes and dislikes just like everyone else. I like football. I like Al Pacino. I like long movies. I even like to look at Cameron Diaz as long as she doesn't talk...<br/><br/>I haven't seen every movie ever made, but I've seen my fair share. Of the movies I have seen this movie ranks as the second worst cast movies ever (when it comes to the two main characters) only better than ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" casting of Keanu Reeves and Wynona Rider. Al Pacino, as good of an actor as he is, is no more convincing as a football coach as he would be portraying a 9-yr old girl scout selling cookies. Cameron Diaz's performance may be close to her real personality, but she doesn't convince me she is that person in the movie.<br/><br/>There are a couple of bright spots, like Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J & Dennis Quaid, but they cannot overcome the lack of believability that surrounds Pacino & Diaz.<br/><br/>One other major problem with the film, other than the acting, is how long it is. Remember, I like football.... I like long movies.... But, about 45 minutes into the movie I was looking at my watch wondering if it would ever end. Well another 2 hours and 15 minutes later it finally did. There are few other movies (and none with the budget of this film) that I have been more bored in. If they would've edited this movie down to 60 minutes (and by doing so edited out all of Pacino & Diaz's scenes), I probably would've given it a 7 or 8, but as it stands this stinker is lucky to get the 2-rating I give it."
"PersianPlaya408","9","1","2","22 January 2006"," A great sports film
","Stones film about a NFl coach and his crisis during a year in which he is getting no younger and changes are happening around him. Al Pacino is great in this role, one of his better films in recent years. A performance kind of similar to work in Simone and Two for the money, however the film is much better, and his performance a bit more complex as well. I also liked Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Matthew Modine, Bill Bellamy and Aaron Eckhart. My favorite performance came from jamie Foxx though, he was great as 3rd string quarter back Willie ""Steamin"" beamen who gets to be the team's answer to problems after first 2 quarterbacks are injured. This film is written well by John Logan(Aviator, last samurai, Gladiator). This is not a bad film, IMDb rating is too low, it is one of the best sports films i have seen. 9/10"
"Liberace22","7","1","2","20 October 2005"," Stone is still the best director in Hollywood
","I saw this when it came out in 1999. I saw it last week again because I found the screenplay and read it. It was after reading the screenplay and then watching the movie again that I fully grasped what Stone was trying to tell me with this film.<br/><br/>The core of the film is that the game has been poisoned by money, greed and power. Player's play on steroids or Demoral. Pride and ego get in the way. Groupies and drugs are attractive pitfalls. Nothing new you'd say, but the way Stone exposes the game of contemporary football to us is so unnerving it's just hard to believe these people are our heroes, our modern-day gladiators. I never looked the same at the game.<br/><br/>As usual Stone casts newcomers (Foxx, Diaz) and puts them against solid actors (Pacino, Woods, Modine). He gets the maximum out of Foxx, but Diaz is just a bit out of her league. She tries, but fumbles in the end-zone. I loved the fact that Stone gave Berkley a role in a major studio film. Nobody wanted to touch her after Showgirls. But Stone did. I love that guy.<br/><br/>Stone is a master of a form that Tony Scott is not: fast and heavy, MTV-style cutting with steadycam and held-camera work. Only Stone can do this the right way. But you can see that Stone doesn't have the help of Robert Richardson, his DP since Platoon. It's not bad, but different.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is (in the tradition like North Dallas 40) a true piece of sport cinema. Sentimental, but filled with terrific dialogue, great actors and action. Oliver Stone may not be the renegade he was, but he still is one of the best directors in Hollywood."
"katz2weird","10","1","2","24 August 2005"," Most realistic movie in a long time.
","I love football. That was a wonderful movie, especially when the opposing teams are facing and you can hear them snort like bulls ready to charge. I found it very realistic and compelling and especially gripping. The players and the challenges they faced were realistic. The female owner was another believable character. The top 2 characters were Willie and the coach. I especially liked how once he got famous, he got cocky, like Ray Charles did. People don't realize that it is not one player that makes or breaks the team. It is all the players who support the good players. When Willie was playing with the team, they blocked for him. When he got so self centered, they did not. It taught him how to be humble I guess."
"Rogue12","8","1","2","14 August 2005"," Battles in the trenches and in the skybox
","The best Sports Movie I've seen. Oliver Stone treats this like a war movie more than a film about American Football. But with plenty of gunned passes and long bombs You see this is not a sports movie in the traditional sense where a bunch of misfits, has-beens and never-will-bees, come together as a team to win against the odds, this film is about the events that go on off the field more than the time spent suited up on a Sunday afternoon.<br/><br/>Off the field we have the new money driven young owner (Diaz) clashing with the hard old school coach (Pachino). Ethics are questioned with the two Doctors on staff (Woods and Modine) and how they treat the players. The finance and the politics, the effects a team has on the city it's based in and vice versa and the families of the players involved, including a quite vicious Mrs Rooney (Holly) On the field it goes a little more by the numbers. In an allegory to the changing styles in the NFL, Dennis Quaid putts in an excellent performance as the Joe Montana of the AFFA, worried about the Michael Vick style play of Foxx's young blood coming to take over and both play well the conflict of the Pocket passer Vs the Scrambler and the Veteran star Vs the Next Big Thing.<br/><br/>LL Cool J's 'all about the money' free agent half back throws extra pressure on the beleaguered coaching staff while he attempts to get his stats up for his bonuses and sponsorship deals as Laurence Taylor provides some added authenticity in a role that would not have stretched him terribly, that of a Veteran All-Pro linebacker headed straight for the Hall of fame.<br/><br/>The games play more like battle scenes than sporting events, with close ups of action in the trenches, slow motion shots of important hits, as all the minor stories come together to the conclusion.<br/><br/>Stone also uses a lesson here learned by the industry in the classic 'Escape to Victory' in that he lets the actors concentrate on the acting and the players (such as NFL stars Terrell Owens and Ricky Watters) do the playing and both films benefit as sports movies by in fact not being sports movies at all."
"kevin142","8","1","2","4 August 2005"," Sports and life
","It is an exciting sports movie. Due to the injury of teammates, the quarterback Willie started his funny show. He vomited because of panic. Even after he became famous, he still kept the laughable habit. His sudden success confused him. He became self-conceited and underestimated his teammates. Even coach Tony could not persuade him. As football is a collective item, that was a fatal mistake. Without effective support, Willie could do nothing. He got the lesson from his silly action.<br/><br/>What Tony said in the locker before the playoff game was the most encouraging words I ever heard. His firm voice conquered everyone including me. Unfortunately I can not fight for him. I think that is not just for sports. We also need it everywhere.<br/><br/>The convincing performance of Al Pacino proved that he could play any role. At the time unknown Jamie Foxx had won the academy award (the best actor for Ray) now. Cameron Diaz was not impressive as her There's something about Mary. Maybe she is just good at comedian movie.<br/><br/>An exhilarating sports movie you should not miss. 8/10"
"policy134","2","1","2","3 August 2005"," On any given Sunday there will be sold movie tickets. To this one I am not so sure.
","Oliver Stone was one of the major wheels in the film industry in the mid-80's but lately he has been more ridiculed, no doubt because of his political stance more than for his movies.<br/><br/>This is the first film he's made that really has no real target, at least not if you are looking for something like a conspiracy thriller, which he of course is famous for. The theme is professional football but here his viewpoint is very hazy. Although, he shows us tons of despicable characters who are in the business end of the sport, they are really not more bad than the players who live for the sport.<br/><br/>Al Pacino as the aging coach has a bravura opening moment where he chews his players out for stinking up the field. He is one of those actor who can make shouting the most hilarious piece of showmanship you have ever seen. Unfortunately, that is the climax of this movie. Form there we get a long boring story about how the coach is becoming obsolete, as is his star player, Cap (played by a sleepwalking Dennis Quaid). The owner of the football team (played by Cameron Diaz in a totally unsympathetic part) wants more sponsorship and is usually thinking of financial gain which disgusts the Pacino character. Despite this rather dry storyline there is a bright spot. Cap gets an injury and is replaced by a third-stringer named Willie (played by recent Oscar-winner Jamie Foxx). He makes a total ass of himself when he vomits on open camera in his first game but then the team wins and the coach and Willie are quick to think that it has something to do with the puking. Could there be any more superstitious twerps? This ritual is totally played for laughs by Stone and that is refreshing since he normally gets very dour and has a rather tepid sense of humour.<br/><br/>Another actor who has virtually become a staple in Stone's films is James Woods and he chews up the scenery as a crooked team doctor but he is not really a major character in this film. Stone is more interested in exploring the age thing this time, not crooked politics. Too bad, because I was about to give the movie my full attention when he showed up on screen. The age thing also concerns the relationship between Pacino and Foxx, not that he is black as Foxx claims. He is arrogant, greedy and totally self-absorbed until he learns a lesson and then makes the usual 180 degree turn at the end.<br/><br/>The football scenes are played out as noisy, confusing and violent extravaganzas and one would think that made it exciting. Not in my opinion but it is far better watching that than the interval scenes which bears little resemblance to anything than a session at a psychiatrist. I heard that Stone got scathing reviews for his epic ""Alexander"" also but I haven't see that yet so I will simply say that Stone should have stuck to doing films about subjects nearer to his heart because the only thing we see here is an outsider who is more fascinated by the subject than knowledgeable."

","Overlong, but appropriately(and predictably)overheated grid-iron drama from director Oliver Stone makes the football field look like a battleground at war-time(and verbally compares the player's huddle to a foxhole). Al Pacino is the coach facing five losses in a row, Dennis Quaid is the aging quarterback, Jamie Foxx is the new star in town, and Cameron Diaz is the daughter of the team's owner, now deceased. Many great throwaway moments, lots of kinetic film-making energy, but the movie makes its points early on and then hammers at them for another hour and a half. Great cast, including Charlton Heston and Ann-Margret in small roles, is up for the challenges of the demanding scenario(with Quaid in particular doing some of his best work ever), but after awhile this gets repetitious, with the viewer batted around as much as the players."

","It is amazing how little Stone choses to focus on the actual game of football, instead, he does his best to detail all of the surrounding issues of the game - from the corrupt trainer to the mercenary running back. Perhaps the only aspect of the game that he doesn't cover - presumably from lack of time, rather than lack of desire (although Stone is never seemingly held back by the length of a reel) - is the influence of the fans. We see glimpses of the overweight, sweaty, face-painted hooligans up in the crowd, but it'd be interesting to get a little more out of them.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is exceptional, and does a great job of creating stadium-level tension in your living room. In a traditionally masculine fashion, we watch this film every year before the Superbowl. Were I slightly more full of myself, I'd go on and on about how it reminds us of all the 'little people' that make a football team work. But really, it's just an enjoyable flick."

","I will admit: I have never played football at a professional level (Only at the High School and hopefully soon at the college level. I'm a Nose Guard and occasionaly an Offensive Tackle). But Pro Football (American Football, not that Communist soccer BS) is portrayed pretty well here.<br/><br/>
===============================================> The movie is about an imaginary Football Franchise in an imaginary Football League (Though they do mention the NFL). Al Pacino plays the old, stressed coach of the Miami Sharks. When his 1st and 2nd string Quarterbacks go down, he is forced to put 3rd stringer Willie Beaman (Fox) into the game. When Willie becomes a star, problems arise within the franchise about ego, money, etc.<br/><br/>==============================================> In regards to the way the Franchise is run, this movie is not terribly realistic, though not too far off the truth. The first string quarterback isn't even 40 and is considered very old, which is true in the NFL. But the parties, drugs, etc, while still in the NFL, are largely a thing of the past, due to current ethics stipulations put in most contracts. They over-do the drama that is being a professional player in a lot of areas.<br/><br/>
But the action in the games/practices is almost dead on. I've given (and taken) hits in games, and the pain comes back every time I watch it. The feeling, the rush, you get from hearing another man's pain filled scream as you put your shoulder-pad into his chest isn't really something you can explain, without having experienced it.<br/><br/>Of course, some things are totally BS. The eye thing was stupid and probably just there for 'shock and awe' value. But for the most part, pretty realistic.<br/><br/>The acting is...pretty good, though nothing stellar. Pacino does the best job, portraying an old, broken down, frustrated coach past his prime. Fox is good, though could have been better. LL Cool Jay over-acts a bit, but is convincing.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is standard, but still good, mostly techno-jock jam stuff. I'm not a big fan of Moby, but it fits the movie nicely.<br/><br/>
The action scenes are pretty well done, mostly by ex-players/no-names I've been told. There's a little too much high-flying and over-dramatic stunts, but mostly it's pretty realistic.<br/><br/>There's not much to say about this movie. But I do want to say one thing:<br/><br/>If you've never played the game, never strapped on the pads, never buckled the helmet, don't imedeatly call this movie crap. Is it perfect? Not nearly. They should have had a lot more playing scenes, and they over-dramatized a lot.<br/><br/>But If you've never run 100 yard wind sprints, never taken pain-killers 6 times a day, never been in the hospital for a concussion, never woke up covered in bruises, never spent 4 hours a day in the weight-room, and never been on the field of battle with 10 other people who are closer than brothers to you, don't slam this movie."

The scene were a football player loses his right eyeball wasn't put for entertainment, or for amusing or anything like that. The point was to show how the public, the crowd, the stadium reacted to it. You can see the public rasing of their sits with grins on their faces to see something, with a sort of need to watch violence. For those of you who have seen other Stone movies, I know how this sounds to you, exactly as the media theme of NBK, a critic to society.

"Danfish","9","1","2","8 April 2002"," The finest film about sports ever made
","Let's get a couple of things straight:<br/><br/>I'm a 'limey' through and through, and know next to nothing about 'Football'. In Britain, most people consider 'Football' (I use inverted commas because we Brits call soccer 'football', too) to be a tamer version of rugby, played by wusses who are have to hide behind acres of padding. Anyone who continues to think that after watching this movie is clearly quite demented.<br/><br/>My only experience of 'Football' before this was playing John Madden's Football on the Playstation, so I never thought a good movie could be made about the sport. Even under the capable guidance of Oliver Stone.<br/><br/>
BUT Any Given Sunday is so well acted, so incisive in its handling of the financial and ethical pressures facing the sport, and so brilliantly directed that I will NEVER get tired of watching it.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is especially surprising, notably in his showdown scene with Al Pacino, perfectly portraying the attitude and idiosyncrasies of an arrogant young hot head who had been catapulted to fame almost by accident. In English Football we have plenty of players just like this.<br/><br/>Even Al Pacino is great, and I normally hate the guy (if I want to hear a tired looking man shout at me incoherently, then I'll walk into a bar and spit beer in the bartender's face). <br/><br/>However, you definitely don't need to be interested in sports to enjoy this frenetic, amazing film. The match scenes are closer to the battle scenes in Gladiator then to any other sports film. As you would expect from Stone, the focus of his film (i.e. a fictional football league) is a microcosm for American society and no stone is left unturned; racism, corruption, heroism, self-destruction, greed, power... it's all there. <br/><br/>If you don't watch this movie, damnit, you don't deserve eyes.

But even those serve the movie, they're no playing-around gadget shots.<br/><br/>This is not another sports-movie. It could take place in a number of other areas (i.e. any other team sport, big business etc.).<br/><br/>There is a wonderfully written story. About winning and losing; about the fear of not being up to it anymore because you got older, because you crossed that line with everybody noticing but you; about youth, with its naiveness, its recklessness and sometimes its tendency to do anything - or not ! - to achieve recognition...<br/><br/>Al Pacino does it again; the young Jamie Foxx was born to play that 'alien' nicknamed super-player; Cameron Diaz gets a deserved chance to show she can do a dramatic part TOO; Dennis Quaid hasn't been that good for a while...<br/><br/>Everybody is just in his right place, and what takes over isn't one of those marvelous actors: it's the story. A story about human beings, their love of power, glory, and their weakness, their readiness to betray... all for the love of the game. Which offers us just wonderful moments of the coach talking to his team like a father to his family, about life and death all being on the same level with the playing as a team.<br/><br/>I was blown over, what a great surprise, Stone being as fresh as ever, and for once leaving (professional, rotten) politic issues on the side, to tell a tale about human politics.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie slows down towards the end, but by then, you've seen more than enough to keep your mind on it for a while.<br/><br/>Very, very warmly recommended!"

""Platoon"" was definitely Oscar worthy, but then there was the conspiracy theory nonsense of ""JFK"" and the over the top violence of ""Natural Born Killers"". But Stone puts in a solid effort with this film, a movie that both pays homage to and takes a critical look at the world of professional football. <br/><br/>The plot itself is fairly conventional. It's basically relating the never-ending conflict between youth and maturity. On the one side, you've got experience, tradition, and loyalty, on the other, energy, innovation, and self interest. Representing the former are Al Pacino, as the coach of the Miami Sharks and their veteran quarterback, Jack 'Cap' Rooney, played by Dennis Quaid. The `young guns' consist of Cameron Diaz, a hot yet cold-blooded blonde who has inherited the team from her father, and the equally hot backup QB, Willie Beamon, (Jamie Foxx) who takes over the starting spot after Rooney gets sidelined by an injury. And, despite some great football action footage, the most memorable scenes are those which show the essential conflicts between these two forces, most notably when Pacino and Foxx turn a lunch meeting into a no holds barred verbal brawl, and when Pacino and Diaz face off over who, and more importantly, whose values, will guide the team. In addition, there's a nicely developed side issue, a conflict between the team's doctors, one an old cynic, played by James Woods, who lies to his players about the severity of their injuries in order to keep their morale (and the team's cash flow) up, and the other a youngster who still retains his ideals and basic decency. In these scenes, Stone delivers first-rate acting and interpersonal drama at its best.<br/><br/>
In short, what makes this movie work is that Oliver Stone, while using his film to address larger social issues, nonetheless focuses first and foremost on telling a really good story. All the key actors are allowed to portray fully three-dimensional characters. We can relate to Pacino as the `old school' coach, a man who used to settle contract issues with Diaz's father over a beer and a handshake, Quaid as the legend who must nonetheless face both his age and his injuries, Foxx as the young hotshot with an attitude and a chip on his shoulder, and finally Diaz, who, despite being quite the icy bitch, also represents the business realities of modern day sports. There's also fine work by the supporting actors, most notably Jim Brown as an assistant coach, who reminisces about the `old days' when players had to sell used cars in the off season just to make ends meet. On the one hand, we can see how modern players are finally getting their fair slice of the financial pie, yet at the same time mourn the loss of team loyalty and the purity of playing for the sake of the game instead of for the next contract negotiation. <br/><br/>

","I love football and thought this would be an enjoyable film to watch. I was grossly wrong. Many pro football players are egotistical, boozers and womanizers; why on earth did Oliver Stone find it necessary to waste so much time on something we already knew? Even if we didn't, why was so much time wasted on it regardless when the film itself had what looked like a fairly interesting plotline. I got to the point where I had almost forgotten what the plot was and finally decided I no longer cared. Out of four stars, I'd give it one star."

In ""Any Given Sunday"", director Oliver Stone shows us his thoughts about the world of pro football, on and off the field. He has recruited lots of talented actors, Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods and newcomer Jamie Foxx to name a few. Everyone involved does a good job and actually convinces us that they are in the football business.<br/><br/>
The film has Oliver Stone printed all over it, with razor-sharp editing and a pumping soundtrack, and it reminds of his controversial movie ""Natural Born Killers"". This one is just as good as ""NBK"", because it remains both believable and exciting at the same time. Being a European, I still don´t understand the joy about one of the world´s strangest sports, but the movie did entertain.<br/><br/>My only complains are the movie´s length (162 minutes) which feels a bit too long, and the part of the movie when we get to face Pacino´s personal problems never gets as interesting as the events out on the field.<br/><br/>4/5"
"mikel weisser","10","1","2","9 December 2001"," best football movie ever? probably
","Oliver Stone may not have outdone his personal best but ""Any Given Sunday"" overwhelms every other football film. Ever. Like Ted Kotcheff's ""North Dallas Forty"" this film attempts to cover every aspect of a major league team it can possibly handle. In Stone's hands that means a three hour movie, speaking cast of hundreds and crowd scenes bigger than ""Ben Hur"" except with the chariot race from old ""Ben"" and Charleton Heston himself thrown in for good measure.  Lead actors Pacino, Quaid, Foxx, Diaz, and Jim Brown all give career high performances. Gridiron great Lawrence Taylor could make himself star with the role he turns in; and Taylor is just one of the dozens of present and past pigskin heroes Oliver honors with screen time. Stone himself even turns in a credible self mocking performance as a drunken commentator.  Like most later Stone films the movie is given to excess,an extended play soundtrack, technically stunning sight and sound work and occasionally superfluous cinematic symbolism shots (i.e. the gladiator shots aren't in there by accident); but Stone goes deep and scores very big time. A commentary, a pulse pounder, a work of art, a winner."
"gbheron","7","1","2","23 September 2001"," Pretty Enjoyable Football Story
","Oliver Stone's ""Any Given Sunday"" creates its story from within the inner workings of a professional football team. Mr. Stone is more restrained (for him at least), and doesn't go as over-the-top with his story a la ""JFK"" or visually a la ""Natural Born Killers"".  Though, his editing still might give Grandma a headache. Plot-wise Mr. Stone tells a straightforward football story, and does it well. He gets lots of help from his actors, especially Al Pacino as the embattled coach, and Cameron Diaz, who is surprisingly good as the young, inept team owner. As rentals go, I put this on my Recommended list, but it does not aspire to, nor achieve greatness. This is sad, because regardless of the fact that ""Any Given Sunday"" is a decent movie, Stone can do much better."

","From one of Hollywood's best and most detail-heavy directors.  This film features the best performance by an actor portraying a coach (the incredible Pacino), two of the best performances by athletes in film history (Lawrence Taylor and Jim Brown are incredible), one of the best speeches in film history (the ""Inches"" pregame monologue) and some of the best sports action ever captured on the screen. This is just a masterwork of the chaos that is professional football.  Any Given Sunday shows you everything these guys do, and puts you right in their shoes.  The excellent cinematography puts you in the middle of the action, but also gives you some beautiful wide shots.  The use of music in the film is some of the best ever.  There is music set to almost every scene and each is perfect for the emotion of that situation.  You want to cheer during several games in the movie.  Anyway, I don't want to ramble so there's my piece.  I love this film.  I gave it a 94 on my grading scale and it's one of the 5 Best of 1999.  It's also vastly underrated and often (and inaccurately) labelled as merely a 2 hour and 40 minute music video.  Wrong. It's simply the best."
"FeverDog","7","1","2","21 June 2001"," I eventually do discuss AGS here - it's a long journey, but a scenic one...
","So I took another giant leap in my ongoing quest in becoming a sports fan. Tonight I was riveted by the second Yankee upset to the rallying Detroit. Then I watched the complete postgame program, including all that happened in baseball tonight.  Then I watched the midnight, edited rerun while flipping to the repeated Mets game.  Ain't that something for me to be proud of?<br/><br/>I now know the complete Yankee starting defensive lineup, if not yet batting order (I'm working on that one).  Ok, I don't know all the pitchers yet. But I haven't known this much since growing up with the 80's Phillies.  I also know who's on the DL and why, and how it affects the team, and who's in a slump and who's on fire.<br/><br/>Man, who knew Detroit was this much a match?  I hadn't ever heard anything about them until this series.  They've earned my respect, and have established themselves in my eyes as a viable force.  I also now know details of their park and their players.<br/><br/>And talk about rallies.  The Mets have a four game winning streak, their best of the season.  But, as a former Philadelphia native - go Phillies!  A two-game division lead!  Put that in your crock pot and simmer it, Atlanta!!<br/><br/>This brings me thoughts of why football never held any allure for me. Because the Eagles play each team only once or twice in regular season, they don't allow me to properly size up the opposition.  I hardly know any of the other quarterbacks in the sport (and none of the other positions), or the idiosyncrasies of the stadiums, if they exist.  If this compacted, accelerated schedule applied to baseball, I would never have had the opportunity to recognize Detroit's strengths or know much about any non-Yankee players.<br/><br/>Anyway, so after the high of a Yankee game, I was really itching for a movie that took an insider's look at professional baseball.  But I couldn't think of one that fully explores this angle.  Bull Durham is set in the minors and focuses on the superstition aspects of the game as well as specific fictional characters.  The Natural and Field of Dreams focus on baseball's romantic allure and its idealistic nature as America's Favorite Pastime. Major League is played broadly for laughs.  The Babe is simply awful.  For Love of the Game could have been good had it focused more on Costner's mind (and the team's reaction) while pitching a perfect game, and less on syrupy, groan-inducing, clichéd, generic romantic turmoil in the pitcher's private life.  So what are we left with?<br/><br/>Then, lo and behold, Any Given Sunday pops up on HBO.  THIS is what I'm talking about!  What I was looking for was a baseball version along these lines.  The inevitable collision of a rookie's ego, inexperience, talent, and stupidity.  The relationship of the team, coaches, and reporters. Yeah, parts of the movie are, well, ""movie-ish"" (do real players recite brief monologues, trade insults, and incite a shoving match while in a huddle? I've never seen it.)  But Oliver Stone is a masterful director who gives all his films an immediate, urgent feel with creative editing and topnotch production values, even though sometimes he feels the need for his characters to shout at the top of their lungs too much to complete the effect;  he's never been known for subtlety.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday stimulated my mind to wander a bit, and I reflected on the similarities of Dennis Quaid's characters here and in Everybody's All American - a legendary quarterback past his prime who's trying to retain his dignity and stature in the sport.  And, poof!  I flip to Showtime, and there's Everybody's All American.  God must have had His cable modem plugged into my head tonight.  This happened earlier in the day too.  Poetic Justice, featuring Regina King, was on Cinemax.  Ms. King was also in Jerry Maguire, which led me to Tom Cruise and thoughts on the era in his career as a rising star - the 80's.  And of course one can't think of said era without reflecting on his financially successful misfire known as Cocktail.  Sure enough, Cocktail also made an appearance on television tonight.  Too bad God logged off when I wished for a Yankee victory this evening.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to AGS.  How clueless is Elizabeth Berkeley's manager?  We all know the story of Showgirls.  She tried to break out of her wholesome TV image in an daring, adult role.  She failed, with a wooden performance (and she wasn't helped by the impossible dialogue and ridiculous character), and garnered scathing reviews.  On the flip side, Gina Gershon made the most out of her character and was rewarded with a integral role in Face/Off and a lead in Bound.  A successful example of the transition Berkeley attempted is Lisa Bonet, who broke free of her Cosby persona in an equally controversial, bod-baring performance in Angel Heart.  Bonet's role was supporting, so perhaps Berkeley felt, when she accepted the lead Showgirls role, that by baring so much skin in a notorious movie, she'd be catapulted to stardom like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct.  Lizzy, honey, you ain't no Sharon Stone;  you possess neither solid acting ability nor star power.  Neither does, say, Ashley Judd, but she obviously has a established, influential agent/manager to overcome these obstacles.  This is also why Cameron Diaz became a headliner within a couple of years after The Mask.  Diaz does have star power, which helps, too; Judd took a lot longer to get where she is after her debut in 1993's Ruby in Paradise, and still can't headline a movie; Tommy Lee Jones and an intriguing (but deeply flawed) premise contributed to the commercial success of Double Jeopardy.<br/><br/>So, after the failure of Showgirls, what does Berkeley do?  Bares her boobs again, but this time in an inconsequential bit role.  Granted, she's romantically partnered with Al Pacino, but, unlike Diaz, her character is not connected with the central plotline and can be easily eliminated.  This is not the way to rise to the top in Hollywood - from a lead to a bit player, trying to make her breasts her ticket to stardom.  Stupid girl.<br/><br/>
Another point about AGS is that I admired its attention to the corporatization (is that a word?) of pro ball, from the superstars' endorsement deals and vanity projects (like cutting an inane, ego-inflating rap album) to the trend of naming ballparks the likes of Coors Stadium, Staples Center, and First Union Center.  This view is expressed in a scene with Pacino and Jim Brown, where Brown recalls a time when players didn't have their eye on the riches and were thrilled to merely be a part of the tradition and prestige of the sport, which leads Pacino to lament the advent, ubiquity, and hype of modern sports broadcasting as the culprit of the misguided values of today's younger stars.  This is why I'm anti-corporate:  ""Teams"" are now known as ""franchises.""  Stadiums are no longer named to honor legendary figures or a location.  Fenway.  Ebbetts. The Vet, Camden Yards and Madison Square Garden.  All these names evoke a sense of history.  Hell, there was even a Mr. Shea who was granted eternal props.<br/><br/>Jeez, I wish I could build a career on all this:  personal ruminations based in film comparison and analysis.  Oh well, that's why God created IMDb at least.  I hope I haven't breached the thousand word limit.  As for Any Given Sunday:  I have seen it all the way through, but didn't tonight.  I do recall Jamie Foxx's breakthrough performance, and, during a beach scene with babes in bikinis, how and why movies stars today have bodies like Diaz and not, say, Marilyn Monroe (bless you, Kate Winslet).  And, viewed on television, how better the film must look in widescreen.  And how quickly the running time goes by (unlike the draggy Nixon).  And how Stone somewhat reigned in his trademark bombast towards a point of self-parody (it's an artistic step back) to deliver a mainstream hit.<br/><br/>7/10"
"xawn","9","1","2","18 May 2001"," Oliver Stone succeeds were others have failed
","American football is a recurring theme - the sports is adrenaline packed which makes it a major candidate for a good 'action' film. Such films circle around common plots - a team in crisis, an emerging genial quarterback, team bonding, and great speeches before the game. And this is not to different from the rest. However, the characters in the film are depicted in such a way as to make them seem more real - with all their flaws and fears - such that at the end we are left with a balance of heroes and villians. The film is embraced with great acting (Al Pacino is superb), great actors, great action, and great words (Al Pacino's speech before the final game is awesome). The film is a typical Oliver Stone production - a hybrid between film and documentary. Great shots, music, words but at the same time an exploration into the word of sports - the players both on and off the field - and the tough decisions that have to made to make it in the game.<br/><br/>A film to be watched more than once."
"Mickey Knox","9","1","2","29 January 2001"," another masterpiece
","""Any Given Sunday"" keeps the unmistakable style of Oliver Stone, especially seen in Natural Born Killers, transporting it this time in the new, agitated, full of events world of american football.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the coach of a football team, owned by the greedy Cameron Diaz, team that passes through difficult times, after 4 consecutive defeats and the injury of the best 2 quarterbacks. In this moment enters Beaman (Foxx), the ""always substitute"", and he doesn't miss the unexpected chance awarded by the coach. By his style of play, spectacular, but not caring about the tactics and the schemes, he wins the heart of the fans, but enters in the disgrace of the coach.<br/><br/>The world of football is an eternal source of  stories or problems that can be used in a movie. After he showed us wars, from many points of view, the murder of JFK, the agitated history of The Doors, or the satire against the media in Natural Born Killers, Oliver Stone enters on an unused territory so far. And he does it in style, with an exceptional movie.<br/><br/>One thing must be clear: this is not a movie only for football fans, but for everybody. Because it's not a movie necessarily about football, but about team spirit, about friendships, joys or troubles, a film with strong characters played by really special actors. A film that will keep your interest at high levels, despite its long runtime, by the fabulous style of Stone, but also by the story, full of events dictated by interests or the rush for money, that many times dims freindships or any bit of morality.<br/><br/>During the movie, you are taken through the backstage of american football. You will discover a dirty world, full of interests and passions, far of the beauty observed from outside. Al Pacino is a character caught between the desire of winning  every match no matter what and the friendship that ties him with ""old"" Rooney, who injures himself at the beginning. Beaman is a young football player, selfish, insensitive, but with an extraordinary talent. Many times, the sudden pass from anonymity in the spotlights can bring with it major changes in the character's personality, changes that can only be bad. That's what happends to Beaman. The selfishness, the interest only for himself, bring major misunderstandings between him and his teammates or his coach. Al Pacino has the tough mission of bringing the team to the desired levels, calming down the spirits and also making the difficult decision concerning the quarterback: Beaman or Rooney. New or old. Talent or team player.<br/><br/>Although the script is very good, the film wouldn't have had the same value without Oliver Stone on board. He shows us again, one more time, his great talent. By his awesome way of filming, that reminds us of NBK, the fast paced, incredibly real dialogues, or last, but not least, the full of significance ""inserts"" with what he feasted our eyes and mind also in NBK, you actually feel that you are a part of this world, that you are really inside it. You can't even blink without being sorry. Again, the camera moves very quickly, this agressive style, of fast filming, ""short"" editing, strange angles or permenent camera movement, being a characteristic of many Stone movies. And the ""inserts"" have a special meaning again, especially in the scene of the dialogue between Foxx and Pacino, maybe the best and most significant of the whole movie.<br/><br/>All in all, another success for Oliver Stone. A movie added to his impressive collection of masterpieces, of the most varied and original director of our times."

","If you've ever seen more than three Oliver Stone-directed movies, they all start to look and feel the same. You can tell one without even seeing the credits. He is not really interested in how you feel or how his characters feel so his movies are usually very entertaining but emotionally barren.<br/><br/>This epic is no exception.  It did not matter a damn to me what happened to anyone in the movie, which is unfortunate since you are spending over 2 1/2 hours with these people. <br/><br/>Too many scenes are redundant - Al getting wasted at the course of his life, at least three/four times? He was starting to remind me of ""Scarface"" and I was waiting for a speech to go along with his misery.  OK, I get it, he's discontent.  I don't need a brick wall to fall on me to get that point across. <br/><br/>Of the gigantic cast, only Dennis Quaid actually looks like a football player.  Jamie Foxx has some great moments and some not so great. I thought Al Pacino was wildly miscast but it was great to see him again, and I enjoyed a couple of his scenes with Ann-Margret.  Cameron Diaz was completely one-note, as was James Woods and Lauren Holly. Lela Rochon comes off best out of the 'wives/girlfriends' contingent. <br/><br/>This is not a big deal, but it kind of bothered me...at one point, Al is watching ""Ben-Hur"" and you get to see several scenes from that movie, including star Charlton Heston.  Later in the movie, Heston shows up as the Commissioner!  Granted, he's forty years older now, but still...was Gregory Peck too busy?  Its a three minute cameo, someone else should be been hired to avoid the distraction.<br/><br/>But if you're not that excited about the movie you're watching, something like this can give you something to think about, though."

"Buddy-51","Null","1","2","9 September 2000"," pumped-up but cliched film
","Unlike `Jerry Maguire,' which found a way to appeal to a broad segment of the movie going public, Oliver Stone's `Any Given Sunday' pretty much requires that one be a hardcore aficionado of professional football to really appreciate it.  Stone and co-writer John Logan deserve credit for attempting to create a comprehensive panoramic view of the sport, warts and all.  For example, they don't shy away from portraying the drug abuse and shady medical practices that run rampant both in the locker room and out. Nor do they minimize the detrimental effect that has come about as professional football has become more and more about obscenely huge salaries, product endorsements and individual stardom and less and less about the values of winning and sticking together as a team.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the canvas becomes simply too broad to keep all this profundity in focus.  For every sharp psychological insight into the people and values that comprise this sport/industry, the film provides half a dozen hoary clichés, stock characters and predictable plot turns that consistently undercut those quality elements.   Al Pacino plays the typical aging coach who, as his losing team begins to become the laughingstock of the league, must decide whether to bow to corporate pressure and remove the injured, aging quarterback (Dennis Quaid) or stay true to his ideals and demonstrate loyalty to his players.  Cameron Diaz plays Pacino's major foil as the hard-driven team owner whose only motivating factor seems to be the Almighty Buck.  By making this character a beautiful woman, the authors get to play it both ways:  they satisfy the feminists by showing that a woman can be just as ruthless and cutthroat as any man in a position of decision-making power, yet, by making her so evil, they also placate all those men who have been smugly assuring us for years that `professional football is no place for a woman.'  (The filmmakers even have her cry in a few places).  Around these two main antagonists swirl a dozen or so equally stereotypical characters including the nefarious team doctor (James Wood, in yet another of his one-dimensional villain roles), whose shameless disregard for the health of the players is set in obvious counterpoint to the righteous young intern (Matthew Modine) who is frankly shocked at this senior doctor's cavalier indifference to the Hippocratic Oath.  LL Cool J has a minimal and undeveloped role as a cocaine-sniffing rival to the upstart young quarterback (Jamie Foxx) whose lack of understanding about the role team spirit plays in a winning strategy provides much of the driving force of the plot.  Not only does Foxx give by far and away the finest, most intensely dramatic performance of the film, but also his character provides the few moments of really solid insightful drama in the entire movie.  However, so intent are Logan and Stone in providing an upbeat ending to the film that they completely abandon the truths of this character and send him through a 180-degree conversion that is never adequately dramatized in the screenplay. He simply awakens one morning a new man, all ready to take his rightful place as a rah-rah team player.  In fact, the neat way in which all the characters and loose plot ends somehow resolve themselves into the happiest possible outcome contradicts the tone of thoughtful seriousness the filmmakers have been trying to establish all throughout the film.<br/><br/>This soft final section of the film is not the only element that undercuts the verisimilitude of the story.  For some reason, in a day and age in which Brand X has long since passed from the scene in the world of advertising and the most minor of sports films routinely use real life teams as focuses for their stories, Stone has opted to create not only a fictional franchise but a fictional league as well.  Moreover, because the team allegedly hails from Florida, the entire season seems to be played under the glowing auspices of blazing sunshine and balmy tropical breezes.  For a sport one associates with crisp fall weather and bone-chilling blizzards, this entire summer-like atmosphere seems a bit disconcerting.<br/><br/>As a director, Stone buries the drama under a flurry of MTV-like stylistic flourishes.  Too cute by half, this pretentious directorial method merely serves as a device to distance us from the characters whose plights should be drawing us deeper into the film.  In the middle of quietly dramatic scenes, Stone intercuts, in rapid succession, utterly irrelevant shots of lightning storms, roiling clouds and even snippets from the `Ben-Hur' chariot race (as a possible sop to Charlton Heston who makes a cameo appearance herein?).  Similarly, the never-ending cacophony of blaring rap tunes cluttering up the soundtrack cannot cover up the essential emptiness of the film's characters and message.  Stone has rarely seemed so transparent in his facile slickness.   Even the football scenes are pumped-up beyond necessity.  Part of the beauty of the sport lies in seeing the players' movements as all of a piece.  In the visually fractured view that Stone accords us, he does not heighten our excitement and involvement, but rather diminishes them.<br/><br/>`Any Given Sunday' is definitely a long haul and it does offer a few moments of effective drama scattered along the way.  But if you are going to devote 157 minutes to the subject of professional football, you might find that time better spent watching the real thing."

","Any Given Sunday By Dean Kish<br/><br/>	On `Any Given Sunday', gladiators clash and hearts are broken. Life is a contact sport. 	Any Given Sunday gives us a behind the scenes look at professional football as an aging coach (Al Pacino) tries to hold a franchise team together. As he embarks on that quest he must deal with a hotshot rebellious third string quarterback (Jaime Foxx), an ailing veteran quarterback who is practically he adopted son (Dennis Quaid), a vicious young owner of the franchise (Cameron Diaz), and his own personal demons. 	As I tried to watch this film I found I couldn't see the players on the field half the time. As the metallic grunge blasted in Dolby surround sound I found a second to ask the question are we watching a 2 plus hour rock video of staged football follies. What shined through during the time that my head wasn't pounding was the dramatic scene clashing between Diaz and Pacino. Diaz does show signs of breaking the pretty girl mold.<br/><br/>	Oliver Stone's cast in this film is breathtaking and should have been used as just that. Wasted here are such actors as Ann Margaret, James Woods, Mathew Modine, and Lauren Holly. Oliver Stone's main focus is on the coach who seems to be on the verge of a major collapse as he one more time tries to fight the war. 	This film is frazzled and drives the audience to wear earmuffs and goggles to see the actual hi-lights. There are some shiny moments and if the football wars were trimmed and muted then we could have had a great football movie.

Jamie Foxx is excellent as the upstart young quarterback (and he sings well too!).<br/><br/>All in all, I feel lucky to have seen a film which wasn't shown much in Britain because of its subject and am impressed with Stone's treatment of a game which is fascinating and so ugly at the same time."
"dbdumonteil","2","1","3","6 June 2003"," Sunday, violent Sunday
","Oliver Stone is keen on American football and always dreamt of devoting it a movie. In 1999, he made his dream come true. ""Any Given Sunday"" is a quite successful movie about the concerned sport which is practiced at all in France. It's especially during matches that the movie becomes awesome. Stone used a lively and even violent directing and makes us share what the players of his team feel. On the outside of these stunning moments, the movie loses of its appeal and is less convincing when it aims at denouncing financial shady dealings against Al Pacino's team. Moreover, a few characters are on the edge of caricature like one of the players who wish to manage the whole team. Nevertheless, it's a movie that is pleasant enough without boredom and American football fans should probably find something in it. Terrific performance from Al Pacino."
"halsey-3","1","1","3","10 January 2001"," Worst football movie ever
","The entire movie was an uncoordinated, unintelligible, totally detached series of 10 second scenes with constant closeup of all characters just mouthing words.<br/><br/>There was no recognizable plot,  and no beginning or ending,  just a mish-mash of useless diatribe and unbelievable football ""action""."
"eddy-love","1","1","4","19 January 2016"," Movie Comment
","I bought this movie for a $1 and it wasn't even worth that. I read a reviewer's comment that people were either going to love this movie or hate it and I fall in the haters. Once I had watched the whole movie I felt I needed a shower. All the acting was bad. This movie made like all football players did outside of playing was snorting cocaine and taking other drugs; having sex with any woman who was willing; and drinking all the time. Dennis Quaid looked like he was ready to burst into tears any time. What really shocked me was Charlton Heston's being involved with this sorry trash heap of a movie. He must have been desperate for money at the time. I was proud to read though that NFL would not let those who made this movie use the NFL logo. I don't blame them - I would want to be associated with trash either."
"ncisabbyfan30","2","1","4","17 November 2013"," Not the best football film
","I wanted to watch this movie because I like a lot of sports films. However, this movie really didn't have as much to do with football as it did with sex and drugs. There is a lot of swearing, which is to be expected with an Al Pacino film. A lot of the stuff in this film they could have done without like the nude scenes, especially the one in the locker room where the owner confronts the players. As far as the actual football games, they could not be more unrealistic. Seriously, a QB throwing up in the huddle numerous times? You never see that in any real game, college or pro. Also, how does a player get his eye knocked out? This movie needed to focus more on football than the ego of the QB. I question the casting too. Yes, Al Pacino makes a great football coach if you're looking for someone with low tolerance for bad plays in the game but Cameron Diaz as an owner? Bad choice. Not an ideal football film."
"saturdaynightbeaver","1","1","4","2 December 2004"," Poor interpretation of a great sport.
","There is a reason the NFL refused to be a part of this pile. When Oliver Stone steps up after a film like Natural Born Killers and states that he is doing an expose on something, I was sure to expect a return to the grand Wall Street era. But Stone, as the ADD child that he can be at times, throws as much unrealistic crap in this piece as he does real.<br/><br/>I don't know if he was trying to keep our attention or not, but why would you need to? It's about football! For every look into a decision with possible fatal consequences, or every power tug-of-war between inept owner and overwhelmed coach, or every player tirade, there IS something so utterly ridiculous to ruin the realism achieved.<br/><br/>A QB puking on the field of player in front of a National audience? An eyeball getting knocked out totally? A player chain sawing a car in half? All these are big dumb MTV style steps away from what could be greatness.<br/><br/>Football deserves a harsh critical film about what happens to players and those surrounding the game, not self indulgent crap."
"mrcaw1","1","1","4","21 April 2004"," Trash from Stone.......
","After watching this movie, one has to feel sorry for Oliver Stone. His world must be pretty bleak because this movie is nothing but trash. Stone shows absolutely no respect for his characters and presents a world as corrupted as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange. Only he does this not by quality film making, but simply by having his characters cursing and basically behaving like pigs constantly throughout the movie. His editing is from the MTV, how many cuts can we make in 30 seconds school of thought and the soundtrack is down right offensive, unless you're idea of theme music is ""you're my nigger"" being played. Apparently this is Stone's idea of racial awareness. Stone takes on too many issues in this movie. Corporate greed, racial injustice, old school vs new school football & more. Halfway thru this 2-1/2 hour music video, Stone throws in the creative towel and literally inserts an MTV style music video into the movie. The setup is that the new quarterback is shooting a commercial for some nutrient. Anyway, this flick is slick, trash, without a soul. I'm no football expert, and I'm sure I'm naive on the inner workings of professional football but I'm also sure that Oliver Stone has made a movie that repels its audience. Near the end of the movie, there's one scene that stands out among the rest. Stone intercuts his movie with the chariot scene from Cecil B. Demille's classic Ben Hur. Unfortunately for Stone, all this scene serves to do is to hi-lite just how soulless & empty his movie by comparison really is."

"raymond_chandler","1","1","4","2 August 2001"," Penalty - 15 yards for roughing the audience
","I am a lifelong fan of the NFL (and USFL, WLAF, Arena Football, and college football). I also really enjoyed most of director Oliver Stone's early films (""Salvador"", ""The Doors"", ""Platoon""). That probably explains why I even bothered to watch this abomination all the way to the end.<br/><br/> There is no point in detailing all the things wrong with ""Any Given Sunday"". My primary objection is Stone's apparent desire to prove to Michael Bay, Joel Schumacher, etc. that NO ONE can over-direct a film like good old Ollie, who insists on pulling out every trick in the film-school book for no apparent reason. It is sad to see the creator of some of the most entertaining and provocative movies of the 80's and early 90's resorting to sensory overkill like just another hack from MTV."

","I'm not a big Pacino fan, but he does a good job as the coach.  Portions of his locker room speeches were inspired.<br/><br/>However, I was really annoyed by Oliver Stone's direction and the film editing.  I guess they feel they need to have that ""MTV look"" where no camera angle is held more than 2 seconds.  What was really annoying was when they interjected flashes of lights coming on or other brief scenes during interesting conversations."

","From the trailer, this movie looked like it wasn't going to be like other sports movies in the fantasyland of Hollywood, and it wasn't, because it was excrutiating long and its screenplay although original in the midst of other nauseating baseball and football movies, it just didn't live up to the promise of the first quarter of the film, and just cruised along with pretentious dialogue and a numbing boredom that Oliver Stone has done before, with his other films like U-Turn. Dont waste your night, just see some brainless action flick, you'll enjoy yourself more."

","Though very clever in its delivery, ""Any Given Sunday"" was overly dependent in its production team. While the movie itself is quite observant in terms of showcasing the dramatic moments quite effectively, there are moments where the action moments have an MTV like atmosphere going for it which can be distracting. Ay least the underlying story is implemented into the plot.<br/><br/>With the emphasis of football, the casual viewers will know what to expect coming into seeing this movie. We learn the unpredictable futures that worry veteran quarterbacks, and how injuries have an impact on players who are more willing to take risks of their own being just to get back into the game. Or how an inexperienced rookie who has a moment in the public eye gets in their heads and turns them into jerks. Even going so far as to give us the impression that ESPN newscasters are just self-promoters, and that owner's wives are inebriates and that precocious daughters know more about football than their fathers and that coaches become spiritual gurus when the games are not in their favour. And that the closing moments of important games end with some last minute exciting play.<br/><br/>These features offer nothing new to the sports movies of all, but director Oliver Stone and the performers give character to each scenario and the dialogue has an effect to the story. Al Pacino shines as the cranky smoky voiced crank Tony D'Amato who is dedicated in coaching the Miami Sharks from being a zero to becoming state champions as he's joined by top notch performers. We know that all the pivotal scenes are unoriginal and the cliches are spread everywhere.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx joins the fray as rookie quarterback Willie Beamen who has the opportunity to shine as his superior quarterbacks have been carried out due to injury. With his lack of experience he gets so overwhelmed he starts vomiting on the field, but then eventually becomes an overnight sensation. Foxx goes through all the changes in his character professionally from unsure rookie, to cocky celebrity, to becoming demanding all in one swipe.<br/><br/>The original owner of the team was a legend of the game who hired D'Amato as a game of chance, but then the owner dies and passes the legacy to his daughter Christina Pagniacchi (Cameron Diaz) while her mother Margaret (Ann-Margaret) is never shy of consuming martinis. Sure this movie will attract the male audience, we know the women will not feel at place in this world. And though Margaret knows it, Christina feels she knows better about football than the coaches and players. Christina thinks by moving this franchise under her lead will bring money to her pockets, her mother never felt inspired by the game and has steered clear.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid is effective as the star quarterback Jack ""Cap Rooney who's fatal injury has led him in a world of great uncertainty. At one point he contemplates retiring only to get aggressively persuaded by his wife Cindy (Lauren Holly). The sad part about ""Any Given Sunday"" is that even though it clocks at 2 hours and 45 minutes long, there's very little room for its enormous cast. James Woods and Matthew Modine have good support as team physicians with contrasting view about players who have career threatening positions and Lawrence Taylor shows strong acting as a veteran player who won't step down unless he gets his bonus. And then there is plethora of familiar faces like Charlton Heston, LL Cool J, Bill Bellamy and Johnny Unitas as a rival coach.<br/><br/>The lacking elements to this movie is due to the smoke and mirrors approach the story has to offer. There's no telling of what the team does to prepare their ways of winning or understood by those who aren't familiar with the rules of the game. Stone depends mainly on closeups of their vibrant uniforms and the rough action sequences and the in-your-face sound effects. It's all done without reason or to get invested into the characters.<br/><br/>There's a lot of music in the movie which promotes an unconvincing video that Foxx is in. It was like Stone was desperate for attention so he decided to crank up the tunes to succeed. There was a lot of ground to be covered but it was all stretched out while throwing in random unknown players tackling every player they see fit and adding music as a distraction to make casual viewers to ease their minds and not worrying if get dazed and confused.<br/><br/>Though not a completely bad movie, it's still recommended and the dramatic scenes were worth your time. Pacino shows great acting talent and his pep talks are quite inspirational especially with Quaid and Foxx. The script was both warm and witty by Oliver Stone and John Logan. Though I never complain too much of the length of the movies I watch I think if they cut the film to two hours maximum it would have been better."

In such a physical demanding violent dangerous league every one gets greedy. The NFL is one of the most if not thee most profitable organization in the United States. Oliver stone is a rebel and a non conformist who served in Vietnam and has directed other movies such as JFK and W which are about the assasination of kenedy and also about president george w Bush's life.

Fans of the Game will be Expecting the Kind of Rush that the Game on the Screen Gives Them Watching Real-Life Sporting Events. <br/><br/>It is Virtually Impossible to Have a Sports Movie that Avoids Clichés because in Reality the Thing that Makes Sports so Much Fun to Watch are Clichés (4th quarter, seconds left, 4th down, goal to go, down by 5......bottom of the 9th, bases loaded, 2 outs, 3 and 2 count, down by 3...and so on).<br/><br/>So How does Director Oliver Stone, a Filmmaker who Loves to do things that are Cutting Edge, Over the Top, and Different, Deal with All of that? He doesn't, that's what He does. The Always Controversial Curmudgeon, Stone Decides to Embrace the Clichés, Wallow in them, Celebrate the Clichés, Putting it All there for All to See, and He says See, ""That is Football"". <br/><br/>It's No Mistake, that Quote is from the Director Himself, Playing a TV Announcer. As the Commentator He Also Includes a Nod to Sports Aphorisms, ""Here's where the proverbial rubber meets the proverbial road"".<br/><br/>This is a Sports Movie that is an Oliver Stone Movie that is High Entertainment, Amped Up, OK, Performance Enhanced (couldn't resist), and In Your Face just like the Game of Football. With the Advent of Cameras on Wires, and Cameras in Blimps, and Helmet Cameras, the Medium has Become the Message and the Director is, No Doubt a Fan of Football (and Marshall Mcluhan).<br/><br/>The Cast is Superb and the Sport of Football in the Movie is Played by Real Football Players, or at Least Actors who have Athletic Ability.

Injuries force Beamen to enter the game and surprise everybody with his performance.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone is using his directing skills in this aggressive show of testosterone overload. That aggression never lets up and the result is a tiring experience. The extreme close up, the sharp cuts, the heart pumping action all drive the movie close to the edge and then over it. There is a lot to admire about Oliver Stone. Sometimes I wish he relax on the reins a little and let the story breathe. The other problem I have is that Al Pacino doesn't seem to do much coaching other than yelling and making speeches. He's a movie cliché. However, the cast is fill with top rank performers.

Excellent score and music. Superb football action. Razor sharp dialogs. Complete characters. Solid cast that fit incredibly well together. Very involved story with a good number of sub-story, all interesting and well developed. Nicely paced scenario, with good emotional breaks and powerful action scenes. It's a long film with lots of meat and every minute is worth it, they even used the final generic to pitch us the epilogue. Nicely done. Great ending.<br/><br/>The actors. Al Pacino is playing his best role here. He gets away from his usual angry almost psychotic roles into a more mellow and near sentimental human being, but still very much troubled and imperfect. Cameron Diaz, for once, plays a hard nut to crack, tough, nowhere near nice and she does it extremely well. Dennis Quaid plays the hero, again, and does it superbly as he always does. Jamie Foxx does his thing as the cool and bitter professional athlete.<br/><br/>Now for the smaller roles that round up this flick and elevate it to greatness. LL Cool J plays the money grabbing star to perfection. Matthew Modine plays a institutionalized game-first team doctor who faces Aaron Eckhart as the do-gooder in a battle over the health of the player. Jim Brown is the perfect tough defensive coach with a heart of gold and a head full of the glory days. Lela Rochon is the sweet intelligent life partner of the third string quarterback. Lauren Holly is the hateful witch trying to control her legendary husband. Lawrence Taylor captures our attention as the bruised captain and keystone of the defensive team. Bill Bellamy plays a young receiver. And Andrew Bryniarski denotes himself as the rough angry offensive line man.<br/><br/>The bad. The opposing team design.

","With an all-star cast it's very difficult to pick fault with this movie. My only gripe was the odd ""pat on the back"" style lines that slipped in here and there, motivational war speeches after seeing the light etc but they certainly don't detract from what is an epic movie. The odd corny line here and there is almost unmeasurable in this 2hr40min marathon of high octane action and passionately acted masterpiece.<br/><br/>Still find it hard to believe it was filmed in 1999!! Seems like it was just released this year every time I watch it (5 times now). Each character is integral to his or her own part and you're never left wondering why they had a part in the first place. Whether it's Pacino's lead role on film or Lauren Holly's minor character of Quaid's ""Cap Rooney"" wife.....they all have fantastic screen presence and have you relating to them straight away. Life and death struggles was a bit of an overstated tag line, but certainly you start to bond and feel every painful emotion and physical blow the team (Miami Sharks) endure.<br/><br/>I personally haven't felt an emotional football or even sports movie like this since All The Right Moves back in the early 80's with Tom Cruise. From Pacino and Foxx down to minor coaching cameo actors, they all have 3 dimensional roles. This movie could've easily have been over 3 hours long and it would still be over too quick. I only wish that Oliver Stone would direct a hockey epic like this instead of the comedy mishaps we always get like Slap Shot, Youngblood and Goon!! A solid 8/10 for a film that brings out some of the best performances from Pacino, Quaid & James Woods. Foxx is brilliant in making you feel compassion early on for his character to feeling utter disdain and contempt as his alter-ego grows and grows and loses touch with why he started playing football in the first place."

","I'm a huge American football fan, despite being Hungarian, and I really liked how this film takes a close and behind the scenes look at the life and drama of a football team. I loved the editing, the shaky cam, the music and the close-ups. But on the other hand, I have a few problems with this movie:<br/><br/>1.: The clichés: Upset owner, head coach on thin ice, boastful quarterback, who gets completely carried away by the success, angry girlfriends etc. 2.: The players are introduced to us as they were nothing but alcoholic wife-cheaters, who use drugs and f**k every woman they bump into. 3.: And last but not least, there is not a single word about punters and kickers. They aren't even mentioned. Everyone who loves this game knows that the role of these guys is unquestionable and essential for a team. However, I liked the intensity of the film, and the acting was quite good. I recommend it for everyone who loves football, even with considering the aforementioned shortcomings."

","So let's get the bad out of the way. Over the top acting at times. The worst side of football is portrayed in most cases (one assumes there are many professional players and staff who just go about their job every day.) But it's a MOVIE. Rejoice, if you can, in the clichés. The ""modern"" generation of football with players getting music videos. The bad language. The clichéd sports speeches. Drugs, corruption. Rejoice I say in things taken to their extreme.<br/><br/>And why the rancor against Dias? She's good, I think, as the mercenary owner who seems to only care about money and winning but not the game. Maybe she's a little too pretty at times, but she puts in a solid acting job.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is good. Predictable in some ways, as he sort of has this stock character. But he LOOKS like a worn out coach. And you kind of expect him to give the big speeches, and let's face it, he's good at it.<br/><br/>The race part is kind of dumb. By that, I mean, the movie pushing the racial equality thing. OK, so the NFL has had few black QBs. This has been discussed many times, I saw no reason to address it again. But it was not a big part of the movie, so no big deal.<br/><br/>Anyway, I did not take this movie seriously. Think of it as an amalagram of NFL stereotypes. The egos which are huge in some cases, the drugs, the excess, the corruption etc. These have all existed, just maybe not to this extent and at the same time on the same team. But it's not like players have not used drugs, or let their egos get the better of them, or play with injuries through painkillers, etc.<br/><br/>If you are going to take this movie as some sort of morality play, it's probably not worth your time, IMO. Just watch it and be entertained. I think the acting is good, the dialog is entertaining, and the pace keeps your interested. If you want to watch real football, you know where to find that too."

","With it's large and noisy figures, one could say football has a little something in common with opera! And the high ticket prices mean people really want to see what they went there for in the first place. Yes, whatever artistry is on display is anchored in the business of spectacle.<br/><br/>The NFL has been around for decades and the players are now bigger, faster and sometimes stronger. All this natural and chemical enhancement means athletes train year round, not just from camp to playoffs. And those taking legal or illegal substances are using those twelve months a calendar too.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" is fast, frenetic and almost impossible to follow at times because that's what the action is like for quarterbacks, receivers, linebackers and all the others on the gridiron. Things happen so rapidly, it's a wonder anybody can hold onto the pigskin for more than a second. Look at what happened to NFL tough guys like Jim Otto and Mike Webster on and off the field and you'll see how devastating the consequences of competing at this level truly are.<br/><br/>Jim Brown, who appears in this film, wrote quite frankly about his experiences playing nine bone crushing seasons as a pro. And the anecdotes he tells about his teams and others are reflected in this tribute to the old guard's last stand against the digital era's absolute takeover of this most manly game. Players do get violently ill before games (and sometimes during, though usually not on the field) and guys on the same team don't have to be friends at all to work well together. When every stat is judged for the possible bonus in one's contract, the desire to be a showboat is more obvious than ever.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is both wonderfully world weary and youthfully (for a man his age) still excited about coaching the team he has been with since before Cameron Diaz took over from her late father, the founding owner. You know egos will clash as this proud man, whose whole life is football, has to take orders from a young lady who isn't as old as some of his shirts.<br/><br/>Jamie Foxx is terrific as the back up's back up, who's thrust into the spotlight when starter Dennis Quaid is injured and his successor also gets knocked out of commission. Foxx shows all the fear and anger integral to quarterbacking, as he goes from ""who's he?"" to ""the team's hope for the future!"". The pressure and sycophancy young stars deal with is now his 24 hour a day schedule.<br/><br/>Oliver Stone isn't the first name you'd think of when wondering who'd direct a big screen flick about sports, but he took a break from the war-conspiracy complex he usually dwells in and did something interesting and fun here, as fun as broken bones contact sports can be."
"Bdot2187","Null","0","1","14 December 2008"," Any Given Sunday
","The most realistic sports film that has ever been made, Any Given Sunday is an amazing drama flick. It tells the story about a back up quarterback who finally gets his start in the NFL. He begins to do exceptional, but with his new found wealth and fame his head gets bigger and his own team mates turn against him. Oliver Stone wanted to show the other side of professional sports to people, in a world of players being glorified there is drugs, fights and the greed for money and success. The story is great because it shows some players individual problems with money and family. Even the head coach played by Al Pachino has his difficulties with his family and friends, although he has all the money he needs he's not necessarily happy. The main character Jamie Foxx who plays the quarterback that has a passion and greed for fame, but can't look pass himself to realize football is not a single man sport. All of these problems brought together on a team really blows up on screen and it is spectacular to watch. Some of the best acting in this film along with the realistic football hits and highlights. Perfect film from beginning to end."

"alainenglish","8","0","1","3 October 2007"," An entertaining, if formulaic look, at American football
","For Londoners at this present time, ""Any Given Sunday"", is a highly relevant movie. This story of a highly charismatic football coach at odds with his club's owners because they won't let him do his job is bound to strike a chord. The departure of English football manager Jose Mourinho (who managed Chelsea) over a fall-out with the club owner, was a great blow for English football. If any of the club's supporters, or indeed anyone who cares about the English game in general, is still reeling from that loss, then they can take comfort in the story of this movie.<br/><br/>Granted, it's definitely not perfect. Director Oliver Stone takes rapid-fire, several-shots-in-a-second approach that doesn't always work, plus a great many minor but plot points and characters are slightly fudged in the delivery and don't register strongly enough.<br/><br/>Thankfully this is overcome through some solid scripting and some commanding performances. There are a lot of great speeches in this movie, but they aren't delivered better then when they're delivered by Al Pacino (as coach Tony D'Amato) who has a way of making the words register while staying comfortably in character. His dressing-room speech before the final game has since become a film classic.<br/><br/>He is ably backed by Cameron Diaz as the club's owner, who sees the team and it's star players as a cash cow to be milked for every cent she can get. Jamie Foxx is also brilliant as star player Willie Beamen and the brief scenes between him and his girlfriend Vanessa (Lela Rochon) are painfully believable.<br/><br/>The football scenes are effective, particularly for their use of sound. You FEEL every charge, tackle and hit these players take, and it makes for some quite gruelling viewing. Music is also a strong factor in this movie, and it has possibly one the most memorable theme tune I have heard in years.<br/><br/>Even if you aren't a football fan of any kind, the concluding pay-off in the end credits is unexpected but gently crowd-pleasing. Go D'Amato!"
"jzappa","8","0","1","30 September 2007"," It May Be Confused, But It Still Has Its Feet On The Ground
","Oliver Stone's powerful, unique, and densely wide-scope football film is entertaining, effacing, dramatic, and fun, even for people like myself who are not fans of football. However, cinema's arguable master, and if nothing else the first director that comes to anyone's mind, when it comes to organizing an acute and brutally brave and honest sociopolitical argument begins his descent into tapering genius here. His previous films are models of specified statements. The first half of Any Given Sunday is an extreme closeup commentary concering the corporate manipulation, dangerously extreme masculinization, and pride battles of up-and-coming young stars in the NFL. The second half is a feel-good sports movie. The critical stance is gone, save for the Hollywoodized comeuppance in the denouement, which you'll understand when you see the film or if you've seen it. Stone seems muddle-headed. Is he fickle here? Or else what is it that he's saying? He's most certainly saying something, based on the barefaced, clearcut attitude and communication of the beginning. This isn't U Turn, where Stone decided to make nothing more than a thriller. Any Given Sunday seems to double back upon itself.<br/><br/>However, that may be the intent of the film. Maybe he's showing the dual nature of football, one side being the gross, purely American Frankenstein's monster created out of stitched together parts of negative characteristics of our country like the domineering, boot camp- like machismo with completely unaware yet glaring homosexual overtones, corporate scandal, and the meeting of egotism and fame, and the other side being a game of passion shared by its players and its fans, where coaches and players are willing to struggle for their place. Altogether as a film, though, this is not a message sent with clarity. Subtlety is one thing. Lack of clarity is another. This film suffers from the latter, as I'm not even sure whether this is the intentional message of the film or not.<br/><br/>I may find gaping fault in the film, but as I say at the beginning of this review, I did enjoy it very much. I think the highlight of the entire film is the seven minutes in the locker room before the climactic game where Al Pacino, completely inhabiting his role as a weather- beaten, lonely old coach, gives his team the most inspirational, warm and passion-pumped prep speech I may have ever heard in a sports film, projecting his own unbroadcasted feelings about life into the growing aggression of the monologue where he tells his team that he cannot make them feel one way or another about how they play during the game, but he can tell them flat out that it's a game founded upon fighting and dying for ""that inch we all need."" The film overall is packed with great performances, especially those of Jamie Foxx, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, and James Woods.<br/><br/>Stone's football sequences have the intensity of a roller-coaster ride. There is something subtle about his tailoring of those scenes that makes the players, the field, the ball, the stadium, and the sky seem so large and intimidating, and it works, not diminished by the injection of the overall film's gimmicky cinematographic and editing angles. Stone once again employs the fast-cutting, nerve-filing visual style based on the impressions of the nature of the MTV and VH1 generations of television and media coverage. Perhaps that's why I'm able to excuse the film's unclear voice. Perhaps it's because Any Given Sunday is a sports film, but it doesn't masquerade itself like all the others do, as a sky-blue, miracle-reality, gift-wrapped, feel- good movie that artificially pumps up with emotion and cheer with the slow-motion happiness that seems like it'll last forever. Stone's film is not cynical. It just doesn't want to butter you up, and I respect that greatly, and it's infinitely endearing to me personally to see a sports film with its feet on the ground and no superficial moments for delusional audiences."

But then again it's about so much more than football ... Stone again criticizes anything/everything he can ... on top of that he has a really disgusting scene (I'm pretty sure you'll get your eye on it), not for any particular reason, but just 'cause he's Oliver Stone and he might wanted to remind you that! <br/><br/>Still as I said, something is still missing, so that I can't give it full 10 points.

","ON ANY GIVEN Sunday is plagued by its unrelenting disconnection from the reality of professional football. Every character is a cliché and congenitally stupid.<br/><br/>Al Pacino is the head coach, only he never coaches! He never seems to work at his job. He produces no game plans. He fails to instruct (in a meaningful way) any player. All he does is rant. He is like Othello on methamphetamine. He argues, he screams, he drinks, he pushes people around, he sermonizes to the team (in embarrassing monologues that no head coach would use), and he wallows in his maudlin subjectivity. Cameron Diaz is the caustic owner of the team. Her mouth is contorted in a perpetual PMS snarl. She seems to live for one thing: hysterical confrontation. She confronts Pacino and they scream and yell at each other constantly. She has some Oedipal problems  making comparisons with her father, who owned and managed the team to previous glory. She has the depth of a toothpick. Then we get James Woods. He is well, he is James Woods reduced to playing his version of the team doctor, and totally predictably.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid is the aging quarterback. He's screwed up from injuries and too much pain medication and he is okay. Quaid does a decent job acting (light years ahead of others in this film). His wife, however, is the bitch from hell. Who invented her? Jesus, she makes about as much sense as a hamster screwing a basketball. She is upset at Quaid because he wants to retire. Now catch this  she actually slugs him in the jaw about it. So here is Quaid, 38 years of age with two MPV awards under his belt, and he wants to retire. The guy lives in a mansion and has a gazillion dollars under his belt, and his wife goes ape about his retiring. What quarterback ever had a wife like that? Then there is Jamie Fox. He is the upcoming quarterback with a chip on his shoulder and a lot of talent (except he can be a screw up too). He is stuck in the civil rights era. He sermonizes about getting the short end of the stick as a black quarterback. He loves rap music. He is out of control half the time, except he has a sweet girlfriend who stabilizes him (sort of). This is the type of character you invent when you are in tenth grade and dreaming of making a Hollywood movie. He and Pacino spend their time screaming at each other and failing to communicate.<br/><br/>Just take a real coach  say Joe Gibbs. Do you think Gibbs sits around and does no work, drinks himself into stupors, spends his time screaming about nothing, and cannot communicate with his problem players? Do you think a quarterback like Fox does would last one series of plays under a real coach? As for owners of million dollar football franchises (Jerry Jones)  are they idiot hysterics who spend their time spouting nonsense? The other football players are a bunch of stupid animals. They are busy snorting cocaine, swearing, screwing the next white woman, fighting with each other, Jim Brown is one of Pacino's assistant coaches. He too never does any coaching, just thundering yelling. The one sort of interesting player is Lawrence Taylor. Taylor is an ex football player and one of the true greats of the game. It seems he can act too. He is given a decent role that makes a little sense, and he is okay at it.<br/><br/>Real football players at this level are not just animals, and they are definitely not stupid. The playbooks in professional football can tax a math professor's ability to understand. There is actually a lot of intelligence in professional football. There are also a thousand stories Stone could have tapped into and made a good movie. I mean, if he wanted to concentrate on the problem player, then he could have used the Dwayne Thomas story from the Cowboys Super Bowl team. This was a guy that coach Landry found a way to use when he was the most aggravating player in football.<br/><br/>ON ANY GIVEN Sunday starts off with a quote from Vince Lombardi. Stone could have used two incidents from Lombardi's life to illustrate great coaching. When Lombardi coached the Washington Redskins he had a rookie running back named Larry Brown. Brown was not particularly fast or big, but Lombardi spotted something in him that made him think he could be the Redskins main man running the ball. Only there was one problem: Brown fumbled the ball a lot. Lombardi made Brown carry a football with him everywhere (and I mean everywhere) for two solid weeks. Brown went on to have a great career and was incredibly sure-handed with the football. When Lombardi came to training camp, a player was loafing through the drills. One of Lombardi's coaches wanted to chew him out. The player was Jerry Smith, an undersized tight end with about seven years with the Redskins. Lombardi told his coach to leave the guy alone, saying ""That's Jerry Smith! The man can catch a football."" Smith went on to have another seven years with the Skins and went down as one of the finest catching tight ends in the history of the game.<br/><br/>Stone also punctuates this movie with relentless visual overkill and with the soundtrack. Both are enough to wreck the nervous system of the average viewer. It is not just that these elements are so graphic and loud; it is that there is no pacing in the use of them. Stone turns them up as much as he can and never stops.<br/><br/>In conclusion, ON ANY GIVEN Sunday is a terrible movie. The acting sucks, the script is enough to embarrass Ed Wood, the visuals and soundtrack are a nightmare. It is just irredeemable crap."

","I must concur with a previous poster who said you can always spot a film directed by Oliver Stone five minutes into it and ANY GIVEN Sunday is no exception. Sadly, Stone has the ability to pick some really human and moving stories and blow them up into gargantuan proportions to the point where it becomes nearly impossible to care about anyone or anything that is going on in the movie. Very few quality dramatic films have been done on the topic of professional football (BRIAN'S SONG and NUMBER ONE come to mind)and I don't why this is the case. It seems to me that the world of professional football would be rife with dramatic possibilities and it's nice that Stone recognized this; however, he as attempted to tell this story on such a large scale that the film-goer just gets bored with trying to keep up with all the stories and all the characters. I think if Stone and the screenwriter had chosen to be a little more economical with the screenplay an focused it on two or three of the stronger stories/characters, this film would have worked much better; however, as is, the film is too busy and there is just way too much going on...Al Pacino as the past-his-prime coach butting heads with new owner Cameron Diaz (badly miscast IMO)...Jamie Foxx as the up and coming quarterback who gets a swelled head...James Woods as the team doctor with the questionable code of ethics butting heads with his idealistic assistant Matthew Modine...Lawrence Taylor as the defensive player so obsessed with getting the yards he needs for endorsements his risks his life...Dennis Quaid as the quarterback coming face to face with the mortality of being a quarterback...Lauren Holly and Lela Rochon showing two different sides of being a football wife and it just goes on and on and on...Stone has assembled an impressive ""Spot the Star"" type cast but unfortunately has given them precious little to do. Pacino has his moments, but his performance mostly consists of a lot of unmotivated screaming and yelling and over the top drunk scenes. Lawrence Taylor and LL Cool J seem to be competing for the ""Which is Worse Award?""- Football player turned actor or Rapper turned actor. Former NFL and movie legend Jim Brown adds a touch of class to the proceedings as the defensive coach and John C, McGinley (SCRUBS) has some genuinely funny moments as a sardonic sports columnist, but Jamie Foxx easily walks away with the film with his charismatic turn as Willie Beamen. Foxx completely invests in this character, who is not painted in shades of black and white, and makes you care about him nonetheless, a performance which was a definite precursor to RAY. I think if Stone had economized his screenplay, re-thought some of his casting, and tightened the direction, this movie could have been something really special. Instead, it's a film that should have been something really special."

","The topic was timely, and based on the material is was written from, it could of been something. Alas, Oliver Stone turns in his worst performance as a director with this muddled, melodramatic, and sometimes, unintentionally funny movie. The Game action is poorly staged, and seemingly painfully obvious, down to the rip off of John Elway's dramatic super bowl scoring run. There's really no life to this movie, as even the actors understand that they are in a high budgeted Lifetime Movie of the Week. Dennis Quaid lacks the personal of a grizzled veteran Quartback. Al Pacino looks completely bored as the Head Coach. Lawrence Taylor, working from Life experience, gives the best performance of the film, with the key scene being his speech to Jamie Foxx in the sauna room. His words are the most important in the film, and should be adhered by all the dreamer out there who fear reality. James Woods is unredeemable evil, and way too over the top for his character is truly exist. I spent my time more or less, looking at my watch, wondering when the film, which greatly overstays its welcome, would finally end. If you want a truly, gritty look at the darkside of Pro Football, rent North Dallas Forty. Granted, the film is 26 years old, but is more on target then the modern On Any Given Sunday.

That's of course a big handicap when you want to sell a movie to a large audience. Will they be interested in a subject that they don't know anything about? Well perhaps not, but when you let Oliver Stone direct the movie and put some great actors in the cast, you can be sure that there will be people who will watch it anyway. One of those people was me, being a great fan of Al Pacino and Oliver Stone, I hoped for the best.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" tells the story of an aging coach, called Tony D'Amato, who finds himself struggling with his players, his personal life, the staff and the management of the team. He has to keep his team together, but then bad fortune kicks in. A devastating hit knocks his biggest star player, a professional football legend, out of the game. He's replaced by a young and unknown player who has spend all his time on the bench instead of on the field. Beaman as he is called, seizes this once in a lifetime opportunity and shows what a great athlete he actually is. He is so good at what he does that it seems the beginning of a new era in football, making many people believe that all of D'Amato's values and strategies are old-fashioned and not adapted to the new times. In the meantime D'Amato also has to cope with Christina Pagniacci, the new aggressive and young president / co-owner of the team. She doesn't know much about the game, but her desire to prove herself in this male dominated world is enormous. She mainly focuses on the marketing and business of football, in which all coaches and players are merely properties.<br/><br/>Now I know for sure: There just are no more certainties in life. Knowing that this movie was directed by Oliver Stone and that people like Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Jamie Foxx, James Woods,... were in the cast, made me believe that this would be a terrific movie. But I'm afraid I was wrong. It's probably true that every director has made great and bad movies, but this one I really didn't see coming. I like the fact that they try to give a very broad view on the world of professional American football. They show us how a match is played and how the management behind it all works, but they don't shy away from showing drug abuse, the parties with expensive hookers, the awful medical practices,... either. But the entire story drowns in the many clichés. An older coach who starts having doubts and who likes to drink, a former star player who can't live with the fact that a new generation is taking over, the new generation who can't cope with the success very well,... You can find it all in this movie. It really offers nothing that you haven't seen before.<br/><br/>But the story wasn't even my biggest problem. What I hated a lot more was the camera work. The 'MTV video clip' style of filming, with some loud techno / rock / rap music in the background is probably very fashionable, but it doesn't work and can't conceal the lack of a good story. It only made everything look very jumpy and nervous and more than once I had the feeling that they were a moment too late to capture an important part of action in the middle of the screen. Also the fact that Oliver Stone sometimes cuts completely irrelevant scenes in the middle of dramatic scenes is unbelievably annoying. For some reason or another he has used shots of a lightning storm, clouds rolling by and even a part from the classic movie ""Ben Hur"" to 'enhance' certain moments.<br/><br/>As a conclusion I would like to say that you better try another movie when you are interested in the small world that American Football is. Only when you are an absolute fan I think you can fully enjoy this overlong movie. It has some good dramatic moments, but overall it just doesn't offer what you can expect from a Stone movie with such famous actors in it. The actors did their best, but they were never able to make you forget about the bad camera work and the weak story. I give it a 6/10."

Having said that, i found the movie to be entertaining and one of the better sports movies i've seen!<br/><br/>The story is pretty straight-forward. The run-down Football-coach D'Amato (Al Pacino) has trouble with just about everything. His wife left him, he has pressure coming from all sides. From the hard-to-control players, from the team owner (a beautiful and sinister Cameron Diaz) and from the relentless media always willing to pick on him. So the question is, can he keep the team together and prove his aging tactics can still win?<br/><br/>This movie has Oliver Stone written all over it. The overblown music, the heroic themes and the slow-motion. I would call this porno for Football-fans. It's Oliver Stones salute to the athlete as the modern-day Gladiator, the fighter who never backs down. But then again, it's also a look into a sports world where everything is about money. A sports world where athletes run down the field pumped up with drugs, knowing that the next tackle could cost them their life. Just one more game, just one more until they get the bonus...<br/><br/>So, what makes this rise above the (admittedly mediocre) run of sports movies that have come out previously? Well, first of all ""Any Given Sunday"" is stylish in a way that few sports movies are. Hell, they even manage to make the Football games look interesting, and the only sport that bores me more than American Football is Baseball! Also, it's quite shameless in it's admiration of the athletes. Which is not necessarily a bad thing. Many people will find this a bit too muscular and testosterone-filled. And admittedly it's not for everyone. But i prefer this to another ""aging-athlete-succeeds""-movie starring Kevin Costner ANY given Sunday (or any other day of the week for that matter).

","Oliver Stone is probably one of the only directors in history who can make films based on a very wide range of subjects (The Vietnam War, JFK, Jim Morrison, Neo-Nazi's, Zombie Hands, War Time Photographers, Urban Road Trips, Football, and Alexander The Great) and still keep his own VERY VERY DISTINCT style. Let me try to prove my point: Steven Spielberg has a range of film-making like no one else, but unless you can identify the music he uses, you have no way of knowing it is a Spielberg film, he had no style to identify himself. Then again there are directors like Quentin Tarantino, his style of film-making is precise, you can tell when your watching a Tarantino flick, but Tarantino has no range, all of his films have been centered around the violence/crime genre. Stone on the other hand does have both range and trademark style. His flashy- dual colered-quick cut-slow motion, technique has been his calling card since JFK. But what happens when you take that technique and add it to something as everyday as football... ANY GIVEN Sunday happens.<br/><br/>ANY GIVEN Sunday is by far, not Stone's worst. In fact it's entertaining, if at the least tolerable. The plot of Sunday is well... empty. It's just a regular football story. It is when stone swoops in with his style that the film separate's from it's genre. The style is perfect for the game of football. Hard Hit's, good music, and a portrait of the sport like no other. <br/><br/>Acting: Excellent. Pacino gives a great performance, he plays a moderate man, who doesn't love yelling (now thats different). Diaz is excellent, one of her less sleazy and more real performances. Fox, Quaid, and Woods all do a great job as well. L.L. Cool. J. is to overblown, his performance is over-the-top and irritating at times.<br/><br/>Writing: OK. The plot is hollow but it builds a good foundation for the rest of the film to come together nicely.<br/><br/>Directing: Great. Classic Stone, blends perfectly with the game of football. Doesn't over direct as he did with ""U-Turn"" and isn't as egotistical as many critics claim.<br/><br/>Music: Great. Wonderful score and songs blend perfectly with the direction and story.<br/><br/>Overall: 7.5/10 NEED TO RENT, Worth a buy. (Suggested: DVD)"

","This movie is about a game which I have never been able to understand. Considering that, the only reason I saw it was because Charlton Heston, the best actor alive, was on it. But not even him could do anything to make things better. After watching the film, I still don't understand the game, which seems absolutely senseless here. Dennis Quaid is always pleasant to watch. Jim Brown too. Ann-Margret has always been gorgeous and she still is. Obviously, Al Pacino has to shout: he is always screaming for something, he doesn't know how to talk, and there are some people who thinks he is an actor!!. There is no movie with him that he doesn't shout. He is unbearable to me. I love The Netherlands, and I respect a Netherlander's opinion given here, but I think this is an awful movie and I would certainly prefer to watch ANY Steven Seagal movie (I love his Warner Bros ones) before this thing. It is hard to believe that Oliver Stone made the superb JFK once."

","Wants 'Raging Bull', gets 'Natural Born Killers'<br/><br/>This is your only spoiler warning...<br/><br/>I'll be honest here.  Stone knows a few things about dialog that his successors don't.  He's also proved himself a master of first-level narratives ('Born on the Fourth', 'Platoon') and even the second-level ('JFK'--where the film was_about_a film), but I think he's exhausted his cinematic juices.  What we have is this...pretty depressing, ain't it?<br/><br/>Stone wants the 'Rollerball' concept of athletes-as-warriors, yet he insists on depicting the characters as people.  Gladiator battles are focused on the movement and fluidity of combat, not single faces.  Stone falls victim, again, to the same ""commercial method"" that he's satirizing, and we're stuck with Jamie Foxx's mug plastered onscreen.<br/><br/>I think, since 'JFK', Stone has been caught in a kind of visual angst.  He isn't certain what he wants to see, so he throws every camera angle into his soup and prays for a miracle.  It worked in 'JFK' in capturing the essence of the Kennedy conspiracy, here it just makes us think he's ADD.  Compare this with Ridley Scott or even Steven Spielberg--who KNOW what they want to see.<br/><br/>Oh, yes, and there's his trademark misogyny.<br/><br/>Fortunately, all is not lost.  Stone has three kinds of actors: real actors (here presented by James Woods), prop actors (LL Cool J), and dynamite sticks (Al Pacino).  It seems in each of his projects he gets one of each. Furthermore, these characters are actors in the barest sense.  They live and perform on camera.  Stone even injects himself into the story as one of the narrators (also, I might add, the most worthless job in the profession).<br/><br/>Also, Stone works to create a universe (in this case a whole football league) since the Sport Nazis at the NFL wouldn't let him use their franchises.  Sadly, despite this opportunity, Stone becomes more derivative rather than more original.<br/><br/>Still, I'll take this over any ""feel good"" Disney sport junk--the most recent being 'Miracle'."

","Up until now, Oliver Stone was the film-maker I hated to love. He could be annoying, polemic, and distractingly 'filmic' for no reason.  I think the perfect example of this hate-love relationship for me was 'JFK', which was basically an annoying, opinionated recreation of 'history' presented as fact, but which had enough narrative drive, great characters and generally good film-making and excitement to be really enjoyable anyway.<br/><br/>On any Given Sunday is the movie where, for me, the style runs away with the substance. <br/><br/>Changing the film stock; going from an overexposed scene to a grainy scene, suddenly changing the camera angles, moving the camera around for no apparent reason, cutting to insert shots of unrelated material, having the camera show the listener rather than the speaker - these are all techniques which have their place, and which, on the whole cause the viewer to be distracted from the narrative and more aware of the fact that they are watching a construction. Unless used carefully, they interfere with the suspension of disbelief.<br/><br/>Now, Stone will use all of these techniques in the same scene, and it will be a scene where two people are standing in a room arguing about football.<br/><br/>I'm sorry, but WHAT'S THE POINT?<br/><br/>If it's not enough that a simple scene looks like it was shot by four different directors and film crews, all of whom were drunk, we have to have these absurd cuts to scenes from the chariot race from 'Ben-Hur'. <br/><br/>

","It's too easy to take pot shots at Oliver Stone, his filmmaking style, his excessive use of . . . well, pretty much everything.  Criticisms of Stone's cliché's pretty much have become the realm of cliché themselves. <br/><br/>
I've read a number of reviews by ""sports fans"" who hate this movie because they are ""sports fans.""  I'm not buying it.  I'm a sports fan (a fairly rabid one at that) and I loved this film, warts and all. Complaints of perceived non-linear storytelling don't matter to me in this type of movie. It's ALL about the Crash Boom!  Anyone who's played professional sports (most of all NFL) will tell you the game today does closely resemble a video war game.  From the initial drafting to the big business, high expectations, marketing frenzy and ownership/management chaos to player conceits, familial expectations, and tribulations both marital and extra marital, Stone's movie doesn't flinch.  Climb on board, and you find yourself on an unrelenting, entertaining, frustrating, and ultimately exhilarating roller coaster ride that you can help disembarking from with a smile and a wink. <br/><br/>
I'm not always (or often) a fan of Oliver Stone  but here, his chaotic, frenzied style, slamming camera angles, use of loud, percussive music and rap feel like life itself:  fast, dangerous, sometimes predictable but often off kilter.  His style serves a vision of the All American game as few others before him have.  He here captures the feeling of the ""business"" of football with ferocious artistic integrity and vision, if not necessarily with the accuracy some fan's may wish.  Frankly, I don't care for accuracy either historical or technical in film, my only demand is ""entertain me."" Any Given Sunday entertained.  Wildly."

","I'm an absolute sport addict but even I would be the first to admit that very rarely is sport the basis for a good film. This was no exception.<br/><br/>
I don't particularly like American Football (I find the idea of using pads & crash helmets in a contact sport a bit like swimmers using a boat) but each to their own, I like sports like cricket which others rightly find tedious. What does annoy me is how America continually export American Football and expect the rest of the world to not only understand it but enjoy it. Fair enough present the film to a U.S market but not a worldwide one. England does not export films about cricket, nor do Scotland with log throwing, Australia with Aussie rules or Pakistan with Kabadi etc. Yet as sure as night follows day you can rely on an American Football film being released in every country each year.<br/><br/>This was not an awful film but nor was it very good. Lots of shouting, lots of swearing, lots of technical jargon, sex and nudity, although at least with the latter of those 5, it was great to see another barrier broken with a woman around some naked fellers which happens all over the world but is still a taboo area on the tele. But despite that Cameron Diaz (as good a actress as she is did not suit her role at all). In real life women in senior sporting positions 99% of the time appear convincing and suited to what they do. Unfortunately in films and on the tele they hardly ever do. I'm not sure why but it seems the script writers try too hard and give them too much technical jargon, when in normal life the female directors and coaches like male ones aren't rattling on 24/7 about off sides, play offs, free kicks and the like.<br/><br/>To an outsider to American Football there just didn't seem to be any coherence to this film. It appeared we joint the film somewhere around the beginning / middle of a season and it ended about half a dozen games later still mid season? There didn't seem to be a natural beginning or end to the film. And the Sharks seemed to lose a lot of matches yet find themselves still involved in a seemingly crucial game at the end,  which I couldn't fathom out at all. Though I could be completely wrong but then that was the problem. The first 20 minutes went way over my head and throughout the film, I could only guess what side was scoring and winning purely by the reaction of Pacino or the opposing coach. Also, as far as I could work out, in the final scenes a perfectly good touchdown was disallowed by the ref because there was a yellow duster or tea towel on the field of play, which obviously signified something I didn't comprehend. There were also occasions when I wasn't sure to laugh or not (like the guys' eye falling out or James Foxx being sick) or maybe these were serious.<br/><br/>The exception to all this is Remember the Titans which was an absolutely awesome film. I'm not sure why that worked so well and this one didn't, but Remember the Titans seemed to know how to present American Football to the overseas viewer far better than Any Given Sunday. For a start there was less on field action in The Titans and what scenes were on the Grid Iron were easier to understand to those unfamiliar which a seemingly complex set of laws. <br/><br/>But as I said, not an awful film, there was no problem with the acting per se and I hacked it through to the end. I just wasn't sure which team won.<br/><br/>3/10"

","""Any Given Sunday"" is, perhaps, Oliver Stone's most egotistical movie out there. It's not all bad, but it's not all good, either, and I for one could go a few more times without having to see male nudity many times in a three hour film.<br/><br/>Here is a plot summary taken from IMDb, written by ""Anonymous"":<br/><br/>When a devastating hit knocks a professional football legend and quarterback, Cap Rooney (Dennis Quaid) out of the game, a young, unknown third-stringer is called in to replace him. Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx) seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato (Al Pacino) to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young President/Co-owner of the team, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz), now coming into her own after her father's death. Christina's driving desire to prove herself in a male dominated world is intensified by her focus on the marketing and business of football, in which all coaches and players are merely properties.<br/><br/>""Any Given Sunday"" has one main flaw: it is overblown to an extreme. This is the high point of Oliver Stone's Ego, and I, for one, would be glad it if would just go away.<br/><br/>Al Pacino gives a good performance, but not one of his most fondly remembered.<br/><br/>Dennis Quaid, whom I have long enjoyed on screen, is not in this film as much as I'd hoped, and when he is, he just seems to be doing his minimum.<br/><br/>Cameron Diaz is beautiful as always, and there's nothing really wrong with her acting here; but like Pacino, she's better remembered for other films.<br/><br/>In the end, ""Any Given Sunday"" is powered by some excellent actors and actresses, but turns into an average football film worth seeing once.<br/><br/>

","I enjoyed this movie. I think Oliver Stone is a very talented film-maker and his films are always worth watching for their passion, their style and their power; Any Given Sunday was no exception, and the director and a strong cast were on good form.<br/><br/>I am, however, not blind to Stone's faults, chief among which is a tendency to jettison truth (or in his purely fiction films, trueness to life) in order to make his own points. For this reason I was slightly disappointed in his approach to the story. For the football team's two star players to suddenly embark on a cross-country killing spree, showing up as they do so the bankruptcy of American values and complicity in violence of the media, then uncover a conspiracy by some really bad right-wing people manipulating South America for their own ends, and finally prove without a doubt that the CIA killed Kennedy on the orders of the military-industrial complex so that it could continue to escalate the Vietnam war, is perhaps not typical of the NFL experience in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>Still, LL Cool J was very entertaining and the bit with the eyeball totally rocked."

","As the movie starts, the fictional Miami Sharks are playing a professional football game.  I could feel the players hitting each other, and my TV is only 13 inches; that's good filmmaking.  Two quarterbacks get injured and the task of leading the offense falls to Willie Beamen, who seems pretty pathetic.  The team has already lost several games, and the outcome of this one appears inevitable.  Not so; Beamen is more than capable, and if not for a last-second touchdown by the other team, the Sharks would have won. Beamen becomes a national celebrity as the Sharks win one game after another.  However, the first-string quarterback, a real leader, will come back sooner or later, and Beamen has to accept this fact.  He is reminded that he is winning games, but he is not a leader and doesn't play by the rules.<br/><br/>Lots of good acting performances here.  Cameron Diaz is the pretty, occasionally sweet, but often tough daughter of the deceased former owner; unlike her father, she wants to have a say in the decisions of head coach Tony D'Amato (which doesn't make the coach happy), and she intends to sell the team and possibly move it to Los Angeles (now this IS fiction:  in the movie, Los Angeles already has a pro football team). Jamie Foxx is surprisingly good as Beamen; I thought of him as a silly comic actor, but he comes across well in the dramatic scenes, still managing to be quite funny at other times.  I wasn't too pleased with one scene that suggested he was abusive to his girlfriend (which he never was), but the character was mostly easygoing off the field.  James Woods did well as a team doctor with questionable ethics; he seemed to care more about who played than about sound medical judgment.  Charlton Heston had a pleasant cameo appearance. And of course, if anyone could inspire these losers to become winners, it was Al Pacino as D'Amato, giving a strong performance, especially in the locker room where he really got the players fired up.  The sportscasters were very professional-sounding too.<br/><br/>The music was mostly loud, but there was something for nearly every taste, including what I believe was a Native American performance. Unusual editing meant people would not likely get bored even in slow scenes; in Coach D'Amato's apartment, as the coach and Beamen talked about how Beamen could improve, there was constant switching back and forth between the two men talking and a Roman Empire gladiator-type movie the coach was apparently watching when Beamen arrived.  And there must have been a ton of profanity; sometimes I felt like I was watching a Hong Kong action film.<br/><br/>This was not for people who like their entertainment quiet, but it was a change of pace for me.  A good job overall."

","I just had nothing to do, so I thought why not watch another movie about American football? The cast did look pretty good, with Al Pacino as the main actor. I now regret I didn't do something else in these over 160 minutes. I have sincerely never seen a movie that was so senseless, and so used as this one. None of the characters really do have some substance, and all the sudden changes in the plot are irrational. So are most of the characters.<br/><br/>
SPOILERS<br/><br/>   First of all, I think Cameron Diaz was totally out of place with this part. She just didn't fit in the picture, and I kind of felt a strange disgust each time I saw her on my TV screen during the movie. I mean, it's totally out of place to put a woman in general in the lead of such a horrible, utterly violent sport, which I must say, disgusts me. I just can't see what all this violence is about...but anyway, let's get back to the movie.   Then there is the character of Jamie Fox, the new star Beamen. We see three faces of him...at first, a nice guy...then a guy whose got lost in his sudden fame...and then back to the nice guy. These changes are totally unfounded, and I really see no reason why they happen. It's just a way to waste some film. Al Pacino is the so called old-fashioned coach. He is the guy who wants the sport to be ""pure"". He cares about tradition. He just isn't in the right place...in that world corrupted by the taste of money. His character is also badly constructed. One time we hear that he ain't good for anything, then he's great again...it makes no sense!<br/><br/>   I really didn't make much out at the beginning out of the scenes of the games...it was all so confusing, and as I have little knowledge of this sport, I thought it was all, again, without any real meaning.<br/><br/>The wonderful stories, about tradition and stuff are all old...nothing new in them.   Then there was the end...I mean, what was that about? So stupid, and not needed. Just as the movie got a little more decent... I cam to the thought that this movie wanted to show how life in this sport is, for the guys who play it...but who is the fault for all the drugs, all the women and all the violence? What can you even expect from people who think only about money, and who play such a violent sport! I mean, the scene with the eye was just mad!   All this film did was make me see how violent this sport really is, and I have to think that some people are just not thinking right if they like this...how can you enjoy such a grotesque game? I'll never come to understand some things. The good parts were very few...I can't even recall any. Oh, one more thing. Why, just why, did it have to be so long? Why show so many games? Again, without any real objective. If you really want to see a movie about this sport, then I recommend Remember the Titans. Yes, I know it's not the same thing, but at least it's something in that direction. I consider I am very generous as I mark this one with a 5. All for Pacino...I'm sorry he even got involved in this junk."

Oliver Stone as usual, tries to explore numerous issues, and for the most part succeeds. Indeed, subjects such as corporate sports corruption and spiralling upwards player contracts are apparent to virtually all sports these days. The film is too long, but the football scenes are so gripping that I didn't really mind. My main concerns for the film were Cameron Diaz's performance, which I felt wasn't played with enough grit or toughness, and also the ending which took on a certain 'Rocky' feel.

That's why, he may not be very popular among many Americans, who believe that they live in the greatest country in the world. He showed them corrupted politics (J.F.K., 10 out of 10), puritanism (People Vs. Larry Flint, 9 out of 10), truth about Vietnam (Born on the Fourth of July, 10 out of 10).

It did seem like a long movie, but his films are never really short anyway. I felt like I was watching a football game on a Sunday afternoon with the pre-game, half-time, and post-game specials along with it (and most appropriately, it WAS on a Sunday afternoon when I saw this). Stone always has so much going on in his movies that it can be chaotic at times. But such is life. It was multi-charactered and each one had something interesting about them: i.e., Dennis Quaid as the 'John Elway', Cameron Diaz as the cold and pragmatic team owner, James Woods as the slimy doctor, John C. McGinley as the soulless sports writer, Jamie Foxx as the hero/villain, and LL Cool J as his nemesis (still, one of my favorite characters, ""J-Man"").

Pacino was good, Cameron Diaz was suprisingly good as was Jamie Foxx and L L Cool J.  But the best performance of them all (and no I'm not refering to Oliver Stone as a radio broadcaster) is Ann-Margaret.

","I was expecting junk, but was pleasantly surprised. Oliver Stone uses quick editing and quirky humor to portray football in it's true light: a complex series of lies, promises and twists of fate. We see the financial pressure owners are under, the medical decisions doctors face on whether or not an integral player has to be benched and the personal love of a sport by a die-hard coach. This was a very complete movie. There's enough football action to keep the typical neanderthal occupied and enough subtle sarcasm to keep me entertained. Great camera work as usual and the sporadic pop-culture symbols were a favorite standard in Stone's work. He uses metaphors very well and has a lot of visuals coupled with narration to convey his feelings. The actors were fantastic and the dialogue was solid. Good surprise!"

","This is one of the most powerful and intense football movies ever made.

In some scenes you literally couldn't see what was happening or understand what people were saying to each other. Had he used more conventional photography, closups yes but the shake, rattle, roll, blur, faded psychedelic effects were way too much and spoiled what could have been a great view of the movie.  It didn't have to be this bad- Blair Witch meets the Superbowl!<br/><br/>Al Pacino was believable most of the time.  Carmen too.  Both were intense and convincing when it counted.

I'm from there and that just isn't possible."
"Fox-18","Null","0","1","1 January 2000"," Intelligent sports movie...on the whole (*** out of ****)
","Yeah yeah, we know how traditional sports movies end. Situations are set up, conflict arises, but none of it really matters because we know that the ""good guys"" will always win the big game at the last second. However, although Any Given Sunday becomes fairly predictable toward the end, there's a unique world-weary tone that I've never seen in any other sports movie....ever. Throughout the first two-thirds of ANY GIVEN SUNDAY, the tone is very downbeat, presenting an expose about the ways that greed and selfishness have wrecked professional football. There are players who are eager to get on the field only because multi-million dollar bonuses are tied to their salaries. There's a quarterback who changes plays in the huddle to make himself look better, and of course, there are conflicts abound between the coach and the owner, realting to business reasons. It seems that football has been ruined ever since TV got involved, judging from ESPN's support of turning a timid player into a jerk, all because of stardom.<br/><br/>
    OF course, none of these elements are particularly startling all by themselves, but they're delivered well thanks to powerful acting all around. Al Pacino is simply doing what he does best: turning up the heat and intensity in front of the camera. Cameron Diaz has a strange role this time around, offering her the chance to really turn nasty at times. Jamie Foxx is superb as Willie Beamen, the third-string quarterback who lets stardom go to his head, and it is a tough role despite how simple it sounds.<br/><br/>    Despite the terrific one-on-ones with various actors shining brightly, there is a second ""dramatic"" element that is, in a word, overblown. It's impossible not to notice that during the game coverage, Oliver Stone embodies the MTV approach. There are quick cuts, slow-motion shots, fades to black-and-white, shots of a pass spiraling in the air, and about a dozen other ""tricks."" Obviously, some people will eat this up, thinking that more style means better style. Sorry, but I can't agree there. Most of the plays in the game are relatively incomprehensible, and there's rarely a single play that can be understood clearly from beginning to end. Perhaps this is all done to turn up the intensity, but really, although it's eye-pleasing, it's also distracting.<br/><br/>     Ultimately, I'm reccomending ANY GIVEN SUNDAY on the strength of its ""powerful"" dramatic elements, not the ""overblown"" ones. Although the film runs too long by about 20 to 25 minutes and is overambitious, it's nonetheless a smart sports movie that has wonderful ideas and a freshness of presenting all-too-familiar movie cliches."

The cast, full of talented actors and recognizable sports stars, does what they can, but the film depends on loud, ugly, in-your-face action on the field which while intense and flashy, quickly becomes an assault on the senses. It doesn't help that the film overstays its welcome. **"

"MacCekko","7","0","1","9 January 2002"," Difficult to follow if viewer is not a football fan...
","I watched this movie on TV, dubbed in italian, as usual (following it in english was too difficult because of the slang!) The main problem I found was to follow the actions of the game: football is not very easy to understand for me, as I am italian and as I had never seen an american football match in my life. The only thing I got is that the QUARTER-BACK is a main figure in the game, and a lot depends on his action... But, because of the cast, because of the director, I thought it was worthwhile to take a look and... well, I anjoyed it. The plot is very involving, the techno music is pumping in the ears, the actions (although, as said, quite difficult to follow for a beginner) are incredible, and yet beautiful to see. Adrenaline is quite high for the most duration of the movie, and, as a matter of fact, Al Pacino is dubbed by a great italian actor, Giancarlo Giannini who had a pivotal part in ""Hannibal"" with Anthony Hopkins. The matter of all this is: is really America like this? Do really players hope just for as lot of money, drugs, girls, big houses and so on? Do doctors (James Woods) want to participate in such a business? What about the Hyppocratic Oath? OK, money is essential, but what about the real health of players? I admit that similar (or identical) facts may happen for italian football/soccer, but, is this real life? Why don't they care a bit more about their future? You cannot play a dangerous sport for a lifetime, so why not store some money for a better (and much ""secure"") future? In short: is really all ""business""? Al Pacino, in a scene, says to a player something like ""have fun, while you play!""... That's the point, on my very opinion. Being hit and punched and so on JUST for money and for fame, is that all? Is it worthwhile? A movie is much more important when it raises some questions in the spectator's mind; ""Any Given Sunday"" also gave me some answers: when in business, there are no friends, no family, no other principles that may be followed. Business is finalized to itself: the more you're in it, the more you've got to take advantage from it, and continue, until you're laying down, with no power in your body and in your soul anymore. I anjoyed so much the lots of songs (not only the ""spoken"" ones, like rap, which is almost uncomprehensible for me) played during the movie, the actions in quite total silence were great, the playing of the actors very intense. It's difficult to explain my thoughts in english, but I gave a vote of 7/10 to this movie; this should explain itself my opinion... A masterpiece for people who do not understand anything about football, who don't understand a single word of ""rap"" songs, who don't understand anything about ""getting into business"", but like the great actions, the great actors, the great directors and the good music. I am happy I've watched this one! One more thing: if you liked this movie, I strongly recommend to take a look at ""Remember the Titans"" with Denzel Washington. So different (yet so similar!), it's interesting to follow the same kind of actions from different points of view..."

"Anonymous_Maxine","5","0","2","2 April 2001"," A good effort, but Any Given Sunday just doesn't work
","A good effort, but Any Given Sunday just doesn't work. The film is basically a behind-the-scenes look at professional football. You see the bickering and fighting that goes on among the higher powers up in the box office as well as the conflicts between the players themselves. I think that it was a good portrayal of how instant fame can really go to a person's head and cause them to act in ways that they normally wouldn't, but the football element of the film was awful. It was entirely too polished, football just doesn't look like that. This is what you get when you mix the Hollywood formula with the sport of football.<br/><br/>Much of the film was so blown out of proportion and exaggerated that it made it ridiculous. For example, you have the party at one of the players' ridiculously huge house, particularly the fact that Willie Beamen's (Jamie Foxx) truck was cut in half with a blowtorch by another player who he happened to have offended. This is just crap. And how about the play near the end of the film where one of the players got hit so hard in a play that his eyeball popped out of his head? Yes, POPPED OUT OF HIS HEAD. See how funny that sounds? It's even funnier to see it acted out on screen by a bunch of people who were amazingly able to keep straight faces. Simple logic reveals that a person's head would explode before their eyeball, along with a good length of the optical nerve, would pop out of their head like that.<br/><br/>Thank God for Al Pacino, he saved this movie single-handedly, as the aging coach who began to feel like he was slightly out of his league, coaching a team that would not come together, even for someone who DIDN'T feel too old. Cameron Diaz and especially Dennis Quaid, perfectly cast in the role of the aging quarterback, also added pretty good performances to this otherwise failure of a sports film, but I don't think that Any Given Sunday had much of a chance to begin with. It is clearly a vehicle for nearly everyone involved, a genre film slapped together for the sole purpose of making money, regardless of how much garbage has to be thrown in. >"
"Spleen","6","0","2","21 February 2001"," Congratulate me: I have made it through to the end of an Oliver Stone film.
","My headache will soon pass.<br/><br/>Of course, I did survive, and survive with pleasure, ""Conan the Barbarian"", but this doesn't count.  Stone only wrote the script to ""Conan"".  Since he didn't direct, he couldn't turn his script into a pompous balloon of a film, which is what he did to the script he co-wrote on this occasion.<br/><br/>In retrospect I like ""Any Given Sunday"" much more than I did at the time. (How could one not?  It's not nearly as painful to contemplate as it is to watch.)  Much of the writing was very good and, after eternity comes and goes, the story becomes involving.  But Jesus, I wish Stone would lay off the hard drugs.  You know what I mean: the slightly shaky, shallow-focus photography; the magazine-layout montages; the artificial drumbeat soundtrack; the sepia tinting, the CONSTANT cutting away to show us something else of no more interest than that which was cut away from; the irrelevant , cheaply ""symbolic"" images (at one point we see the Earth from outer space - it's like Ed Wood and his buffalo ... and speaking of buffalo, it's as if the sound effect of footballers pounding into one another was achieved by dropping dead ones into an empty wheat silo).  At least we're spared shots of the American flag this time.  I guess Stone used up his quota of posturing flag imagery in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" and ""JFK"". In the end what's most notable about Stone's range of mannerisms is how limited it is - and how limitING.  What could Stone ever DO with his self-conscious edginess except churn out, by the yard, more and more of this kind of thing?<br/><br/>Another thing... Remember the scene where the team's owner has a conversation with Charlton Heston?  (Maybe Charlton Heston wasn't playing himself.  Hard to tell.)  Heston walks out after delivering what sound like veiled threats of some kind, and Cameron Diaz turns almost to camera and says, ""What the PHUCK just happened?""  ...Well, if anyone knows, drop me a line.<br/><br/>Stone has real talent.  No mere hack could direct so badly.  It's possible - nay, likely - that there is a good film buried under Stone's visual rubble; and maybe even with the rubble it IS a good film, despite everything Stone does to ruin it.<br/><br/>But for a better year-long, behind-the-scenes look at a down-on-its-luck football team, I recommend ""The Year of the Dogs"".  It's a documentary, but don't hold that against it - qua fiction it has much more value than ""Any Given Sunday"".  (The only thing Stone's work can claim on its behalf is that it uses higher resolution film.)  And don't worry if you're unfamiliar with Australian Rules.  I knew no more about Aussie Rules when I saw ""Year of the Dogs"" than I did about gridiron when I saw ""Any Given Sunday"", and in the former I could at least tell what was going on."

","Despite some great game footage, overacting by everyone from Al Pacino, Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz to Oliver Stone himself as a sportscaster render this look at pro football trite and irrelevant.<br/><br/>An added disappointment is the lack of attention to details that lends a sense of  authenticity to most of Oliver Stone's films.  When is the last time anyone has seen a pro football coach wearing black blazers on the sideline?   Moreover, character development   happens because the screenwriter thought it would be cool, not because it was evolved from the story.  For example, Jamie Foxx's  Willie Beaman goes from a confused humble kid to trash talking homeboy in a matter of minutes.<br/><br/>All in all, Any Given Sunday is a must to avoid.   If you want a great inside look at pro football, rent North Dallas Forty instead."

I figured with the skills of Al Pacino and the looks of Cameron Diaz you don't need to a genius to make a good film, but it flops in 169 of the 170 or so minutes.  The only thing I can say good about the movie was that the sound was excellent.  I would have been disappointed if I spent money to rent this let alone see it in the theater.

","This is really a strange movie. The not uncommon theme of a sports club turning defeat to victory is used. The genius quarterback provides the moral - after two victorys he is afflicted by hybris, one defeat and one Al Pacino speech later he is humbled and realizes he is one of the boys. All within 3 games! Fast cutting and rap music is supposed to bring pace to the movie but is only annoying. Al Pacino plays his favourite character - ruffled, alcoholic and disillusioned but does not succeed in bringing sympathy to his role person. The story would not be believable even if the constant exaggerations were left out. If the movie had had a message, it would have been lost."

Any time the most convincing ""actor"" in a movie is Lawrence Taylor, you know you're in trouble.  The only good scene in the entire movie is when LL Cool J stands and raises his hand.

","My goodness, ""Any Given Sunday"" is like a lethal narcotic shot of a movie that will just about kill the normal viewer.  It runs an amazing 164 minutes and is just as wild and chaotic as ""Natural Born Killers"".  Stone tries to examine professional football teams by showing how fast and out-of-control the lifestyle of those involved are.  However instead of providing any drama or a real message, Stone goes for style over substance and ends up creating a movie that is little more than a nauseating sequence of crazy camera shots.  The cast is adequate, but is totally wasted due to Stone's overbearing, in-your-face style.  Overall a film, like ""Natural Born Killers"", that only the greatest Oliver Stone fans will get anything out of other than a severe migraine headache.  2.5 out of 5 stars."

","There are some comments in this review that talk about specific scenes, including one of the scenes near the end of the movie, but since I couldn't really discern any real plot, I don't think that I'm spoiling anything.<br/><br/>I'm not a big Oliver Stone fan, so this movie had a strike against it from the first.  But once I watched it, I realized it wasn't any different from any of his other movies that I've seen.  Oliver Stone is the guy that lives on your street that is the neighbourhood crank, always convinced that somebody is up to something to hurt him or to cover something up.  The underlying premise in the movie is that every player is trying to maim every other player, when we all know this isn't true.  And the part where the guy's eyeball falls out onto the field?  Oh, sure, we've all seen that happen before!  Those guys don't want to end each other's careers (Bryan Cox excluded, of course) because they know it could happen to them just as easily.  And James Woods, who looks in the movie like he's 75, could never have practiced that long by constantly putting players' lives in jeopardy! Don't you think that maybe just one of his former players would have said something by now?  Also, you don't see many team doctors making out with cheerleaders on the sidelines.<br/><br/>This is just a cartoonish look at pro football and is almost too ridiculous for words.  How many NFL coaches, with their high profile, do you think could get away with drinking themselves into a stupor every night in public and paying for prostitutes?  Very few, I would guess.  What coach would announce at his retirement that he's taking a job to coach an expansion team and basically dump on the people that have set up such an extravagant and emotional send-off for him?<br/><br/>The reason that so many high-profile actors worked on this turkey is amazing to me.  Surely some of them must have read the script before they agreed to be in it.  Al Pacino, while a great actor, was mostly lame in his part, but lame doesn't even begin to describe Dennis Quaid's performance.  Dan Marino Jr., as one of Quaid's character's sons, does a better job, and he doesn't even have any speaking lines!<br/><br/>While I'm at it, what was that gladiator scene all about?  The only thing I can figure is that someone on the direction/production team has a thing for men in armorplate and underwear.<br/><br/>Really, does anyone honestly think that an entire team, with all the assorted groupies and hangers-on around, would have a party like the one shown at LT's house with hookers and rampant drug use in full view of everyone?  That would be in the newspaper before they could crawl out from under the bed in the morning!  Ask Michael Irvin, he could tell you.<br/><br/>Overall, it's little wonder that the NFL wouldn't let Stone use real teams in his movie.  The plot is so outlandish that it could only be dreamed up by someone like Oliver Stone, who apparently did his NFL research by watching the WWF for hours on end.  Watching the movie made me wonder whether or not Mr. Stone has ever even watched a game on TV, much less seen one in person. I'm sorry that I lost more than two hours of my life watching it."

","A real stinker, corny as hell. The plot is as old as the hills. Completely predictable. Sorry that so many name stars wasted their time on this one.

"CinemaLE","1","0","2","12 December 2000"," Ugh, watch something else!
","A horrible movie that managed to make 3 hours seem like 12 hours.  It had a predictable story line based on characters that I could really not care about even though I tried (because it would have made the movie easier to watch and I like Pacino).  As though the story wasn't bad enough, I was also subjected to annoying jerky camera motion during action scenes that appeared to be an attempt to harness that battle feeling like in the movie Saving Private Ryan (where the camera motion actually works well).  Too much Hollywood and too silly of a movie for me to consciously recommend this movie to anyone at all.<br/><br/>(Stupidity Spoiler-Don't read this last part if you don't want to know a specific non-plot detail from the movie.)  Finally, there is a scene focused around a player getting his eye ripped out in the endzone.  Come on, who's bright idea was that, an eye laying on the ground (note-recycled prop from a bad slasher pic).  I suppose it was intended as a `shocker' and I only hope former Raiders center Don Mosebar didn't see this movie."

Probably one of the worst films I have ever seen."

It ended exactly the way I had forseen, and I felt really disappointed. Of course these players are modern day gladiators and everything, but I knew this already. The film didn't give me anything at all. 4/10 and a waste of my money."
"stardog67","2","0","1","24 October 2000"," this movie is fourth and long with a bad snap
","It's amazing to me how Oliver Stone was once regarded as a truly insightful screenwriter.  If I go back and watch what's regarded as some of his earlier lesser work (Salvador, Talk Radio), I would swear it's not the same man behind ""Any Given Sunday"".  This movie is a 2 1/2 hour mid air collision between music video editing and overacting.  When you watch the intersplicing of ""Ben Hur"" and the dinner scene between Pacino and his star quarterback, tell me Stone's not still laboring in the buffoonary of ""Natural Born Killers"". Somewhere in directing ""JFK"", Stone discovered the smoke and mirrors of a million feet of footage and overworked editors. Someone should give Stone two million dollars, not a penny more, and sit on him until he remembers more can be suggested in good dialogue than can ever expressed with ""gadget"" filmmaking. That being said, this one rates as the guiltiest pleasure of 99. It's sports movie cliche to the Nth degree with comments on racism and sexism tossed in for social merit.  But the in-game sequences are exciting, with the choppy camera work and thud sounds, extreme violence and hard ribcrushing tackles. And, of course, Pacino chews the scenery again with several locker room speeches which eventually get to his even most cynical player. Hey, it's bad- like a Chuck Norris movie ""bad"", like a Russ Meyer ""bad"", the kind of stuff you can't walk out on because there might just be another item you can laugh with your buddies about. The only performance worth mentioning is Jim Brown's.  And it's not because he blows you away in a single scene, but instead saddles his moments with a subdued weariness. And in any recent Oliver Stone film, it's the subdued moment which'll stick out like a yellow flag on the line of scrimmage."

"andrew7","9","0","2","6 September 2000"," Stone is judged by a different standard
","Any Given Sunday has come under lots and lots fire from plenty of people for all sorts of reasons.  Some people don't like the style in which the football sequences were shot because it obscures the action.  [Guess what, the action isn't the point!] What bugs me about this film's criticism is that some people, not the least of which is Leonard Maltin, say that the film has too little substance. The editor reviews at Amazon.com say that the film's only interesting points are about race relations, and that it is bogged down by obvious and simplistic comparisons between football players and gladiators.  Ok, you know what? I'll buy that.  But remember what we're talking about.  We're criticizing a film because what it has to say isn't interesting enough.  Compare that to the ridiculous acclaim garnered by The Sixth Sense, a film that has practically nothing to say at all, except perhaps something staggeringly banal like ""Live for today, because you might die tomorrow.""  Compare this also to American Beauty, which does have a lot to say.  Just not nearly as much as it thinks it does.<br/><br/>People judge Oliver Stone by a different set of standards.  With most films, having a ""point"" is a rare and unnecessary bonus. With Oliver Stone, everyone whines if the point he has isn't quite up to his previous standards.  You can only make Platoon once.  You can only make Wall Street once.  This time, he made Any Given Sunday.  So maybe it's not as good as JFK, but it beats the living crap out the The Replacements.  Perspective, people.  Perspective.<br/><br/>Any Given Sunday is a film that knows what it is.  It's not out to change the world, it's out to tell a terrific story, which it does.  [I normally loathe sports movies because they are so predictable.  This one had just enough elements to keep it interesting, so I didn't mind the predictability.]  It does have something to say, but it knows (unlike American Beauty) that it's nothing revolutionary.  So, it neatly avoids seeming pretentious (unlike American Beauty).<br/><br/>Bottom line: strong story, excellent characters, great performances, stunning direction, strong script.  This film is not one of the absolute greats of all time.  But it is significantly better than 90% of the crap that gets thrown at us every day.  Significantly better."

","I rate about 1 movie out of every 100 at under at 6. So, a 4 is REALLY BAD!! Look, if you want to watch a good sports movie, watch Hoosiers or Rudy or For Love of the Game or The Natural or Field of Dreams. And, I could go on. But, if you want to watch the WORST sports movie I ever recall having seen, feel free to waste an ungodly amount of time (2 hours 42 minutes) on this pile of crap.<br/><br/>I'll tell you one thing. Whoever put this movie together - whether the producer, director, editor or writer knew ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about football. Now, if you too know ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about football, you are 1/3 of the way toward being able to tolerate it. If you have ABSOLUTELY NO concept of chronology and time lines then you are another 1/3 of the way toward being able to tolerate it. If you don't mind horrible music and overacting by Pacino and Woods as well as others, then you might crawl your way up to a move that is passable. But, otherwise, for the love of God, save your time and money.<br/><br/>I watched this movie with my wife and a couple friends. Now, we all know football. But, more importantly, we all have IQ's of over 50. We began the movie asking questions like ""Wasn't it supposed to be such and such."" Then, we progressed to ""That couldn't be true because of ...."" Finally, the last 10 hours (oops, it just seemed like 10 hours), we were laughing hysterically at the ludicrous attempts to pretend it was supposed to be a serious insight into professional football.<br/><br/>I cannot begin to list the at least 100 implausible, absurd mistakes and mischaracterizations that we couldn't help but see. Just let me give you a simple example. On one play of one of the games, a receiver catches a ball in the endzone. Fans scream. Immediately, the next shot is the ball on the 8 yard line, 1st and goal. This is one example that is representative of the inexplicable, incomprehensible, incompetent view of professional football.<br/><br/>Perhaps if the movie itself had characters that we could root for or if we weren't forced to die of boredom by the time the 2 1/2+ hours had passed, maybe we could overlook some of the glaring weaknesses. BUT NOOOOOO. You can thank Oliver Stone exclusively for this fiasco. I have enjoyed some of his movies (JFK for example). But now in retrospect, if his attention to detail was only 1/10 as bad in JFK as it was in AGS, then JFK wasn't anywhere near as good as I thought.<br/><br/>MISSSSSSSSSSSS ITTTTTTTTTTTTTT !!!!!!"
